From full block. Seems to be the only hero who can do that as far as i know (I know it seems ranty but its not a rant. Just pointing out a slightly busted mechanic)

(""Rework"" Ideas)",1,i5egek,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/i5egek/can_they_change_warmonger_already_rework_ideas/,2020-08-08 00:08:20,"I was hyped for Warmonger but now that she has came out she is so boring. She is in my eyes a ""Warden 2.0"" yes there are differences between the characters but Warmonger just feels like another braindead hero with a chargeable bash. It feels like her feats have more pesonality than her. I want them to adjust some of her moves and her feats (but ubi is probably never going to really change her) Here are the changes I want from her *Make cancel window for bash shorter *Remove attack priority after bash light *Improve iFrame window of unblocable doge heavy and shorter guard break vulnerability *Give ger the ability to dodge attack out of her light and heavy recoveries (not including dodge bash and finisher recovery) *Nerf her posin feats and give her better opitions for alternative feats My explanation (first to last) I want them to reduce the time you can cancel bash because its preasure is insane and feels cheap. They need to remove attack priority after bash light because the devs said this is not suppose to be in the game anymore and makes it were Warmonger can get into ber bash over and over agian. They should improve the iFrames and reduce guardbreak vulnerability on her dodge unblockable, because her dodge unblockable can be hit out of on REACTION to her doging and you can guardbreak her almost half way though her attack it just dosent make sence how its a dodge attack The reason I want them to add the attack into dodge attack (not including bash) is to make more use out of her dodge attacks other than countering and being an okay opener, because when you try to use her dodge attacks mid combo they're just too slow and you will get hit out of your animation and when fighting Warmonger when she starts with a light they only thing you know she is going to do is bash or another basic attack plus it will give her a little more personality to the game because she is suppose to a agressive hero but you pretty much always know what she's gonna do And changing her feats is a no brainer , her best feats are her stater ones and eveything else is usless or just worse If you you read all of this your a real trooper , ubi will probly never make these changes to her because they need to fix the whole entire game first but we see and anything you want to say tell me"

The problem being the sometimes part) prevents you from putting your guard up. Duels and Dominion only helped to confirm both.

Similarly why have that attack require good timing and prediction to get a punish but then be too slow to catch people before they recover so you instead have to engage in a 50/50 where you *may* or *may not* get any damage and potentially take damage instead."
5,vulnerability,forhonor,Jiang Jun,1,i7jgm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/i7jgm0/jiang_jun/,2020-08-11 12:37:25,"Hey, all! I honestly havent played JJ that much since the CCU. He is my main, though. Im rep 162 overall on ps4 and have 25 reps into the old man. Ive been mostly on the Shugoki grind the past week or two (finally rep 8.) So, my question is: how do players of JJ and players going against JJ feel about him after the CCU? Im a little torn. I feel as though his choke is slightly overtuned in terms of the stamina damage. The one thing I really, really like about it is that it causes a knockdown when the opponent goes OOS. However, I absolutely love that now it has utility outside of the very situational parry that causes an enemy to go OOS or the potential wallsplat/ledge. The only thing that makes me think the stamina damage is justified is that on a heavy parry, his max punish is 14 damage (I believe?) or a light for 12. The 14 damage coming from a zone that takes a hefty sum of stamina for the extra 2 damage. Light parry is obviously still the top heavy which is nice. The max punish now from a OOS choke is zone (14) into top heavy unblockable (38?) so were looking at a potential 52dmg heavy/light parry punish if the opponent has around 1/3 of their stam. I feel this is pretty strong and perhaps a little too strong. His punish for a heavy parry is either shit or insane and his punish on light parries are perhaps the best right now. All of that being said, the nerf to damage in his zone sort of blows since, as a JJ main, I can attest that his zone is a pretty crucial part to his kit. His heavies are pretty unthrowable (due to their slowness) unless youre attempting to trade with neutral heavies or you occasionally let an unblockable heavy rip. He feels like a mixed bag. Slower stam regen although it is compensated by his Sifus pose, very high GB vulnerability on his dodges and on Sifus since you want to go into it when youre low on stam and your opponent knows this, but perhaps the strongest parry punishes in the game right now. All in all, I think hes still in a very good place. He might actually be worth bringing into duels now instead of just 4s. Thoughts?"

I'm hoping giving actual suggestions instead of simply criticizing their more recent ""balancings"" will lead to more positive and proactive change. These are the ideas given to me from my last post mixed with my initial ideas. Please feel free to go into the comments to tell me which of these are dumb and need changing, as that is the point. I hope to continue doing this until we have heroes that everyone thinks would be fun to play as and against in the game. Here are the ideas so far: * Kensei: Enhance tracking on forward dodge heavy, to more effectively catch roll. Allow zone to soft feint to top heavy, would be undodgeable. Allow side/forward dodge after chained attacks, allowing a dodge forward to gb. * Shugoki: Decrease back breaker recovery to 1000ms Make headbutt softfeintable to Demons Embrace. If not feinted, the headbutt will deal 10 damage. Allow headbutt to chain to Demons Embrace, guaranteed if opponent is walled. * Nobushi: Kick will be given a new animation. Instead of leaning against her staff, Nobushi will perform a kick far more reminiscent of Tiandis kick, to allow her kick to feel more natural. Nobushis Sidewinder Form may now be soft feinted to kick. Kick is now 500ms Kick may be softfeinted into a backstep sweep by using heavy during kick startup. This will be 400ms and gbable during the first 300ms. Dodgeable, but not interruptible as she will have I-Frames while performing it. Upon connection, Nobushi May use light attack to link to a light impale which would deal 7 base damage and trade in a stack of bleed for 4 flat damage per bleed stack and perform a special kill animation. Zone may be soft feinted into HS. Allow for Nobushi to exit from HS from any guard direction. * Orochi: Allow end of chain heavy to be soft feinted into deflect punish, end of chain light may chain to deflect punish upon landing. Add a dodging heavy attack Allow chain to link to dodging light or heavy Allow a kick from Storm Rush which, if dodged, leaves Orochi vulnerable for 600ms. This kick would use Tozens animation, would be 500ms, and guarantee a light attack. Any attack following this kick would also be considered end of chain, which allow linking to the deflect punish mentioned earlier. Left heavy attack from Storm Rush now has I-Frames. * Shinobi: Increase distance of backflip, will be half the distance of Pre-Nerf backflip. Sickle Rain heavy (chain heavy) is undodgeable. On front roll, the deflect light punish will be added here, with the exception of it being blockable/parriable. This light attack being 466ms. Allow heavy to chain to zone leading to Sickle Rain (ie. once Shinobis zone is cancelled, he may perform a heavy attack that would lead to sickle rain in connection). After a parry, Shinobi may dodge which will act as the double dodge, along with all the benefits that brings. Additionally, Shinobi may dodge forward to perform a mock deflect. The animation of passing through his opponent will not deal damage. He will have access to both the kick and light attack, both of which will be punishable upon heavy parry, unpunishable on light parry. The light will be a 466ms light, the kick will act identically to his double dash kick, with the same amount of vulnerability if missed. Finally, the mock deflect will allow for chain heavy. Make ranged gb reversal and ranged heavy parry no longer knock Shinobi to the ground. He will now be reeled in, and be considered guard broken or heavy parried depending upon the initial action by Shinobi. * Aramusha: Soft feint top heavies to head bop; side heavies to top heavy (which will allow for soft feint to head bop, also reducing the amount of time for top heavy to go through to 666ms). After soft feinting to light attacks Aramusha may now kick as a chain finisher. This can wall which guarantees a heavy from Ara. Allow Aras zone to be soft feinted to head bop. * Hitokiri: Revert to Pre-2.19.1 - 2.19.3 Hito, with minor improvements. Zone now has super armour which activates at 200ms. Hitokiris uncharged heavy deals 32 damage, Endless Myriad deal heavies deal 25 damage. No changes from last discussion."

From neutral: counter everything but bashes, unblockables and gbs without any effort and cancel recoveries including, but not limited to, block stun. With the counter: Counter everything but gb on a very forgiving timing (can extend the counter like a parry with multiple attacks) With the slash: Counter slow attacks and gb attempts (it's vulnerabilityis pretty low), alongside providing great pressure both OOS and not. Counters: - Do nothing and roll away - make a 50/50 prediction or bait for the punish (relies on the bp getting it wrong not you) HS can... From neutral: Avoid basic attacks, unblockable attacks and bashes for a large chunk of stamina on a very awkward timing (does not extend for multiple attacks) Light attack followup: Low damage but reliable for a punish (on most but not all heroes) applies some bleed for the passive. Heavy followup: No pressure, only guarenteed on moves with gb vulnerability so not exactly special there. Kick followup: Slow and reactable, punishes are either a light parry or a gb so not a great idea when your own moves force a 50/50 on you. Terrible forward movement and general tracking, so not worth using in a gank either. Counters: - gb - undodgables - soft feints that change the timing of the hit - hard feint into light - attacks with good forward momentum - can literally dodge 66% that comes out as a followup if you aren't in a long recovery And this is without even talking about the rest of their kits and the feats they have access too. And people still say nobu is fine."

When i say a moment later i mean like microseconds. Its turned the tide of many fights now and ive always felt like a cgb should work in this situation since my gb didnt actually wiff and i hadnt entered recovery yet. if anything the gb should both just bounce since they were thrown practically at the same time. This has both happened to me and ive noticed that i have done it to people as well sometimes.

15,vulnerability,forhonor,An Analysis of Nuxia,3,hmbfiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/hmbfiq/an_analysis_of_nuxia/,2020-07-07 03:00:00,"So before I say anything I wanna say I don't think Nuxia is OP or broken or whatever buzzword people wanna use. This isn't gonna be a hate post about her. I think Nuxia is just a little below average. But this also isn't gonna be a wall of ass licking that makes Nuxia seem like a goddess. This is just my thoughts as to why not a lot of people play Nuxia and what could be changed to make her more popular. Ok, so first of all, let's go over her kit: Nuxia's kit is not horrible. At least, not on paper. 400ms light chain, heavies have great damage and also have a 400ms trap that punishes people who try to block or parry her heavies. Dodge attack has little gb vulnerability and and isn't too slow. Zone is a decent OS since it can be feinted and also has the same trap mechanic which guarantees more damage than heavies do. Her animations are also gorgeous. The problem with her kit is how it's implemented. Her light attacks are fine as is, but everything else just feel really underwhelming. Her traps are 400ms which isn't hard to react to since it's a single stimulus rather than a choice reaction and her heavies are extremely awkward because of how slow they are, so they're not a reliable opener even if her traps were faster. That's not even mentioning the fact that her deflects don't guarantee damage. Seriously Ubi, come on. The other problem she has is her personality as a hero. The community has various heroes we all love because of their personality; Centurion for his cockiness and theatricality, Shaman for being an absolute lunatic, Conq for being Conq, but Nuxia just.... Doesn't have something like that. Her personality is, I'm assuming, to be seductive and sarcastic, but the issue is she's too subtle. And no, before you say it, I'm not asking Nuxia to become an outright lust machine. But Nuxia is just completely lacking in anything that makes her stand out, especially with her voice lines. Most of her lines are just generic quiet grunts and noises. I don't think I'm the only one who loves heroes that actually say stuff in battle, i.e Highlander, Centurion, Lawbringer. So what would I change about Nuxia? Well for her kit, I'd make her deflect guarantee damage, make her traps truly unreactable, speed up her heavies to maybe 800ms (yes I know being 100ms faster isn't a whole lot, but it could make a difference regardless) and I'd also make her zone faster, because holy hell that thing is SLOW. For her character in general, I'd definitely give her more voice lines, ESPECIALLY during her executions. Give her stuff that makes people know there's a Nuxia around instead of ""oh, a Nuxia"" when she actually shows up. Like I said before, Nuxia isn't bad, but her viability often goes unnoticed because of just how insignificant she is. I'm a person who adores Nuxia but even I can see how and why people just don't care about her. There is a reason she has the lowest pick rate in the game. I'd love to hear you guys' thoughts about Nuxia and why you think people don't care about her and what you'd do to make her more popular :D"

19,vulnerability,forhonor,Regarding How To Buff the Samurai: Part 11,1,hsbqwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/hsbqwm/regarding_how_to_buff_the_samurai_part_11/,2020-07-17 01:34:44,"Since Ubisoft comes onto Reddit to get ideas for what to balance, I was hoping to get a big mixing pot of ideas to increase the relevance of the Samurai. I'm hoping giving actual suggestions instead of simply criticizing their more recent ""balancings"" will lead to more positive and proactive change. These are the ideas given to me from my last post mixed with my initial ideas. Please feel free to go into the comments to tell me which of these are dumb and need changing, as that is the point. I hope to continue doing this until we have heroes that everyone thinks would be fun to play as and against in the game. Here are the ideas so far: * Kensei: Enhance tracking on forward dodge heavy, to more effectively catch roll. Allow zone to soft feint to top heavy, would be undodgeable. Allow side/forward dodge after chained attacks, allowing a dodge forward to gb. * Shugoki: Decrease back breaker recovery to 1000ms Make headbutt softfeintable to Demons Embrace. If not feinted, the headbutt will deal 10 damage. Allow headbutt to chain to Demons Embrace, guaranteed if opponent is walled. * Nobushi: Kick will be given a new animation. Instead of leaning against her staff, Nobushi will perform a kick far more reminiscent of Tiandis kick, to allow her kick to feel more natural. Nobushis Sidewinder Form may now be soft feinted to kick. Kick is now 500ms Kick may be softfeinted into a backstep sweep by using heavy during kick startup. This will be 400ms and gbable during the first 300ms. Dodgeable, but not interruptible as she will have I-Frames while performing it. Upon connection, Nobushi May use light attack to link to a light impale which would deal 7 base damage and trade in a stack of bleed for 4 flat damage per bleed stack and perform a special kill animation. Zone may be soft feinted into HS. Allow for Nobushi to exit from HS from any guard direction. * Orochi: Allow end of chain heavy to be soft feinted into deflect punish, end of chain light may chain to deflect punish upon landing. Add a dodging heavy attack Allow chain to link to dodging light or heavy Allow a kick from Storm Rush which, if dodged, leaves Orochi vulnerable for 600ms. This kick would use Tozens animation, would be 500ms, and guarantee a light attack. Any attack following this kick would also be considered end of chain, which allow linking to the deflect punish mentioned earlier. Left heavy attack from Storm Rush now has I-Frames. * Shinobi: Increase distance of backflip, will be half the distance of Pre-Nerf backflip. Sickle Rain heavy (chain heavy) is undodgeable. On front roll, the deflect light punish will be added here, with the exception of it being blockable/parriable. This light attack being 450ms. Allow heavy to chain to zone leading to Sickle Rain (ie. once Shinobis zone is cancelled, he may perform a heavy attack that would lead to sickle rain in connection). After a parry, Shinobi may dodge which will act as the double dodge, along with all the benefits that brings. Additionally, Shinobi may dodge forward to perform a mock deflect. The animation of passing through his opponent will not deal damage. He will have access to both the kick and light attack, both of which will be punishable upon heavy parry, unpunishable on light parry. The light will be a 450ms light, the kick will act identically to his double dash kick, with the same amount of vulnerability if missed. Finally, the mock deflect will allow for chain heavy. Make ranged gb reversal and ranged heavy parry no longer knock Shinobi to the ground. He will now be reeled in, and be considered guard broken or heavy parried depending upon the initial action by Shinobi. * Aramusha: Soft feint top heavies to head bop; side heavies to top heavy (which will allow for soft feint to head bop, also reducing the amount of time for top heavy to go through to 650ms). After soft feinting to light attacks Aramusha may now kick as a chain finisher. This can wall which guarantees a heavy from Ara. Allow Aras zone to be soft feinted to head bop. * Hitokiri: Revert to Pre-2.19.1 - 2.19.3 Hito, with minor improvements. Zone now has super armour which activates at 200ms. Hitokiris uncharged heavy deals 32 damage, Endless Myriad deal heavies deal 25 damage. No changes from last discussion."

21,vulnerability,forhonor,Conquerors current state,1,hxq16d,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/hxq16d/conquerors_current_state/,2020-07-26 02:59:18,"From my understanding all the nerfs that happened to conq was because new players were struggling with him. That much is understandable but look at everyone who learned how to play the game without these nerfs. We didn't get our hand held through this game and we weren't coddled by the development team. Everyone learned how to counter a hero with the hero they play. Recently I've seen many issues with conqueror which is why im here writing this thread, I want to see if its just me or if its happening to other conquerors. I've had a few problems so I'm gonna start out with the most recent one I've realized, the superior heavy. I've always been good with timing his superior heavies and I thought it was a balanced thing for him to have, it's a punish after all. But in my past few matches every single one of my super heavies have been immediately blocked, even with reflex guard. What's the point of having a move that blocks an attackers attack and is followed up with a punish attack if it's just immediately blocked? The second issue I've noticed is his heavy guard break vulnerability. Before in my opinion I thought it was perfectly fine. I mean so many characters have like zero guard break vulnerability on some of their heavies. This has been a problem for all of us conquerors. Seeing how our heavies are easily parried, why would they make his guard break vulnerability be increased? I've thrown heavies and had my back completely turned to them so basically 50% done with the animation then get guard broken out of it. I dont know if that's the enemy's lag getting me or if that's actually how vulnerable conq is. It's insane that conqueror went from a good character to being an extremely vulnerable hero. The shield bash is also a problem, getting punished for missing a shield bash is perfectly understandable and I support that decision. But my problem is why do you have to be so vulnerable so long. Now this has only happened to me a few times but theres been times where I've missed a shield bash and instead of recovering and getting back into combat I just stand there and get easily guard broken. Again I dont know if that's lag or the actual timing of conquerors failed shield bash. With the state that conquerors in I fear for the future players that want to get into conqueror because with how he/she is in now. Can any other conq main confirm that this has happened to them or is it just a problem that I face."

23,vulnerability,forhonor,New mechanics idea: brace,1,i0fqvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/i0fqvy/new_mechanics_idea_brace/,2020-07-30 14:35:51," Ive been thinking of a new for honor mechanic that could be implemented into all heroes that I honestly think would put bashed based offense on the same level as others so its not just the obvious best a ""brace"" mechanic so if you think you're about to get bashed you can brace yourself, and if bashed, you wont be pushed, (maybe even your enemy would stagger off you and you could get in some damage? idk) the brace wouldn't have GB vulnerability but would take away your guard stance so you could get hit by anything. this adds a new layer to a bash, because right now, you can only do one thing against a bash, dodge, where as with every other type of attack you have more then one option so now when someone bashes, there are so many more outcomes and requires so many more reads, you can bash feint, and try to hit in case they brace, gb in case they dodge, or follow through if they don't do anything. It adds depth and means that there aren't 4 ways a bash can be done but only one way to defend against it. if you go the path that means if you successfully brace an attack it gives you an in to damage it can be a good way to sustain the flow of combat instead of rolling away and stalling everything please consider this. if you have any suggestions or reasons why it wouldnt work please by all means critique me,"

25,vulnerability,forhonor,You might as well delete Shugoki at this point. (A rep 140 Shugo Mains Thoughts),25,h023hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/h023hm/you_might_as_well_delete_shugoki_at_this_point_a/,2020-06-10 12:36:16,"Dear Ubi Devs, I wanted to formally congratulate you for essentially sending shugoki off the tier list into his own little special corner of Hell. It baffles me how incompetent you could possibly be nerfing a D tier character for no reason at all. As a 4 year Shugoki main (OOF) with 140 reps (70 on ps4 70 on Pc) I feel like I know all the ins and outs of the characters and its safe to say these nerfs make absolutely no sense at all. Also as someone who plays the game at a high mmr I can assure you that shugoki is easily One of the worst, if not the worst 1v1 hero in the game (Rivaled only by shinobi), and a very mediocre 4v4 hero who is outclassed by any other decent hero in the game. I don't care that low mmr players cry how OP shugoki is, or how much they cry that they can not react to his mix ups (that are 100% reactable and punishable no matter the variable), or cry about how shugoki has hyper armor on light attacks like its the best thing in the game, when it comes down to it, when playing in a high level environment shugoki is complete garbage HE IS ONLY A NOOB STOMPER. Rather than addressing ANY of his problems (2000 ms missed hug recovery allowing people to roll away neutral reset and still get any punish in the game, Having the biggest GB Vulnerability in the game on any of his heavies, Hyper armor on demon ball allowing you to take INSANE damage from external hits in 4s, no chase down, having the worst general attack recovery in the game; just to name a few). Shugoki is not only heavily countered by several characters in the game (Warden, Tiandi, Glad, Shaman, Conq, Warlord, BP, Jorm, Highlander, Lawbro, zerk) but is still completely hard countered by simple game fundamentals such as rolling while having no chase down options at all, and of course optimal turtles. Introduction aside, I wanted to touch on what these nerfs truly mean to shugoki since it seems like your not sure what you are doing. 1. Uninterruptible stance - Light Opener starts at 300ms (was 200ms) \- This nerf is the least of my concern as a hyper agressive shugoki main, any smart shugo player is going to know how to properly engage using armor on lights but this can potentially still damage the trading value of shugoki's lights when it comes to fighting faster assassin classes in the game that. All of this is not even considering the fact that shugo already has the easiest to parry/deflect telegraphed lights in the game already. 2. Uninterruptible stance - Heavy Opener now starts no earlier than 433ms (was 400) \- This may not seem like much but in reality when it comes to shugoki 33ms of armor on an already horribly inconsistent character can drastically hurt the potential of trading with heavies. Shugoki already gets hit and GB'ed out of raw throw heavies enough to begin with, so adding additional time before hyper armor kicks in only makes it more inconsistent. 3. Heavy Opener Charge (Is no longer ""Immune"" to GB during the charge portion \- THIS...absolutely blew my mind and actually made me question if anyone on the dev team actually plays shugoki or if y'all just like to throw random nerfs on characters just for fun. SHUGOKI HAS NEVER HAD ""IMMUNITY"" TO GB'S ON HIS CHARGE HEAVIES WTH ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT? Whether its a charged heavy or a raw heavy he has the highest GB vulnerability in the game (only made worse by the GB patch that was meant to fix GB issues with Aramusha and Glad). On top of this if a player does somehow magically not GB shugo out of the middle/late charge of his heavy and the GB bounces 9/10 TIMES YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO RECOVER AND STILL PARRY THE UNBLOCKABLE LMAO. With these nerfs you are essentially removing aggressive potential from shugo and making it so we can only trade attacks on red like some pre nerf bootleg Hitokiri. Oh and did I mention you can still just roll away from any shugo heavy 50/50 heavy mix and we can do NOTHING about it :)? I know this post is not going to do anything to change shugos nerfs and I doubt anyone even cares, I just figured id give yall the low down on how the remaining 10 people who still play this doo doo character feel, lol peace."

27,vulnerability,forhonor,ANOTHER heavy hito nerf?,4,h7wg02,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/h7wg02/another_heavy_hito_nerf/,2020-06-13 10:08:22,"Aight I could understand the first one because she was BROKE AF on release but what is with this BS?? Interruptible heavy opener? Ok I can deal with that. More interruptible sweep? Aight I guess. Slowing down pretty much everything she does?? Nerfing the 4th feat 1 shot to make it just a top unblockable? Was that absolutely necessary? This feat was already weak compared to other 4th level feats of the same effect, such as Catapault, Arrow Storm, Spear Storm, etc, all of which achieve the effect of instantly killing the standard hero (no revenge, hyper armour, etc).If you had full revenge shields and full health you could even survive Senbonzakura with about half your health left because it only deals 200 damage. Hito wasnt bad to fight, especially after the first nerf. Now she just seems weak. Why would I even use Senbonzakura anymore if an enemy can just stand there and parry it. Or if theyre in a gank, which is where this feat was most effective like the other three feats I mentioned above, why would I even throw this feat out there when its likely to be parried like a standard attack? Senbonzakura isnt even viable in 1v1s due to the long charge up period, and the fact that it can just be sidestepped. Ubi, I insincerely thank you for making Senbonzakura nothing more than a watered down version of the Unblockable feat, which I can now replace with such equally useless feats as Regenerate, which is only usable in games such as Tribute or Deathmatch when there are no healing buffs around or in Breach when the enemy has the healing zone, but of course I will not be able to utilise this feature because Hito is a pretty slow moving hero who will not be able to back out of combat, and if she tries will easily be caught up with. And if she does win this theoretical combat, she might as well just go to a healing zone which will heal her faster than relying on a feat. Alternatively I could use Fear Itself, a feat which has the vague description of Nearby Enemies have lower defences which gives me no idea as to what it actually does? What constitutes as a defence? Is it a ms% deducted from the time which their guard sets in? If it is its not a difference that Ive ever been able to notice whilst on both ends of the feat. It doesnt even feel like a placebo. It offers no noticeable difference to my playstyle other than a dark purple aura. Thank you Ubi, for nixing Hitos only viable 4th feat. Thank you Ubi for taking another fucking sledgehammer to my big axe wielding asthmatic waifu. Hitokiri was clearly way too overpowered with her fast lights, her infinite heavies, and her chargeable heavy which deals up to 40 base damage (lower than other heavies such as Shugoki, whos charged heavy deals 45 (or can be soft-feinted into the hug), or a hair above other heavies moves such as JJ, and lower than other heros moves such as Shamans bite, Jorms CBT, and Zerks triple heavy chain.) Thank you Ubi for making Hitokiri so much easier to fight, because she wasnt possible to defeat by a half decent player before (sarcasm), and anybody who played her instantly became an unstoppable god nearly equivalent to that of a Lvl.3 bot (also sarcasm), but now she is a perfectly balanced character with an interesting moveset (which totally do not have broken animations on the new blocked light finishers, because blocked enhanced lights were clearly op) and usable, useful, and unique feats, each of which now have clear situations which they can be reliably useful (Yes, more sarcasm). Im really hoping Ubi rolls back some of these changes. I can live with the few extra frames between my attacks. I can live with a little more vulnerability. But this is just ridiculous. At the very least buff Senbonzakura back to how it was, because at this point its only useful against lvl.1-2 bots, bad players, and maybe if you throw someone out of stamina to the floor. This used to be the execution-getter feat. And now I feel it truly is a low-chance gamble you can use every 2 minuets."

Literally ruins 1v1 when anytime you go to start a combo or anything on the cent and they just whip out a non gb vulnerable attack that can just be feinted instantly and shut down your entire attempt at even playing the game. Just add gb vulnerability to the move, done. Right now its like a glad zone but without the unblockable. Takes 0 skill to use, ruins the flow of combat, and makes the character just as unfun to fight as before the rework. When people don't use it, the character is fine, but when used just ruins the game"

Now that Aramusha lost his 100 ms heavy gb vulnerability he cant really turtle anymore. He has a lot of tools but it is hidden in the blade blockade (bb). I would like to bring out those unblockables and bashes to be able to use from neutral and from chains as well. First off remove bb completly, it has very little to no use right now, since the meta is bashes and unblockables. Reduce neutral side heavy dmg to 33.No longer guaranteed top heavy after heavy parry. Top heavy is 800 ms 30dmg, gb guarantees top heavy. Reduce side deadly feints to 12 dmg. The two side unblockables from bb are now top heavy chain finisher without the hyper armor dealing 30 dmg 900 ms, no longer feint into deadly feint.The top heavy from bb is removed it is very incosistent. Kick is avaible from forward dodge gb. 500 ms No longer wallsplat,drain stam and stun, instead gaurantees a light. Can not be punished with gb, can be bunished with a dodge attack on read. Ring the bell is avaible from parry( input is gb after any parry) ,also from gb(light input). Reduce zone stamina cost,zone can be feinted into deadly feints. Oh and replace rock steady with something else."

Add 10 fire dmg (2 dmg per tick for 5 ticks) after landing it. Considering how easy it is to parry that 600ms move, I think 28 dmg is reasonable.

Also unblockable light attacks if being changed, it should be 500ms. Dealing 15 dmg after buffing the speed. His specialisation is dodge recovery cancel, but the dodge is same as recovery finish. What's the point of it? Make the dodge window starts at 0ms into recovery of Dodge Attacks, Opener, or Zone attack, which should make him an actual dodge master. Same like Tiandi mid chain dodge, Nobushi dodge attacks recovery cancel. Another problem is...his right heavy finisher's hitbox is stupidly strange. It activates so late it would ignore external target on your right but it hits people on your left and almost behind. It needs urgent fix at the moment. Dodge attack specialist, but his side dodge attacks start at 400ms into dodge, but means...he has 500ms GB vulnerability on dodge attacks. 400ms + 100ms from the attack itself. It should be made variable timed, from 200ms to 400ms. This will make him able to OS GB on reaction more than he should be.

People in the community dont sympathize with Shinobi players, which only exposes their bias, and double standards. They will never acknowledge shinobis weaknesses, and I hope you guys reconsider his nerf/low tier direction. Range - Shinobi has no chase tools! Heroes like Shaman can do the same thing as shinobi. They can use their stealth feat and throw homing missile chase heavies. This midget leaps 50+ Feet like its nothing, and if theyre out of range, it auto follows until they are!  straight comedy! Stop being so afraid of the range part of shinobis kit. Theres plenty heroes that have ridiculous range, or better yet CC moves that carry the victim for 50+ feet til theyre ledged. LB, Warlord, Raider. Maneuverability - no quad dashing because its BrOkEn! However JJ can infinite dodge, cancel dodges into as many as they like! Try to gb.....get hit with a wiff unless your a Viking (beside Valk and HL really) or knight because theyre GBs will track a good 7+ feet. Not to mention HL OS dodges, Tiandis FLoW lIkE wAtER, theyre all more agile and safer than a ninja. Read that again please, these heroes are 6ft warriors more agile and as fast/faster then a ninja. Tech - no real tech anymore besides a zone option select. No recovery cancels, huge gb vulnerability, shinobi gets gbd so deep into their heavy animation its pitiful. The entire cast is safer than what should be an agile and deadly warrior in the game, cmon. Bezerker is deadly, Pks deadly now that they have enhanced lights on bleed, Shamans deadly and can heal without feats plus basically do a sickle rain mixup with her bite. My point is, it is clear people want shinobi to be the bottom of the barrel or deleted. Its complete hypocrisy and any problem people have with his kit...someone else does better. Better CC, better enhanced defense, better enhanced offense, recovery cancels, legit tech. Its a shame and people need to grow up. Ninjas were real get over it! Weeb this, weeb that.

Make lights slow again, like back when they were an easy parry every time. And make them all this slow, with a standard speed (maybe 500/600 ms). Make heavy animations similar enough to lights and fast enough that: A) you cannot tell the difference before the light parry window and B) you dont have time to feint a failed light parry and block a heavy This means that parrying requires a heavy/light read. This would be ideal if not for the constant blocking and the whole just wait to parry a heavy idea. The issue if waiting for heavies is easy to solve, give EVERY hero enough GB vulnerability that feinting into GB works on them. Next, the constant blocking or turtle meta. This could be fixed by amping up chip damage on both heavies AND lights by a lot. Like make a block absorb only 60% of damage. This makes blocking a last resort and forces players to read for a parry or turn the fight to their offence. Mind games, no light spamming, and no turtle meta. Thoughts?"

The point of this nerf is to disincentivize the reliance on lightspam to play Nuxia effectively and encourage the use of all her moves. Decreasing the speed of her lights would make them parry bait for an already-underpowered character, so going for a dmg nerf would be a more appropiate option. * **Increased Heavy Opener, Chain and Finisher speed to 700ms (from all directions):** It's understandable that Nuxia's heavy attacks are slow so they can be linked to Traps and give the opponent an opportunity to read or at least react to the upcoming attack. Increasing the speed of Nuxia's heavies would make them more viable without breaking the aformentioned rules. * **Decreased Chain Heavy damage to 30 (from all directions):** I promise there's a good reason for these dmg nerfs. In order to obtain something, thou must sacrifice something else of equal value, or we end up with another overtuned rework. * **Heavy Finisher is now unblockable (from all directions) but cannot be linked into Trap (""Glass Waltz""):** Nuxia's Heavy finishers are unique in the since they can throw and destabilize OOS opponents. Making them unblockable allows this tool to be more reliable without sacrificing their ""high risk/high reward"" principle too much, as the opponent can still go for a parry to counter it. As for not being able to link it into Trap, is to stop the move from being OP, since the Trap indicator looks quite similar to the unblockable indicator, and would surely be exploited in an unhealthy way for the game's balance. # 2.- Relocate the ""Trap"" button from ""GB"" to the ""Light"" button. If one thinks about it, it makes sense to relocate the Trap to the Light button, since you're going to press that button again to chain a Light attack following a successful or missed Trap, should you choose to do so (and it connects to the next point). Depending on the system, it would look something like this on the control scheme: * **XBOX:** RT cancel with RB. * **PS4:** R2 cancel with R1. * **PC:** RMB cancel with LMB. # 3.- Nuxia gets a Soft-feint into GB on all Heavy attacks. The purpose of the previous change was mostly to allow Nuxia to get a new move on her kit. This added tool justifies her dmg nerfs, as it would create new opportunities for mixing-up the opponent, plus serving to minimize the slightly-random nature of the Traps sometimes landing on parry attempts depending on your luck that day, thanks to the recent GB vulnerability changes. # 4.- Crescent Step * **Decreased Side-Dodge Light speed to 600ms, but is now undodgeable and can be chained into Chain Light or Heavy Finisher:** Decreasing the speed of Nuxia's side-dodge attack is to keep it in line with other characters that have a similar move (Berzerker, Orochi, Gladiator), with the extra that making it undodgeable makes this ""high risk/low reward"" move more viable. As for the follow-ups, chaining into Light isn't new, but changing it so it links to the Heavy finisher sounds like a nerf, as you're potentially taking away the opportunity to get two Heavy attacks worth 70 dmg if landed. However, since we're talking about an unblockable Heavy that can be soft-feinted into GB, I believe it's a good trade when taking the mixing-up potential into consideration. # 5.- Zone Attack * **Increased Zone Attack speed to 800ms (from 1000ms), is now undodgeable and can be chained into Chain Light or Heavy Finisher:** This slow move that always comes from the same direction can surely benefit from some improvements. One could argue that its hitbox is quite huge and can be chained into a 45 dmg move if landed (or a chain that can potentially mix you up like we examined in the previous point), hence the addition of the undodgeable property, so it becomes more effective at its purpose. As for the dmg, that takes us to the next point. * **Decreased ""Jade Ballet"" Trap damage to 35 (from 45):** This nerf is to keep the possible outcomes of this move balanced. In a gank, a Nuxia that lands this move on an opponent leaves said opponent at the mercy of 3 other players with their own attacks to give in a likely one-shot scenario (assuming they don't interrupt Jade Ballet). In short, dmg nerf keeps undodgeable attack with mix-up potential not-so OP (I hope). # 6.- Echo Strike * **Decreased ""Echo Strike"" Deflect damage to 30 (from 40), but is now unblockable and can be chained into Chain Light or Heavy Finisher:** This is a change that needs to happen, period. Performing and landing a deflect requires a good read of your opponent on top of accurate timing. Being able to parry and/or deflect a deflect dismisses the whole ""high risk/high reward"" principle that makes this move, and encourages turtling instead of trying to predict your opponent. Nerfing Nuxia's deflect dmg is a fair trade for a guaranteed reward after reading your opponent successfully. *And that's about it from my part. I strongly believe that Nuxia can be greatly improved with just a few tweaks to her current moveset. I know I left some other important things out in this post, but that's what the comment section is for. I love this character and I'd also love to see what you guys think about this.* *Thank you for coming to my TED talk, and may you have a wonderful weekend.* ***Cheers!***"

(Kick can now be punished by a quick doshe attack or bash). Make forward dodge heavy have quicker hyper armour. Make forward dodge heavy 28 damage (from 20). Make side dodge heavy 28 damage (from 25) Give side dodge heavies more i-frames and less gb vulnerability. Make all dash lights enhanced and up the damage to 16 Allow flow like water to work on chain finishers. Allow the kick to be performed on a heavy chain finisher and also be performed after a wiffed heavy. Decrease stamina costs for all soft feints and on a wiffed kick. Make palm strike do more stamina damage and also make the light follow up deal 16 damage. Allow him to soft feint into palm strike from forward dodge heavy and side dodge heavy, make it 466ms. I think this would give him some OOS pressure much like JJs. Palm strike is now 500ms from neutral and 466ms in chain. Spread the stamina cost of the zone over the two hits not just the full cost when you use it. Shaolin: Top light is now enhanced. Opener heavy now does 28 damage from 25. Deflect now does 30 damage. Time to get into qi stance from a wiffed attack is quicker. All attacks from qi stance can flow back into qi by holding the attack button ie. Light or heavy. From qi stance shaolin now has his sweep. Can be performed by holding back and pressing the gb button. Forward doge heavy can be soft feinted into a kick (similar his running kick). This confirms the same as his running kick does. Triple light or a heavy if knocked into a wall. Top heavy from qi stance can be soft feinted back into qi stance like it used to. All qi stance lights now add a stun effect.

I added new things and tried to make everything a bit more clear! Thanks for reading and have a nice one! I think Aramusha is and has been in a pretty weird place. He's both *strong and weak*. Overall he is a fun hero to play, but still lacks a bit of *sauce*! So, after some thought and some new ideas, I've come up with a few quality of life changes for Aramusha, that I think are needed. *Without going any further, I want to thank you all for reading and ""any"" feedback is welcome* My goal here is to: - Make Aramusha more versatile; - Give him more options; - Balance speed and damage; - Other. - **NEW** Oh, and have a Female Aramusha (that would be nice not gonna lie); I don't want to change his chains, meaning that the whole **top/side/top/side** *Tempest* thing will stay as it is. Although: - Neutral Side Heavies can be soft feinted to a Light Attack either to Top or the opposite Side (just like his ""Deadly Feint""); - (Mid Chain) Top Light is Enhanced (meaning they don't bounce off if blocked); - **NEW** Top Chain Finisher Heavy can be soft feinted into GB (or the Deadly Feint with Light Attacks to the sides); - **NEW** Side Chain Finishers can be soft feinted into the Blade Blockade Kick by pressing the GB button (or the Deadly Feints with Light Attacks to top or the opposite side) (details about the kick are below); Another change would be to his **Rushing Wind** *(Alternate)* (Dodge Forward Side Heavy): - Has Undodgeable properties (to better catch rolls and more pressure); - Can be soft feinted to a Light Attack from the opposite side; - Can be soft feinted to the Blade Blockade Kick (details about the Kick are below); **Blade Blockade And Soft Feint To Kick Changes** - (on hit) you will not be in Light Attack range; - (on hit) you can chain automatically to an Heavy Attack to the Top or Sides; - Top Heavy (after the Kick) is guaranteed and counts as a chain starter; - Side Heavies (after the Kick) are not guaranteed and count as a chain finisher; - the kick will push your enemy away from you just like it does now. Once you press Heavy Attack you'll be teleported to the enemy (like the Sprint Attack Teleport); Details: - (after the kick hits) Top Heavy animation is just like the *Rushing Wind* (Dodge Forward Top Heavy) but Aramusha disappears and appears near the enemy (use of the teleport, like the Sprint Attack); - (after the kick hits) Side Heavies animations are just like the Side Heavy finishers but (again) Aramusha disappears and appears near the enemy (use of the teleport, like the Sprint Attack); - (after the kick) Side Heavies are guaranteed on a wallsplat; **Guard Break:** - Top Light Attack will be changed to the **Ring the Bell**; You can still throw the enemy after doing that (damage and stun are only applied on hit, thus making it possible to be hit/stopped from outside attacks); **Blade Blockade:** - Kick, will now have the mix up/properties I described above; - Ring the Bell, will also make you able to throw the enemy just like in the guard break (damage and stun are only applied on hit, thus making it possible to be hit/stopped from outside attacks); **Damage/Speed Changes:** - Top Neutral Light - 15dmg; - Top Chain Light - 17dmg; - Top Neutral Heavy - 25dmg; - Top Chain Heavy - 28dmg; - Side Neutral Light - 15dmg; - Side Chain Light - 15dmg; - Side Neutral Heavy - 35 - Side Chain Heavy - 30 - All Heavy Chain Finishers will do 40dmg; - Deadly Feint Speed nerf - 400ms to 433ms or 466ms (only reason being that now you can soft feint to the kick at ""any"" point, so imo there's no reason to make the mix up 400ms when you have more options to hit your enemy and play a with all the soft feints) (a direction delay could even be added, to prevent flickers and to so the speed nerf is not too noticed); - Deadly Feint Damage: Side - 20dmg to 17dmg; Top - 15dmg to 17dmg; - Ring the Bell - 15dmg to 10dmg (plus the stun); **Standard Changes:** - Heavy Attacks have the same Guard Break vulnerability like ""all"" heroes; - Top Heavy no longer guaranteed after a Heavy Parry. And that's about it, let me know what you all think! Have a nice one!"

62,vulnerability,forhonor,Increase the delay or gb vulnerability between side dodging and bashing.,1,f6667z,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/f6667z/increase_the_delay_or_gb_vulnerability_between/,2020-02-19 16:42:42, This might be because of the characters I enjoy playing or just the cast in general but counter bashing on some characters as it is right now is stupid. There are characters (mainly conq and LB) who can straight up negate mixups by dodge bashing and for some reason are still gb immune. I can understand initiating the counter bash on a dodged attack and landing it because of the opponents recovery but its redundant that I can make a hard read go for the gb and then get cucked by a bash attack. My solution is to either increase the delay between the dodge and the bash or increase the guard break vulnerability on the beginning frames of the bash. Also while I'm on the subject just remove wardens back dodge bash in its entirety.
63,vulnerability,forhonor,PK viability idea,2,ek4uy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/ek4uy2/pk_viability_idea/,2020-01-05 11:03:28,"Most of us know that PK isnt the most viable character in the game. In the past, her speed, bleed and high damage output made her nearly unstoppable. But since 400ms lights have been made more common in the game and her damage has been tuned down very significantly (way too much in my opinion, but some do think its okay), she has lost a lot of utility and usability. I still like to play PK every once in a while as PK was my first main when the game launched. But I have a few ideas on how to make her more prevalent again. I wanted to dive into her speedy aspect so I made the heavies faster and made each direction a different speed so she was less predictable: - change heavy speed to match their damage output - 700ms right side heavy - 800ms left side heavy - reduce GB vulnerability for both - both still land on GB - damage remains 20 for both - - 900ms top heavy - damage increase to 25 (was 23) - top heavy can now soft feint into a left dagger cancel - top heavy still doesnt land on GB - top heavy still lands on light parry - - all finisher heavies do 30 damage (was 27) - all chain finishers have faster recovery - - all lights remain the same - - increase stamina pool to 130 (was 120) - - side dodge heavies are slightly faster and are chain starters (I dont have numbers for this one) - - forward dash heavy has better tracking and a faster recovery Let me know what you all think. Remember this is just an idea and NOT going into the game. I am just trying to think of a good way to make PK viable again"
64,vulnerability,forhonor,Heavy Attack Guard Break Vulnerability Bug,1,eo1rdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/eo1rdt/heavy_attack_guard_break_vulnerability_bug/,2020-01-13 20:08:37,"So I noticed recently in a dominion game that feint into heavy was bouncing off of a Raider's parry attempts and I was just eating the heavy. I know that this shouldn't be happening (Raider has 400ms GB vulnerability on his heavies cause they're over 700ms meaning that a GB, being 300ms after a feint, and feint timing occurring 100ms before parry timing means that my GB should catch him during his heavy attack startup), and my initial thought was that he was cheating with a lag switch or something because I was inputting the right attacks, so I did some testing. Turns out that Parry attempts only have 400ms GB Vulnerability when you have to change guard to throw the heavy. I don't know how much the GB vulnerability is decreased by cause I don't have recording/editing software to test but here's what I can tell you. 1. Feint into GB will not work if a the enemies Guard is already in the direction of the attack you are throwing, this includes reflex guard hero's passive guard direction. 2. The GB vulnerability is more than 100ms and you cannot use a heavy in you're current guard direction to punish neutral GB attempts, unless you're hero has fast neutral heavies of course. 3. This is a bug with all heroes as it remained the same with both static and reflex guard heroes. I really hope this gets patched soon cause having a standard thing like feint into GB suddenly become situational and requiring a lot of game awareness of guard direction, especially against reflex guard heroes, isn't good for the game."
65,vulnerability,forhonor,Not the average Orochi needs an opener post. These are all very realistic and minor changes that would definitely improve Orochi without making him more annoying to fight against. Please hear me out.,1,eoszrn,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/eoszrn/not_the_average_orochi_needs_an_opener_post_these/,2020-01-15 09:48:07,"So, Im going to start with his lights. *LIGHT ATTACKS* Make all his 1st lights in the chain 500 ms (from 466 ms on top light) therefore his double top-lights should do 22 damage AS BEFORE (from 18 dmg). Why? Because if youre going to make his offense shit, at least give him a nice parry punish, and for a fact, he had 22 dmg on his top lights before and nobody complained. His 2nd lights should stay 400 ms or they can be slowed up a bit to 433/466 ms and they should be enhanced, this would allow Orochi to throw his chain finisher even after his 2nd attack was blocked. Note: Only the 2nd chain light is enhanced, not the 1st one. Finisher lights are now 500 ms (from 500/466ms) His zone should be 500 ms again (from 466) and (possibly) the option to chain an attack after the zone (like with Warden). His heavies are fine but if some players agree with it the top heavy can do 30/32 dmg (from 35 dmg) considering that it has no guardbreak vulnerability. *DEFLECTS* Light deflect should get hyperarmor. This will prevent you getting hit out of your light deflect, bashes however are still able to interrupt you. This is very helpful if youre deflecting Zerks/Shamans zone and have hit deflect too early and you got interrupted. Also, if you softfeint your Heavy deflect into a Light deflect, you will get interrupted if the enemy decides to throw a chain light. This change wont be game breaking at all since most of the Orochis cant even deflect and its a rare occasion that you even go for a heavy deflect at higher levels. This wouldnt be too noticeable because most assassins already have guaranteed deflects (Shinobi, Glad, Zerk). *STORM RUSH* Its already fine but it would be helpful if you would be able to soft-feint Storm Rush into a dodge, this way you could deflect attacks directly out of Storm Rush instead of having to cancel it first. *POSSIBLE CHANGES/BUFFS* 1.) Having the Old Riptide Strike back and keeping the existing one at the same time. The old RP strike should have the same input (forward+backwards+heavy). This way it would still be guaranteed on like heavies that cant be cancelled (Kenseis dodge, Shamans dodge, Highlanders celtic curse, etc.) and it did 40 dmg, i would gladly risk throwing the attack because its a heavy and therefore get punished a little less by the enemy. The current RP strike is high risk/low reward. No good Orochi uses if anymore. 2.) Replace the 3rd Longbow feat with Second Wind. In my opinion, Orochi doesnt even feel like an assassin, but more like a vanguard/assassin hybrid, considering that hes wearing the most armor out of any other assassin in the game he atleast could have that option to heal himself and he cant do much in anti-ganks without any openers, so having that little bit of help would be very appreciated. I think it would not be as strong as you might think because Shaman, who is an assassin herself, has both the ability to heal herself through her move-set as well heal herself through the second wind feat and so far i never heard anyone complaining about that. 3.) Finally, his light deflect could be able to interrupt heroes with hyperarmor in their chains (Raider, Zerk, Warlord, etc). I believe that this wouldnt be too strong because there are heroes that are able to do this (Zerk, Shinobi, Valk) and so far ive heatd no complaints and had none myself. *FINAL MESSAGE* If you read this, then thank you very much for your attention. If you agree/disagree then please comment. And keep in mind, im an Orochi main, so i know what would be good for him and im a dedicated player, so i also know what would be good for the game and all these changes i mentioned wont make him more annoying or less viable.I put a lot of thought into this so i know it wont be bad. Once again, thank you for reading and please comment your thoughts on this."

So I wanted to gather some ideas for how to change reflex to something a bit more fair, while still keeping deflects. I had an idea where assassins would have static guard until they block an attack, then it would revert back to reflex for a short period of time. After maybe 4-5 seconds of not blocking or taking damage, it would revert back to static guard. I know that this change wouldnt save assassins in ganks but the designs of the characters movesets and how powerful deflects are would make them insanely powerful if they just had a constant guard, this way they would be weak to constant applied pressure, while emphasizing trying not to be hit to save static guard. I'm a warlord main so my opinion isn't the most informed, if any assassin main wants to give their two cents I'd love to hear it, and I'm sure Ubi would as well"

I understand having 800ms heavy openers so that people can feint into GB and catch her in the startup of her parry attempt heavy, as opposed to Cent or Aramusha where you just eat their heavy for even attempting a GB, but most of the cast have 700ms chain heavies with the people who have slower ones getting hyperarmor, or unblockables, or higher damage to compensate, ie; Kensei, Warden, Raider, LB, Zerk, Zhanhu, JJ, Shugoki, etc. She does some of the lowest damage heavies in the game and you either get GB'd or light parried out of all of her chains, Ubi, I beg of you, please give her 700ms chain heavies. A full rework would be nice but next season is Cent's turn so I won't bother asking for that now. List of heroes with 800ms+ heavy openers but 700ms, or less, chain heavies: Tiandi, Shaolin, Shinobi, Nobushi(on side heavy finishers), Orochi (on top heavy openers and finishers), Highlander, Berserker (Side heavies), and Warlord. and that's not including heroes with heavy openers that are faster that 800ms (Cent &amp; Aramusha plus some others). For anybody who does't understand why 700ms heavies would help, all attacks that take 0-700ms from indicator till hit have 100ms GB vulnerability during their startup, while all attacks 800-1000ms have 400ms GB vulnerability. look up the For Honor Information Hub and go to the General Information &amp; Frame Data tab for more numbers."

First off on a side-note, For Honor is made by Ubisoft, which I already know many people despise, but thats for another time. So without further ado, lets get started. First off, the character balancing system is wacky. Sure other games and stronger and weaker characters and whatnot, but FH had some awful heroes compared to others. Like my main (warlord), for example, hes very low tier due to some reasons like not having very good mixups and no unblockable attacks, or PK who doesnt have a bash or unblockable. Ubisoft needs to do a better job and designing these heroes and not get lazy for the new ones. Secondly, some characters are way too strong, like Warden, Conq and BP. Warden unlike other characters (besides Hito) can feint his bash making him a pretty good offensive character. On the other hand, Conq is a very defensive and turtle like character with a pretty safe bash unless dodged on prediction like BP who is like Conq but somewhat in between Warden and Conq, he can be aggressive or defensive but anyhow, some characters are too OP. Third, new players will have a very hard time with newer characters like Zhanhu, Jorm and Nuxia for example. When you first learn to play you are taught to block, parry and dodge. Nuxia just flat out denies newer characters the ability to block, Zhanhu gets to decide when the newer player gets to parry, and Jorm with make a new player say this game sucks by putting him out of stamina very fast leading to high damage on all of these characters mentioned. When you are getting better at the game and feint and GB more, you learn that some characters have high GB vulnerability during heavies while others and zero to none. Im not a game designer but Im sure Ubi could put more effort into this game and fix some heroes and bugs.

His damage is overtune, feint game is better than zerk, BB counters all lights and it even has 3 options to choose depending on the situation, has hyper amour on forward feintable dash attack, usable zone. Unblockable into guard break? Well, he can just fail parry for a 40. dmg heavy since no gb vulnerability. The lack of opener can be just completely hacked by a backward light to enter. I played him cause i lost to Ara so much just to discover hes hell strong. And watching Ara channels is now kinda boring cause good Ara dont even have to try, often maybe 3 hits and your opponents are dead. Yes, he lacks opener i get it but his pros overweigh his cons at the moment. And people keep crying LB punish damage op. Look at the data, Ara win rate has always sit steadily within top 5 for a while for a reason. Suggestion: - Nerf heavy side damage to 30-35 instead of 40-45. Nerf light damage to 12-13. - Make his heavy vulnerable to guard break. - Give him a better opener, maybe light into top unblockable to force reaction."

75,vulnerability,forhonor,Much needed Tiandi buffs,1,ehursf,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/ehursf/much_needed_tiandi_buffs/,2019-12-31 11:20:09,Make forward dodge heavy confirmed on a kick. Make forward dodge heavy have quicker hyper armour. Make forward dodge heavy 28 damage (from 20). Make sure dodge heavy 28 damage (from 25) Give side dodge heavies more i-frames and less gb vulnerability. Make all dash lights enhanced and up the damage to 16 Allow flow like water to work on chain finishers. Allow the kick to be performed on a heavy chain finisher and also be performed after a wiffed heavy. Decrease stamina costs for all soft feints. Make palm strike do more stamina damage and also make the light follow up deal 16-18 damage. Allow him to soft feint into palm strike from forward dodge heavy make it 466ms. I think this would give him some OOS pressure much like JJs. Palm strike is now 500ms from neutral and 466ms in chain. Spread the stamina cost of the zone over the two hits not just the full cost when you use it.
76,vulnerability,forhonor,Gladiator is the strongest character in the game. Change my mind.,1,eicgl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/eicgl7/gladiator_is_the_strongest_character_in_the_game/,2020-01-01 13:04:21,"Gladiator is, imo, the strongest character in the game at the moment, too strong. While there are plenty of characters with annoying moves that don't necessarily require ""skill"", I feel gladiator stands out for one reason. He's far too safe. **Toestab:** \- 20 damage move (w/ HM) on 600 ms timing from neutral and is safe to GB on dodge... I think this is the worst part of his kit for several reasons. \-10 of the 28 characters in the roster **CAN NOT** punish this move unless the glad makes a mistake \-Of the characters who can, only one deals greater damage than the toestab would have (conq w/ SB), all others deal equal or less damage (technically, HL in O-stance can also deal more, but who toestabs a HL in O-stance?) \-The move feeds little revenge and sets up big damage from teammate. React to friendly gladiators toestab with attacks up to (and possibly higher than) 1000 ms. These attacks will either hit if the toestab does, or the enemy will dodge and they will be unable to parry rendering the attack safe. This does not require comms or coordination. **Zone:** \-Nothing new here, gladiator still has the best zone in the game. Fast at 500 ms, highest damage\* at 30 (w/ HM), and very safe. \-If you don't personally see it as the best zone in the game, that's fair, however I believe it is as all other zones can be blocked for, w/ the exception of BP, who comes out 200 ms slower. **Safe dodges:** \-Gladiator can make all his dodges safe (mostly) with sucker punch. Removes the parry opportunity afforded by dodge lights and removes the guardbreak vulnerability afforded by a neutral dodge. Also, sacrifices only ten damage w/ HM. \-I'm aware that there is a way to punish this and that this is also an issue with other characters, but gladiators dodges provide him with much greater movement than them. **Honorable mentions:** The sped up lights and slowed guard decay were good changes imo, they just add to the issue of an already too-strong character. **Suggested changes:** \-The toestab should not be affected by HM and should not be safe on dodge. I think this is fair seeing as it was sped up and would still have high ganking potential. \-The zone should not be feintable. This has been a belief of mine since gladiator was released but I was willing to let it slide when he had nothing else going for him. It would still be viable as it is still a fast move on par with other viable zones, and it would still have high damage \-Sucker punch needs a bit more GB vulnerability during its startup. This would at least force gladiators into making a choice between it, and the dodge lights. **TL:DR** \- Gladiator is too strong due to his low risk, high reward play style. I think some of his moves should be made less safe without taking to much away from the reward if they land. \*There are other characters with potentially higher zone attack damage (eg. HL or cent) but I have omitted these for obvious reasons."

The original problem with Gladiator's Zone was that people could just use it on reaction to Guardbreak Indicator for free damage, and the same problem exists with Conq. While I understand that Conq is supposed to have ""incredible defense"" as his theme, I still don't think a zone this strong should be allowed. While it doesn't give much damage, it's still a fullblock stance and should be subject to at least 100ms of GB vulnerability like most attacks. Also, before anyone says ""just parry"" I'd like to see you parry a reactive Conq with over 200 ping."

With the worst unblockable in the game and no heavy light glad is pretty much useless u less the opponent is oos. These should change that Make sucker punch 500ms(from 600) this move doesnt guarantee damage so it makes no sense to make it reactable Add a heavy light chain(he needs more chain pressure instead of light spam which isnt even viable with the buffs as they are still reactable(all of them) and this will help catch early dodges when going into skewer) Skewer now does 15 direct and 10 bleed on impact for a more reliable move in team fights aswell as letting glad get some kind of trade when trading with hyperarmor as all other assassins can get theirs off before taking damage Actually increase the forward movement of skewer because people are still backdodging it because it doesnt track Reduce the feint timing on heavies so glad has to choose whether to use his gb immune heavies or feint as he can attempt a parry and feint causing gbs to bounce and he gets a free gb Make his dodge attacks have less gb vulnerability Make parry counter bash do more stamina damage to make it actually useful Possibly make feinted lights 466 ms so were not reset to neutral when I feint Right now hes the exact same as before except you can throw chained lights and toestab more often. he is still pretty weak and you shouldnt leave him untouched

I was looking for a hero that I could grind on and get a high rep for so long, and now the final hero is as disappointing as ever. I really wanted to enjoy Zhanhu but this character is in the lowest tier. Two directional dodge attacks? thank you for the free light parry buddy, oh and if they hit its 14 dmg? cool. might as well get a blocked heavy attack then. not to mention the gb vulnerability on them... Light unblockable, sounds cool at first, until you throw it out, then you realize how retarded it is. How is it ever going to be worth to throw out a 600 ms light with an obvious animation that deals only 18 damage? They are going to go for the parry and you are eating 35 - 40 damage. Hmm what else does this abomination of a character have? Ah the zone, yes like you would ever have any incentive to dodge during a Zhanhu mixup, so the blue animation is just a free parry again. Don't get me wrong it works on warlord. But when they gave Zhanhu a blue animation honestly they just wanted to make the zone worse. Honestly buff the dodge attack damage to 18, parrying the unblockable light results in a heavy parry and make the zone faster. I understand For Honor is a new game and hard to balance. but its been over 3 years now you can't keep making mistakes like this."

85,vulnerability,forhonor,Let's Talk Bots,1,dx05hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/dx05hm/lets_talk_bots/,2019-11-16 12:20:40,"**Bot issues** Ever since the latest patch to bots, where bots sometimes fall for feint into GB, I have not seen any more discussion about them. Bots serve two important key purposes that affect basically everybody at some point. For one, they teach new players how to play the game, through the apprentice/warrior trials and through AI matches. For two, they take over for teammates who drop in PvP matches, where they are intended to serve as adequate if unremarkable teammates - neither carrying nor throwing the game. Currently this is not the case at all. Bots fight in an absolutely nonsensical manner that does not at all look like how players fight, and they teach new players unhealthy habits which leads to frustration when they enter PvP. For two, their performance is extremely inconsistent when used as drop-in teammates, pulling off ridiculous feats sometimes but usually just feeding the enemy team renown. This post will mostly refer to level 3 bots, as lower level bots are intended to be easier to beat - but level 3 bots are usually the standins for actual players. **Suggested changes** 1. Bots shouldn't fail CGB from neutral. Period. Not even level 1 bots. This teaches new players that neutral guardbreaks are viable (they are not) and makes bots far too easy to kill - currently by far the simplest way to kill bots is to camp at a ledge and just throw them off. Even level 3 bots can't CGB consistently which is a travesty. They should only fail if a player is lucky and catches their attack startup vulnerability, that's it. 2. Make bots take decisions on how to deal with an offensive move when their opponent first uses it, like players, rather than after the feint window ends. Bots are absurdly good at defense (a big reason why GB spamming them is the best option, as bots cannot punish that as easily). By making the bot decide whether to parry (or dodge, or option select, etc) before rather than after the feint window, this makes mixups more reliable in general and better replicates player behaviour. 3. Make bots deal with unreactable mixups similar to players. Currently a level 3 bot will parry about 80% of all 400ms lights used against it, even from neutral. Asking ubi to make the bots detect delayed inputs is probably too much, but I still think that if a player uses a move that is unreactable to other players, the bot should have to guess - if Orochi is using a chain light the bot should pick a random direction to make a block or parry attempt. 4. Make bots do correct punishes. This is not hard. Most punishes are very simple and you can even go for the simplest options when some are complicated, like Gladiator. This both makes bots more effective and teaches players better. No reason not to do it. No, bot, rolling away is not Conqueror's max punish on OOS throws. 5. Make bots interrupt executions and revives. Currently bots seem to never interrupt enemies who are executing which is terrible. Fix it. They also seem to often just hang back instead of interrupting revives. Make bots _focus_ on trying to interrupt these instead of ignoring them. 6. Make bots conscious of their team. If their team is breaking, they should focus on sticking with their allies. If they have an opportunity to take a point to unbreak, the bot should do it, but should withdraw if it can't do it without getting ganked. If their team can't unbreak anymore, the bot should just support its team. 6. Personal if minor gripe: Make bots only call for help if actually in trouble, such as when ganked or defending a point on low health. Currently bots seem to randomly ping for help regardless of what they are doing, which is annoying at best and distracting at worst. No, bot, you just killed and executed the only enemy within 100m of you. You don't need backup."

87,vulnerability,forhonor,The Nuxia Rework,1,dy5mr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/dy5mr5/the_nuxia_rework/,2019-11-19 03:42:04,"Nuxia Nuxia is the only Wu Lin Assasin to be introduced with Marching Fire and is frankly among the most unpopular characters in the game. With her kit, playstyle and even New Mechanic. Nuxia becomes a Hero that everyone is very intrigued with, but isnt willing to try for themselves due to her overall: lacking capability. So for Nuxia to stand on her own, I think change is necessary. But for Nuxia to be able to compete with others, she needs something that is crutial for an assasin:(in my opinion) counterattack. The Rework The way im going to Rework Nuxia is to suggest some important changes to her Foundation in order to tie her kit together in a Satisfying way. Mainly, changes to Nuxias Traps, Nuxias Counters, Nuxias Punishes and Quality of Life changes. Then finally, Ill explain an entierly New Stance for Nuxia that will allow her to conveniantly access some of her more difficult attacks as well as a Neat Addition to her capability. Buffs and Nerfs Trap - Traps effectivness is now greatly increased, opponents attacks will now have the same vulnerability to Traps as GBs - Trap indicators are now erased, and Unblockable Indicators are now utilized instead - Glass Waltz Punish is now reduced to 25 Damage Light Attacks - Nuxias light from netural is now sped up to 400 MS (from 500 MS) - Nuxias light from netural is now reduced to 11 Damage - Nuxias end of chain light is now increased to 13 Damage - Cresent Step will now have the Trap Mechanic wich results in Glass Waltz punish (enitiation = 405 MS) - Cresent Jab now has a Soft Feint into GB (enitiation = 305 MS) - Cresent Jab is now reduced to 17 Damage Heavy Attacks - All Heavies except for end of chain top, has been sped up to 700 MS - Trap enitiation and Feint timings for these Heavies are at 405 MS - End of chain top heavies speed is now reduced to 900 MS - End of chain top heavies Trap enitiation is now at 505 MS - End of chain top heavies trap will now result in a Jade Ballet Punish Zone Attack - Nuxias Zone Attack Will now have a hitbox 400 MS into the attack - Nuxias Zone Attack hitbox deals 17 Damage from 400 MS until 800 MS into the attack - Nuxias Zone Attacks damage is now increased to 30 (from 25) Deflect - Nuxia will now be able to preform the Jade Ballet punish of a successful deflect, this will have a different input. As Echo Strike will still be available Dancers Stance Dancers Stance is a completely New Addition to Nuxias kit that will bring her Mechanic from Purely Offensive, to Defensive. The enitiation into the Stance lasts 300 MS, and it places Nuxia in a stylish Ballet like Stance where she balances her entire body weight on her toes. For a visual representation, watch [this scene|URL and wait for the woman to raise her stature Dancers Stance is like a hybrid of both Fullblocks and Stances, as you can block in this Stance. In this Stance youll have a regular, non-assasin Guard in which you can use to block. Blocking a regular attack in this Stance will grant you a Glass Waltz punish. These arent the only capabilities this Stance has. Nuxia has 3 other options from this Stance. She can preform a Mirror Raid from top guard, she can preform Left or Right end of chain heavies and finally a roundhouse kick to drain stamina However, Dancers Stance has a couple of inconvenient drawbacks. From this Stance, Nuxia cant return to a Netural Standpoint without preforming one of the previously described attacks. She also doesnt have the option to parry any attacks like unblockables or even dodge any attacks like Demons Embrace. Her only option is to attempt to block something, or to attack. If you cant manage to do anything within 1500 MS, Nuxia will lose her balance and fall over. From there Nuxia will almost immediately roll back up on her feet, leaving only a 800 MS window for the enemy to punish Summary of Dancers Stance - Enitiation = 300 MS - Duration = 1500 MS - Static Guard - Glass Waltz on successfull Block - Mirror Raid from Top Guard - End of chain heavies Left or Right (Glass Waltz or Feint) - New Addition = Cobra Kick - Can reduce Trap recovery - Cant Parry - Cant Feint Stance - Cant counter guardbreak - Balance loss - 800 MS window"
88,vulnerability,forhonor,New hero Idea: Ljiodo user,1,dy71lr,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/dy71lr/new_hero_idea_lùjiǎodāo_user/,2019-11-19 05:21:30,"Hello everybody. I'm sure you are all aware by now that the wulin (oh no, wulin bad!...is that still a thing?) now only need another heavy and another assassin to be in line with the rest of the cast. I'm also sure you are well aware that there is a certain section of For Honor who want some form of Hand-to-hand combatant. Luckily, there is something that perfectly fits the idea of an assassin, AND a HtH combatant, the Ljiodo or deer horned knives. For those who don't want to search them up, they are basically two steel half circles, or crescents, that cross eachother to produce a grip. They are commonly used due to their great ability to be concealed. On top of that, they were generally used against longer weapons such as broadswords and spears, so this even satisfies the issue of putting such a short-range weapon against the longer range of characters like lawbringer. In short, these are the PERFECT weapon for an assassin Hand-to-hand combatant. Now, I bet you are wondering, ""but what would their move-set be?"" Do not fear, my fine vulcanaboo friend, for I have thought of everything! (somethings...). Firstly, I want to address my design philosophy behind this character, just to answer why certain things are where they are. You can skip these and go straight to the design, if you like. The 3 main points to address are: * Basic tools required to be viable * Unique aspect of the character to distinguish them as their own thing * The style of martial arts the character would use Okay, to start with, the recent characters and the development of the game have made me realise that for this game to work as an offensive game, each character needs certain basic tools in their kit. Heavy, light and GB are not enough. On top of those, they need some form of guaranteed bash-like damage i.e vortigers bash, nuxia's traps etc. They need a way to respond to bashes i.e shield flip, super armour, dodge attacks. And so, I have tried to include at least one of all the basics. **It is better to overload a characters kit, then remove/nerf aspects of them until they are balanced than it is to give them the minimum then be forced to change that character.** The unique aspect of the character is obvious - I could easily just remake orochi and give him a bash, but then why play orochi? There has to be something that makes you go ""this character is X, this other character is Y"". Finally, the style of the character. Deer horned knives are commonly used in Baguazhang, a soft form of martial arts that is focused a lot of circular movements and having a solid, unmovable base. As such, the character needs to be able to flow when he needs to, and become solid when he needs to. Alright, now onto the character :D Basic move set: * As with all assassins, they have reflex guard unless in **Grounded Stance** * **Yin style** \- An infinite light-light combo &amp;#x200B; * **Hidden violence** \- An infinite heavy - light combo. The heavies have special properties: 1. Each heavy in the combo is chargeable, with variable timings. The top heavy becomes unblockable near to the end, but the side heavies do not have the unblockable property at any point 2. The side heavies can be softfeinted into either a 433ms undodgeable light, that comes from the opposite side of the heavy or into **Grounded Stance.** 3. The top heavy can only be softfeinted into **Grounded stance** or hard feinted. * Zone - Character spins with both knives, hitting their target twice, with the first attack being 500ms, and the second being 566ms. You can softfeint after the first hit into **Grounded Stance.** The second part of the attack is unblockable. &amp;#x200B; * **Grounded stance** \- Activated in the same manner as hidden stance/sifu stance. While in this stance, the character gains static guard and becomes **unflinchable** i.e they gain SUPER armour (immune to bashes). You also take 30% increased damage while in this stance, or after having a move parried/gb'd from this stance. The startup has GB vulnerability, hence why you can soft feint into it. 1. The super armour is lost during attacks or while dodging. 2. You cannot parry while in this stance 3. In this stance, you gain access to new attacks and effects (explained later) 4. In compensation for the inability to parry, you gain enhanced dodging. Continuing to hold the dodge button extends the dodge duration and I-frames, up to 900ms (minimum 400ms) and has an extra stamina cost. 5. The dodge only has GB vulnerability during the 400ms startup, extended to 500ms for longer dodge.It is vulnerable to undodgeables through the entire dodge (cannot backdodge) 6. The 400ms startup can deflect, which sees the character attack with an unblockable in a wide area around them doing 25 damage. * **Grounded stance attacks** \- Grounded stance light finishers circle the character to the side of their opponent that they attack (if it hits). They cannot ledge, but is great for re-positioning away from a wall, a ledge, or in a team fight. 1. From this stance, the character has 1100ms heavy attack openers that do 35 damage. The direction the heavies come from can be changed 600ms into the attack. If the direction is changed, they only do 20 damage. They cannot be feinted if the direction is changed. 2. Starting a heavy during a dodge extends the dodge to its full duration, the attack cannot be hard feinted, but it can instead be soft feinted into an elbow strike that guarantee's 15 damage. Changing its direction turns it into an undodgeable that does 16 damage. 3. Lights after a heavy do 6 damage + 10 bleed. 4. Heavies after lights come from both sides and have variable timing. If both hit, they do 28 damage. If only 1 hits, it does 13. Feinting the attack does not cancel it, but makes the attack only come from the direction in which you have chosen (sides) and does 13 damage. &amp;#x200B; Now, the character is probably TOTALLY overloaded, but honestly as I said, its better to try and throw as many possible idea's in at once now then remove them, than to not have them at all. That, and I really think it is better for characters to have more decent options than only having 1 or 2 really really good ones (looking at you, warden). Tell me what you think. If you think its stupid, fuc...thank you, I will contemplate my terrible choices. If you think its good, tough ubi will never add this and if they do it will probably be mega gibbed or mega broken. Thanks for reading :D Tl;dr A real knifey boi with more options than a shaman on steroids."

His zone is practically useless, its either parried or deflected, only works mid combo but barely Unblockable lights are cool but theyre very easy to parry if your opponent knows the difference in the heavy and light animations even if you delay it Why am I able to be guardbroken out of my dodge attack (its not just the dodge, Ive tested it and the guard break vulnerability is up until the attack is in its strike phase) Also dont say just delay it because regardless it doesnt dodge His dodge attacks dont dodge anything, the amount of times Ive been top lighted in the middle or end of either of the dodge attacks is absurd. (This was also tested however the heavy is a bit more consistent) If you were too cut off Shugokis legs he would still dodge better than Zhanhu As a dodge specialist id expect him to dodge Nobody uses his neutral light for a reason its almost as useless as a Ford If I were to change him Id let his zone come from 2 sides, let the delay on his unblockable light be a little longer and allow his heavy to be cancelled into a dodge attack that can actually dodge Thank you for coming to my TED talk"

First of all, I do agree that Aramusha is a really hard hero to master and things can go horribly wrong if you misread your opponent. A lot of people are saying that Aramusha is a less berserker, but his kit is a lot more diverse than that of a berserker. Aramusha has: - No gb vulnerability - Almost instant full block - Fast top heavy attack - High damage side heavy attacks - One of the most useful zones in the game (imo only glad's zone is better) I find that by alternating full block and parries, it's really hard for the opponent to react accordingly. If people think you're gonna full block, they will heavy feint into gb. If you try to parry at this time, you will have a guaranteed hit cause of the no vulnerability. I feel like Aramusha is one of the most misunderstood hero's in the game with amazing defense. It's really hard to master though, which I believe, causes all of the hate people have for Aramusha. Adding anything else to Aramusha will most likely result into Aramusha being way too OP. What do you guys think, is Aramusha pretty decent right now or do you guys think he really needs a rework? If so, what should be reworked?"

Strong in a way because when he hits you, he hits you hard, yet weak because he has no openers and without lag or flickering guards he's gonna have a pretty hard time hitting anyone! So, after some thought I've come up with a few quality of life changes for Aramusha, that I think are needed. **Without going any further, I want to thank you all for reading and ""any"" feedback is welcome** My goal here is to: \- Make Aramusha more versatile; \- Give him more options; \- Balance speed and damage; \- Other. I don't want to change his chains, meaning that the whole **top/side/top/side** **\*Tempest\*** thing will stay as it is. Although: \- Neutral Side Heavies can be soft feinted to a Light Attack either to Top or the opposite Side (just like his ""Deadly Feint""); \- (Mid Chain) Top Light is Enhanced (meaning they don't bounce off if blocked); Another change would be to his **\*Rushing Wind\*** **(Alternate)** (Dodge Forward Side Heavy): \- Has Undodgeable properties (to better catch rolls and more pressure); \- Can be soft feinted to a Light Attack from the opposite side; \- Can be soft feinted to a kick (same kick from Blade Blockade and it will push the enemy away and even wall splat and/or ledge just like it does in BB) if the kick connects with the enemy it can be chained to an Unstoppable Heavy from any guard. Although, only the Top Heavy is guaranteed and acts like a chain starter; it will teleport Aramusha to the enemy (just like the ""teleport"" from the Sprint Attack) (the animation of the attack is like the one from the Dodge Forward Top Heavy, **with a teleport**); The teleport also applies to the Side Heavies, although this one counts as a chain finisher, so it can chain to the **Deadly Feint** mix up (but it's also guaranteed if the kick wall splats); \- Since it's an Heavy Attack (even with all the changes I said) obviously they can all be hard feinted like all Heavy Attacks; **\*Guard Break:\*** \- Top Light Attack will be changed to the **Ring the Bell**; You can still throw the enemy after doing that; **\*Blade Blockade:\*** \- Kick, will now have the mix up I described above; \- Ring the Bell, will also make you able to throw the enemy just like in the guard break; **\*Damage/Speed Changes:\*** \- Top Neutral Light - 15dmg; \- Top Chain Light - 17dmg; \- Side Neutral Light - 15dmg; \- Side Chain Light - 15dmg; \- Chain Heavies - 30dmg (any side); \- All Heavy Chain Finishers will do 45dmg; \- Deadly Feint Speed nerf - 400ms to 433ms; \- Deadly Feint Damage: Side - 20dmg to 17dmg; Top - 15dmg to 17dmg; \- Ring the Bell - 15dmg to 12dmg; **\*Standard Changes\*** \- Heavy Attacks have the same Guard Break vulnerability like ""all"" heroes.

Basically, it would work a bit like gb vulnerability timings on heavies. If the attack is a light, or a super fast heavy/zone (like warden, kensei first hit, etc...) it would be a minimal reduction (like 10-15%) while if the attack ate a mediocare speed heavy or zone (like lb-s zone) it would be a mediocare damage reduction (like 40-50%) and if it ate a slower heavy (like raider, lb, warlord...) it would get a greater reduction (70-80%) to make failing a parry less rewarding, making heby on red, practically impossible, while keeping hyperarmors tanking features.

You can continue your chain. - Rushing wind can be soft feinted into blade blockade. -Top heavy now deals 30 damage and no longer guaranteed after a heavy parry. -Light attacks are enhanced. -Top heavy blade blockade is guaranteed. -Reduce zone stamina cost and you can soft feint the zone second part into either guard brake or deadly feint.

I'm back with, in my opinion, a more fleshed out version of that post. From what I understand her main issues are: **Issue 1) Lackluster lights.** Due to the nature of her animations and stance, her lights (and their direction) are much easier than other heroes to distinguish between her heavies and thus react to accordingly. **Issue 2) Niche underused heavies.** Like the animation issue lights have, heavies are underused and currently limited to the purpose of wall splats, feinting for gb and oos knockdown punish. **Issue 3) Escapable mix-ups**. HS mix ups can be negated by back dodge on reaction to HS. **Issue 4) No openers.** Because of issues 1-3 Nobushi has no real way to open an opponent. She is lacking in ways to force an opponent to make a decision that can be punished, and a knowledgeable opponent knows this. This causes her to turtle and play defensive. **Issue 5) Lackluster offense.** Because of issues 1-4 blocking puts an end to most of her light offense and heavies are too predictable and niche in utility. Lack of un-dodgeable and un-blockable attacks means aside from the kick, an opponent has no need to dodge (though safe to do so), and no need to attempt a parry as there is no forced choice to parry or dodge. **(possibly) Issue 6) Bleed mechanics**. Bleed is a mixed bag, some dont see any issue, others hate the mechanic altogether. While Im in the first camp because Im a biased Nobushi main, I can still understand the frustration of it. And so, I would like to offer up one solution that I actually really like that may bridge the gap and make the bleed mechanic more fun to engage with. \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So, it is my understanding that addressing these issues will help to bring Nobushi to a healthier state of balance. First, I'd like to explain my personal understanding/vision of Nobushi and her play style, this is what has informed my philosophy for the changes Ive come up with. In my opinion (in no small part formed by the framework set by Ubisoft), my own experience with the character and by the comments Ive read by other players. Nobushi is primarily a defensive ranged character, and by that, I mean it seems to be implied that she should be at her best or most effective when keeping an opponent(s) at a distance. This is supported by her long-range weapon and up until recently her back dodge on block move. I've seen other players describe her style as fluid-like, and that her moveset should flow together elegantly, and I would agree with these descriptions. These core aspects seem crucial to keep as it is part of her identity. But this also seems to create the issue where we're unsure of how to balance her as we don't want characters to be so effective at range and to be too safe at defense. One solution I think may be worth engaging with is an idea of a more fluid offense/defense dynamic. To explain further, Nobushi should have more offensive opportunity (in the form of an opener) at a distance but that opportunity is weakened when an opponent gets in close. When an opponent is close she must use her defensive tools to either temporarily but indirectly improve her offensive odds or regain distance. The overarching idea is that Nobushi's style would have her flowing between a good offensive opener at a distance to a weaker offense up close, one leading to the other, the other leading back, a continuous loop. If Im incorrect so far or at any point in my post by all means call me a dumb dumb and if you have the time, correct me. If it means anything, I'm rep 52 with Nobushi on Xbox One. By no means am I a pro or very good, I would consider my self average. But I think that even less skilled voices are worth listening to, even if they only help to springboard better ideas from more knowledgeable/skilled players. And as a reminder, anything I say is obviously open to constructive criticism and I am in no way cemented on any of these suggestions. If you like most of something but think a small part needs to be tweaked in another direction, or if you dislike most of something but do like a small part of it and think it would be better used elsewhere or applied differently please say so. I will try not to make any suggestions on damage numbers as I think that would be better suited for someone with more expertise on the subject and I dont want criticism to focus on numbers and instead the concepts presented, numbers can always be adjusted, but number changes won't necessarily fix an under performing kit. With that all in mind here is what I suggest: **1) A feintable forward dodge heavy attack.** This would be her go to offensive attack, one that makes her offense great at a distance and the start of her flow. This attack could be both hard feinted to return to neutral or soft feinted into HS. What I am unsure about is if it is better that the attack be unblockable or undodgeable, feedback is greatly welcomed here. **For the sake of moving forward let's assume it's an unblockable.** This attack attempts to address issues 3, 4 and 5. **Issue 3**: The attack closes the gap created by the mix up negation that back dodge on reaction to HS offers her opponents. **Issue 4 &amp; 5**: The attacks unblockable property forces the opponent to react in a way other than blocking, creating an opening. A reaction that can be punished with the added ability to feint. **CONS** \-**This move would have a fair bit of gb vulnerability on start-up, therefore it is a very risky borderline useless move to up close.** It is a move that plays to her strength at range but loses its power when an opponent gets in. \-**It may be fair for the attack to have a 2  4 second stamina delay**. Since it isnt designed to be used at the high frequency that HS was, the delay shouldnt be very noticeable or debilitating. **2) Deflects that ""stunning tap""** IIRC, Nobushi is a hybrid of a vanguard and an assassin, so the introduction of a deflect isn't too out of character. \-This attack would do 0 damage as its goal is to be another tool in her belt to indirectly improve her offense. **Aesthetically, this move may look cool as a blunt strike to her opponents ear with the back end of her naginata.** \-Like HS this attack acts as the first attack in a chain. \-These suggestions attempt to solve issues 1, 2, 4, and 5: **Issue 1:** The animation of her lights and her obvious stances reduce the viability of her lights and make them easy to block and parry. Speeding them up is not a fun way to balance and changing animations to hide them seems overly time consuming and do not add complexity to kit the way deflects could. Deflects that stun her opponent and hide her indicator work along the same lines as her new HS ability to hide the first 100 ms of lights. This also fits into my belief that while her base offense up close should be weaker, her defensive tools should indirectly improve her offense temporarily. **Issue 2:** Because it acts as the first attack in a chain it can be followed up with the heavy finisher with could be feinted into gb. This doesn't change the utility of her heavies but does add to her access of them. **Issue 4 &amp; 5:** While this change wouldnt be a true opener, the stunning effect indirectly could improve her offensive odds up close increasing the chance of landing a light (and it would be the second light of a chain which would guarantee the third). **3) Enhanced lights and extended back dodge when an opponent blocks her heavy attacks** As I said earlier, the offensive she should have up close would primarily be weaker in neutral like it is currently. Her defensive tools like the new deflect would be a way to temporarily improve her offensive opportunity to either remain up close or to regain distance. I liked the concept of her back dodge on block but from what I understand and have experienced it didn't work as intended or at all really. While I was sad to see both dodge on block and light feint to HS get scrapped instead of improved, I think with enhanced lights and an option to back dodge when *her* heavies are blocked can address some issues while at the same time being an improvement on what was scrapped. **Enhanced lights** As we've established her lights are relatively easy to deal with due to her animations/body position that give away the direction. The loss of light feints means when any light comes out an opponent knows its legit and will react accordingly which further compounds **issue 1**. at best, one block ends her light offense and returns to neutral, and at worse she's parried and punished. Enhanced lights attempt to address issues 1, 2 and 5 **Issue 1:** As said before lights are lackluster and block shuts down her offense. Enhanced lights indirectly improve her light offense by raising the bar for what it takes to shut her down. With still no extra properties, as an opponent all you need to do is block. Keep blocking and she still wont be able to open you with lights alone. **Issue 2:** With enhanced lights Nobushi has more access to her L-H chain, this doesnt change the current niche use of heavies but does allow more access to them. **Issue 5:** Enhanced lights let Nobushi continue her offensive pressure when an opponent is content with simply blocking. She isnt guaranteed any hits, her lights arent any faster and they have no unblockable or undodgeable properties. She is simply better rewarded for an opponents bare minimum defensive actions. \-Now if this sounds overpowered when the other suggestions are taken into account perhaps a middle ground can be found. One possible way to do this is to make enhanced lights only available to Nobushi when her opponent is bleeding. **Back dodge on blocked heavies** The suggested changes above have all been ways to indirectly improve Nobushis offensive opportunities up close. If Nobushi would rather regain distance, shell need a tool designed for that. This move is primarily inspired by her previously scrapped move that allowed her to back dodge when she blocked an attack, however, now it is accessed when her heavies are blocked. I think this is a healthier and more purposeful way to include this move. \-Whereas before, the back dodge was awarded for being defensive (blocking). **Now Nobushi is rewarded for being offensive.** \-If possible it may be interesting to have to input the dodge on contact with the block almost like a defensive parry. Additionally, she could be knocked down for a punish if parried when attempting to use the dodge. So in other words, if Nobushi is intending to dodge on the block she would input dodge when she is expecting to make contact with the block (sort of like a parry). But if the opponent parries then she is knocked down. If that is too convoluted then just scrap this particular mechanic and leave it simply as a dodge after an opponent blocks. \-When successful this move completes the flow and returns Nobushi to a safe distance in which she can access her forward heavy dodge opener. \-This would be included as a follow up to sidewinder (side dodge heavy) \- Like enhanced lights this move attempts to raise the bar for what it takes to stop her offense. If all youre going to do is block, something I think many would agree is relatively easy against Nobushi (an opponent with no property infused attacks aside from her kick). Then your passivity rewards Nobushi with access to more of her offense. \- As i'll mention in the cons, this move is gb vulnereable. Nobushi can punish the gb attempt with vipers retreat or kick. If I understand correctly, this would be a mix up. This move attempts to address issues 1,2, 4 and 5. **Issue 1:** Like the other changes Ive mentioned that attempt to indirectly improve her offense, this is a move that doesnt intend to improve the overt offensiveness or ease of her offense but rather their utility. **Issue 2:** Heavies are underused because theyve fallen into niche purposes, their animations make them easier to block and parry. The removal of guaranteed kick from heavies out of HS further reduced their utility. This move may act somewhat as a spiritual successor, while it wont guarantee anything, and an opponent isn't punished for blocking, *it does put the onus on the opponent to do more than block if they want to stop her offense and keep her close.* **Issue 4 &amp; 5:** Similar to the explanation given for issue 1. This move acts a way to indirectly improve her offense utility by taking control of the fight and her positioning if her opponent is content with only blocking. **\*\*Cons\*\*** \-This move would be gb vulnereable. **4) ineffective and underused heavies.** As stated many times before, Nobushis heavies currently serve the purpose of feinting into gb, knockdown punish or when she wall splats an opponent. The added change of enhanced lights improves her access and utility of L-H chain and back dodge on her heavies that are blocked help to improve their utility and urgency for an opponent to do more than just block them. As heavies currently stand knowledgeable opponents also know to expect heavy feint to gb, so they are likely to not dodge because theyre already expecting the feint before she even inputs it meaning Nobushi struggles to open them up. Here is one solution: **Heavy cancel to top light combo finisher.** This would work mechanically similarly to PKs heavy cancel to light stab attack. This attack would be another indirect improvement to her offense and addresses **Issue 2** by increasing the utility of her heavies by decreasing the predictability of what shes going to do after the startup of a heavy. Light combo finisher does 2 damage and 12 bleed damage. So, it would do very little \*permanent damage and more of a bleed stacker. I may misunderstand PK's use of her version of this attack so I want to explain that with Nobushi this attack is parry-able. Nobushi is labeled as ""hard"" so I don't want her moves to have anything guaranteed apart from what she already has. \*Now I say permanent damage because the next suggestion is one way to fundamentally change how Nobushis bleed works. **5) Offensive pressure stops the bleeding, any attack a bleeding opponent throws that hits Nobushi or is blocked by her will replace 1 tick of bleed with health.** What this means is when a Nobushi stacks on the bleed, you as an opponent can stop the bleeding by**applying pressure!** Jokes aside, I think this could be an alternative approach to the bleed mechanic, it gives Nobushi clear motive to either stay on the offensive to capitalize her way of the shark passive or to regain distance to let the bleed run its course. But it also discourages Nobushi from turtling up as simply blocking attacks will replace the bleed shes inflicted with returned health. Nobushi is then more inclined to dodge, HS or parry her opponents offense, opening her up to punish. IIRC Nobushis bleed attacks currently give 4 ticks of 3 damage, a total of 12 bleed damage. So right after she applies bleed, the opponent has a short time to mitigate that damage as best they can. If she dodges or parries the attack, then the bleed stays. \-As an example, lets say Nobushi applies 12 bleed and then blocks 2 attacks from her opponent and nothing happens after. Her opponent will gain 6 health back because they changed 2 ticks of 3 bleed damage each back to health. So, instead of taking 12 bleed damage the opponent only takes 6. \-Note that this doesnt grant extra health but only transforms queued bleed damage back into health. An opponent who has 1 tick of bleed remaining and does 3 attacks that are blocked or hit will only gain 3 health back. \-This would apply to any bleed gained. So if an opponent gained bleed from a Shaman and then attacked a Nobushi, this mechanic still applies. **In theory, upon the application of bleed the intensity of a fight would increase. Bleed would be less of a major threat while at the same time creating more opportunity for Nobushi to use her defensive and offensive tools to both avoid her opponent and apply more bleed. This is because a bleeding opponent is now more inclined to up their offense to stop the bleeding. This may also change how 4s are played because now in a gank the opponent has more incentive to, and benefits health wise from, placing focus on Nobushi to stop the bleed shes been applying on the sidelines.** &amp;#x200B; Thank you for taking the time to read!

I went and dug these out, thinking they might be of use to us fanboys waiting for the new release. What with the new Wulin hero likely to debut on Halloween, I thought I might share these with you all, as I think they could give you a taste of what Ubisoft might be trying to capture with the new hero. The first video is from Scott Rodell, the inheritor of the Yang School and one of the best English-speaking sources on Chinese swordsmanship. He is exceptionally knowledgeable on antique blades, and used to have an antique auction house specializing in rare antique Chinese daos and jian. His video is filled with informative historical data for the first half, and demonstrations during the second half (4:57). URL The second video is a pure demonstration form, but it's really informative when taken into account with the previous and following videos that display much of the chang-dao, miao-dao, and yue-fei-dao technique involve setting up a ""vulnerability stance"" then rapidly counterstriking once the oopponent has taken the bait. While it's purely a practice form, or 'kata', it's great to watch and see potential that Ubisoft might take into implementation for their hero. URL The third video is a slower form display, but I included it here because it helps to see the techniques in a slower pace, to understand where the rotational redirections occur in the course of the movement. URL Also- I highly recommend u/DeadR4NG3R 's post on another training manual video, with Chinese and English translations. URL"
110,vulnerability,forhonor,Proposed rocksteady change,3,co2o87,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/co2o87/proposed_rocksteady_change/,2019-08-09 23:52:52,"We all hate rocksteady. It's a pain in the ass that you constantly have to watch out for. It keeps us from using normal defensive methods and numerous ways to increase damage. Meaning the user of the feat needs to put almost zero thought into positioning and tactics. Worse yet it entirely nullifies certain parts of certain character's kits. Highlander's caber toss is nullified for some odd reason, and cent relies extremely heavily on wallsplats. We all agree that it needs a change, and many of us rightfully believe it should just be removed. But, it's not likely it will be removed because of the necessity to find a new feat to replace it with. So, we need a way to nerf it to make it fair. Here is my proposal: give it a cooldown. Much like warden's thick blooded feat, which gives immunity to bleed damage once every few seconds before having a short period of vulnerability. That is a bit more of a situational ability, as opposed to rocksteady's universal application of reducing enemy damage output. So there is no reason why rock steady shouldn't be given a cooldown of some sort. Hopefully along the lines of 6 seconds or so. That could potentially save an enemy from a single oos punish, but then leave them vulnerable to a second one if the attacker manages to do so. Or to a second ganker, that may attempt a wall splat of their own. If there's a decently long cooldown, it'll act more like a second chance, and not entirely cripple all offensive punishes. It won't fix cent's issue with it, but he has deep-rooted problems that can't be fixed so simply."
111,vulnerability,forhonor,What does Nobushi need?,4,cq3qgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/cq3qgz/what_does_nobushi_need/,2019-08-14 12:57:19,"Hello, I was hoping to create a dialogue with suggestions on how to improve Nobushi. From what I understand her main issues are: 1) Due to the animations of her character her lights are quite easy to see and react to accordingly. 2) No real openers. 3) HS mix ups can be negated by back dodge on reaction to HS. 4) Lack of undodgeable and unblockable attacks means her offense can be shut down by blocking. If i'm incorrect so far by all means call me a dumb dumb and if you have the time, correct me. If there's more to add let me know and I can add to this or change the language to be more accurate. If it means anything I'm rep 50 with Nobushi on xbox one. To understand my reasoning for the changes I will suggest, here is my opinion on Nobushi's play style: She is primarily a defensive ranged character, by that I mean she is at her best when keeping an opponent away. I've seen other players describe her style as fluid-like, which I would agree. This is important because I think this should inform her offense/defense. IMO she should have a good offensive range that weakens when an opponent gets in. With that in mind here is what I suggest: \*\*(and as a reminder, anything I say is obviously open to constructive criticism and I am in no way cemented on any of the suggestions. If you like most of something but think a small part needs to be tweaked in another direction, or if you dislike most of something but do like a small part of it and think it would be better used elsewhere or applied differently please say so)\*\* 1) \*\*A feintable forward dodge heavy attack.\*\* This attack could be both hard feinted to return to neutral or soft feinted into HS). What I am unsure about is if it is better that the attack be unblockable or undodgeable, feedback is greatly welcomed here. But the general idea of this opener move would be for Nobushi to 1. close the gap (stop the back dodge negation of her HS mix up). The feint option allows her to mix up her approach/reaction to her opponent's response to the incoming attack. And depending on if its unblockable or undodgeable would force the opponent to select an option that isn't simply block or back dodge. \*\*CON\*\* \-This move would have a fair bit of gb vulnerability on start up, therefore it is a risky move to use up close. It is a move that plays to her strength at range but loses its power up close. This would be an interesting opener as it both forces a reaction for Nobushi to punish but once used she is now up close, requiring her to use her defense to regain distance. This is the beginning of the flow, at a distance she can initiate offensive pressure but regardless if she is successful or not, she is now up close. \-Also this move could possibly have the 3-4 second stamina delay on the attack. I can see the possibility of this attack being abused by Nobushi's back dodging and rolling to regain that distance, (while the backdodge roll was somewhat fixed I still see people able to use it to get away) so this delay could help to make using it and back dodge rolling just a complete waste of stamina. when used correctly this delay wont cause much issue as its designed for Nobushi to get in, get damage, use defensive tools to regain distance. 2) \*\*the concept of 100 ms hidden indicators\*\* The introduction of a 100ms hidden indicator for lights out of HS are cool, what thoughts would you have about applying that to all her lights based on the proximity of her opponent. I wouldn't know the exact meters but perhaps at the peak distance of her light's reach? Nothing would change regarding the speed of her lights, however at that peak distance the 100ms hidden indicator would be another way of playing to her strength at range. And it gives another incentive to the opponent to get in close. I can understand if spaghetti code would make this a nightmare to implement so if its hot garbage of an idea then toss it. 3) \*\*Back dodge when an opponent blocks her light opener\*\* (maybe enhanced light opener as well?) The previous suggestions were ways to improve her offense at a distance and I want to mostly keep her offense up close less effective. The offensive she should have up close should be supplementary tools for her to regain range. I liked the concept of her back dodge on block but from what I understand and have experienced it didn't work as intended. I was sorry to see it (along with light feint to HS) just get scrapped instead of improved. So I think with an enhanced light opener and an option to back dodge when her light openers are blocked can provide Nobushi with 2 things a) A clear but not completely safe move designed to regain distance b) Back dodge on blocked lights means while an opponent could just block the attack, if they do nothing after, Nobushi is able to regain distance. Meaning this would give greater incentive for her to use her lights not so much as an overtly offensive tool (cuz they ain't good at that) but as a tool to regain distance. It rewards an offensive action (light attack) on a defensive action (block). The opponent must do more than passively block her lights and instead try to parry them to get an advantage or block and figure out what she plans to do next. c) why enhanced light opener? the reason I think they would be a useful addition is because it allows for Nobushi to not have her already poor offense be negated by a block. Additionally, enhanced light opener would create a mix up situation in which the opponent, having just blocked a light opener, is now faced with a choice to either attempt a gb to catch her attempt at a back dodge or kick, or block/parry the second light coming in the chain. Without them, what the dodge on blocked lights means for an opponent would be to always gb after blocking a light because at best they catch her dodging and at worse they get cgb'd and return to neutral. Enhanced lights do little to improve her offense thanks to her telegraphed animations but they do indirectly improve her offense by providing opportunity to regain distance. \*\*Con\*\* \-This move would be gb vulnerable, and because the kick has 100 ms start up gb vulnerability a reactionary gb attempt would catch both back dodge or kick. I'm unfamiliar with the more technical number side of things but if this dodge move was 200 ms gb vulnerable on start up and the kick has 100ms gb vulnerable then perhaps it creates a situation where a gb attempt on reaction to blocking Nobushi's light would catch both the back dodge or the kick, while a delayed attempt to gb would still catch the dodge but would miss the window to catch the kick. and a gb attempt would be beat by the second light. What I imagine is this creates a scenario where if an opponent gb's right away they either successfully gb and punish the attempted dodge/kick, or they get hit by light, light. I could be wrong but this does sound like a 50/50 and from what I can tell these are either perceived as bad or okay. Perhaps this is different though because it is on the opponent to decide to risk the 50/50 rather than the player forcing the choice. Because if the opponent decides not to gb right away (decides against participating in the 50/50) they would instead wait to either attempt to parry the second light, dodge the kick for a gb, or let Nobushi regain distance (return to neutral). And of course they could also attempt an attack to close the distance. And Nobushi could answer with a HS attempt or vipers retreat etc. Thank you for taking the time to read, thank you for any and all constructive criticism. Again in no way am I locked on these suggestions and I do not even consider them fully fleshed or a final draft, I welcome you to pick them apart, change them, scrap them etc. nor do I think they're a packaged deal that must all be implemented together. You may disagree with this philosophy but I think getting ideas out in the open even if they do not hold up, can still be of value as they have the potential to spark new ideas through dialogue. By that I mean you might read others or my suggestions and think it won't work, but because you engaged with it, it could give you an new idea that has yet to be considered. I simply like the idea that Nobushi is intended to have a good offense at her preferred distance and a weaker offense when up close. Up close her defense options and weaker offense would be used to regain her distance to allow her the use of her heavy dodge opener. Thus creating a flow between using offensive tools that close the gap and defensive tools to recreate the gap to start the cycle over again. With that said, what are your thoughts? is back dodge off a blocked light stupid? Would it be better if its accessed through one of her heavies being blocked instead? Should the forward dodge heavy be unblockable? undodgeable? neither? Should I stick to lurking instead? Lets discuss :)"

He hasn't had an offense except for slide tackle, which has also been neutered and is reactable and struggles to reach people half the time (falls short). Here's a list of problems with Shinobi. He's slow, interruptible, bait-able and REACTABLE dodge attacks being 1200ms or slower and having 700ms+ of GB vulnerability. No offense. No health. Shitty fundamentals because of double dodge, making him slow and ineffective both offensively and defensively. No chase-down, despite being a ranged character. He's extremely high risk and above average reward for defense, and no reward for offense. Try dealing damage when you have revenge, you can't. Contrary to popular belief, he has shitty defense now that he can't back-walk out of GB range consistently. His option selects are high risk and risk a max punish to counter with range GB because the window is tighter and the slightest latency requires you throw a range GB on read to parry attempt and counter a GB. And he's almost always vulnerable to GB except for zone parry, which is low damage (15), or this high risk (max punish) read, otherwise he's completely vulnerable to GB with everything he does, parry or dodge attack. There's virtually no risk in trying to bait a shinobi, you might eat a couple low damage zones, but it's not enough to kill anyone before help arrives because of how much stamina it uses. Shinobi is supposed to be a glass cannon and a fundamentally strong counter attacker. He's only strong in terms of damage, his fundamentals are shit and there's no justification for it. He should have strong offense and defense, every hero should, but even more so for shinobi because he's supposed to compensate for low health by being awesome, fast, mobile, and fun to play, but he's not, he's slow and he's shit. And he should be outputting some of the highest damage but now gets outclassed by valk on deflects and LB on parries, both of which have more health and more fundamentally sound and can actually move and dodge safely with fundamentally 100ms gb vulnerable dodge attacks. Imagine LB's dodge shove being 1200ms from neutral and you could GB him out of it on REACTION to his dodge, or feint GB beat it every-time. That's what happens to Shinobi's kick. It sounds completely ridiculous when you apply his shitty fundamentals to characters who aren't hated. The only exception is being able to dodge out of range, which is rare and now a very small window. Imagine getting max punished for having a heavy parried even when you have stamina. (ranged heavy counter in range). Again, sounds completely absurd when it isn't in the context of a hated heroes kit. That's like warden doing his dodge heavy and falling to the ground to be vulnerable for a one shot in a gank. Nobody would play warden if that happened. Nobody plays shinobi because he's so vulnerable. He was designed to be easily killed if you caught him, but the catch was he was hard to catch and had all these fundamental problems that were just okay if you stayed out of range. Now he's easy as fuck to catch and can't maintain range, but still has this absurdly shitty downsides, wtf. He can't attack, he can't dodge or even move. He just has to stare at you or run away. That's not fighting, that's just dying or prolonging your death, or occasionally ganking, but still not having the best ganks, just the ganks that piss people off the most (range GB). Be pissed off, piss people off and die or try not to die. That's your experience with Shinobi. Just give the man single dodge attacks already. Double dodge is a gimmick that taxes stamina, time, and viability. Single dodge forward kick would make a decent offense. Single side dodge kick would make a strong defense. Making him strong offensively and defensively. It's really that simple. You have to make a HARD read to counter with double dodge and risk a GB or dare to attempt to open with the kick without being interrupted. And now that you can't properly space with back-flip or distancing with back-walking, it's even more rare you get the spacing you need to safely go into your dodging options because the opponent can simply react to your startup dodge with a GB and interrupt all your dodge attacks. You're supposed to be the most mobile character in the game and you can't even move or dodge attack reliably. You can't have an offense with the lowest health. And you don't even have the best punishes or ganks to justify all the downsides. LB is virtually better in every-way than Shinobi. Faster from neutral, better punishes, almost twice the health, solid guard, better ganks. And LB isn't even an OP hero. He's balanced, has the best punishes and has minimal offense for new meta standards and he's legitimately twice as good as shinobi. Faster and fundamentally safer dodge attacks, that's a big one I almost forgot to mention. The game has literally been rigged against Shinobi for the past 3+ seasons and there has been no buffs or compensation to the hero. I don't consider a feint-able zone or 1000ms reflex guard ""buffs"". That's just standard shit that people expected on day 1. I don't think it's right to completely gut a hero and leave him in the worst spot in the game. Other characters didn't get this treatment (Raider). Shinobi was in a very similar spot to Raider pre rework. His defense was too strong, and his ganking was too good, but he had no offense of his own. What you did to Shinobi would be the equivalent of the Raider rework being the nerf to his tackle and dodge GB, without buffing ST in anyway and leaving him with no offense. Which seems ridiculous, but that's exactly what happened to Shinobi and he has a lot more flaws on top of that such as raider still would of had a better dodge attack even with ST at 600ms, because it's twice as fast as a buffered 1200ms dodge attack from Shinobi..... It's fucking ridiculous. I've been playing this game since launch without more than a 2 week break since, pretty much only playing Shinobi as my main, because that's the only hero I want to play, I occasionally play BP or LB, but I'm not playing the game just for them. And now the game is literally unplayable. I'll be sitting here bored asf in my free time just avoiding FH because I'll play 1-3 games, get pissed and quit. It ruins my day and mood if I even open this game, and this game is honestly designed to instill mental illness in the way it's designed. Like fucking seriously, I've had my family murdered irl and this is the shit that pisses me off. That I have no fair escape and distraction because it's all bullshit politics everywhere you go. Everyone hates Shinobi, so he's going to be shit and nobody cares. After 2+ years of playing this game and it not even being that good of an experience, and it's just been frustrating and constantly waiting to wait until the next patch to wait some more just to get gutted, fucking raped and tossed in a ditch to die. Shit needed to improve for Shinobi and it go so much worse. I waited fucking 2 and half years for this patch and to finally have a good experience with this character and it's not even a slap in the face, it's fucking skull raping mind fuck. Every patch has literally been designed towards nerfing Shinobi without compensation. Ever since gear stats were removed, which disproportionately nerfed assassins vs solid guard heroes and buffed bash heroes with the revenge changes. The ridiculous uncalled for nerf to Yama Uba that was undocumented and didn't even show up in the patch notes. Almost every escape nerf and just the obvious gutting of everything Shinobi. You think Shinobi mains have enjoyed playing him and being forced to play like a little bitch all the time to have a chance at winning? And now it's not even possible and he's gutted at top tier. We haven't enjoyed the forced play-style before the nerfs, and we definitely don't enjoy the play-style now when he's forced to be shit."

How dare I say that shino wasn't op/broken or whatever... So my point here is that taking away shino's capability to fight 1v1 won't solve 4v4 problems. As far as I'm concerned people found shino annoying in 4v4 since grab is not shown (for whatever reason) when it's exterior and sickle rain was uninterruptable. I totally get that and be it, nerf 'em. But if you take away ALL his HA then he will be completely useless in 1v1. If someone is just spamming light chains that even REMOTELY track you are f-d (this is a real problem since ubi is kinda trigger happy with adding 400 ms lights to heavies and such). HOWEVER I think if they would reverse the ridiculously low range on backflip (still no HA on that) and gave kicks a smaller HA and bigger startup vulnerability window, FIXED the exterior gb indicator, then I think noone would complain. DISCLAIMER: this is purely my opinion, of course it won't be popular since not many play shino, however I think this nerf is exaggerated. Shino is good as dead in 1v1."

It never works in mixups at higher level and therefore gets left in the dust. Additionally, remove guardbreak vulnerability from it, cant tell you all how many times Ive been canceled out of that move simply because the enemy lost their physical barrier of friction and decided to glide over and guardbreak me. Storm Rush: Add the ability to softfeint into gb to catch dodgers out or softfeint into any dodge attack, including into normal dodges allowing for easier transition into a deflect. Additionally, the side attacks from Storm Rush could be unblockable, as they are quite reactable and easy to counter (at least on PC). Unblockable top heavy chain finisher: Kinda like Wardens this one, it would add some OOS pressure as well as make Orochi better with ganks, while also opening up turtles and more possibilities to land a deflect. Thats all. Obviously I would argue about adding a sort of kick to counter turtles or a stance of some sort. But lets be honest here, Ubi would never add those because... Ubisoft. These are just changes that I think are in the realm of possibility that would also make Orochi more viable in 1v1s at least, since they want him to be a duelist anyway. What do you think of these?"

Its a good start but i hope they address some issues and not just speed up his attacks and call it a day. Dodge light - has 400ms(?) Gb vulnerability on startup? I dont know how fast the attack is but why in gods name does it have such high gb vulnerability? I tested this on a raider where he softfeints the heavy after tap to gb, i was completely unsuccessful in using either of gladiators dodge attacks as they where just gb'd Deflect - i believe it still bounces of hyper armour, why? Some people say that you should know when to deflect etc. But orochi has 2 deflects (light/heavy) that can interrupt hyper armour and nobody complains about orochis getting easy deflects through hyper armour Toe stab - so they made the heavy after oos toe stab unsafe as you see in freeze's recent video, this one baffles me as the total damage would be 40 (toe stab plus heavy) which when compared to characters like warden who also has a 40 damage bash (which is far better than the toe stab) i dont really see why they made it unsafe, i know that you can follow up with anorher toe stab but that can be punished as well Overall his rework is decent as there are a lot of quality of life changes that gladiator needed e.g. no 600ms lights, but there still needs to be some work done.

Her only offensive move, the hidden stance heavy in to kick, has been removed, and her strong defence which made up for her horrible offence has also been stripped. Simply because bleed can stack, means nothing when the damage has been severely nerfed, and her offence totally gimped, save for slightly faster lights and better combo heavies. I was hoping she would receive some much better offence, perhaps an undodgeable or unblockable to work with her kick, in compensation for her Hidden Stance being removed; there is no point in using the move now with the GB vulnerability added, and the fact it still drains stamina. Overall, I'm greatly disappointed, but I hope that when this 'improved' Nobushi is released that Ubi reviews her state again, to avoid her ending up like Peacekeeper."

These changes that were meant to make nobushi MORE competitive have now completely removed all her offense options. Sure there are some nice changes like the light attack speed buffs and other things but why one the HELL did they think she needed a damage nerf?! I dont understand the thought process behind these changes. I know this post wont do much but Im hoping a developer sees this and keeps it in mind for the future, when rebalancing a character like nobushi, you dont have to change a lot, all she needed were some minor changes, you dont have to nerf and buff or change every part of her move set. Removing guaranteed kick on heavy block was the only opener option nobushi had, and in an attempt to improve her, you removed it. I can understand The gb vulnerability on hs but that plus damage nerfs, plus removal of kick on heavy block, plus what ever else was there will probably make me quit playing this character. It really is a shame, my face lit up when I saw changes coming to nobushi, now I guess Ill just main orochi since he got speed buffs and I play on console.

127,vulnerability,forhonor,How the guard break changes will help every hero (probably).,46,ci10u6,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/ci10u6/how_the_guard_break_changes_will_help_every_hero/,2019-07-26 20:10:30,"In case you don't know what changes I'm referring to: **From PATCH NOTES 2.11.0** All Rolls are now vulnerable to Guard Break from 0ms  333ms (from 0ms  300ms) Dodge is now vulnerable to Guard Break from 0ms-633ms (from 0ms  600ms) Branching from Dodge to Roll can now only be performed between 300ms-400ms (from 300ms  500ms) Guard Break immediately after a Feint is now 300ms (from 400ms) This is HUGE. I'll explain how this change will affect each individual hero if it works as expected/intended: **Warden:** * Top heavy unblock able will actually be a decent move now, since opponents will no longer be able to safely early dodge it every time, giving him a solid secondary opener. * Shoulder Bash is now even more god tier, feint to GB will work more consistently and the roll catcher will need to be used less often. **Conqueror:** * This change won't affect him all that much, however forward dodge into GB mixup will now be more consistent. **Peacekeeper:** * The guard break changes won't really affect her all that much. Her soft feint to GB was already doing a solid job of beating dodges. **Lawbringer:** * Get ready to hear a lot more of **AD MORTEM INUMICUS**, because this move will now actually be really solid since he will most likely have the ability to catch early dodges. **Centurion:** * This patch didn't help him at all, he still sucks. Moving on. **Gladiator:** * Currently Gladiator has to use toe stab (extremely risky) to punish people early dodging away from his skewer. He will now get to just GB like everyone else, making it a solid opener especially considering how easy it is to access. * Bad news: The GB vulnerability on his dodge light was already kinda bad, after this patch you're probably going to get feint GB'd a lot for trying to dodge attack against moves. **Black Prior:** * I'm not 100% sure, but this MIGHT give him the same forward dodge into bash/GB 50/50 as conqueror (oh god) except way safer (double oh god). * His bulwark slash feint into GB was already pretty consistent, but even moreso after this patch. **Raider:** * Raiders won't really notice much of a difference since their soft feint GB was already really solid at dealing with dodges. So. Keep spamming away I guess? **Warlord:** * Warlord's headbutt/GB mixup is currently quite ineffective because it can be beaten with an early enough dodge timing making it quite consistent. I think this is why they gave him the undodgable zone? Well forget that, just GB now. **Berserker:** * He didn't have issues with this in the first place, so he won't see much of a difference. **Valkyrie:** * She might see the biggest difference out of everyone. Not only has the dodge window her her shield bash been made smaller, but that combined with this change will almost certainly make it an unreactable mixup. Every time valkyrie throws a heavy you will have to guess if it's a GB or a bash, whereas you could safely dodge it before at the correct timing. Basically she's gonna be stronk as hell boys. **Highlander:** * This change - Branching from Dodge to Roll can now only be performed between 300ms-400ms (from 300ms  500ms), might make it a bit harder to dodge roll his kick/grab mixup, but chances are it will still be possible. * The effectiveness of offensive stance feint into GB might go up after this patch too. Looks like it's time to stop preemptively dodging every time you see highlander go into offensive stance. * Offensive stance dodges are now going to be significantly more risky as they will be caught more often by guard breaks. **Shaman:** * Before, it was pretty inconsistent to land headbutt/bite feint into GB. It should be a lot more consistent now, making it a solid easily accessible mixup. **Kensei:** * The GB changes didn't really affect him much. **Shugoki:** * Oh boy. Looks like Hug/Unblockable will be a force to be reckoned with now. You will no longer be able to just safely dodge roll it every time. Not only that, but with the improved tracking + nerds to back walking speed, you might not even be able to easily get away from the neutral charged heavy. This is gonna be a nightmare for some characters. **Orochi:** * These changes don't really affect Orochi that much. I do feel like this character has a lot of heavies go through his guard break when he tries to feint -&gt; GB though, so this will probably help with that. **Nobushi:** * Along with her kick being harder to react to especially when delayed, light/heavy -&gt; kick/heavy feint GB should be a solid mixup now. She'll probably still have issues with people simply walking out of the kick's range though. **Shinobi:** * Guard breaks are going to catch dodges much more consistently, which means that as the most dodge-intensive character in the game he is going to suffer. That along with the fact that he just lost all of his armour, shinobi is taking a big hit this patch. **Aramusha:** * Deadly feint is going to be a proper mixup now. No more safe back dodges. Huge buff for slashy boy. **Hitokiri:** * You will theoretically no longer be able to safely dodge roll away from all of his mixups, making this a huge buff for Hitokiri. **Tiandi:** * Light -&gt; Palm Strike/Heavy Feint GB mixup should now work more consistently. However palm strike is reactable anyway so....meh. He still sucks. **JJ:** * JJ is going to have a VERY effective offence in duels if this goes as expected. His unblock able heavy feint into GB will catch early dodges, and his forward dodge heavy feint into GB will also catch dodges, making both of these a solid mixup. **Nuxia:** * Considering that her dodge lights were already getting caught by GB pretty often, it is safe to assume that you should basically never use them now. * Oh yeah and deflecting heavies will most likely not be safe from feint GB now. **Shaolin:** * Top heavy from Qi stance should now actually be a viable unblockable opener. * Qi stance feint into GB will catch early dodge attempts in reaction to Qi stance. This could already be done although very inconsistently. You will need to use your undodgable heavy from Qi stance less now. * Same as nuxia, deflecting heavies may no longer be safe from feint GB."

But shinobi still has some of the strongest attacks and punishes. His light opener is (I believe) only 400 ms, dealing 24 damage. A heavy parry deals 29 damage, which is higher than some characters light parries. Light parries and guard breaks are 40 damage, OOS gb is 46, OOS parry is 54. Hes still the only character who has 2 chances to deflect an attack, which deal 40 damage (50 damage, but the mechanics on that punish are complicated and not always guaranteed). He still has his double/quad dash ability which can give a ranged heavy (which can be followed into so many things) or a simple double dash and feint can lead to a free gb if they dodge. His ranged gb MAY still be useful after doing a back flip if the opponent goes for a gb. (Not sure on this since, in the coming patch, rolling away can give the opponent a free gb, but nothing was said on his backflip). Even if its not useful in 1v1s , it can still be used to gank, like shaman or Shugoki (wait for the attack to finish and put in all damage, there will be a moment of vulnerability on the opponent, and then let teammates attack). His ranged gb shouldnt have had the ability to ignore revenge armor in the first place. Im not even sure if that was a bug or an actually feature. His ranged gb in 4v4s is no doubt one of the most irritating moves in the game. It definitely needed to lose that hyper armor. Now about him actually losing his hyper armor. Backflip: Well yea that kinda hurts since we probably wont be able to follow it with a ranged gbz Roll: That also hurts since, if youre attacked, you cant follow it with a feint into gb, sickle rain, light or kick. Double dodge kick: Only had hyper armor near the very end of the kick so not that huge of a loss. Kick after deflect: You cant even be attacked in duels in this situation, and you shouldnt be going for the kick punish in 4v4s. Sprint slide: I personally dont use this opener that much so Ill assume it sucks. Sickle rain: Already addressed that Stop whining about how bad hell be, he still has a great kit and is definitely not useless now."

So on and so forth let me just explain. &amp;#x200B; I've found 3 key issues that Orochi doesn't have that the rest of the cast does in one form or another and its all to do with his rather shit kit. &amp;#x200B; 1to3) No bash, no neutral unblockable, no crowd control. All this means he has no offensive option other than R1. His heavies are some of the easiest to parry or block and if you're fighting someone with deflect of some kind they are the easiest to punish. So because R1 is his only viable option you get brats, trolls and no lifers stress testing the spring on their R1 bumper in every fight and that's just fucking sad above anything else. &amp;#x200B; 2) No neutral unblockable, The only unblockables Orochi has plus the only HA he gets is off deflect which is already something extremely hard to do deliberately, 8/10 times i get a deflect is accidental, 1/10 is prediction, 1/10 its on purpose. and half the time i don't even realize i got the deflect so i miss the follow up. I don't know the numbers and they aren't important because the game thinks rep200+ player's skills are lower than mine so go figure. But i think Orochi's deflect window is the shortest making getting them even harder. And again because of all these drawbacks, Orochi then is forced to lean on R1again and that's fucking sad. &amp;#x200B; 3) no crowd control, no bash. Orochi has no way to get free damage. People will argue that his dodge attacks are free damage, but no. A hard feint into a parry will grant a shit ton more damage to the Orochi than whatever he would have got if the attack landed so no. His dodge attacks do not give him free damage. I beat a rep ten Orochi flawless in ranked because he kept using Orochi's dodge attacks, hard feint into parry and i get 35dmg top heavy. In a gank, Orochi is easily the absolute, undefeated weakest character. He cant pop a light and backflip 8 miles like shinobi. He cant throw out 50+dmg charged and neutral heavies like shugo,highland,LB,JJ and others. He also has no way of applying pressure beyond being aggressive. Everything he has, everything he can throw at you can be blocked so on the likes of PC where 400ms attacks aren't hard to block he flat out has no pressure applying abilities. Even while out of stamina an Orochi is fundamentally the least opposing hero to face. He has no soft feints like PK he has no HA like zerk, no traps like Nuxia, no ranged attacks like shinobi, no punish on parry like Glad. If you took away his light spam by either slowing down the first light or getting rid of his third light in his chain. Orochi would fall straight down to the bottom of the cast ladder if hes not there already. &amp;#x200B; Another issue i have with his is something every other character has except for him. And maybe Valk. &amp;#x200B; BS tracking) Wardens top heavy tracks a back dodge. In fact most heavies in general track, i dont mean they cant be dodged on a back dodge, what i mean is the character clips forward and tracks. And because a back dodge completely turns off your guard for like a second that tracked attack lands every time. JJ's chain heavies yes are usually dealt with by simply back dodging but they do track, they have on me and i have on other people. On the subject of tracking i want to talk about the games so called UNDODGEABLE attacks. Attacks that ignore I-frames. Well i'd rather Orochi had zero of these attacks if he got a strafe attack that tracked like wardens, shao lins, shamens, highlanders, nuxia and even PKs forward dash heavy. All these characters have a dash attack that tracks waaay beyond the range of their actual animation. But not Orochi, his top undodgeable storm rush can be rolled away from AND it has an extremely fine tight knit range. Enemies can run away from it, can interrupt it very easily with a fast zone like Ken, Tiandi, warden and PK. And for how slow and long the entire process is it does not do enough damage in my opinion. &amp;#x200B; So think about it really, what DOES Orochi have that makes him strong? What does he have that makes his so hard to fight against? If your answer was light spam which i assume most would be then that is fucking sad. Isn't it? &amp;#x200B; Now i refuse to use the 3rd light in any chain. I refuse to light spam as Orochi. I try my damn best to play in a way that's minimum toxic, max skill. But i also learned that Orochi is also the hardest character to get an execution with so without body count feat his longevity is drastically lowered. This also makes me perhaps the easiest Orochi to beat, because you dont have to worry about light spam and eventually i'll fall for a hard feint and get my dash light parried. &amp;#x200B; What i think could fix him) &amp;#x200B; 1) get rid of his undodgeable side dash lights and replace them with faster versions of Ken's. Its still a light but its animation is shorter than Orochi's current dash attack and hits the opposing guard of the direction he's dodging in like Ken. forward dash light, scrap it. Forward+A+R1 now has Orochi perform a leaping thrust attack that tracks forward, its a light attack so 15dmg but its dodge able and its faster than Orochi's current forward dash. Now the back dodge light, replace it with the old back dodge HEAVY, slower animation but if it lands it grants an execution on kill, its definitely way slower than neutral top heavy so it'll do 40dmg. It will have hyper armor so it can tank one hit and one only. This new attack can also be hard feinted or soft feinted into the unblockable spin kick see below \\/. then of course into the top unblockable, again see below \\/. &amp;#x200B; 2) replace top guard storm rush with a neutral unblockable. Storm rush still works the same, back+A+R2hold. but it will only fly on either left or right guard which can be changed on the fly. This would be kind of like an all guard stance. Guard stick down to initiate. It has I-frames to dodge attacks but has GB vulnerability unlike Nobush. Hitting R1 throws an unblockable fast light in the animation of a quick draw dealing 18dmg. hitting X has him throw an unblockable spinning head kick. If you played the final mission of viking campaign you'll see the golden Orochi do this kick. The kick can be chained into a top unblockable with R2 in the animation of Orochi's running attack. I.E. it will track a back dodge, i thought 30dmg would be enough. &amp;#x200B; 3) now onto his deflect. Id first open up that window just a tiny bit to make the timing less split second luck and more deliberate timing. R1 stays the same as a fast unblockable back stab. R2 though is now an wide sweeping high damage Rochi zone with an animation comparable to the length of the animation of his current deflect heavy followed by a sweeping kick knocking anyone hit by it to the ground. The kick is optional you gotta hit X right at the end of the zone animation to throw the kick. The kick doesn't guarantee damage due to recovery frames though he can counter GB during those recovery frames. This is just a crowd control ability to slow down enemy aggression. &amp;#x200B; 4) now his zone. I never liked Orochi's zone, it doesn't track like any of the other zones period. Warden clips forward, PK clips forward, Glad literally walks forward, Cent clips forward i could go on but i hope you get the point. Orochi's zone cements him into the ground and makes him vulnerable to GB. I'd change it into a quick draw animation that his him bring his sword to his hip and whip it out in a wide arc, hes stepping forward during this animation so it will track. Its also undodgeable and will be the only one of its kind in his kit. &amp;#x200B; 5) finally i'd give him a parry punish. Now he'll have two in essence. During a parry hit X for a pommel strike that is a stamina harassing stun tap but 0dmg. Hit R2 for a charged unblockable reverse stab dealing 25dmg and granting an execution on kill. If you use the R2 punish on a heavy parry it can be dodged and the recovery will grant a free GB. Only on a light parry will it be garrunteed and since a light parry would give you 35dmg top heavy anyway its more for style points and to give Orochi more pressure tools. Also if you do manage to land it off a heavy parry its not so punishing to your opponent at only 25dmg. It can be hard feinted but that's it. &amp;#x200B; Also Orochi's heavies have a forward stepping animation yet they track like dog shit. I'd have the animation extend forward as he moves to improve tracking and put him on equal footing with some of the other cast members. &amp;#x200B; Oh and finally, thought you might appreciate this one. Keep his light attacks as they are but, scrap the 3rd light. You can still do a light heavy light, heavy heavy light, or a light light heavy, or even heavy light light. But from now a 3rd light is impossible in a light chain. &amp;#x200B; These changes are to fix his lack of tracking, lack of offensive openers, lack of viable punishes, lack of pressure tools, lack of crowd control and of course to hopefully fix the issue with Roch players relying on light spam. &amp;#x200B; If you got some sincere arguments or criticism i'm all for reading them and replying."
142,vulnerability,forhonor,Thoughts on Shinobi?,0,bnrgfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/bnrgfy/thoughts_on_shinobi/,2019-05-13 03:20:51,"Was wondering what you guys think of Shinobi as a character? Im not someone who complains often on here about heroes or play styles but Ive always hated fighting Shinobi. Broken BP? Ill take it. Raider a bit overtuned? Bring it on. A full team of Berzerkers all over rep 10? Tough but doable. Ive been playing since season 2 and nothing makes more sigh harder than seeing a Shinobi on the enemy team. I dont necessarily think hes OP but if played a certain way, he can essentially control every aspect of a fight. The only times I ever beat them is when theyre really dumb or new. Strangely enough I sort of feel bad for them because if Shinobis played the way I wanted them to, Id beat them every time so I kind of cant blame the player rather the design of the hero. People often say Zerk has no bad matchups but what does a Zerk do against a Shinobi who plays the distant game until he gets the perfect moment for a kick? So what do you guys do against Shinobi? Is there a vulnerability I might be missing? Should he be more standardized to closer to how everyone else plays? Should I just accept my fate and die when I fight a Shinobi? Lol any tips would be greatly appreciated"

Dodge instantly into Sidewinder** Sidewinder lands 600ms after 100ms-300ms from side dash. It has 0ms vulnerability to GB (as standar dodge attacks) allowing her to not be catched with GB when dodge. Is a heavy and if parried it cant be punishable at all. **2. Hidden stance** It works as a dodge but allows nobushi to Counter GB since it starts. Most heroes have safe tools on their movesets, but the problem is that nobushi can actually * link both of them, making HS into dodge instantly sidewinder extremelly safe. The most probable nerfs can be: **A**- Growth side dash penalty to start sidewinder from 100ms to 200ms/300ms. *EFFECT:* Dodge will be catched with GB if it is not done early. **B**- Delete HS capacity to counter GB. *EFFECT:* Hidden stance would remain as an offensive tool like shaolin Qi stance. This means that it would need more offensive power **C**- Unable nobushi to dash on HS after 300ms. *EFFECT:* we would not be able to dodge attacks of 600ms or less **Personal suggestion** **D**- Nobushi not able to dodge on HS but yes on HS recovery. *EFFECT:* we would not be able to dodge attacks of 500ms or less. (HS dodge will require more skill than just press a button, a similar nerf was made to warden bash into GB) #Opinion It could be nerfed wisely but we would not like that this means take away its unique essence"
144,vulnerability,forhonor,Improvement ideas for ALL heros #2 (vikings),4,br37tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/br37tj/improvement_ideas_for_all_heros_2_vikings/,2019-05-21 09:50:14,"I made the first of these a while back (knights) and I promised if there was positive feedback I'd make another... it took a long time to gather information, and frame by frame statistics and alot of in-game testing and talking with my friends and colleagues. But for those who dont remember- Hi, I'm a LB main since PC beta... I played on PC to 367 reps with mostly berserker and warlord being my main heros of choice... as LB was trash and the meta was a shitshow. I spent alot of work to make an accurate and sensible proposition for hero changes and I would love to hear accurate and sensible feedback weather in agreement or not... But without further adieu let's get started- 1. Raider- Almost all the changes i would've proposed have already been given to him in the recent rework, an AMAZING job and improvement in ubisoft's balance development... However there are things that do need adressing. Raiders dodge GB needs to be removed (only sides need this) With his really good offensive power now, he no longer requires a strong defensive tool as hes no longer a defensively oriented hero. 2. Berserker- Yet another shining example of ubisoft's potential... not much needs to be changed about berserker... he has viable but countable offense that's ""read based"" for both opponents, this offense is toned down by short range... its truly good balance. 3. Highlander- The big Scots man is in need of help... he was difficult to come up with balanced improvements without janking up his KIT but here's what we got. HL needs speed on defensive heavies increased by 100ms (if you bait someone into misstiming a parry on your heavy by making them think it's a light, most heros can simply feint to block it and protect their mistake) hence the 100ms speed increases. HL stam cost buff on all offensive stance heavies and lights (not kick/caber)... we proposed not to change the 600ms defensive lights on HL as they have good counter frames, and a long backstep... but he does need his stam costs on offensive swings lowered SUBSTANTIALLY... 15 for lights, 28 for heavies. HL chain defensive light attack sped up to 500ms, with 100ms HA startup, and enhanced property. This will allow him to have a viable defensive light that can be used to trade, and because of enhanced property it can be used to enter offensive stance. Add a visual (bash) icon effect and sound to offensive stance emote. This will allow him to bait rolls by using the caber like animated emote and flash a visual and audible bash icon and sound to scare opponents with a false indicator hopefully to increase his mixup game. 3. Warlord- Warlord needs more than most on the viking list due to lack of offense and mediocre opener. With viable but mundane defense. Increase WL top light speed to 500ms *why is it 600? Just why?* Increase HA startup on neutral heavies by 200ms... increase HA startup on chain heavies by 100ms. He needs better HA with trash range like his... Increased tracking on headbutt (about conq bash levels) He needs a viable opener and headbutt doesnt land, it just doesnt. Add New chain- 4 hit combo (heavy-light-heavy-light/heavy to end combo) AND (light-heavy-light-heavy/light to end combo) These chains will allow him better potential in 4v4 especially with his improved HA. Reduce zone attack recovery to 400ms (similar to LB current zone recovery). This will allow WL to not get GB immediately after zoning in 4v4... and allow him go recover and continue pressuring. Increase hitbox on all attacks. This is simply for minion clear and possibly hitting more targets in 4v4. Rework WL helm splitter leap to be a feintable unblockable. This move has ALOT of GB vulnerability but he needs some orange in his KIT for 4v4 target swap and OOS pressure. Full-block board'n'blade heavy increased hit radius to a full 360 around the WL, unblockable property, instant HA startup. dmg lowered to 28. This will make the heavy punish guaranteed on a blocked attack, and allow him to punish gankers around him similar to BP flip slash. (The attack will be accessible from full-block without a blocked attack, however it will still not be feintable). Grant ability to cancel any basic attack recovery (lights or heavies chained or neutral) into a forward dodge. This will allow him to cancel the recovery of a basic light or heavy into a forward dash, this means a headbutt mixup... OR the unblockable leap mixup... for chain pressure and 4v4 fight potential DRASTICALLY improved. Increased stamina pool, and decreased stamina cost on headbutt. Headbutt costs ALOT of stam as does most of WL kit. 4. Valkarie- Increased sweep speed to 500ms, and removal of the ability to sweep team mates... to nullify this buff slightly, we lower the sweep reposte damage to 25. Increased light damage to the standard 15. Increase heavy damage to 25 neutral, 35 chain, and 40 finisher. Removal of full-block. I'm giving her a very offensive mixup oriented KIT , all overturned defensive moves should be dropped. Stam costs raised slightly across all of her bash attacks. This offense needs to be more bursted, if she can sustain it like she can now she would be overtuned. Removal of her superior block lights. Again having too many defensive options will overturn her. Superior block dodge PINs now are 25 dmg CC attacks that hold enemies vulnerable for a 2 second animation. This is a nice little CC like counter method for 4v4 potential, it will operate similar to glads skewer pin. Dodge lights changes into dodge heavies, damage and all other properties are the same. This is simply keeping an easy to punish dash attack, from being punished with 40+dmg. 5. Shaman- Not much I could work out for shaman, a solid design overall. But there a couple. Stamina pool increased. She runs out extremely quickly. Recovery on any any chain finisher can be canceled by a dodge. She's a wild assassin who moves wildly... she shouldn't have 1000ms recoveries on finishers. and that's it! I'd like to say pardon my formatting I dont have formatting reddit option available to me currently. Please tread the read carefully and dont skip details and expect me to take your opinion seriously. However if theirs anything you want to clarify or dont understand simply ask in the comments and I will respond. I'd love to hear your opinions and thoughts about my and my group's concepts for hero improvements number 2. And as once again if it's taken well there 3rd samurai will be in the making.

I'm rep 16 with her. &amp;#x200B; * Give Hidden Stance GB vulnerability * Give Sidewinder from neutral undodgable properties ^((not sidewinder from chain)) * Half the amount of time of the Hidden Stance stamina regen delay, but keep the cost the same * After a kick, allow a Viper's Retreat ^((maybe with a 100ms delay)) , as right now her only option after is a top light ^((easy parry if you dodge her kick)) or she sits there and gets GB'd. Essentially if you dodge her kick ^((Which has no variable timing and cannot be canceled like Warden's SB)) somebody who knows what they're doing gets a free Heavy attack * Make second light attack ^((Her slowest and most parried one)) faintable via Hidden Stance, but make her first light attack committed. ^((right now it's the opposite, her first is faintable and her second is committed... I believe. I've tried fainting the second but wasn't able to)) * Her Viper's Retreat follow up after a sidewinder really should come from the other side than the one it hit on already because if you think about and see how she holds her naginata after a sidewinder it just makes more sense. ^((I might be tripping here, consider this a IIRC)) * I'm considering that maybe she should only be able to do HS-&gt;Dodge and not Dodge-&gt;HS to slow her down a bit, but since HS will already have GB vulnerability I'm not sure how I feel about this. * Make heavy attack after a kick not affected by Way Of The Shark so that it won't be as frustrating and punishing to get wall bashed. I've cornered my opponent too many times to count and kept them there doing this. At the least this would still be possible but she would need to use 20% more stamina to do as much damage in this situation * Make the feint window on her zone longer. This is probably just me since I hardly ever use the move but often I end up accidentally throwing the second part even though I deliberately hit the feint button &amp;#x200B; I might be remembering a couple things wrong, but off the top of my head these are the things about her that I think would make her fit in to the new world of For Honor that we're seeing with such a heavy focus on offense. &amp;#x200B; Maybe I have it totally off too though, I'm not sure what's bothering everybody, I really only know what bothers me. As it is right now it seems like though I can be effective with her, people who know her moveset are very easily able to predict what I am more than likely to do since her range of options to apply pressure instead of counter attack are somewhat modest."

I'm just proposing a couple sets of nerfs and buffs that will change gameplay up. Well, what are the annoying parts of Shinobi? In my opinion, not being able to punish him, and quad dash. The only option of fighting him should *not* be spamming GB. And yes, he is annoying in 4v4, but my fix will only work against uncoordinated teams. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ *You can only dash out of your charged heavy when it is fully charged. &gt;This should completely nerf quad dash. I wouldn't have done this if I weren't going to buff him later. *Backflip is no longer uninterruptible, and has GB vulnerability for the first half of the move. &gt;This needs to happen to make him punishable overall, and make him even worse in team fights. I believe he shouldn't be even possibly viable as a team fighter, and have the role of ganker. A Shinobi's job needs to be specializing in 1v1s and picking a weak enemy out of a fight. His low health and super sprint already reinforce this role as the weak but deadly assassin. *Make second ranged heavy not bounce off block. &gt;This is just so he gets a forward roll, and it also pairs with the next buff.. *Allow Shinobi a ""33/33/33"" soft feint on the second ranged heavy in a chain. Backflip, the second heavy in a chain (Sickle Rain), or of course, just letting the ranged heavy go. &gt;This gives Shinobi *way* more options after kick. This makes him mix-up *intensive* and again, sticks to the role of him keeping you on your feet and being a duel god. And this isn't as broken as Raider 33/33/33 because Shinobi has to feint into a non-stunning light/guard break. *Shinobi health reduced to 100 &gt;Oh no! Ew! Another Shinobi health nerf! Okay, look at it this way. My buffs are making Shinobi that deadly but weak assassin, and he is *really* deadly now. Shinobis will have to think carefully about their moves now to avoid dying that much sooner. *Front Roll Kick is now 600ms, and can be charged to a second stage at 1000ms. It is uninterruptible after 700ms. &gt;Makes forward roll way more rewarding to do, and isn't shut down by dodging early. *Charged Front Roll Kick now wallsplats. &gt;More mid-chain pressure, and makes the move actually useful. Also.. *You can now Front Roll Kick instead of 3 timed lights during Sickle Rain. &gt;Gives Shinobi options to work with his environment and punish positioning more. Stamina drain and such. Just another option instead of backflip if you want to get out of a situation during Sickle Rain. Let me know what you thought!

One of the main things about a rework is to make sure a hero keeps their Identity, so openers are usually just taken from his kit and amped up to do better &gt;Neutral heavy Neutral heavy no longer has superior block but instead has HA to actually make it easier to use and make it a trading option, this may also include giving him more GB vulnerability during heavies to make up for trades &gt;Shield Bash Side dodging shield bashes are now 600ms to make it less annoying and not such a loathsome counter attacking tool, forward dodge SB remains untouched &gt;Flail charge His opener that needs more love, it's not always useful due to it being easy to get around, so to make flail charge more useful it's probably best to treat it like it's own stance: -First off no more stamina drain for charging up the flail, this is to encourage using it. -Unblockable gets to keep it's superior block and has little to no GB vulnerability but lacks HA -While charging flail you can throw out an undodgeable 600ms light to mix up the opponents just in case they try to dodge the expected unblockable. -Soft feint into SB is now 600ms to better support mixups from Flail charge **Full guard** Just a few tweaks to keep it from being a ""GB me"" invitation &gt;Exiting full guard stance There's really nothing you can do from all guard except wait for an attack or exit and hopefully get to start a combo. -Can now throw out 700ms SB to give it a better out of guard option -Can now enter straight into unblockable phase of flail charge *That's all I could really think of in the time being but I'm still no pro at making reworks, please any feedback is welcomed so I may have better Ideas and suggestions for the future* **Other Ideas for Flail charge mix ups** &gt;Stun tap SB Basically the same as Highlander's stun tap, fast and high stamina usage but instead of with a pommel it's with his shield &gt;Flail trap -Lv1 flail charge is normal -Lv2 flail charge is unblockable -Lv3 flail charge is a guard trap (Kinda don't like this Idea because you're just kinda obvious on what you might throw out and there's no point on putting 2 anti-guard options on one attack) &gt;Soft feint direction Just kinda do a flashy flail spin and change the flails' direction to mix it up"
153,vulnerability,forhonor,Shinobi is the most unhealthy character in the game... Long analysis and rework.,6,bfhepw,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/bfhepw/shinobi_is_the_most_unhealthy_character_in_the/,2019-04-21 07:36:57,"My goal is spread awareness about why the character is strong and to promote healthy conversation and what he needs as far as nerfs and buffs for balance and make him healthy for the game. Shinobi is strong for all the wrong reasons, he's a paradox. He is forced into playing an unhealthy play-style in order to be viable and it's not enjoyable for anyone. Specifically his strengths are running away, stalling, defending, and ganking. First let me start off by listing Shinobi's main strengths and what needs to change so we're all on the same page. **-Strengths** **Ranged GB:** It's basically a sneaky raider charge on wheels. The CC of this is obviously too strong. I personally think he should just get a regular heavy on ranged GB with no CC. What I expect is that they at least make it interruptible. But the main fact making it too strong is that it's unpunishable at far enough range. **Ranged attacks:** Pretty similar to ranged GB, is just unpunishable at extreme range and promotes no attacking in the game. Shinobi can punish any attack startup or recovery that makes it almost impossible for enemies to attack. This is also assuming the Shinobi is not neutralized and likely has to have numbers, such as a 2v1. **Back-walking:** This is easily Shinobi's best defensive tool, his walk speed is faster than other characters, so he can simply walk backwards and avoid mix-ups, such as kensei's pommel strike, or on HL's kick into caber, the kick will never land if you are walking back, so you can just react to the caber. I personally think a better solution would be to improve other characters movement speeds as well as allowing characters to GB while moving instead of being stationary. But the devs have mention further mobility nerfs in the future, such as a back-walking nerf. **Slide-tackle:** This one has already been nerfed, and is a still a pretty strong gank, I don't see too much wrong with right now, but it's not really useful in a 1v1 setting now. **Damage:** I actually think in the current context of the meta, Shinobi's damage is fine and justified. But damage values in general in the game are too high, and would agree with a damage nerf if it was globally nerfed on all characters. These factors are what makes Shinobi so strong. Shinobi is extremely safe provided that he just stalls and defends until he is out of range and in a position to gank. &amp;#x200B; Now I'm going to be making arguments for Shinobi, because he does need buffs more than he needs nerfs imo, and his past nerfs haven't addressed his problems. Like I said, he's a bit of a paradox, but if you're playing within GB range of a Shinobi, he's incredibly sub par. So I'm now going to list factors that makes sub-par at close range and in turn forces him out of range to be safe and viable. Shinobi has no offense of his own, everything he has is easily react-able, his fastest attack being a 500ms light. Shinobi cannot 1v1 or 1vX, but he remains viable in duels and 4v4's game modes due to technicalities. He can run away and time out the clock with only winning on block damage in duels, and he is really good at stalling in 4v4 modes until he is in a position to gank. But he can't actually attack in a 1v1 or 1vX setting, it's almost impossible for him to win those fights without help or unless the opponent hands him the fight with react-able attacks he can punish. Usually it ends up in stalling. He is almost completely reliant on having a good team at high tier and is a support role. Even with all this being said, Shinobi is still strong in the meta, for the wrong reasons of course. &amp;#x200B; His strengths are unhealthy, but if they are nerfed without buffing the character in other ways, he will be completely gutted and one of the worst heroes in the game. The devs have mentioned a back-walking nerf coming in the future, and in combination with a range GB nerf, he could easily become a D tier hero. Shinobi essentially needs his ranged game nerfed, and he needs a viable inside game. I'm going to list my personal solutions and then add in solutions that some of the competitive community has suggested. First I will address solutions on how to properly nerf his strengths that I listed above. The main issue, ranged play needs to be balanced and it's so difficult that most compet players think it should be removed. **-Solutions** **Ranged GB and attacks:** First of all, Range GB CC needs to be nerfs as I mentioned before, I would prefer just a regular heavy. The risk/reward of ranged play is too extreme where Shinobi is too safe at range, and too heavily punished when countered up close. The punish for ranged attacks should just be automatic, similar to how BP counters a ranged attack with his Bullwark flip. I think the goal should be to make range irrelevant when trying to punish a Shinobi, so you would be able to punish him at any range. I think an automatic 15 damage on counters or something more in line with heavy parry punishes would be more acceptable and beats him being complete safe at range. Of course this would just make the risk reward healthier and make range irrelevant, but it wouldn't fix all of his issues like only punishing recoveries safely. I personally think in this context his range punishes wouldn't be a big deal if the CC was nerfed, and he could be baited and punished properly and consistently, but comp community has made a point of it. And the best solution I can come up with is that his range is reduced, maybe by half or so. **Dodge attacks:** Imo, Shinobi really needs single dodge chains and double dodge is the reason why he is fundamentally bad in close range, making him slow and interruptible by GB and making his kick pseudo 'opener' a lot less effective. It makes him worse offensively and as a counter attacker. When I asked the comp community, specifically Kawaii, he suggested that Shinobi just get 400ms kicks on double dodge back but they are punish by GB, which I wouldn't mind, but I would prefer 500ms kicks off a single dodge chain personally and make the recovery punishable by GB on early reaction. This bring me to my next point of how to get the GB with backflip how it is currently. **Backflip:** Basically this move is ass backwards, it needs iframes instead of hyper armor, and the startup needs to vulnerable to GB. It should work so that a back-flip can be confirmed on hit or block stun in a 1v1, but if they dodge your attack and try to GB they should interrupt your back-flip provided they buffer the GB. Maybe 200-400ms of GB vulnerability needs to be added here, somewhere in that range. It should still be relatively safe, but the fact that it has no iframes makes it a detriment to use in group fights and only serves as a spacing tool and a way to avoid GB punish on recoveries, which isn't healthy the way it is implemented. &amp;#x200B; With these changes, I aim to still give Shinobi a slight advantage to punish people at range, but in a much more healthy and fair way. Range should not be his one trick, he needs an inside game, which I think single dodge attacks would provide fundamentally. His mobility, dodge attacks and deflects should be his main incentives in a fight as opposed to his ranged play. This isn't everything, but the main points I want to get across, I still think he needs a slight speed advantage on his lights attacks vs someone like warden, maybe 450ms, that's another conversation though. Let me know what you think, and what you're ideas are for the character other than just removing or gutting him. What are your solutions that would leave the character in a healthy state?"
154,vulnerability,forhonor,Balance Question Kensei,2,bfjc3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/bfjc3k/balance_question_kensei/,2019-04-21 10:58:23,"Please Read all the post before you comment. First of all, this is just my point of view about the Kensei Hero and the balance of the game for PC. &amp;#x200B; I main Kensei since S1, i have more than 1.3k hours played... I think Kensei is the best balanced Hero in the game, because: &amp;#x200B; He dont have: ""Super Lights"" where you cant see properly indicator like: Tiandi, Jian Jung, Shaolin, Nuxia, Bersherker, Orochi... &amp;#x200B; He dont have: Opener/Shove/Punish ""Instantly, Fast or Strong"" like: Warden, Conqueror, Black Prior, Shaman, Shaolin, Tiandi, Jian Jung... &amp;#x200B; He dont have: ""Cancel Unblockable"" when you want like: Bersherker, Shaman, Warden, Raider, Jian Jung, Black Prior, Gladiator, Shaolin, Highlander... &amp;#x200B; At the end of his chains he have recovery time and he is vulnerable to GB. ""Top Light"" its the only fast start hit way (excluding the zones attacks) Have Low damage Sides Lights. Only have Hyper Armor at the end of his chain. Unblockable only starts at the end of his chain. Slow Opener because need start with his chain. &amp;#x200B; I mean Kensei doesn't have Ridiculous/Powerful things like others, he is just a Hero with her style like all... BECAUSE THE PERFECT BALANCE MUST HAVE PROS AND CONS, because powerful movements needs to have some risky/vulnerability, and this need to apply all Hero that they dont have this, and there is many heros... Because we want to fight, to test us skill, not just picking a Hero, picking you Hero that you like, that is the goal of Perfect Balance of the game. &amp;#x200B; I think all the other heroes have to see Kensei as a base to balance the future of the game ... I think Kensei have Pros and Cons so its the perfect balance... and you hero?"

156,vulnerability,forhonor,Lawbringers Rework is a Significant Improvement,151,bi70z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/bi70z4/lawbringers_rework_is_a_significant_improvement/,2019-04-28 13:18:07,"There have been a lot of complaints about Lawbringers rework, however, it seems that the majority of these have been due to lack of knowledge on the implications of the changes. So, allow me to elaborate on why this rework (so long as all the parts work properly) is a good improvement. - 500 ms Shove after a hit/blocked/whiffed heavy attack is quite good. For reference, this is the same speed as Black Priors chained bash and Shaolins kick. Now that it guarantees a light, the opponent is motivated to dodge it to avoid the damage, and can be caught trying to dodge it with a heavy or delayed GB. This also works with his now unblockable heavy chain finishers, meaning that he can restart his chain with the Shove follow-up. - Enhanced 500 ms lights are very good for reaching chain pressure. Look to Shugoki for this. So long as they are properly mixed with heavies to discourage parries, reaching the rest of his chain should not be overly difficult for Lawbringer. - The added forward movement to his unblockables supposedly means that his unblockables can no longer be backdodged to avoid the mixup. This means that Lawbringer not only has more unblockabkes, but also actually menacing ones. - Everyone is complaining about the reduced damage from Blind Justice. No offense, but if were paying ATTENTION, you would also have noticed in the patch notes that all top heavy finishers INCLUDING BLIND JUSTICE guarantee a follow-up stunning light. What does this mean? It means that your light parry punish is now Blind Justice (38) + Stunning Light (12) = 50 DAMAGE. Congratulations, your light parry punish has actually been buffed by 5 damage. Not to mention to zone parry damage buff and being made unblockable. - His zone being sped up to 700 ms has likely made it an option select, as most 700 ms attacks have 100 ms GB vulnerability. This makes parrying with Lawbringer much safer. In general, the only nerf Lawbringers parries received was to hit maximum heavy parry punish going from 50 damage to 45 damage due to Impales damage dropping, but a 45 damage heavy parry punish is still MORE than enough. - 400 ms top lights are obviously good for pokes and with the new guard switch bug fix (allowing static guard characters to now switch guards and attack as fast as assassins), his feint game will be more effective. - While his neutral Shove is still slow, it still has hyper armor, meaning that, now that it guarantees a light, it can be used to trade for a light and start his chains (either allowing him to go for another Shove after a heavy or go for his unblockable). All-in-all, the rework, so long as all the parts function properly, is a significant improvement. While he still remains a defensive character thanks to having the best parry punishes in the game, he should now have a usable offense capable of putting pressure on those refusing to attack and force them to play into his defense."
157,vulnerability,forhonor,Open letter to Ubisoft,27,bjbeyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/bjbeyu/open_letter_to_ubisoft/,2019-05-01 11:20:17,"I had planned to post this in the competitive sub, but it didn't really seem relevant to the type of content they want, and those guys already all know this. So I'm putting it here for visibility, though I doubt Ubi will respond. Still, I hope they at least see this. I shouldn't need to say this, but this is of course my personal opinion. I do not claim to speak for the community, or the competitive scene, or anyone but myself. I'll also point out, though I follow competitive play, I am not myself at a competitive skill level. I can only make observations on what I see the actual top players doing. Do not take my word as truth, and I'm more than happy to be corrected by those with more knowledge than me. I just ask you do so respectfully. Now, to begin. For Honor has a major problem. It's not backdodging, or dodge rolling, or anything like that. It's that the core systems driving the game are not conducive to both high skill and fun. Competitive play is not fun for them, and it's not fun to watch. The game has a problem where it becomes less fun the better you get, which is absolutely bonkers to me. I shouldn't want to be a low skill player fighting other low skill players. I should (and I do, but reluctantly) desire to improve and become as good as I can. But....I'm not looking forward to hitting a higher skill level. Why? Because defense is fundamentally too strong, and thus far, your methods of trying to bypass it have consistently watered down and overly standardized (imo) too many mechanics and too many heroes. As it stands now, the *intended* ways of getting past defense seems to br either hard or impossible to react to bashes for mixups (i.e Conq, Warden, Black Prior) or unreactable 400ms chain lights (Orochi, Tiandi, PK, Nuxia). This makes heroes feel exceedingly samey because their actual unique mechanics don't see much use in duels, which, and I could be wrong, but I feel is intended to be the most competitive mode. Black Prior currently feels the best to me mechanically due his number of options and lack of super strong unlock play, but he keeps getting hit with nerfs. Admittedly, some are justified, but this feeds into my next point. A big part of the issue is safety vs punishes. Let's look at BP. I forward dodge bash, you dodge, you don't get a punish unless you're a specific hero with a suitable dodge attack. It's very safe. So I'm gonna keep using it because there's no risk. If you nerf it and make it punishable, I'll never use it, because one light attack is not worth a potential GB for anywhere from 25-65 (maybe even more) damage. We already see this with BP not using it against raider, which is admittedly due to raider having a specific and very strong defensive/punish tool with dodge GB, but the same concept applies if everyone gets a GB. I won't want to use his bash anymore because I won't feel the reward is worth the risk. Maybe other feel differently, idk. I understand it's hard to balance this. You don't want completely safe offense. You also don't want parts of a kit to be utterly useless because the risk/reward is off. You want mixups and reads and a healthy back and forth with balance both offensively and defensively, so that you can have unique heroes who are are played offensively or defensively in their own unique ways. But the core design doesn't really allow for this. Defense is too strong. Blocking is too easy. Dodge rolling exists. Various mixups can be safely backdodged. Guard breaks are basically just a punish tool, not a universal means of opening people up. The obvious solution seems to nerf the defensive systems as a whole. Remove dodge rolling entirely, nerf back dodges (so that you don't have to buff every mixup that fails against them), and find a way to punish excessive blocking. Implement a true guard break system (a la Dark Souls or Absolver) or something. I don't know, this post isn't designed to be suggestions on how to fix the game, I leave that to smarter and better people than I. But this has been a problem since the very beginning, though it's gotten better. But....it is still a problem, alongside an extreme lack of testing or any kind of consistency with when you do a PTS and what you do with the feedback. There was a disgusting incident in S4 of the devs actually letting comp players workshop the new heroes (aramusha and shaman, for those who weren't around then). There was a lot of feedback on various issues, in particular I very specifically remember Vinx, a top player known for rolling with Skorbrand, telling the devs how broken shamans original bite tracking was, and various comments from other comp players about issues with aramushas kit (and iirc this was before regular backdodging was such a problem) because his full block left him vulnerable for like 900ms due to insane recovery or some ridiculous number like that, and his deadly feints were parry bait. The devs knew prior to launch, but changed nothing. It was like 2 weeks before shaman bite got a tracking nerf, which would've happened anyways because it would've come out at launch via the community at large, just like BPs OOS pressure, which basically meant they wasted time and money bringing out the comp players just to not listen to their feedback and make changes post season launch that they would've made anyways. The old PTS testing OOS and parry changes like a year ago has only really had one major change go through (removal of GB on parry, alteration of vulnerability timings after parries), and the rest of the tested changes we've heard nothing on since then. No news on worse OOS dodges, or making bashes no longer drain stam from OOS opponents, or making it so OOS characters can't parry. The most recent TTS (afaik, I stopped paying attention after this one) was basically just a testbed for the dialogue system and some minor tweaks to attack timing increments, most notably by giving raider a 50ms(?) change to allow side heavy on stampede charge. Aside from some vague mentions on the warriors den and a confirmation that RDS was being scrapped, we never really hear anything. Just ""we're working on it"" or ""nerfs to x coming soon"". Ubi is not listening to the community and especially not the competitive scene. Ubi is not properly testing new heroes and changes made to old heroes, and have consistently broken heroes with small changes. Raider instant stampede in S3 was also tested on PTS, and the competitive players told you ahead of time, but it still reared its ugly head in the Hero Series, alongside unlock play and an embarrassing show of what people then assumed was actual competitive console play where an orochi consistently beat a warlord with side light pokes (clocking in at 600ms at the time, which is parry bait even for console) Granted, this was ages ago, but competitive play (specifically duels) doesn't appear to have changed for the better with the discovery of backdodging entire mixups and the cancer that is dodge rolling. Dodge rolling has been around since I think S3 and the nerf it got only solved one specific issue, which was competitive players being able to snuff GB mixups by unlocking on reaction to the indicator. But....its still a very safe option against almost every mixup in the game. Again, I get that it's hard. It's hard because defense is fundamentally broken, and the offensive means of bypassing it are unfun and therefore generally disliked by both the community at large and the competitive scene. I've gone on long enough. Please, Ubisoft, do more PTS testing. Do it earlier so that feedback can be implemented before things launch, rather than launching anyways and being changed later. Workshop with what competitive players are left, they'll find what's wrong with a given patch, I can almost guarantee it, and more importantly, listen and implement their feedback more efficiently. Maybe it isn't feasible. Maybe the money just isn't there, or the team is understaffed, or whatever else. I don't know what's happening behind the scenes. But the game has great potential....it just needs a lot of work to get where it needs to be. And I know a lot of work has already been done. And I appreciate it. We want the game to be competitive, and you do too, and more importantly, we all want it to be fun at all levels, especially a competitive one, but it needs a lot more effort than is currently being put forth. I guess that's all I really have to say. TLDR defense is fundamentally broken, source feedback from your top players and make a serious, dedicated effort to fix it so that everyone can have fun and the competitive scene can come back to life. Apologies in advance for formatting, I'm on mobile and can't do much more than double spacing to separate my points. Have a good day, everyone."
158,vulnerability,forhonor,Lawbringer Changes on Inspection,58,bk990h,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/bk990h/lawbringer_changes_on_inspection/,2019-05-04 00:42:29,"Lawbringer remains the Jack of all trades, and the master of none. The biggest change to Lawbringer is that he can arrive at his issues faster in combat now, while receiving little in the way to compensate. He may have more chain mixup potential, but accessing these mixups is as difficult as before. While the Lawbringer might be more combatativly potent than before, he is in a worse state. A situation made all the more frustrating when improvements that lawbringer needed, were given to other characters. The reasons Lawbringer was denied these changes or improvements was never really stated. What must be understood is that Lawbringer is by no means the best at anything he does. He is not the best at punishing parries, he is not the best at attacking, he is not the best at mixups. Ultimately Lawbringer is rather irrelevant in Year 3. What he has is a high health pool. Health that doesn't last long now that his defensive capabilities have been reduced. The changes done to Lawbringer sound good on paper, and in a fight they are good. However, this does not mean that Lawbringer benefits from them, or can use them as well as other cast members can. Lawbringer mechanically and by design is still not as effective as he was before. His drawbacks of stamina, and difficulty reaching his unblock/finishers remain fatal flaws in his design. All the while other heros have similar chains and movesets, but with tools to offset the flaws. Yet lawbringer does not. His offense remains functionally the same, only now his defense as been weakened. Lawbringer can choose to turtle and hide, or risk everything on the hope he can kill his opponent before his limited stamina kills him. Ultimately he has not been fixed as a hero in the game. Lawbringer remains a relic of the past, easily forgotten, and hopped to be forgotten by the developers. &amp;#x200B; **Changes to shove** First and foremost, Shove on block needed to go. The only times I ever used Shove on block were to shut down light spamming opponents who effectively shut Lawbringer down by attacking. It needed to go, but Lawbringer should have recieved something in exchange. More on this later The biggest change to shove was making it a flat time across all uses, and the confirmed light after a shove. There is no more shove on hit. While shove on a miss is a welcome change, the lack of a fast shove on hit removes and sense of momentum Lawbringer had. He can no longer pressure opponents after a successful hit with a confirmed shove into mixup. Instead Lawbringer is now expected to continue to throw out naked attacks. Most of which are still parried quite easily. **Changes to lights and heavies and chains** Another welcome change to the Lawbringer's kit is the superior lights. While good on paper, and a 400ms top light might sound like an opener, it does little to help Lawbringer. Lawbringer has no light chains, so all superior lights do is allow Lawbringer to initiate his Heavy chain, or throw a heavy feint. Both of which are easily reactable. At worst, punishable Heavy attacks being faster is another good change. However these attacks remain easily parried, and mechanically do not differ from before. They have the same vulnerabilities they did when they were 800 and 700ms. Once again, another welcome change is Lawbringer's now Unblockable Heavy chain finishers, as well as the blind justice finishers. What remains a problem is is accessing these attacks, as well as landing them remains as difficult as before. In this there have been no changes. Lawbringer remains vulnerable. **Changes to CC elements** Inline with many other changes, Lawbringer received nerfs to his Impaling charge and Long Arm. While these changes are not bad, Lawbringer gained little from them. The damage increase to Impailing charge is good, but nothing about the move's drawbacks were touched on. Compared to Raider's Stampeede charge, impaling charge ( and impaling riposte) offers more drawbacks to Lawbringer than benifits. Stampede charge drains opponents stamina, and will send them into a stunned state if there is a wall impact. Impaling charge will render the Lawbringer with little under a third of his stamina remaining. Enough for a follow up attack, but then Lawbringer is useless in the fight for the next few seconds. If it is blocked Lawbringer cannot initiate an attack otehrwise he will go into the Out of Stamina State. If it is parried he enters OOS. Conversely Stampede charge offers little to no drawback for the raider. It presents him with a GB vulnerability if it is dodged, and the charge ends nearby. Arguably Raider benifits more from essentially the same move mechanically. &amp;#x200B; Long arm is another move in the Lawbringer's kit that has little use to him. It is more dangerous to Lawbrinegr than any other character. While Shugoki's Demon's Embrace, Or Shaman's bite offer a similar mechanic, those characters reap a reward if landed properly. Shugoki regains health and stamina, and Shaman regains health. Lawbringer receives no benefit. He may land a side heavy, and potentially a top light. This will render Lawbringer low on Stamina as well. It's nerf is understandable, as it is a powerful tool in gang up situations. However it received nothing in compensation. Nor was it buffed as ubisoft stated they wanted to improve the weaker parts of a heroes kit rather than nerf strong tools. Ubisoft Nerfed the weakest tool in Lawbringer's kit, going against their own claims. **Stamina limitations** Since the beginning of the game, Lawbringer had a diminutive stamina pool. Lower than the average. While the pool itself might have been large, his move costs made it minuscule. Early renditions of the game almost required Lawbringer's use Stamina cost reduction gear stats. With the changes in his design, lawbringer is expected to throw out more attacks, with the same stamina costs, and pool. This forces Lawbringer OOS faster then before. If one of his reactable heavies is parried he is out even faster. This forces Lawbringer to become more defensive than before, as he is punished for sustaining the offensive. Lawbringer's will find themselves out of stamina more often in fights. With little tools to defend himself in this state, Lawbringer is in a worse state than he went into the changes. It is better for a Lawbringer player to remain defensive and not initiate any kind of attack untill it is guaranteed, gather a few hits, then resume a defensive stance. Moreso than in his previous design. Stamina was not addressed in his redesign and it remains his single most glaring flaw. With no OOS recovery mechanics. Lawbringer must balance pressing an offense, or remaining entirely defensive. He cannot sustain an offense like the developers thought they had designed him. It is more advantageous for the Lawbringer to wait for his confirmed light, and stop than to do anything else. **Initiating and openers** Lawbringer remains unable to pressure his opponents into a reaction. While Top Light may strike an unaware opponent, or a side light might land, the follow-up heavies are more risky. Feinting will only exacerbate his limited stamina pool, allowing two or three hits before Lawbringer must turtle up again. While defensive, he lacks any decent means to force a reaction. This has not changed from the previous build. After the first couple top lights, an opponent with situational awareness will simply block top, and negate Lawbringer's offense. It is possible for him to press with side lights, or a heavy feint mixup, but these still come with risk to Lawbringer. Other characters have certain traits or abilities to lessen these risks. e.g. The stunning ability of Raider's stunning tap, or Hitokiri's hyper armor. Lawbringer throws out his attacks with the hope they do not get parried. Any decent player will understand Lawbringer's limitations and see through any attempt to fient. Lawbringer simply cannot force a reaction the same way other heroes can without the use of a bash. **Hyper Armor arguments** The basis for Lawbringer requiring hyper armor has nothing to do with his physical character model. Lawbringer's need for HA comes from the ability to shut down his offense by attacking him. Lawbringer is meant to be a counter attacker. Originally he had shove on block to initiate his counter attacks. With this removed, Lawbringer stand entirely vulnerable to fast attacking foes. Hyper Armor on his heavy attacks would allow a means to stop or trade with an opponent. The argument that Lawbringer is not meant to trade is made less credible with the use of HA on shove. Here, Lawbringer is expected to trade with an opponent, it is the reason behind the move. What HA on his heavies, and heavy finishers would accomplish is forcing an opponents reaction, much in the way that HA on Hitokiri's heavy attacks is meant to force a reaction. As well if an opponent chose to try and shut lawbringer down with light attacks, they will land their damage, but not be successful. This changes the dynamic of his heavy attacks from simply attacks in his chains, to attacks that force an opponent to react to him, either by parries or dodges to avoid chip damage or trade damage. It will allow a greater range of mix-up potential for Lawbringer, as well as increased survivability in team-up situations, since his shove on hit was removed. With this simple addition it takes away the issues Shove on Block presented, while maintaining the spirit of what Lawbringer is. A counter-Attacker. **Comparison to other cast members** Lawbringer is not unique, nor is he the best at his intended role. Mechanically Lawbringer is inferior to his peers. He does not have the staying power to fight with heavies. He does not have the flexibility to shut down mix-up heroes. He doesn't have the defensive ability to outclass a Vanguard. Lawbringer was always a toolless toolbox. While his new design does grant him a few benefits, they were not where Lawbringer was having the most issues. His light attacks are the same speed as Jiang Jun's however he lacks the mixup of Jiang Jun's Lights into heavy unblockable, or Light into Light. He lacks Jiang Jun's stamina regeneration. While Lawbringer can now more regularly punish bash opening heroes. he does not debilitate like Black Prior and his Bulwark Stance. His heavies are more accessible, but they are not nearly guaranteed like Hitokiri's or Shugoki's with Hyper armor. &amp;#x200B; Lawbringer remains the Jack of all trades, and the master of none. The biggest change to Lawbringer is that he can arrive at his issues faster in combat now, while recieving little in the way to compensate. He may have more chain mixup potential, but accessing these mixups is as difficult as before. Lawbringer remains punishable, and difficult to play with. After playing him through 65 reps, I must say, I am having more trouble playing this character now than ever before. Lawbringer wasn't reworked, He was undone."

Considering it's a One-hit kill that tracks and is uninterruptible unless you bash, there should be at least 1000 ms of vulnerability. I keep dodging them, only to be unable to punish them properly with a GB. I hate to sound like one of the many ""too stronk, pls nerf"" but that's ridiculous even by For Honor's standards"
160,vulnerability,forhonor,In lue of the incoming prior changes.,5,b0ueoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/b0ueoz/in_lue_of_the_incoming_prior_changes/,2019-03-14 12:40:19,"Assuming ""jawbreaker"" is his forward dash bash and they are increasing its recovery to 500 ms from 300 ms, then PRIOR NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED TO THE SAME TIMEFRAME FOR HIS BASHES AS CONQ, otherwise, he will be complete fucking garbage. Currently, conq and bp have the exact same initiation and delayable timing for their respective shield bashes except for one simple difference. For conq there is a 100 ms timing which you can dodge both his instant startup and delayed bashes. For bp there is currently a 300 ms window to dodge both versions of his bash. If there are nerfing the recovery of his forward bash then THEY NEED TO COMPENSATE HIM by decreasing the window to dodge both variants of his shield bash to 100ms just like conq currently has. IF THEY DON'T it will completely fucking dumpster the characters offense. Onto the damage nerfs, all of them except chain heavy finisher are fine and completely reasonable. Onto the full-block changes, changing his fullblock exist recovery from 200 to 400 ms will completely kill the move's viability. They either need to not go through this change or give his full-block superior block and lower the gb vulnerability of his heavy unblockable down to 100 ms to compensate. If they don't then using fullblock will offer no advantage, be unsafe and just stop being useable altogether. Onto the bugs he has remaining that NEED to be fixed come tomorrow. To start he still has a 300 ms guard switch bug that is applied to himself, this was removed from every character in the game previously and for whatever retarded reason they brought it back. This also has the side effect of locking the opponents he hits with a light into a guaranteed followup bash if they failed to block and moved their guard afterwards. Onto his bulwark counter, currently, there are two bugs surrounding it, the first is that your followup unblockable swipe can get interrupted by colliding into or a near an object. I don't know why I would have to explain why having an otherwise guaranteed punish end up getting you punished isn't really healthy. The next bug is in relation to bashes after the swipe has finished its animation, first, there is a short window where prior's guard isn't available as he is getting up from his flip. This allows people who use proper spacing to completely punish his punish, intended to prevent him from being punished. Yea thanks ubi. Secondly, certain cc moves such as raiders charge, wardens bash and gladiators toe stab can all force you out bulwark clip after the sword swing has finished, guaranteeing free damage. At the end of the day regardless of how you feel about Black Prior, its clear these nerfs are knee jerk reactions to people complaining about him, nuking someone with the nerf stick and give 0 compensation isn't proper balance, its a child trying to shove triangle into a square slot, getting pissed it doesn't work and flipping the entire fucking table..."

162,vulnerability,forhonor,Discussion about the new update to heroes and Black Prior,1,aq5st5,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/aq5st5/discussion_about_the_new_update_to_heroes_and/,2019-02-13 22:52:42,"So I may warn you that this will be a lengthy post so just bear with me okay? So let me start with my own introduction and how much experience I am. So I am Uknowitbuddy (brilliant username yes) and I main Centurion with around 10 reps in him and total rep of about 51. Yeah I might not be super high rep but I just know what I am doing. So lets get down to what I wanted to discuss. So with the recent update we got Black Prior and hero updates for Shugoki, Warlord and Peacekeeper. Black Prior was a really the biggest part of the update along with Shugokis rework so lets start with that. Black Prior is in no way that special of a character as his moveset to me lacks depth. He has really safe forward bash which gives him his chain finisher light which nets you in 20 damage to opponents stamina and 20 HP damage. It can however be reacted to by dodging on reaction to his dodge however he can try to use zone to mixup but that can also be avoided by rolling. It also doesnt have same functioning as Conqs delayed bash as it doesnt have the same tracking so doing delayed bash will just get you punished (as ironically delayed bash actually is the only way you will get punished for doing shield bash) and also only select few characters can punish it. His defense is really good as well due to having 0 ms activation on his full block after blocking an attack like Aramusha however he has really low recovery for leaving his full block. So he can in theory negate 400 ms lights as he can full block on reaction to red and leave it on reaction to feint animation. However the other thing is he cant chase heroes like not at all! As his forward dodge heavy is mostly useless while the out of lock running heavy is just miserably bad. On the topic of useless moves lets talk about his soft feint to bash as that is pretty much useless since you can easily side dodge and punish it on reaction. As for Bulwark Counter it works as intended and is not in need of any tweaking. However his zone though is useless as it is due to being 700 ms and having 400 ms of guardbreak vulnerability making it useless as option select and also making it useless to use in general unless used in conjunction with his bash due to zone having different dodge timings. His unblockable from Bulwark is good as it allows to catch dodges to some extent and also works good to punish GB on reads and not on reaction which is good. His light chains and heavy chains work as intended however the light finisher on bashes is too much just because of how safe it is. Due to his OOS light to bash bug is now fixed I wont talk about that though I wish they had kept in on revenge. His superior block light damage is also now fixed and in line with how generous the timings for it are as you have the frames starting from 100 ms to 300 ms giving you 200 ms window which is very generous IMO. Now if I havent missed anything lets move to Shugo rework. So Shugoki Rework how do I say this. It was really a big disappointment for me. As long as it is subject to further changes I would say it is good base to start from however if they are just done with Shugoki just based on this, I am incredibly disappointed. Lets start with his main mixup that he got which is his charged heavy mixups. So basically you can dodge on red and roll on reaction to Demons Embrace as he cant catch rolls at all. His feint to GB wont catch you as you already are at the end of the dodge and you negate his entire mixup. His headbutt is useless as it guarantees nothing except a stun to the opponent which is useless. His Demon Embrace recovery is a god awful 2000 ms which allows players to roll and still be back in time to punish it which is totally a shitty design choice on their part. His 500 ms enhanced lights are a good addition but since Shugoki didnt get any new good new chains to begin with its usefulness is QoL improvement as of now. His hyperarmor does little to protect him against bashes. Allowing Conquerer and Black Prior to bash Shugoki out of his unblockable windup. Him being able to be knocked out of his hug UNLESS you do what Kaiayos showed in his video in the competitive sub reduces his gank potential particularly due to how long the recovery is for the damage you are getting. Along with it being easy to keep distance against a Shugoki which doesnt work against good gankers like Shaman or Lawbringer. His headbutt gank was totally gutted while his anti gank potential was made meh from bad. Also the zone improvement is good but not enough as 600 ms is very slow but I guess the hyperarmor makes up for it I guess? Dunno lets discuss that in the comments. Lets move onto uhhh Now since I have really zero experience on Warlord I wont give any opinions on him but from what I have heard from good players it seems he was gutted from one of the best openers in the game in exchange for chains which are reactable and dont do much justice to him. His crashing charge was made 500 ms and is now reactable making it not useful at all even against an OOS opponent. His lunge attack was gutted as well making it fairly useless unless used for OOS punishes. His chains are good addition but due to being reactable as I said before it doesnt give him much. His superior block light now actually works instead of just being there. The changes to full block are good however it is still not clear as to what punishes there are for blocking what attack which makes it lacklustre to use. In general I dont see anything being done to him except a nerf for higher level of plays. (RIP Warlord you had fun times at S Tier) We move onto Peacekeeper whose number change was so insignificant that I dont even feel like talking about them. So thats my opinion on each and every hero update and the new hero that has been introduced. Lets have a friendly discussion and no flame wars. "
163,vulnerability,forhonor,"For Honor RPG system, For Honor Addition, RPG? /u/MrEpricPope",1,aq9nlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/aq9nlb/for_honor_rpg_system_for_honor_addition_rpg/,2019-02-14 05:23:45,"For /u/MrEricPope &amp;#x200B; This is something i have been working on, primarily the system to incorporate without change the combat system. I am not a dev or in the gaming industry, just a passionate player that wants more of For Honor! Warning Mega thread, make some coffee sit back and hopefully you can understand what i have envisioned and tried to explain. &amp;#x200B; **What if For Honor  The Division  AC Odyssey became ONE game!!!** For Honor as an open world game, exploration, raids, pvp and faction building. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; ** What this would look like** Take these components: \- The fighting engine of Ubisofts For Honor \- The world, history and factions of Ubisofts For Honor have you ever just stopped to look around at the For Honor landscape Now mix these with: \- Ubisofts open world format of Odyssey \- Faction base building of Ubisofts The Division at HQ \- Quests instances and open world instances Ubisofts The Division \- PvP zone of Ubisofts The Division and Faction Battles of Ubisofts AC Odyssey. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; ** ABOUT:** The game world consists of 4 factions, fighting an endless war, each faction attempts to push into the lands of their enemies while defending their own borders. Strongholds must be turned to ruins or re-built. Resources are the realms blood, while influence is the reputation you hold from the people of the realm. Followers will be acquired to aid the players in acquiring all needed currencies to ever move forward in this world and supply the events that will keep the players engaged in the Faction War. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Throw in some personal development and growth, players will fight for a Faction (knights, Vikings, Samurai or Wu ling) and players MAY pledge to an NPC Order for example: Knights Black Stone Legion, (Vikings  Clan, Samuri  House, Wu Lin  Master). Players will gain influence within their Order, which will provide an opportunity to start their own guild, develop player housing or upgrade strongholds, these are among a few options. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Add in some element of player foundation by this I mean the development of your guild leveling, the progression of a players home base, and the ability to see your faction grow. These will take the place of the traditional player advancement. The character development will be as is currently in For Honor using reputation ranks, with the players earning influence that opens new options with their Faction/Order/Guild and the ability to grow and acquire resources from in game actions. These resources can be used to lunch events, rebuild locations or be given to his faction to keep the lands prosperous. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Each faction realm will have 3 zone types, from safe zone which is friendly land near the capital and is protected by boundary npc strongholds. The war torn zone which is mostly friendly, but due to the on-going war shows signs of scaring, and the frontline zones which is the primary PvP zone, these battle fields between the factions are guarded by strongholds which block access into the war-torn zone. The battlefields are home to many strategic locations which are constantly in turmoil. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The entire game is considered to be end game, by that I mean players will be able to perform and partake in all faction events, **player levels do not define character strength**. Scheduled faction raids or player lunched raids being a highlight of the gaming experience, where guild members can also invite/open to raid to non-guild members to partake in their raids if needed. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; ** IN GAME ROLES:** Player housing: *Understand, you are a warrior and as such forsake a family* \- Personal Housing is instanced within your Factions capital or your Orders Stronghold. \- Guild Housing is an instanced stronghold at your faction capital, the top 4 guilds within an Order will also have a guild Hall within the game world of the Orders Stronghold. &amp;#x200B; **In game building:** In game building, players can shape the battlefield by spending influence and laying down a building plan at a predesigned plot in the game world. These plots could shape a small village in an open piece of land or add to existing defenses at a stronghold or keep. These structures are always vulnerable to attack and can be destroyed, although their defenses are formidable. They provide not only construction options but also vendor options to make resources for their Order/Faction. The player will have to assign a special vendor follower Landlord in order to keep the structure healthy, NPC Orders like The Black Stone Legion would take a tax from all locations that are on their controlled lands, (Resources gained from taxes). There is a set number of building plots within each game zone. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Destroyed locations: All npc resource locations in faction controlled zones can be rebuilt if they have been destroyed. A faction realm quest will need to be completed to start the rebuilding which will require resources and influence to be allocated to complete the reconstruction where by the player can re-acquire a new resource follower. (fill the Building gauge by donating resources to this quest). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Player followers:** *You are a warrior and protector of your people; you do not farm, chop wood or make horse shoes.* Each follower you gain will require a quest to be performed, and cost the player influence to initially hire or replace with exception to guardians. All followers when assigned will become part of the in game world and therefor always vulnerable to attack from opposing factions, if killed they are destroyed and removed from the game. All followers can be upgraded individually at a cost of influence/resources/scrap when not assigned. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; To gain new followers or replace lost ones, (except guardians) a player must complete a quest, the option to hire will be given as a quest reward. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; To maintain followers the player will need to complete a quest or multiple quests for each follower in a 1 week period depending on the zone of the assign follower. (friendly Zone 1 quest, War-torn Zone 3 quests, PvP Zone daily quests). \- Resource Followers: Farmers, miners, traders, craftsmen etc, they will send you resources, but will also call upon your services. &amp;#x200B; \- Guardian Followers: Players can also acquire a set number of NPCs (1 every 10 rep levels of a character, max is 7 at rep 7) that will fight with him or can be set to guard in game locations/caravans. All locations, caravans and players in game have troop slots that can be filled by the player allocating a guardian to the desired troop slot, also locations maintain reserve lists of followers that have been allocated but no slot are available, they are ready to fill the position after 10 minutes. These are bonus troops at the locations and wear your colors. When your guardian is destroyed a new guardian will be replaced after 48hrs, and be ready for assignment. &amp;#x200B; \- Vendor Followers: Vendors turn player looted items into scrap and also turn scrap into resources. Players can hire trade townsfolk to set up shop, at a player built location. So long as the location remains healthy they will remain. A special vendor called Landlord is needed when building upon an open world building slot. (a player will gain influence from a vendor instead of resources, the vendor also pays resources to the controlling Order as a tax). &amp;#x200B; \- Caravans: The supply lines of the realm. Generated by the Order strongholds and sent to the Capitals. There are two types of caravans (1) Routine: Every 4 hours. (2) Triggered: When a set amount is accumulated. (this is an AI action). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Orders/Guilds** The player decides he want to join an Order, he locates the Blackstone legion at their Citadel, completes some basic quests and pledges to their order. He can now fight in their name, expanding the orders control over the land and help to donate resources to this citadel. Players can also upgrade the Order and improve their own guild. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Each Order of a faction will always send resources to the capital periodically via an in game caravan. These resources will be used by the faction to keep its realm healthy, a realm that does not maintain a healthy reserve of resources will fall into ruin. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; As players complete quests and gain influence in the surrounding lands of their Orders Citadel, the Orders control will expand. Orders automatically collect resources as taxes from these locations. A Order can only control lands that are connected to already owned regions. Order influence/resources will identify the top Orders in a faction, and guild players influence/resources gained will identify the top guilds within an Order. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; As part of an Order the player now has access to their Orders Hall where they can interact with all members of the order and the guilds that have sworn to this order. Players will also have an instance room to customize; this room can be upgraded and customized. Players can also establish a guild under this Order, this allows for 2 elements. (1) all guilds get access to an instanced fortress at the capital, which they can upgrade, the top 4 guilds within an order also gain a guild hall in the game world that is part of the orders main citadel, this can also be upgraded. (2) The guild leader can start a guild event  Bastion or Expedition &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Events: There are three different types of events, Faction/Order/Guild.  Faction events are triggered on a scheduled time, the resource stock pile will fill over time as resources are received from the static locations and all strongholds in game, (Caravans).  Order events are triggered by the Orders event stock pile filling over time from the collected resources from its lands and its members dedicating their resources to the event.  Guild events are chosen by the acting guild leader when triggered by the guild members collecting and allocating their resources to the event stock pile.  Player event is chosen by the player, and will trigger when all criteria is met. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **EVENTS** The Event resources stockpile is basically the life span of the event. As troops, equipment and players are destroyed the resource pool will diminish. Once the resources are depleted the ability to maintain it will be gone. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Examples of events: \- Coliseum: Faction Champion/Order Champion/Ultimate Champion, Scheduled events where all who enter fight 1v1 until only one remains. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \- BASTION, pvp zone  Send resources into the pvp zone and build up your keep, continue to collect resources and upgrade this strategic point, defend it when the time comes. This keep will require resources via caravans periodically from the Orders Stronghold and resource donations from players to be maintained, if these caravans/resources are lost over time this will effect to overall health of the Keeps defenses. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \- SIEGE: an army is sent forth to lay siege to an opposing stronghold (instanced event). Each faction has a Siege resource pool (10,000,000) to identify the overall health of their armies during this siege. As instanced games conclude the results impact the siege resources pools. The first faction to lose all resources also loses the SIEGE, if this is a CHAIN EVENT and the attacking army loses, the event ends. The Event icon on the campaign map changes to an Cinematic Icon to show the conclusion of the event.  watch cinematic option - &amp;#x200B; \- GUILD SIEGE: pvp zone  an army is sent forth to lay siege to an opposing player made keep (BASTION) in the pvp zone. (Schedules a vulnerability time for the attack), The guild must plan their attack for the vulnerable time, defenders must plan to defend. This happens in real time in the open game world. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \- PUSH: pvp zone (The is always one path with no guild keeps)  troops push out and attempt to conquer the strategic points in the regions that lead to the opposing factions border stronghold, once reached the PUSH event will turn into a Siege, the goal here is to reduce the stronghold to a ruin where by access into the war-torn zone is gained. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \- Expedition: any zone  gather resources to launch an expedition, travel and overcome specific challenges to reach the BOSS, kill it and plunder and loot its lair for unique rewards. Upon start time a location on the campaign map will open (map Icon shows location), players will be show a path over land and sea to the location. This location will remain open for 6hrs or until completion of the event, win or lose. Once the location is reach the instance event will start, the journey is part of the experience. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; SPECIAL CHAINED EVENTS  PUSH &gt; BREAK &gt; INVADE&gt; PLUNDER&gt; BREACH &gt; RAZE **PUSH&gt;** Faction triggered event at PvP NPC Stronghold(resources donated to the event at this Stronghold), npc troops will move out in an attacking path directly to the Border Stronghold of the opposing faction. Each Border stronghold has an opposing stronghold. All in game strategic locations must be taken to the target stronghold. The attacking faction has the advantage due to the continued waves of npc troops that will be sent out, this provides the opportunity for the target faction players to meet on the field of battle and drain the resources of the EVENT as the PUSH&gt; advances across the region. Players of the Pushing faction can continue to donate resources to the event resource pool during the event life through all stages; this will be required as each siege will require a set value to launch. If any siege is lost by the pushing faction the chain event ends. Once the path is established to the target stronghold BREAK&gt; is triggered. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **BREAK&gt;** Triggered SIEGE event at the Border Stronghold, this is an Instanced event to allow all players to partake. Breaking the stronghold here leads to INVADE&gt; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **INVADE&gt;** A successful BREAK &gt; allows the plundering of the lands in the war-torn zone, this leads to multiple SIEGE events happening one after the other on successful wins of the previous (faction event to SIEGE all of the controlling ORDERs Citadels in the adjacent lands one by one as the event moves to the capital). By successfully turning these citadels to ruins and capturing the in game strategic locations your faction has cleared the flanks from attack. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **BREACH&gt;** Triggered SIEGE event at the Border Stronghold, this is an Instanced event to allow all players to partake. Breaching the Stronghold here leads to RAZE&gt; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **RAZE&gt;** nothing stands before you, move to the capital and SIEGE the jewel, a successful SIEGE event here by the attacking faction will grant great rewards and unique rewards, once the capital has been razed and looted your FACTION will take a trophy of this victory to its own capital granting great resource boosts/buffs for a period of time. Invade/Raze&gt; allows players to move about the opposing factions zones, burning locations once the guards at these locations have been dealt with. The conquering faction will take control of these lands during the event, and lose them as the strongholds are rebuilt and the lands rebel. Each of the many regions within a zone has its own strategic locations and defenses to encourage attacking faction to focus on the attack line to the capital. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Event Types: Scheduled, Triggered and instanced \- Scheduled events: Event is listed with a count down until its start time and provides all info on the event, players will know when to join to be part of this event and it will begin at the allotted time. (ie: The weekend). \- Triggered events: The event start at the time of the trigger. \- Instanced events: Players join multiple on going events which all share the same resource pool. As events end the success is reflected in the amount of resources that are lost from the shared pool. This allows all members to be part of an event, win or lose. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Winning the Faction War** Faction wars are being won by factions that can maintain good resource totals, sack opposing faction locations and completed the chained event to take trophies from the other faction capitals. (Trophies grant exceptional boosts to the capitals resource totals). These chained events are able to continue due to caravans of resources and donations that will restock the event stockpile during build up time. If a faction is starved of resources it will fall to Ruin and life will be harder and its strongholds will be weakened. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Effects of ruin: Bandits will be more common attacking caravans and farms in the friendly regions, and NPC Orders will require quests to be completed to boost resources which will be sent to the capital to help bring the realm back into a healthy economy. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*\*in game mechanic\* obviously no game could support every player being in a single battle, with npc troops and beautiful graphics. Players that enter a Faction event will enter their own instance of part of the SIEGE (multiple battle locations meant to represent different parts of the overall SIEGE), all instances share the same resource pool for the event, however each instance is a separate skirmish with its own life pools and goals, a victory of your skirmish will refill a fraction of your factions event resource pool. A player that drops or quits a skirmish will not be able to rejoin for a set time period. Each player may enter each skirmish once until all skirmish locations have been entered. (Skirmish battles are long 1hr timer). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Destroyed locations: All resource locations in faction controlled zones can be rebuilt if they have been destroyed. A faction realm quest will need to be completed to start the rebuilding which will require resources and influence to be allocated to complete the reconstruction. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Currencies: Resources, Influence, Scrap, Steel** Resources: resources are used to help fuel the realm, upgrade locations, rebuild locations, and supply event triggers as well as fuel the progress of an event. Earning Resources: The life blood of the realm &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \- Player resource can be gained by having the current npc at the location pledge to you or by having a vendor in place. Some resources can also be gained from quests and also the scraping of items through a vendor. \- Orders gain resources by collecting a tax from all vendor transactions, strategic locations and resource locations within its control and player donations. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \- Faction Capitals gain resources from all active locations, arriving caravans and player donations. \- Events gain resources from the passing of time, and player donations. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Zone Resource gains:  Friendly zones generate a small amount of resources daily and require a weekly task from the player.  War-Torn generates a moderate amount of resources daily and requires a task every 36hrs to maintain.

164,vulnerability,forhonor,Black Prior is an over-tuned mess that saps the fun out of every game he's in,0,at6c26,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/at6c26/black_prior_is_an_overtuned_mess_that_saps_the/,2019-02-22 05:09:43,"Honestly I think he's been out long enough for me to have this strong of an opinion on him. Much of the community (that doesn't main black prior) all agree that he's too strong, or that his counter play is non-existent. I want to create a discussion where we can talk about the changes we want to see in him, and hopefully make a better character that isn't just a stronger version of conqueror. I want to talk about his bash, his bulwark stance heal feat, and his revenge sapping feat. His bash is ridiculous. It confirms 20 damage, is 100% safe, is only moderately stamina intensive (if you could call it that), and is 500 ms. There is no other move in this game that has that many advantages (stop before you go on about conq's tracking. What does tracking matter if he can continue spamming the move with no repurcussions? He misses and he just tries again, no sweat of his back). There needs to be a change to this character, otherwise what stops him from just spamming the shit out of shield bash throughout an entire fight, taking out whole chunks of my health as he goes along? We need a rework to this move, so I have two suggestions: 1. vulnerability change: This move is admittedly easier to dodge than conq's shield bash. I'm not exactly sure why, maybe it's more predictable, maybe it's like freeze suggested and it has to do with how much movement is in the animation. Regardless, I think adding gb vulnerability to the move would be overkill. However, I should be able to get a fucking dodge attack off. What is the point of dodge attack if it can't punish a bash of all things? Increase the recovery time following a bash so that it's on level with all the other bashes in the game (that hit less as hard mind you) and decrease the damage to the 15-17 range. It's still formidable, yet not total horseshit. 2. (My personal favourite and actually a suggestion of my friend) Differentiate the move from just a different conq bash. Make it a very, very short range move that black prior can only hit with if he's breathing on you and you're too slow to dodge. Keep it as completely safe, make it more stamina intensive, and turn down the range to the area directly in front of him. I'm talking a shotgun blast where he doesn't move at all. Then reduce the damage to within the 15-17 range and suddenly you have a powerhouse capable of saying ""get the fuck away from me"" whenever he wants. That feels more in line with black prior's personality and defensive playstyle than his current kit does. His bulwark heal feat is very, very good. However I question its power in ganking situations. I know we've all seen this scenario: we beat ass in a 2v1 and suddenly the black prior disengages, hiding in bulwark stance and slowly walking away while healing. You ignore him and he creeps up on you, waiting for a chance to use that unblockable because you've forgotten about him. By this time he's probably got half of his absurdly huge health pool back. He is the only character in this game that can apply pressure by doing absolutely nothing. And while you would say, just gb him. you have to keep in mind that his friend will beat the shit out of you the second you put your guard down. A simple change to this would be to adjust the way that the feat heals during fights. If there is an enemy near by, black prior's heals should come slower while in bulwark stance, or only be able to heal him up to a set amount (say 25) until his immediate area is clear of enemies. This way we don't have two black priors doing their weird turtle gank waiting for you to do something all the while they heal and think they're good for putting you in an unwinnable situation. Finally his revenge cancelling feat. It's level 3, it's strong as fuck, and it's really, really annoying. I understand that a level 3 should be really strong, so how about we increase the cool down and have it quickly drain shields as opposed to immediately removing them? That way you only barely get revenge instead of losing the second you become offensive. What do you all think about this? There is no doubt in my mind that this character is too fucking strong right now, and in fact I feel like he's killing the game with how his playstyle is basic, unpunishable, and almost impossible to beat if they play well. I didn't start playing this game for it to become as casual as black prior makes it, so stop giving bp all these upsides with virtually no weaknesses. Bulwark counter is in a really good spot rn (maybe the damage reduction is bullshit and so is the fact that he can counter moves that aren't targeted at him) but bulwark counter isn't what the focus should be on. tldr: rework bp's shield bash to be punishable or to effectively only be a shotgun blast rework his heal in bulwark stance to adjust the way it heals based on if there are enemies nearby rework his revenge killing feat to quickly drain shield instead of instantly removing it."
165,vulnerability,forhonor,Thoughts on Gladiator in 4v4 game modes,0,aw3b3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/aw3b3k/thoughts_on_gladiator_in_4v4_game_modes/,2019-03-01 21:21:42,"Let the record show I am by no means a professional player. On average I rank around Plat two and frequently get spanked whenever I do (albeit rarely) break into the diamond ranks. With that in mind, lets get started. As most of us probably know, Gladiator is an interesting character. In duels and brawls, he tends to be fairly potent with a healthy mix-up game, one of the best deflects in the game, a decent enough attack speed to damage output, and his zone which is bar none the best in the game for 1 v 1 scenarios. According to the most recent [state of balance](URL (This will be referenced several times) as released by Ubi themselves he is an ""A"" rank duelist which makes him in Ubi's words ""consistently strong"". Unfortunately his fours potential is significantly weaker. For plat and above players, his pick rate is a measly 1.9% (This is fairly consistent with the general population which only selects him 3.2% of the time) in dominion. For comparison that means in plat and above he is only .3% more likely to be picked than Peace Keeper and in the general population he is just marginally higher than Warlord, Shinobi, Nobushi, and once again PK. When looking at Breach these numbers remain consistent once again with only a 2.8% pick rate in the general population, and a 1.6% in plat and above. The numbers dont lie, people simply feel the Glad is much more suited for duel modes over the dominion / breach game types. This is a problem as a character should be viable in both ones and fours, even if they are specifically tooled to be more effective at one or the other. With that in mind, I have a few suggestions that could probably get him moving in the right direction while not breaking him as a character, thematically or otherwise. **Buffs** *Reduce starting light attacks to 400ms and all chained lights to 500ms This is simple enough. Gladiators lights are parry-bait at higher levels of play, and even at the low / entry tiers his chained lights are laughably easy to parry or block. This fix would make his lights a viable opener, and his chains not suicide to use. *Make the sucker punch have super armor after start-up Besides his zone the sucker punch is Glad's only way to truly open an opponent, and it works fine in 1v1 situations. Unfortunately in my personal experience this viability goes away in gank scenarios as I am frequently hit out of it. This is a simple fix that would allow Gladiator to land more consistent openers in hectic situations. *Add superior block on dodges ^(Only under the circumstance his reflex guard is not changed) I really dont think Gladiators reflex guard needs to be changed if this edit is made. His character at its core is meant to be very aggressive and promotes dodging / deflecting attacks. With Ubi making it increasingly difficult to land deflects allowing for a superior block followed by confirmed toe stab or light followup for 10 damage would not only make it safer to dodge in gank scenarios but it could also be a way to help Glad confirm light damage. *Lengthen in reflex guard decay ^(Only if above option is considered too strong) This again is obvious, Gladiators reflex is the worst in the game and actively fades before many heavies land if you change guard on reaction. Again, I do not think this is the only option to fix Gladiator, I just put this in as I can see my previous idea being considered too strong. *Change side heavies to sweeping, raking-like attacks Another obvious issue I see Glad having in fours is his lack of AOE attacks. Even his zone rarely is able to hit several enemies at once which as many of you surely know, is fairly important when it comes to winning ganks. *Skewer in chains soft feint into lights OR heavies from any direction SiC is a fairly good attack at forcing reaction but is also difficult to actually land due to how early into the animation you need to feint it. If omnidirectional heavy and light soft feints are added you can actually make gladiator ""Mix-up intensive"" as his title implies with much harder to read attacks. *Increase movement speed As it stands Gladiator's movement speed is on par with Warden, Raider, Kensei, Lawbringer, Warlord, and several other slower more heavily armored heroes while his fellow assassins are anywhere from .20m/s to .40m/s faster than him. While he doesnt need to be Shinobi quick, it would be nice to see him elevated to the standard of other assassins. **Nerfs** *Remove the ability to feint the actual attack portion of his zone Just as it reads. No hero should have an entirely safe option select move. In its current state even if you wiff the first half of the zone you can entirely cancel the second bit making it fairly difficult to get damage in on a Gladiator that just spams zone and runs to recover stamina. *Add Guard break vulnerability to Skewer start up Similar to Black Priors bulwark slash or Kensei's top heavy mix-up, if buffed Skewer should be open to GBs for the opening frames of its attack as a true counter to the updated move.

166,vulnerability,forhonor,"Soothing Mist got overnerfed, in my opinion.",2,aylcks,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/aylcks/soothing_mist_got_overnerfed_in_my_opinion/,2019-03-08 14:03:09,"Soothing Mist WAS overpowered as hell, not even going to try and deny it. It definitely needed a nerf, needed something to make it feel like you actually NEED to have allies and enemies in proximity to get value out of the Feat. The hero it was on was performing too well in 4v4s, for sure. Regardless, the nerf it got was overkill. The TL;DR on the nerf is that the healing is less than half as potent as before, and the cooldown is doubled meaning it can only be used half as much given you're being optimal and using it briefly after cooldown. That adds up to the Feat being roughly 25% as useful as it was before. The thing to keep in mind about Soothing Mist is that it IS situational. It has a windup that leaves Jiang Jun vulnerable, and requires the proximity of both wounded allies and enemies to be valuable enough to be a justifiable Feat. However, the big problem is that the numbers are neutered so severely that it doesn't have the power to justify its restrictions. You jump through hoops to have other players in proximity and put yourself through the vulnerability for what? Heal you and your buddy by 25 on a GOOD day? You literally need to be in a 3v3 with your whole team wounded for the effect to feel powerful anymore, while also having twice the cooldown. TL;DR on that is it doesn't have a reasonable reward for its stipulations anymore, so I'll bet my bottom dollar that Jiang Juns will just start using Second Wind now, making him, what, hero number 7 that picks Second Wind? Our Feats should be balanced, for sure, but you'd think it'd be cool to leave Feats with unique effects like Soothing Mist powerful enough to be considered, having costs and stipulations but offering meaningful rewards in exchange for fulfilling them, instead of nerfed so badly you have to pick the same vanilla, one dimensional Feat as so many other heroes."

His unblockable heavies are countered by it. This effectively means that he can camp full block against HL to force him into defensive mode. Oh and he heals himself when in this full block stance so if you don't attack or drop offensive mode immediately to apply pressure he gets his health back. Now we're in defensive mode and our fastest attack is 600 ms lights (a joke now that even shugoki has 500 ms lights... let that sink in). Any half way decent player can read and block/parry his defensive heavies (including celtic curse)... so he has no moves to use... highlander can't even hard feint his defensive heavies so once you throw out that 800-1000 ms attack you're fucked. people will be quick to say hl needs his 600 ms lights for crushing counter strike (debatable) but good luck getting a crushing counter strike against turtle supreme that can heal by turtling (WTF was ubi thinking with that ability).... i'm at a loss... rip highlander? gonna be a sad day next week when every other person is vortiger.

But that didn't stopped me from creating an original character with new game mechanics. Wall of text incoming. The Witch- Viking Hybrid. Uses a polearm shaped like a broom. On one side there is a curved blade like a smaller glaive. On the other end there is the broom only made with metal strings. The strings are coated in flammable liquids. Chains and move-set. Sacrifice preparation---Light-Light Hearth Seeker---Light-Heavy Forest Whispers---Heavy-Light Please the Gods---Heavy- Heavy Every chain finisher confirms another light or heavy attack but instead of a normal attack the Witch throws a flask with different effects. Anger of the God---Light Works like Nobushi's third light, does 15 bleed damage. 2 direct, then 4 damage for 3 seconds. Swamp Oils--- Heavy Covers the enemy in flammable liquids for 5 seconds. Does not deal direct damage nor has other effects. Turns the borders of the screen green to make this effect noticeable. Night Witch--- Forward doge heavy(undodgeable) An attack similar to warden's valiant breakthrough, only undodgleable to be more consistent. Spellcasting--- Backwards Heavy (guaranteed from guard-break) A wide unblockable unparriable swipe that deals 12 damage. It is performed by swiping the metal broom on the ground and setting it ablaze. If it hits an enemy which was previously hit by Swamp Oils then it sets the enemy ablaze for an additional 36 damage, 12 fire damage over 3 seconds. Works similar to shaman's bite and gladiators toe stab, normally it would deal only a small amount of damage but if the enemy is primed then it deals a lot more damage. Witch's flight.--- Backwards light. (Has dodge properties) Bounce backwards and throw a Swamp Oil flask forward. The flask comes out only once the bounce was finished. Has guard break vulnerability on start-up. Witch's curse---GB+Throw+GB Works like Centurion's kick after throw. Does not guarantees any damage but does 40 stamina damage and stops stamina regeneration for the enemy for 4 seconds. Witch's domain---Light+Heavy (zone attack) Another undodgeable unparriable attack. Has around 3/5 of Shinobi's ranged attacks distance. Must be dodged. Does only 10 damage but also primes the enemy for Spellcasting and Witch's Curse. Witch's Spell---Charged Heavy+ GB. Throws a Swamp oil flask from range. Reasoning behind everything: The guaranteed hits after any chain finisher are meant to allow further pressure or deal more damage. Spellcasting serves to add pressure and deal damage with turtling enemies. Can be feinted. (Here is where not being sure about balancing comes) Ranged attacks, well Shinobi has them. They have a shorter reach and mostly all forward dodge attacks should close the gap. They are only there to give another way for the Witch to get her Swamp Oils on. Shaman has her deflects as well as her soft feitns and chain finishers. The witch has her chain finishers and ranged attacks. They don't do splash damage so unless they are a direct hit the Oils won't apply. The zone is the third way of applying pressure. It isn't just another fast attack. Instead is is an area denying tool which does splash attack, always right in front of the witch. Useful when ganked to set more enemies ablaze. Last thoughts. Fire was never implemented as a fighting mechanic beside environmental hazards and feats. Although Shinobis are cancerous with their guardbreaks through revenge attacks in ganks I think every factions should have a similar hero just for fighting diversity sake. Yeah, I might have just waited 20 minutes writing all this... "

Yes I've played him and yes I think he's good. However, there's a few let flaws with him: 1. I don't understand what the point of even having the bulwark counter on console is. With input delay, it feels like I get it through luck more than with skill. The only moves I find myself using it on are dodge attacks and occasionally a warden shoulder bash. 2. I feel like it's too easy to punished. I understand the gb vulnerability on the startup of the unblockable, but I don't feel this is necessary on just the stance. When playing against a black prior, all you need to do is a heavy feint into a gb to get free damage. If the black prior tries to go into bulwark, there's literally nothing he can do. I don't feel like it would be too game breaking to at least give him the option to counter the out of neutral bulwark. Other than that, the only things I'd change are the shield bash timings, and fix the bug with the guarenteed bash after light when your enemy is out of stamina."

The focus of this rework is to improve the existing kit of gladiator without having to add many new moves. (Makes it easier for the devs to actually make changes) Help keep the identity of major stamina control, attack consistency, and large mix up potential. And to prevent gladiator from becoming to similar to other characters which is why i think he shouldn't have a bash that guarantees a light. I want as much feedback ##Zone attack * Given 100ms of guardbreak vulnerability during startup * Unfaintable ##Deflect * Skewer on deflect is changed to have variable timing. ""This will allow gladiator to have the same input times as shaman, peacekeeper, shaolin, valkyrie, tiandi. "" ""Currently the skewer can be difficult to startup on time from prediction or reaction to performing a deflect."" (i.e. performing a deflect then inputing the heavy to startup a skewer but doing a normal heavy instead) ##Reflex guard changed to 800ms (from 500ms) ##Sprint attack * Bamboozle does 80 stamina drain (from 12) ""Currently when an opponent dodges the first attack, bamboozle would still miss even if it started after the dodge."" ##Skewer ""Currently skewer is too difficult to hit and opponent, I hope these changes can make it a more viable tool."" * Uninterruptible * On skewer land deals 12 damage (from 4) then deals bleed. (~33 from full bleed duration) This will make skewer do 45 damage total. * Add the ability to soft faint into guardbreak. 400ms from startup. * If parried takes 84 stamina (from 140) * Change Skewer to track through back dodge. (Hidden stance can still avoid) * Skewer is given the ability to break through uninterruptible attacks or stances. (Affects both skewer in chains and in deflect.) ##Chains * All lights normalized to 500ms (The first light was 500ms but the rest in a chain were 600ms making them easy to parry.) * Heavy finishers buffed to 35 damage (from 30) ##Fuscina ictus. Aka toe stab * Remove ability for guaranteed guardbreak when dodging toe stab. ""The ability to get a guaranteed guardbreak when dodging fuscina ictus is too high of a risk compared to the damage"" * Oos toe stab is sped up to 600ms, still reactable but not too easily avoidable as it is currently. ##Sucker punch * Sucker punch acts as a 2nd to last attack in chain and can be immediately followed up by skewer, heavy or Fuscina ictus. (Cannot be followed up by lights however.) - If sucker punch misses cannot follow up with toe stab, can still follow up with heavy or skewer on sucker punch miss. ""If an oos opponent were to dodge the sucker punch the toe stab follow up would be unavoidable crating too strong of an oos pressure. * Sucker punch now costs 10 stamina on hit, (from 24) deals 40 stamina damage (from 30) * Costs 25 stamina on miss (from 42) * Sucker punch now applies a 600ms stun that prevents the startup of dodges (can still block/parry as you can now) this dodge prevention makes toe stab guaranteed after a sucker punch. ##Counter jab * Counter jab heavy becomes unblockable, can still be parried * If the attack that was parried was a light, the counter punch heavy is guaranteed. * Deals 40 stamina damage (from 30) ""Currently there is no reason to ever use it as it guarantees less than doing a neutral light, this way is still doesn't guarantee anything unless its a light parry but will become a viable option."" Created with the help of u/DrFrankendoodle u/The_Filthy_Spaniard And Crackus34 (xbox) Rejected ideas Here are some ideas I've had or suggestions i got but were rejected in favor of something else. * Keep chain lights at 600ms but make enhanced lights (cannot be interrupted by blocking) * Make zone a light parry punish * Make all heavies unblockable * Make sucker punch guarantee a light. ""This would contradict gladiators play-style too much and make him too similar to other characters."" * Making counter punch do 50 stamina damage from 30. ""I settled on 40"" * "

Sure her SB has the same dodge frames as her heavy but I still catch people with both SB and heavy. Her lights are reactable but not easy to parry even with a static guard. Her back dodge SB is solid for ending combos early and Aramusha type feints, even with its GB vulnerability and dodge frames being somewhat wack. Her deflect and dodge attacks are pretty nice for a change to a defensive playstyle, and she has both great 1v1 and gank potential if used write. Does anyone else feel different, if so, I would like to engage in a discussion for different views and overall more knowledge."
180,vulnerability,forhonor,Revenge in its current iteration is heavily flawed and needs a rework from the ground up.,1,a7i6q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/a7i6q2/revenge_in_its_current_iteration_is_heavily/,2018-12-19 13:37:45,"TL;DR Revenge gain changes to prevent gaining it in 1v1's or when out-numbering an opponent , changes to the revenge state to make it more consistent and a change to the over-shield to prevent opponents from turtling the revenge user to death. * Revenge as a whole is a currently heavily flawed system needs to be reworked to make it's intended role as well as prevent abuse of the system itself.. Before we get into how to fix revenge I feel it's important to educate people on how the revenge system currently works to clear up any misunderstandings. - So what exactly does the revenge state do? Well I'm glad you asked , it: -Provides a 30% stack-able universal damage buff for duration. -Gives you a flat 120 over-shield that disappears after revenge duration ends. -On activation auto parries all attacks that can be parried causes enemies to fall down for 1600 ms. 100 ms activation time , you are locked in place for this 100 ms and can be gb'd you can counter gb it though , 900 ms of active frames , any action except movement can cancel this early after 200 ms have passed. - Completely cancels any current momentum on activation. -Provides the uninterruptible status to most moves (Does not get applied to your gb attempts). - Lasts 8 seconds - On activation allows the canceling of almost all recoveries. - Guarantees a guard break if activated immediately after you block your opponents heavy if it has 600 ms or move of block recovery. - On activation allows you to cancel your own gb attempt. -On activation cancels your parry animations granting you more ms to get a punish in. An example would be a zerk parrying a heavy then immediately activating revenge to cancel the parry animation to allow him to get a top heavy off it. - On activation allows you to cancel any gb attempt on you / some cc. - While active provides you with priority over enemy attacks , meaning you can attack or gb an opponent out of anything except another gb ignoring their normal vulnerability windows/recovery times. -While active grants gb immunity when preforming an attack/ while in recovery of your own moves. -While active grants characters using a charging or hold move super armor , meaning gb's will wiff , bashes wont stagger you , unblockable hits wont stagger you , regular hits won't stagger you. - While active causes all parries/throws and some melee attacks to knock enemies down for 1600 ms. _________________________________________________ * So thats what the revenge state currently does , how do you enter it? Well in order to enter the revenge state you have to accumulate enough revenge meter. The amount is different for each warrior and depends entirely on their base total health-pool. - So for example a warden with 130 hp requires 130 points of revenge to enter the revenge state. Where as a Shinobi with 110 health only needs 110 revenge points to enter the revenge state. - So then the obvious question then is how does one accumulate revenge points to add to their revenge meter? Well the answer is somewhat complicated and in order to address it we are going to explain how different types of attacks give different values. - To start any melee attack that doesn't have a set value of damage grants the target a flat 30 revenge to their revenge meter. - Something to note all sources of fire or bleed damage do not get calculated into the revenge equation. - Next for non-melee attacks the amount of revenge score the target gains depends on what the outcome was and what the raw base damage was. For example say I was to hit an opponent with a 40 damage top heavy from warden but the opponent parried this , they would get a different amount of revenge score than if they had simply dodged it , got hit by it , blocked it , or deflected it. -Finally after these calculations are complete a group multiplier is applied to whatever value was achieved before. These multipliers are as follows: For 1v1's =0.2 , 1v2=0.5 , 1v3=0.75 , 1v4=.0.85. _________________________________________________ * So thats currently how the revenge state works and how you gain revenge score to fill up your revenge meter to enter the revenge state. Now i'm going to over the purpose of revenge and its intended use vs the current reality and how to fix some of the broken interactions within this system. - Revenge is intended as a comeback mechanic for when a defender is out-numbered by attackers. It is not something you should try to run away with , it is a tool to stand your ground until your teammates can arrive to help you in a group fight. - Currently there is a glaring oversight in the system that allows players to gain revenge in a 1v1 with an opponent or potentially even allow people who are ganking an individual to gain revenge. As this goes completely counter-intuitive to the purpose of revenge it needs to be corrected. - Furthermore the revenge state cannot be activated when under the effect of certain moves , Faider's fire-man carry , Lawbringer's impale , Shamen's predators mercy and Tiandi's palm strike/dragon kick just to name a few. Currently these types of moves go against the normal rules of revenge activation and deny it , it's entire purpose , to keep you alive when your getting ganked. - Obviously if were going to be fixing revenge these types of exceptions must be removed and revenge must be allowed to activate at any time given the meter is full. - Another glaring issue with revenge is that while you are idle (ie in recoveries) or attempting to preform a gb throw on an opponent you do not get uninterruptible state , despite what the in-game description states. This is bad for several reasons and unfairly makes warriors with low recoveries and repeating/long chains much better then those without them. - A simple fix to this issue is to ditch the current hyper armor you get while doing attacks in revenge and instead apply a passive super armor while in revenge. What this means is that you cannot be hit-staggered by a melee or a regular attack and gb's wiff when attempted. Think of juggernaut but without the auto-cgb part or the damage reduction/slow-down. -Aside from these issues one of the biggest things preventing revenge from doing its intended purpose is the fact that intelligent enemies can simply roll away from you once you activate revenge and wait your overshield out. Denying you the opportunity to utilize revenge. - In order to combat this type of behavior a player existing revenge should keep half of whatever remaining revenge overshield they have left for 30 seconds or until the next revenge activation is achieved. What this would effectively do is make is much harder to whittle down an opponent while ganking them , then run away to deny revenge its intended purpose. __________________________________________________ * What these changes will ultimately do is put more control and player agency back into the hands of the player being ganked. While also solving some of the more frustrating aspects of the current revenge system. Ultimately a win-win for everyone. At the end of the day this is a game and nobody enjoys losing to something out of their control. These changes will significantly impact the death-ball meta were in making it harder to just roll over someone. - Sources for information , other then personal testing.

Abilities that serve no purpose but to drag out the fight (Block shove, passive HA) should not exist under any circumstances. Characters like Shugoki really need some love and Conquerer needs some toning down. The main point here are OPTIONS, one dimensional movesets are just bad for the game, even if they're incredibly good and/or annoying to fights (Bash only Conquerer, crashing charge warlord). Some things, mostly the 50ms increments are just an idea to make very spammy characters, well, less spammy. I'm by no means an expert on all characters (especially nobishi, orochi, valk, just the ones with not as many ideas) so if you have something to add, feel free to leave it in the comments. this could actually turn out as a full and comprehensive list of ideas and potential changes. The Wu-Lin are a whole other topic but I believe they only need some minor adjustments, if any. &amp;#x200B;"
182,vulnerability,forhonor,My pitch for a Star Wars/For Honor crossover game,1,a9sypr,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/a9sypr/my_pitch_for_a_star_warsfor_honor_crossover_game/,2018-12-27 09:16:09,"Star Wars: Warriors of the Force (working title) Ubisoft/Disney collaboration - &amp;#x200B; Using the AnvilNext 2.0 engine, Warriors of the Force would transfer the fighting system of For Honor to the Star Wars Universe. The game is set during the time of the Old Republic, when Sith where as prevalent as Jedi and both sides are at constant war with each other. The player chooses a faction to represent to gain rewards and during events, similar to the For Honor faction war. The faction war map is represented as a star map of the galaxy, with each faction fighting for control of planets. Regardless of the chosen faction, players will still play a mixture of Jedi and Sith. &amp;#x200B; Rather than a selection of individual heroes, the player creates their own Jedi and Sith character, choosing a race and gender. Fighting methods are based on choice of lightsaber style, combat stance forms and force powers. Combat itself works in a very similar way to For Honor, utilising the input direction to choose blocking and striking directions, mixing up guard breaks, dodge/dodge attacks, feints and parries. New additions to combat are the ability to jump to higher places when not locked on, increasing the verticality of gameplay and map design. The other is the ability to use force powers, similar to feats and abilities in For Honor but with a greater effectiveness and impact on combat. &amp;#x200B; Combat, lightsabers and Force Powers: &amp;#x200B;  Shii-Cho - The basic lightsaber form, classified as the Vanguard class for the game. This style is basic but adaptable, with straightforward and direct attacks and bashes. E.g. Warden, Raider. (Single saber, guard front stance) &amp;#x200B;  Makashi - The duellist lightsaber form, classified as the Assassin class for the game. This style is fast, utilising dodges/dodge attacks, counter strikes and high damage with less defence. E.g. Orochi, Tiandi. (Curved lightsaber hilt, single saber, open stance) &amp;#x200B;  Soresu - The defensive lightsaber form, classified as a Hybrid class for the game. This style is a mixture of 2 other styles, combining the power and high defence of the heavy and the straight forward approach of the Vanguard/Shii Cho. Based on a strong defence and perfect counters. E.g. Lawbringer, Kensei. (Single saber, palm forward stance, lightsaber overhead) &amp;#x200B;  Ataru - The offensive lightsaber form, classified as a Hybrid class for the game. This style is an acrobatic mixture of 2 other styles, combining the aggressive bashes/kicks and disabling abilities of the vanguard with the fast, dodge based attacks of the assassin. E.g. Shaolin, Nobushi. (Duel lightsabers, aggressive stance) &amp;#x200B;  Djem So - The heavy lightsaber form, classified as the Heavy class for the game. This style is based around a strong defence, with enhanced block during dodges, bashes, stamina punishment and very strong heavy attacks. E.g Conqueror, Shugoki. (Cross guard saber, strong guard stance) &amp;#x200B;  Vaapad - The Mix up specialist form, classified as a Hybrid class for the game. This style is an aggressive mixture of the assassin and vanguard, using dodge attacks, feints and bash mix ups to confuse and control opponents. E.g Gladiator, Valkyrie. (Double-bladed lightsaber, side stance) &amp;#x200B; Each style has a visibly different stance and lightsaber to allow the opposing player to determine what they are up against. &amp;#x200B; Lightsaber construction and character creation - &amp;#x200B; Players can create up to 12 playable characters, consisting of 6 Jedi and 6 Sith. Upon creating a new character in one of the available slots (4 slots available from level 1 to 20, 8 slots from 21 to 40 and 12 slots from 41 to 60), the player is greeted by the option to choose their Race (Human, Zabrak, Twi'lek, Rodian, Quarren, Chiss, Sullustan, Kel Dor, Nautolan.) Species choice comes with different options for skin colours and head types (including masked/hooded variations.) Body styles are a selection of robes and armours, broken up into sections (Body, arms, legs.) Depending on the class you chose for your character slot, you will be given a different lightsaber variant (Standard, Curved hilt, Duel sabres, Cross guard, Double bladed.) As you play, you will be rewarded with different armour/robe parts, head types for your race and lightsaber components. Lightsabers are split into 3 parts - The pommel, grip and blade(s). There are a variety of combinations for each lightsaber type. Sith characters have red lightsaber blades, with purple and black as well as unstable variations of each being unlockable. Jedi have blue lightsabers, with green and white being unlockable, as well as pulsating variations. &amp;#x200B; Force powers and abilities - &amp;#x200B; The player has the ability to jump great heights by pressing Y/Triangle to initiate the jump and holding it to increase the height until desired or max height is achieved. Jumping adds a new layer of combat to the For Honor system, allowing for jumping attacks as an opening move, flipping over the enemy and escaping combat. It also adds new layers to map design. Fall damage is decreased in this game compared to For Honor. It is not a factor when dropping to a lower part of the map or being thrown from one ledge to a lower area. The later however will cause the player to land in a position of vulnerability to drop attacks. Death will still occur if pushed off a cliff at the edge of a map or into a pit/trap. Force powers replace feats and are a more integrated part of the combat system. Each power is linked to a D-pad button (Right, upper and left) and various powers can be equipped and upgraded. The bottom D-pad button is a ""Force block"" that drains stamina as it is held. When successfully blocking a Force attack, the blocking player will not receive the effects of the attack, but will have a chunk of stamina damaged and receive a slight knock back effect, leaving them vulnerable for a second. Force powers can change the flow of combat but take time to recharge. Some also have a window of charge up, leaving the user at risk. They will recharge faster when a player is being ganked, acting in a similar way to revenge, allowing the player to even the odds. Using any force power resets the charge times for all powers, reducing force power spam. All force powers incur some stamina drain based on their effectiveness. &amp;#x200B; Light and Dark powers: &amp;#x200B;  Force Push - Sends out a wave within an area in front of the player, sending any enemies caught in blast (That are not force blocking) flying backwards. Useful for clearing away enemies during a gank or sending an enemy off a ledge, into a trap or wall splat. Force push has a small, visible charge up. This allows enemy players to prepare a force block or interupt the attack. Has a long reset time.  Force Pull - Pulls a single targeted enemy flying towards the player, leaving them open to a heavy attack or guard break. Also has a small charge up time. Same force blocking rules apply. Has a medium reset time. &amp;#x200B;  Force Speed - Allows the player to run faster for a short time. Has a short reset time. &amp;#x200B;  Force Repulse - Sends out a blast wave around the player, knocking any enemies not blocking backwards a few paces. Not as powerful as force push, but has almost no charge up time. Excellent for countering a gank. Has a long reset time. &amp;#x200B;  Force Grip - Grips a single target and suspends them in the air while slowly doing small amounts of damage over time. The player must stay locked on the enemy to keep the grip in place and is vulnrable to attack from other players. The player can still slowly walk around with the left stick. Suspension animation for light side (target flails), choking animation for dark side (target grasps at their throat). While holding an enemy, the player can use the right stick to slowly move them left, right, forwards or backwards to place them over a trap or ledge. The player on the receiving end must mash the guard break button to reduce the time they are kept in the grip. The power has a visable charge up time and slow recharge time. &amp;#x200B;  Lightsaber throw - Hurls the players weapon at the enemy, dealing the same damage as a heavy strike. This power cannot be stopped by a force block. Instead, if you are guarding to the right and initiate a saber throw, the enemy will receive damage as an attack from that direction. If the enemy is blocking in the correct direction then the attack will be blocked and the throwing player will immediately pull their saber back to them. If the enemy manages to parry the thrown saber, the saber will be knocked to the ground and deactivated. The throwing player will retrieve their lightsaber using the force automatically but it will take longer, leaving them vulnerable to attack. &amp;#x200B; Light powers: &amp;#x200B;  Mind trick - Afflicts a single locked on enemy, causing their guard widget to be reversed. Attacks from the right side are displayed as overheads, overheads as left side attacks and left attacks as right. Has a visible charge up and a long reset time.  Alternate mind trick - Afflicts the enemy with a brief blinding effect similar to the effect of being kneed in the face by Raider in For Honor. A blinding flash followed by removal of the HUD for a couple of seconds. Has almost no charge up and medium reset time. &amp;#x200B; Dark powers: &amp;#x200B;  Force lightning - Fires a stream of electricity at a single locked enemy. The damage will be displayed in the direction the attacking player was guarding from, similar to a lightsaber throw. If the defending player fails to block in time, the electricity will stun them for a moment and inflict medium amounts of damage over time. The effect only lasts for a couple of seconds. If the player manages to block in the correct direction, the stun and damage is stopped. However, blocking with a saber drains a large portion of stamina. If the defending player uses a force block, the block is guaranteed regardless of direction but also drains a large portion of stamina. Blocking force lightning with a force block increases the speed that the defending players force powers recharge. The effect is similar to Yoda's absorption of lightning. Force lightning has a short charge up time and slow recharge time and leave the player vulnerable to attack from other players when being used. As it does good damage over time and drains the enemy stamina but also risks being attacked and can ""charge up"" the enemies force powers, it is a risk vs reward power. Force powers can be used to stop a retreating player, help escape a gank or help a ganked ally. Synergizing Force powers can be used to devastating effect. They have slow recharge time to stop this type of thing being spammed. However, one player could force grip an enemy while another shocks them with lightning and a third player throws a lightsaber at them. However, such an assault would mean that the enemy player being attacked (assuming they survive) would have their force power cool down reduced and almost the entire teams force powers are now on a long cool down for the sake of killing one player. It can be advised to save force powers and use them to get out of tight spots. This creates a rock paper scissors dynamic for the usage of force powers. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"
183,vulnerability,forhonor,Balancing the Heroes myself,1,ab8n5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/ab8n5s/balancing_the_heroes_myself/,2019-01-01 03:32:53,"In this post I will adress a few heroes who I personally think need changes. Please go down in the comments and tell me how you disagree or agree with me. Aramusha: -Opener: Neutral side heavies can be soft feinted into a kick with guarantees a light. I want to make this opener original so I made it a bit different: the kick is real slow and way easy to react to. But it has undodgable properties. The way for the enemy to counter this kick is to light him out of it. Aramusha can however once again soft feint this kick into a blade blockade (A triple feint like tiandi) (this makes blade blockade not as dead). You could counter aras feint into Blade Blockade by for example heavy feint into gb if you read him right. -Deadly feint lights obviously need undodgeable property, being able to back dodge it all is retarded. -can give blade blockade property to heavies (Only combod heavies or heavies after a heavy feint) this also counts for the dash heavies. Getting hit during these heavies gives ara blade blockade (I am basically trying to make the sick feint into blade blockade plays easier to pull of) Conqueror: -Whiffed SB has more recovery so punishing with GB is easier -When enemy is OOS the bash no longer drains the enemies stamina but it halts the recover Warden: -3rd stage SB can not be feinted as late Berserker: -Whiffed heavies cannot be chained into zone, we should get the gb fair and square after a dodge -Zone cannot chain into anything Raider: -Zone has now 100 ms gb vulnerability -Potentionally could have a little more stamina than the rest of the cast -L H H / L H L / H H L chains The third light in a chain will be 400 ms (Basically animation of poke with back side of pole) perhaps that light only does 12 dmg Shoalin: -top light is 500 ms Warlord: -Heavy Heavy chain (second heavy has full Hyper Armor) Shinobi and Warlord out of lock needs changing but im not gonna be spending any time on them as the devs said they were planning on doing so Nobushi: -lights are 500 ms Valk: -Sweep is useless, it can only be achieved through a chain so a soft feint into gb shouldnt be so unfair PK: -Any attack can be chained into her zone Shugo: -Remove passive hyper armor -Add demon aura, gets removed after shugoki blocks or gets hit but regains after he connects any hit (block or hit) -Remove knockback from heavy after gb -remove headbutt aswell (as they were tools for passive hyper armor) -a heavy with demon aura that hits guarantees a light, the light can be dodged but be wary as shugoki can chain a gb after a heavy (Its basically LBs tool but its not acquired via turtling) Not really sure about this havent put much thought into him Ofcourse this is not all the balancing FH needs LB is a stupid design a should be overhauled from scratch he is litterally turtling the hero Nuxia is a stupid design the only thing she has is 400 ms chained lights, her traps are reactable but cannot even be countered if you play valk, HL, warlord, warden Gladiator is only his zone Centurion cant attack but his offense is way too safe so fighting against him is a pain in the *** And more Any questions please ask them Please give your opinion about this I would like to see what everyone thinks, maybe eventually we can have a real guide for the devs to balance heroes "
184,vulnerability,forhonor,"Lawbringer ""Rework"" Using Only His Existing Moves",1,9w15nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/9w15nd/lawbringer_rework_using_only_his_existing_moves/,2018-11-11 15:50:48,"*I posted this in the other subreddit yesterday, and someone suggested that I post it here, so here we are.* So, I'm aware that these are for the most part pointless, but I just want to get a few ideas out there regardless. Also, as suggested in the title, nothing here will include new animations/moves, although LB probably needs them to be viable, but nevertheless, here are my ideas: **Basic Attacks** - Opening side lights speed increased to 500ms (from 600ms). *600ms+ lights that have no added property have little to no use* - Zone attack damage increased to 25. *Helps to balance the risk-reward* - Zone attack can be feinted. *Without the ability to feint this will almost always be parried* - Zone attack now 700ms (from 900ms?). *Allows LB an option-select to beat feint-GB due to only 100ms vulnerability* - Zone has hyper-armor starting at 500ms. *I believe this allows for trading with feint-light. If not, still useful for team fights* - Opening side heavies have hyper-armor starting at 600ms, top heavies at 700ms. *I was reluctant to add this to avoid just slapping hyper-armor on everything, but based on feedback it is reasonable for his damage.* **Chain Finishers** - All have hyper-armor 200ms into the attack. *Similar to Kensei, this prevents being hit with a light attack* - Light damage increased to 20 (from 15). *The damage was too low compared to the difficulty of landing this* - Light speed increased to 500ms (from 700ms). *600ms+ lights that have no added property have little to no use* - Blockable heavies damage increased to 35 (from 30). *Damage was too low for getting this far in a chain* - Guaranteed light following Blockable top-heavy counts as chain-starter. In addition, this can also be accessed by landing the side heavies. *Allows LB to keep up the pressure if he manages to land this* - Improved tracking of unblockable heavy. *Should prevent back-dodge avoiding this* **Shove** - Shove-on-block removed. *This is a no-brainer and eliminates the unhealthy playstyle* - Blocked heavies can follow-up with a shove. *This gives LB's heavies a bit of pressure and increases his offensive capabilities* - Dodge-shove speed increased to 500ms (from 700ms). *For a move that guaranteed nothing, it was very slow. This gives it a reasonable chance to hit* - Shove can be triggered from a forward dash at 100ms. *Reduces the overall time needed for a shove* - Shove into heavies track back-dodge on indicator. *Prevents simply back-dodging on indicator* - Shove-heavy-feint-GB tracking improved. *A basic flaw that hasn't been fixed for nearly 2 years* - Follow-up top light from shove is 400ms, 12 damage. Only applies after shove, not in regular chains. *This allows LB a way to beat people who can on reaction consistently avoid his shove follow-ups* **Long-Arm** - Speed increased to 800ms (from 1000ms). *While still very slow, increases its likelihood of landing. A 100ms delay before being able to use this off a parry, to prevent use on heavy parry. This move needs to be kept reasonably slow to avoid completely dominating ganks* - Super-armor (counters bashes) during 200-600ms. *Due to shove from dodge, LB has a hard time countering bashes. This gives LB a way to counter bashes in a way similar to dodge-GB, while also giving this move a use. Apart from ganks, this move is not intended to be used offensively in a 1v1* **Parry Follow-ups** - Impale damage reduced to 15 (from 20). *Now the top-heavy is the optimal punish for a light parry, while also slightly toning down his potential heavy parry punish* - Zone attack unblockable. *Adds pressure to external attackers* - Zone unbalances opponents, but out of range for a heavy. *Gives LB some breathing room and better stalling ability. This would however guarantee a heavy if the opponent is already near a wall, so perhaps the opponents get up sooner, so that only a light attack is guaranteed, resulting in a total of 40 damage as opposed to 55* - Top unblockable has hyper-armor starting 200ms into the attack. *Allows better use in ganks/team fights.* Well, I think that's all. Let me know what you think, but keep in mind the idea here is to improve LB while trying not to add anything. Thanks for reading. Edit: I added some things based on feedback, and below I just want point out things that LB needs outside of his existing kit: **New Moves** - Impaling Charge Alternate: A forward dash heavy that can be used 300ms into the dash. 500ms, 15 damage. Always comes from the right. *Allows LB a better way to deal with rollers from his shove mix-ups* **New Chains** - L, L, L: 15, 15, 20. *Currently after a light LB must use a heavy. Decreases predictability* - H, H, L: 30, 30 (35 Top), 20. *Currently after a heavy LB must use a light. Decreases predictability* - H, H, H: 30, 30 (35 Top), 45 (Unblockable). *Another way to access the unblockable* - L, L, H: 15, 15, 35. *Another way to access the 'Swift Justice Finisher'* All lights are 500ms. All blockable side heavies are 800ms. All blockable top heavies are 900ms. All unblockable heavies are 1100ms."
185,vulnerability,forhonor,Tiandi dodge bug/suggestions,1,9xzxum,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/9xzxum/tiandi_dodge_bugsuggestions/,2018-11-18 07:59:31,"The light dodge attack: Is not Dodging, at all, if you want to dodge you need to extend the a loot the attack (Inconsistent) the blocking mechanic of the light is on prediction is almost imposible to do it on reaction, if you fail you it will impact you because you can not dodge either. ( my suggestin is make the blocking mechanic work early in the dodge or make the dodge actually dodge something ) The heavy dodge attack: Is not Dodging either because the iframes are inconsistent whit de side heavys and side light ( it allaways dodge heavy and light coming from the top and all kind of bashes ) the dodge have a guard brake vulnerability from the beginning to the middle of the dodge (Consider that the dodge is super long) my suggestion is make the iframe work from the beginning to the end of the dodge , and the guard brake vulneeability just in the beginning, (like kensei dodge works )"
186,vulnerability,forhonor,Gameplay elements to counter bashes,1,9y4wb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/9y4wb2/gameplay_elements_to_counter_bashes/,2018-11-18 21:04:11,"The main problem with bashes is they have very few counters. That is, while most attacks can be superior blocked, dodged, blocked, deflected, parried, etc. depending on the attack. Bashes can only be countered by premptively attacking, or dodging. Thus, to compensate, perhaps three new elements be added to the game: 1) More Super Armour attacks: attacks that not only go through attacks, but also bashes. They are more powerful than hyper armour, so should be doled out more sparingly, however should not be on only super slow attacks, but also faster attacks and maybe even special lights. One such move Id really like to see is LBs longarm receive such superarmour, or maybe even just a bash armour that eats through bashes but not attacks. Or add that to his top light, to allow it to intercept bashes and go through them. 2) Sex Attacks: Moves that thrust out the sword or such that create an active hitbox for a long or indefinite duration. The parry hitbox is a bit further out, thus the enemy can walk close to it and parry it easily, but dodging forward or bashing into it will result in pain. Specifically, would like to see such a move on Nobushi (can hold lights), and maybe warden. 3) Full or extended gb vulnerability on SOME (not all) bashes: such as shinobis slide or warlords charge they are gb vulnerable, thus can be countered by a predicted gb. Whether that gb is counter able or not depends also on the move. 4) Alternatively, some characters (namely heavies who should be able to withstand a bash or have bad dodges, such as aramusha, Shugoki, and LB, maybe Cent), could perhaps be given superior gb, which allows a certain part of their guardbreak to counter bashes though this would have to be done before the bash hits, or right when it does, with strict timing. It does mot necessarily have to reward a guardbreak either, as that could be a bit too powerful, but, say, a shove for Lawbringer, a jab for Cent, etc. It could also be attached to other moves instead for instance, Aramusha could instead have this superior gb property to his top light in the same vein of wardens top light, except it counters bashes instead and maybe rewards him the nose punch, or add this to The beginning of LBs shove, or Nobushis forward dodge. These arent meant to shutdown bashes completely, and they would need tweaking (as some bashes, like Cents or Galds punches, do not need such counters), but having ways to deal with bashes more than just fast light or dodge correctly would be nice and, I think, open up gameplay to more options, as well as compensate heavies who do not have nor otherwise need dodge attacks (afterall, a fist or headbutt into full-plate steel armour should be a bit less effective than ramming into a little leather-clothed girl, right?), as well as buffing those at the bottom right now (who, most of all, are at a lack for answers to bashes). As far as Nobushi, I know she is already defensively good, but her main game should be spacing some tools such as sex attacks seem natural to her logic (naginata sticking out) and design (keeping enemy at bay). Thoughts?"
187,vulnerability,forhonor,Every problem I have with every hero in For Honor.,1,a0xu30,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/a0xu30/every_problem_i_have_with_every_hero_in_for_honor/,2018-11-28 05:58:16,"Starting with the knights: Warden: Warden suffers from having a mediocre moveset but one very good tool- his shoulder bash. The problem with his shoulder bash is that it forces the opponent to read, but even if the opponent reads correctly, the Warden can just feint to avoid paying for his gamble. 50/50s are not bad for the game, and I happen to think they are necessary for the future of the game as player skill gets higher and higher and everything is reactable. A bash that confirms damage is nice to have, especially from neutral. Having variable timing options is also nice. (See conquerers shield bash) Being able to feint it is even BETTER. But when you can punish a player for reading you correctly, theres a problem. Also, the fact that you literally fly thirty feet through the air during valiant breakthrough is preposterous. The range on VB deserves to be cut down by a bit, because its in line with PKs forward dodge heavy. Conquerer: Conquerer is the strongest hero in the game. An option select zone that doesnt even need to match the opponents guard stance? Thats tasty. So is a shield bash with variable timing that confirms damage. Many people gripe about conquerers shield bash, but it is nowhere near as bad of an offender as wardens. The only problem is how late it can be inputted. At this moment, conquerer can delay his input on the bash for 300 ms. This means that if the opponent dodges correctly in anticipation of the bash, conquerer can delay the input and still hit them. That means there is a 33% chance of the opponent avoiding damage, entirely on prediction. Those numbers are too low, my guy. Peacekeeper: RIP peacekeeper. She used to be so overpowered that she was a walking meme. (Anybody remember shmolty?) Now, she is a shadow of her former self. I picked her up again today just to stay familiar, and I changed my mind about some things. For one, her damage output isnt really that low. Not in a 1v1 scenario. Yes, a lot of her damage comes from bleed, but thats kind of her thing. I would still like to see a damage buff for pks heavy attacks, but only by a little. Just enough to kill at 1 bar of health (25 hp). Same goes for her dodge heavies. But the biggest problem is her stamina. Wait, what stamina? Exactly. You get 1 combo with PK before you have to back off. This makes using her an agonizing cycle of (do pitiful amount of damage) -&gt; (back off for ten seconds) -&gt; (repeat). She needs a lot more stamina. Lastly is that she cant get a heavy off of GB (to incentivize the kidney stab). This isnt awful, but it means that if you have low stamina, your GB punish is laughably weak. I would suggest allowing a heavy off of GB, even if it doesnt do as much damage as the triple stab. This would also allow PK to get a decent punish against heroes with the thick blood feat. Lawbringer: Walking meme. First, shove on block is cancer. It incentivizes turtling, and makes any offense against him not initiated with a bash suicide. Remove that shiz. Next is his offense. His offense is lackluster. Pitiful range, a neutral bash that I can get up and make a sandwich before having to dodge, (THAT DOESNT EVEN GUARANTEE DAMAGE) and limited chains. This guy just doesnt have anything to work with. His lights are too slow and his heavies have no range. How would I fix him? Im not a dev, but I would start by making his noggin boop 400 ms. Make his side lights either 500 ms or give them superior block. Scrap shove on block completely, and speed up his neutral shove to 500 ms (200 ms into dodge). Give him hyper armor on chained heavies (starting at 400ms) and give that boi something to make his long arm useful. maybe let him soft feint heavies into long arm, and buff its tracking a little. Centurion: I N C R E D I B I L I S. Centurion is in a weird spot. Being a noobstomper, you dont want to buff him too much, or the memes will come back, but he does need something to be competitive. I would suggest a speed buff for his legion kick, for starters. Everyone likes a 50/50, right? But with that should come the cost of variable input timing. Right now, Cent can delay his kick for a good bit, which is necessary right now considering how slow the kick is. But players with a pulse can dodge it on reaction, and so lets buff that boi. The only thing I would suggest besides that is a small health buff. Centurion has a full breastplate, why does he have assassin health? Gladiator: His chained lights are parry bait, his punch guarantees nothing, but his zone is very good. So: speed up his chained lights, let him get a light off of punch, and take away the feintability of his zone. You miss? Oh well, its basically free damage, so if you missed, you deserve to eat some. Aside from that, I think Gladiator is pretty good. I cant hate on him. Raider: Raider would be good, but he needs 500ms lights, and his zone/heavy into stunning tap shouldnt be beaten by a dodge on the first attacks timing. If you dodge too early you should get an oof on the noggin. Aside from that, I think raider is okay. His zone is a decent opener, but it costs too much stamina to use a lot. I guess thats why stunning tap is a thing. Warlord: Warlord is pretty good up until high-level play, and even then he has a decent amount of potential. The only thing I would do for him is give him some three-move chains. a heavy-&gt;light-&gt;heavy, light-&gt;heavy-&gt;light, and heavy-&gt;heavy-&gt;light. He needs to be able to put pressure on people with more than just his headbutt. Berserker: My problem with everybodys favorite homeless man is the hyper armor on his 400ms lights (which he can access instantly from heavy feint). I dont mind them being fast, but the hyper armor? Really? Is that necessary? I heard someone on here talking about well if he didnt have hyper armor on his feinted lights, he wouldnt be able to trade with characters like warlord or highlander Well how about this? LET THE HEAVY FLY, and then chain another one! Boom, instant hyper armor. Yall love to complain about a hero until your main gets called out. Zerk has plenty of tools, He can do without HA on 400ms lights out of a feint. That is overtuned. Valkyrie: What is damage? Asking for a friend. No but seriously, no heavy attack should do less than 25 damage. That is just absurd. Other than that, I dont think Valk is in too rough a spot. Highlander: Balanced, as all things should be. My only complaint is that his kick should have some recovery frames on it. Nothing is worse than dodging the kick, attempting to GB...and then you eat another kick. Feels bad man. Shaman: Her damage nerf put her in her rightful place. Some say shes weak, but lets see, she has a feintable, unblockable opener that wallsplats, dodge heavies, soft feints into bleed, confirmed double hit lights, you see where Im going. Shaman is in a good place. Kensei: Epitome of balance. All kneel to the golden example of a well-designed moveset. Shugoki: *raughs in japanese* Okay, where do I start? Lets go with his chains. Wait, he has chains? Yeah, two, two hit chains. We need to pump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers. Lets give him light-&gt;heavy-&gt;heavy, and heavy-&gt;heavy-&gt;heavy. Oh and heres the kicker. Allow him to charge ANY heavy, combod or not, making it a finisher. What about the headbutt? Well, make the headbutt dodgeable, nerf the stam drain, but make it guarantee a light. Remove passive hyper armor, for it is cancer. Give all his heavy openers Hyper armor at 400 ms, and chained heavies start with it. Demons embrace... Lets get rid of some of that recovery time, and the health penalty for missing it. Missing it should net a guardbreak, just like shamans pounce, and no more. Also, no more critical health insta-kills. I shouldnt have to explain why. Orochi: Mr light spam himself. What should we do with you? Well, for one, I would make his top light 400 ms, and all side lights, combod or not, should be 500. (Im not a fan of combod 400 ms lights, if you cant tell by now) I know that Orochi needs an opener guys, but I cant think of one at the moment. Maybe tozens kick, but without the unbalancing? Make it guarantee a light? Im not sure. Im not big on assassins having bashes, it goes against the whole concept of Orochi. Aside from that, I think hes fine. His damage is good, he has decent stamina, and good chains. I really have no problem with him. (Oh yeah. A curse on Kiai, and everyone who uses it.) Nobushi: Again, a well balanced hero. Her only problem is that her lights are parry bait. Aside from that, she is a decent hero. Good damage, and hidden stance is versatile. Way of the shark means big punishes if you play your cards right near a wall. Shinobi: I really have nothing to say about shinobi. I dont see them enough to know what to gripe about, even though I have two reps on her. Does shinobi have GB vulnerability on the backflip? If she doesnt she definitely should. Other than that, not a peep from me. Aramusha: Its a pity that all of his deadly feints can be beaten by a backdodge, but if they couldnt, he would be my least favorite hero to fight against. I really dont know what else to say about him. Damage is NICE on those heavy finishers, which actually seem to land quite often. Blade blockade is nice for styling on fools, but its a bit lackluster without a wall nearby. Tiandi: 400ms chain lights. Why. Here is one of the only times I think feintable dodge attacks work, because his arent really that overbearing. The 29 damage off of a heavy parry is a little much, though (unlock tech). If you dodge the kick, it should guarantee a GB. I know it doesnt get him anything in a 1v1 UNLESS theres a wall nearby. In which case a forward dodge light/possibly heavy. But I stand firm. Ol boi does a split to kick me to the moon, but if I dodge, no GB? Ludicrous. Now about his tiger dodge, that boi is way too fast. He is a vanguard, he should not have a faster dodge light than orochi and gladiator, especially since it has superior block properties. Also: Someone please gag female tiandi. I would rather hear two feral cats with rabies heeding natures call than that womans voice. Jiang Jun: I know it has been said a million times, but ol boi moves too fast/much to be a heavy. I dont really care about his damage. hes a heavy, I get that. But his speed and mobility are a little much. Why can a heavy hero soft feint a dodge attack into a 400 ms light? Why does a heavy hero have a dodge attack? All good questions, Jimmy. It is because god has forsaken us. God has forsaken the knights for losing the faction war consecutively. Also, 28 damage unconditionally off of a heavy parry is a little extreme. I could do with like, 25. Lastly, I know the devs are working on it, but those animations, man. getting ganked by Jiang Juns is like playing with splinters underneath your fingernails, all because those unblockable bois hit you before the weapon even connects. Actually, one last thing. The timing on JJs oos parries is a nightmare. Nuxia: *screams in 400ms light spam* I know that light spam isnt necessarily a problem to the top players, but to average joe with a ps4 pro, nuxia is a holy terror. Her traps arent terrible in a 4v4, but in duels, theyre pretty useless. I can GB a nuxia out of her traps fairly consistently, or emote if I want to be safer. I honestly dont know what to do with this one. Not enough experience with her, I suppose. Shaolin: At last, we come down to monkey boi. So, first things first. Damage. On his triple light, 24 is a bit much. I would suggest going 12-&gt; 6-&gt;4. 22 is acceptable, and keeping the second hit at 6 damage means that if shaolin wants to go into Qi stance after the second hit, he still did decent damage prior. The top light after sun kick is a bit high at 20, though. I would knock that down to around 15-16, due to the damage being basically guaranteed if hitstunned. Next is his Qi stance side heavies. He should not be able to feint those, as fast as they are. My reasoning? Because sunkick/Qi side heavy is a legit 50/50, and no character should be able to avoid the consequences of a gamble. Lastly, Im still not a fan of 400 ms chain lights. But thats just like, my opinion, man. I know this was a long read. If you made it this far, you deserve a cookie. Go tell someone who cares about you that I said that."

If I simply stand there, he could feint the heavy to a guardbreak. However I can beat this with a dodge attack, but that would of course be beaten by a feint into parry. My question is: Can I react to his guardbreak indicator with my dodge attack? Since I'm already in a dodge, does the swiftstrike attack portion itself have 100ms of vulnerability still?"

Why? Here are several reasons: All of them have a mixup-able (except nuxia) dodge attack for some reason, even JJ which is a HEAVY. Tiandi has too many and mixups moves for a vanguard. Shaolin has Qi stance which he can do atleast 10 different combos/mixups just from doing a backstep light. Tiandi has the fastest dodge attack in the game which has very little GB vulnerability. And a feintable vERY LONG DODGE ATTACK All of JJ's lights deal 18 damage for some reason. JJ's heavy animations are literally broken. (especially his OOS ones, you have no idea how many times I got hit by this) Tiandi has PK's Last Laugh bomb and JJ has Vikings' Fire Flask for some reason? &amp;#x200B; In my probably unpopular opinion Nuxia is one of the most balanced Wu Lin hero, but everyone doesn't like her of course. ^(but of course none of this matters since everyone in 4v4 is dumb and can literally be on the top of the score board by spamming heavies while in a team fight) &amp;#x200B;"

194,vulnerability,forhonor,We need Season 9 to have changes that are on the same level as Season 5,1,9qfpa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/9qfpa7/we_need_season_9_to_have_changes_that_are_on_the/,2018-10-23 03:58:32,"We need another ""age of wolves"" type of season, that gives us significant character and balancing changes that make this game better. Now that the devs aren't making more heroes(other than what they may introduce in the Harbinger) we should get some significant changes. Here is what I'd like to see. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Three heroes that qualify for a rework: Lawbringer, Warlord, and Shugoki.** **Lawbringer** has next to no pressure, slow heavies not complemented with hyper armor(even though a large man in full plate armor would certainly have that), and bashes that are so slow, that only newbies would consider them a threat. So instead, he banks on his higher than average parry punishes and his shove on block, essentially making him one of the best turtles in the game. He qualifies for the Knight faction. &amp;#x200B; **Warlord** does have actual pressure and relatively good tools, but the problem is that they are all just weaker than average. His damage is low, his headbutt has poor tracking, his hyperarmor is poor, and his counter attacks and full block are inconsistent when it comes to punishment. The only things that give him actual pressure is his Crashing shield Charge, which can make any Warlord dominate a duel for how safe and powerful it is. He qualifies for the Viking faction. ([Here's a suggestion for a Warlord Rework that was well liked](URL &amp;#x200B; **Shugoki** has... oh boy, what does he have? There's so much of him that's pitiful. He has no opener, no pressure, no anything. His only somewhat broken tool was even screwed up by making him take more damage without his passive armor. He qualifies (automatically) for the Samurai faction. ([Here's a suggestion for Shugo that Filthy Spaniard made that was rather good](URL &amp;#x200B; **Now onto the heroes that require a rebalancing: Conqueror, Nobushi, and Gladiator.** **Conqueror** is obvious: his shield bash. It's fast, has a wide dodge input window, and it pauses stamina regen for a whole 2 SECONDS. Meanwhile, his shield uppercut and shield bash mix-up are slow and unrewarding, his soft-feints into Full Block are slow and predictable(you CAN Full Block from his whiff recovery, but it's so slow that you might as well just wait for the whiff recovery to end), and his Charging Stance is literally useless. So yes, a redistribution of power is needed. &amp;#x200B; **Nobushi** was already rebalanced, but it didn't solve all that much. She's still bad in 1v1s, although they did succeed in making her less powerful in 4v4s. Her chains are predictable and her lights are parry bait. Her hidden stance is insanely safe, but pauses her stamina regen for a long time. Her other options, her back light and dodge lights, are also parry bait. Overall, her hidden stance needs to be less safe but still viable, and her lights need an overall speed up. &amp;#x200B; **Gladiator** is somewhat good, but there are still things that make him unbalanced. His chain lights are 600ms, making 75% of his chains worthless. His dodge bashes have no pressure, his toe stab has high recovery, and his Guard Duration is abysmal. Then there's his zone, which is the only thing that still has 0ms GB vulnerability and has no way of punishing on a fail. He can be at a Kensei-level of balance, he just needs his chain lights sped up, extra pressure from his bashes, longer guard duration, and a less safe zone. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Something that requires major changes: **Revenge**. &amp;#x200B; **Revenge** does work as an anti-ganking tool... sometimes. But other times, it can be activated in 1v1s while in 4v4 gamemodes, the shield is imbalanced between classes, and it doesn't even work against CC moves: the literal embodiment of ganking. &amp;#x200B; So here are changes that are needed for Revenge: * Revenge is capped at 85% in 1v1s and cannot go over unless another enemy attacks you * Revenge shields are balanced out between classes so that assassins have the weakest shield, and heavies have the strongest shield * Revenge can be activated during CC moves &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

197,vulnerability,forhonor,Some various LB Suggested Ideas,1,9sbu7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/9sbu7z/some_various_lb_suggested_ideas/,2018-10-29 21:19:29,"**THEMES to keep in Mind:** * LB is THE turtle: The turtle meta was terrible as every hero HAD to be a hero, but that is being killed off more and more with bashes, faster lights, and better mixups. However, Lawbringer was a character who's actual gameplay is SUPPOSED to be turtling. His main issue, however, is his inability to bait anything. His defense is medium right now, and terrible offense. These changes hope to make him defensively excellent, borderline ""overtuned"", while offensively capable, but not on the level of berserker, Kensei, Warden, etc. * LB is basically a heavy. That is, not a hyper mobile character. * LB is physically intimidating and MUCH bigger than most, if not all, of the cast. Thus, his playstyle should be revolved around shutting down the opponent and forcing them into submission. * LB is a foil to Nobushi: Both are spear-ish users who are SUPPOSED (but do not necessarily do) use distance to their advantage, and counter in some regards. Nobushi was made to do so with hybrid vanguard-assassin move set, using her dodgey Hidden Stance and recoil on being blocked to make space for her opponent; Lawbringer is the inverse, stopping the opponent dead in their tracks and pushing them out of the way to make space for himself. * Range: In general, all of his moves should have a bit more range, thus he should move forward a bit more in hit attacks. &amp;#x200B; **Long Arm (of the Law)** Right now a useless tool outside of ganks, and even then subpar to other CC moves. This should help it be another tool to counter opponents, and give it a smoother followup (as Valk got with her sweep, or Cent with his leaping plunge) * \+ Super tracking on back doges and rolls * \+ Superarmour, can be used to counter bashes and gbs on read * \+ Can be feinted, though high lag (cannot force dodge into gb); can cancel high feint lag into heavy attack/parry * Follow-Up Attacks: * GB - continue flip of polearm into landing the hammer on opponent; medium dmg (25) and stun * Heavy - continue flip of polearm into landing the blade on the opponent (20 dmg), then can followup with light input to plant the poleaxe tip into opponent (10 dmg), then optional additional light for a twist of the blade (5 dmg) = 35 dmg total (optional inputs for a bit more technicality and fun, as well as to lengthen animation for when you are ganking while allowing you to cut it short for when you are being ganked). * Light - locks on to new opponent if one around, kicks behind him to stun opponent and roll him a few feet (very fast followup in case you are suddenly ganked and need to just move him out of the way) **Light Attacks** Not a major component, but should be somewhat usable, and sew his heavies together. Relatively low dmg. * 500ms chain starters (this is common in the game now) * Side lights come out opposite direction of guard-- a left light comes out right. Visually, this is strike with the bottom of the poleaxe, similar to his light parry punish, except to the body. * Top lights stun opponent * Chain lights are 400 ms sides, 500ms top (which still has stun); designed to not be reactable (they are quick pokes while to poleaxe is aimed at opponent), 10 dmg * &amp;#x200B; **Heavy Attacks** The staple of the LB. They are now changed to make them more feasible baiting tools, by increasing feint windows, and countering blocking and dodging turtles. * WEAK TRAP: can be softfeinted into weak trap 200ms-300ms before impact (safe move, low reward); pulls opponents weapon (and the opponent themself) with ""hook"" of the hammer or blade * ONLY counter blocking, NOT parries/superior block/deflects * Not reactable * Leads into directional bash * Forward - shove with extra range * Right - left elbow hook bash to the face * Left - backhand to the left * Followup to bash with light chain starter, or Heavy unblockable finisher -- neither guaranteed * Hard feint allowed a bit later (do not know exact timings) * Can feint at nearly any point of heavy (to counter lights hitting him out) * \++Side Heavies are undodgeable (to the side; back dodging/rolling still escapes) * REDUCED GB VULNERABILITY: While his heavy attacks are long, they should have the GB vulnerabilty of Glad or Cent's heavies -- 100-200ms. &amp;#x200B; **Zone** Changes to make it excellent in anti-ganking, and while not excellent in 1v1s, at least potentially usable * 500ms Unblockable from the right of the LB, stuns * visually, strong high horizontal strike with the hammer side around him * Low dmg (15-20), Medium range, HIGH knockback * 66 Stam cost (60% of stamina) * Designed to get opponents away from him; High stam cost, low dmg, and ability to be countered rather easily prevent spam in 1v1, while still being occasionally useful. **Shove** Changes to make it a more situational tool to continue chains and bully opponents. * Shove on block removed. * Slightly faster (100ms or so) * Pushes opponent much further back * Wallsplats (guarantees light, top light is optimal due to stun) * Shove on parry with extra stam drain(less optimal than other counters, but situationally useful) * Side dodge into shove removed. * This is somewhat compensated by Forward dash * Softfeintable into longarm (to counter side bashes, and backdodges and such) * Followups (mostly unchanged): * midchain lights - 400ms sides, 500 ms stunning top, countered by dodging, cannot be blocked/parried * guardbreak - counters and forward dodging * Long arm - counters back dodges/rolling and turtling * \+Side Heavies - undodgeable, catches side dodges * \+Unblockable Top Heavy Finisher (maybe) * Waiting and parrying - counters dodge attacks **Shove Bash Counter** A more fitting counter to bashes for LB rather than dodging, but not as good as reading the bash and countering with Long Arm * TIGHT input: Dodge forward and shove 100ms before impact of bash; should be technically demanding (only 5 or so frames to input) * Counters bashes with fast shove * Compensates for lack of dodge attacks/shove * Countered by opponent baiting this and then side dodging shove. **Parries** * slightly more dmg on light followup (+5) * Slightly less dmg on impale (as wallsplat nets a lot of damage) * Shove on parry (situationally useful, great stam drain) * NEW MOVE: Disrespect - Taunt after parry, Cherry Taps opponent with 1-5 dmg with some type of disrespectful move (such as a backhand, or perhaps one-handedly chokes opponent, lifts them up, and tosses them behind him) **Dodges** A true LB should only ever dodge forward. With counters to bashes, a side or back dodging LB should be ashamed. But forward dodges should be rewarded, and allow fast followups such as longarm to catch an opponents backdodge, a shove to punish turtlers, or a parry to counter light spammers, or another forward dodge to make sure the opponent knows it is your space. * 500 ms forward dash, fast recovery (can parry even 400 ms into dodge), great range * Low range side and especially back dodges; if they'd be willing, make them 700ms sides and slower back dodges; costs 100 stamina and 50 health (/s) **Impaling Charge** * Forward doge + Side Heavy * 700 ms, feintable * as you might imagine, a forward dodge into impale to catch runners **Feats:** * Impenetrable Armour (Tier One Feat): 10% chance for opponents attack to deflect (or be blocked by) off of LB's armour. * Just Oppression (Tier 4 feat): 25%-50% damage buff after parry. &amp;#x200B; Hyperarmour on Heavies? No. Why? If the opponent is throwing attacks to knock you out of heavies, that is GOOD. That means you can counter with a feint into parry. LB is a counter attacker, and mostly just needs things to bait out of opponents attacks. Hyper armour encourages attacking through and continuing chains, which while good, is not something LB necessarily needs-- leave that to other characters. &amp;#x200B; Softfeints? While softfeints are cool, and seeing some such as a heavy feint into different direction attacks would be cool, they are not necessarily his playstyle. He'd essentially become partly Kensei, or Shaman, but with no reason to do so -- he is not made for misdirection or mixup intensive play. &amp;#x200B; More chains? It seems most characters are now geting either infinite chains (with some sort of alteration), or ""Full"" 2 or 3 chains (I.E. can do heavies and lights in any order through chain). While this is neat, and needed on some, Lawbringer is not made for the feint mixup play that others such as Zerk and monkey boi do. His chains are buffed with unreactable lights and alternate ways to get to the finishing unblockable (such as shove into top heavy), thus this is not necessary for LB. The alternating Lights and Heavies are characteristic of him, as well as sensible (light followups are quick pokes as pole is aimed at opponent, while heavies swing the poleaxe around). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

I'd love to see them not be afraid to make more small changes like this and test out how the community feels about them, for example, testing out a nerf to conq's shield bash.

You can actually kill the shamans and Kensei without having to try and ledge them. When the match begins, duck behind that corner to your left. That will stop the shamans from hitting you with jump attacks. As soon as one rounds the corner, hit it with light into heavy then get ready to turtle up. I usually keep my guard to the right since they like to spam zone so much. Be ready to switch guard to top and counter guardbreak. As soon as you get revenge, pop it into Celtic Curse and start throwing unblockable heavies, switching targets each time. The crazy thing is these gremlins are so aggressive that they dont bother with defense and youll likely hit them while theyre in the middle of another attack animation. Try to kill them both around the same time so you dont have to worry about the Kensei hitting you in the back. Once the Kensei shows up, keep your guard up top and be prepared to counter guardbreak. She guardbreaks a LOT. She also does a lot of mixups, so be careful not to get baited into a parry attempt. You know that brief guardbreak vulnerability you have during an attack startup? She guardbreak you in the tiny window, every time, without fail. Then its side heavy to the ground, top heavy, youre dead. So turtle up. I just wait for her to do a dodge heavy, then parry that and follow up with a single light. She does have a tendency to run out of stamina, thats your chance to abuse kick into grab. As long as youre patient she shouldnt be much trouble. Highlander is the only hero I had the patience to grind out the effect for idle, exe, and emote for. At most, killing the shamans and Kensei took me six attempts. Most of the time I dropped them the first or second try. If youre getting sick of attempting to ledge them and have a Highlander that you have a high enough gear score on I recommend giving him a shot."

Their great body mass and physical fitness make them a great host for Cthulhu, which is their ultimate purpose: to be possessed by Cthulhu and carry out his actions in our world until the flesh is dead. Until that day comes, the Conduit serves as an enforcer for the Cult, excelling in the more brutal missions. Conduits come in both male and female. Both are incredibly muscular and tall, the only difference being a cloth binder across the female Conduits chest. &amp;#x200B; Health: 140 Stamina: 120 &amp;#x200B; Neutral Heavy: 650ms Damage; 30 Chain Heavy: 570ms Damage; 25 Neutral Light: 530ms Damage; 15 Chain Light: 500ms Damage; 13 Zone: 600ms Damage; 20 Unblockable: 600ms Damage; 30 Gazelle Punch: 550ms Damage; 11 Full Guard: 300ms, 15 Stamina/Second &amp;#x200B; # Combat Conduit has three chains. &amp;#x200B; *One, Two* Light, Heavy &amp;#x200B; *Dempsey Roll (Infinite Chain)* Side Light, Light (Opposite Side), Light (Opposite Side) &amp;#x200B; *Haymaker* Heavy, Heavy(Unblockable) &amp;#x200B; **Other Attacks** &amp;#x200B; *Headache Punch (Zone)* This attack will appear as if it is coming from both left and right, but in reality it will only come from the last side Conduit had their guard before the zone input. This attack is undodgeable but cannot be cancelled, so the defender must guess which side the attack is coming from or keep track of Conduits guard. The defender can choose to simply guard the true attack or even parry it. Conduit can cancel the Zone into a guardbreak, however the guardbreak will bounce simply cause Conduit to bounce off unless the defender is in full-guard. &amp;#x200B; *Gazelle Punch* Gazelle Punch acts as chain finisher. After an attack, Conduit can Move Back+Light. If the final attack in a chain has landed, the Gazelle Punch is guaranteed. Gazelle Punch comes from hidden stance (Like Conqs Uppercut) so it must be dodged. (Gazelle Punch is guaranteed after Dempsey Rolls second light) &amp;#x200B; *Peek-a-Boo (Full Guard)* Conduits Full Guard has them go into a peekaboo stance. Conduit can still move, but only forward at a slower speed. Conduit can also still dodge, but only sides, shorter distance, with a longer dodge recovery. Peek-a-Boo only has guardbreak vulnerability during a dodge, and is mostly safe from everything except a guardbreak. &amp;#x200B; *Weapon Catch* Conduit can Catch a weapon by pressing guardbreak at the parry timing. From a Weapon Catch, Conduit can throw a guaranteed light for 15 damage with a stun, or throw the opponent like after a normal guardbreak. &amp;#x200B; **Punishes:** &amp;#x200B; Wallsplat *Heavy, 30 Damage* &amp;#x200B; Knockdown *Heavy, 30 Damage* &amp;#x200B; Heavy Parry *Weapon Catch Light, 15 Damage and Stun* &amp;#x200B; Light Parry *Heavy, 30 Damage* &amp;#x200B; Highest Chain Damage Possible (Except Infinite) *Haymaker+Gazelle Punch, 71 Damage* &amp;#x200B; **Quotes** Conduit speaks Runic from Eternal Darkness: Sanitys Requiem &amp;#x200B; Haymaker Unblockable Pargon!

Psh, No (5000 Steel) Conduit leans in, putting two hands on their chest, before waving away and laughing. &amp;#x200B; # How to Play Conduit has some lackluster chains that are nothing special on their own, however Haymaker can be used to force a reaction on lower skilled players. Against those who can punish the first heavy, the Zone remains a more stamina expensive option. Only those keeping good track of the Conduits guard will be able to counter it consistently, and, seeing that theyll be hit either way, most opponents will simply opt to parry instead of blocking. This way, the defender is awarded for guessing correctly (or being more aware). And, seeing as it is a zone attack, the Conduit will not be able to spam the attack for easy damage. It is a non-spammable, yet reliable, fair opener. Seeing as most opponents will be able to remember the last place you had your guard, the zone would be most useful if you have held your guard top long enough for the opponent to forget where your guard was last. Additionally, if your opponent consistently fullguards to nullify your zone, you can guardbreak for greater damage, encouraging your opponent to play along with the mixup. Seeing as the Conduits main weapon being his fists, he has quite short range (think Centurion). Peek-a-Boo, though a horrible offensive tool, is an excellent tool for closing the distance between the enemy safely and giving you time to think. You could even use Peek-a-Boo to further confuse your enemy with your zone, as the fullguard may make them forget where your guard was last. You could enter fullguard from top, or exit fullguard to top. Peek-a-Boo will also be great for giving you time to think or against players spamming light attacks. Be warned however, the inferior dodges means you will have to time dodges against bashes or unblockables much more tightly than normal. Additionally, Peek-a-Boo cannot be used to turtle up, as it drains a fairly large amount of stamina per second. Attempting this will quickly leave you out of stamina. Lastly, the after catching a weapon you can use the light stun to chain into Dempsey Roll and finish with a guaranteed Gazelle Punch. While it may be tempting to spam Gazelle punch, keep in mind that the recovery is long enough that you cannot counter guard break if it is dodged. It is best used as a chain finisher, or in the middle of a chain to catch your opponent off guard- but never to be spammed. &amp;#x200B;"
204,vulnerability,forhonor,My thoughts on what needs to be done to the game in relation to balance,1,9vcutr,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/9vcutr/my_thoughts_on_what_needs_to_be_done_to_the_game/,2018-11-09 06:04:25,"Dear Devs, My name is Crims0nCrow3, and im going to try my damn best to make a fair criticism and advice on how to improve the state of balance and cover as much as possible. I will be going character by character in order by faction. I will try my best to make as much sense as possible while being as descriptive as possible Warden- I know when his rework was first released you guys mentioned you wanted him to be a super simple and easy to learn and use character, however, the problem I see here is that shoulder bash was one of the main problems people complained about because it was abused and the only safe attack warden had at the time. Post rework it only seems that its stronger now and instead of 50 50 guard break or regular shoulder bash, theres an animation thats identical for not charged or charged shoulder bash in which you are unable to tell which it will be you just have to read it, after awhile this became not so much of an issue because we all learned how to dodge roll out of it but now that dodge rolling is taken away it is almost as if warden traps you in his shoulder bash. My advice is maybe to look over warden again entirely and see if you can make his mixups more sword-mixup based. I feel he is too easy to be as strong as he is and is one of many characters that have one singular tool thats powerful and allows a victory. If you cannot do this then may i suggest you somehow allow dodge rolling in this scenario to work again, or if a warden feels the need to spam the shoulder bash mixup, for each time you do it your light attacks have rapidly decreasing damage reduction for each time in a row it is done. Also, the damage on the heavy off a fully charged shoulder bash if nothing else is changed should be nerfed a little bit, maybe 35 damage not 40. Peacekeeper- Her rework had some good ideas, however, I feel the nerfs she received were too much. Every single one of her attacks do too little damage. I think her lights should do only a little more damage and her heavies should be quite a bit stronger as to make them viable enough to throw. For example in 4v4 gamemodes, a peacekeeper will be fighting a 1v1 on let's say zone A, With her little damage she takes too long to finish her fight and the enemy team comes to kill her before the enemy is dead even if she was getting attacks off on her enemy. She will get out damaged regardless of how many more attacks she gets off. My final suggestion for her is that her heavy finishers be unblockable as to provide more pressure on mixups, and more of a variety to her moveset, oh and her bleed damage should do like one or two damage more per tick. Centurion- As many people have stated, Centurion is viewed as one of the bottom 3 characters in the game. He has absolutely no out of stamina pressure because his kick is completely reactable, and his charged heavy animation is clear to see whether you can parry or not if he is far enough in his animation. Now I am not suggesting you make the kick unreactable because we don't need another character to spam bashes to win. however. I am suggesting you allow the ability to soft feint the charged heavy later in the animation, that will add more pressure. Also off a wiffed kick I feel that Centurion should be able to throw a heavy with a little bit of extra tracking to attempt to prevent people from rolling away from a kick. Also, I think it would be very nice for Centurion's heavies to be able to soft feint to another side along with the guard break soft feint ability. My ideas with cent were thought of as I was writing this so forgive me if these arent the greatest ideas, but reading it now, it is the best thing I can think of to make centurion more viable. &amp;#x200B; Conquerer- I hate conq so much, I will just say that right now sorry devs. His shield bash is too fast and has little to no animation when doing back to back bashes. It is very annoying that a conq can also get a guaranteed light off this powerful of a bash. I think the animation for conquerer's shield bash needs to be completely changed. A few months ago you nerfed his full block start up time by 100 ms. I forget the exact timing, and then you reverted the change. I think the change was needed and it should be reverted again. Lastly, conquerer's zone is strong and I think all bashes, kicks should hyper armor through conqs zone. Also I think in a gank situation in a 2v2 or 4v4 mode that an enemy should not be blocked by the zone as well. Perhaps if not this then the zone should cost a more significant amount of stamina. Gladiator- Very powerful in duels, His zone should not be able to be used on reaction to guard break, therefore something about the zone animation should be changed. Also his heavy animations and area of effect should be changed as to be more viable for team modes so he can do more damage in a team fight and defend himself. I am not sure on anything else as I have not thought about glad in 4s too much but I know there are some great ideas out there that I have read before. Lawbringer - He is the other of the bottom 3 characters. Not viable at all for duels and is only useful for crowd control in team modes. Without his feats to help him lawbringer is very weak and cant do much in team fights. For one, you should not be able to back dodge out of his unblockable heavy finisher combo. His top light needs to be a little bit faster, and or safer if you have another idea. Also, he should have a heavy soft feint into guard break like centurion and also a top light soft feint. That is the only idea I have for him for now. Remember I am a very dedicated player with over 2 thousand hours and have appeared in the competitive scene a few times but I am in no means a top player so a few top people may disagree with some of my inputs but I wanted to help the best I could because I love this game and the devs. &amp;#x200B; Raider- Lights are too reactable, and his mixups are too easily readable. He needs more mixups, soft feints and some faster attacks. I also think for raider, he should have a heavy soft feint guard break but I am not sure. Warlord- Hes powerful in duels, however I feel his crashing charge is not so reactable when out of stamina since you can just stop moving and guard break and punish him regardless. Also his damage outputs are too low and I think he should have triple hit combos just like valk with all the combinations. &amp;#x200B; Valkyrie- I really wanted valk to be viable after her rework, it was at least more fun then the warden rework. Basically I think everything you took from her pre rework, you should give back and she would be fine. The ability for her full block to block any attack while charging forward (except unblockable), the ability to dodge out of full block. and the ability to shield crush after a heavy not just on a soft feint. I dont remember what else was taken but I think that is what she needs to be improved. Berserker- I saw someone mention this the other day so I don't take credit for this idea, but on heavy feint light attacks since they are unreactable, but I think also needed, should do much less damage. The only advice I have for him because I think he had the best rework along with kensei. Highlander- His kick into caber toss soft feint when applying out of stamina pressure is very annoying, I think the unblockable heavy off a kick or caber toss should be nerfed slightly as to not make the 50 50 spam not as enticing. His offensive stance dodges also should be the universal just like all other dodges in the game. He can dodge most attacks if he times his dodges correctly. Perhaps you also don't lose stamina when in offensive stance but also don't regenerate stamina. Shaman- Shaman is fine in duels against most characters, however the best ganker in the game. She is an absolute necessity for dominion and breach. I think you should be able to activate revenge while being bitten, so that it does not guarantee death if in a team fight situation. &amp;#x200B; Kensei- Perfectly fine best rework best balanced character. Please don't change him. &amp;#x200B; Orochi- He has no openers, no out of stamina pressure other then unreactable light following a heavy. Also, I do not think that he should get 3 lights in a combo, just 2. he needs to be able to apply pressure. Maybe make heavy finishers unblockable, also off a zone orochi should be able to throw a heavy finisher. and zone should be the same speed as pk zone if its not already. Nobushi- I don't know what advice to give for nobushi I hope anyone that sees this can help me with her, other then the fact that her lights are too reactable. and in my opinion does not have a great opener. Shugoki- I think shugo needs heavy soft feints into guardbreaks or other heavies and should also have a triple hit combo That goes light heavy heavy. Heavy finishers should be unblockable but not soft feintable. He is the third of the bottom characters and I hope these ideas make him slightly better. Also his heavies need to be faster. &amp;#x200B; Shinobi- Shinobi only gets a single light off a slide, I think he should get both lights. He has not much out of stamina pressure because of that and I think his heavy finisher should do a bit more damage or be unblockable. Not both but one or the other. &amp;#x200B; Aramusha- I think he should be able to zone off side heavies that connect or wiff, and that he should be able to soft feint heavies to lights in any direction off any heavy not just finishers. and I think his top light should be faster but do less damage. I don't know what else if anything else is needed. &amp;#x200B; Tiandi- Personally I have problems parrying most of tiandi's attacks but I know a bunch of people that have no problem at all so I don't know I could just be bad. Also I personally don't think he should be able to dodge out of his dragon kick, Or if that's wrong let it have guard break vulnerability if you follow through with the kick. Shaolin- People are saying he is OP, but I think hes simply strong but not op. However I will say I think his damage needs to be nerfed on well.. everything. Not drastically but enough to make it fair with all the mixup potential he has. &amp;#x200B; Jiang Jun- His heavies and heavy finishers need to get a hard damage nerf. He can do some characters entire health bars if get gets them on the ground while they are out of stamina. &amp;#x200B; Nuxia- Her traps are bad. You should not be able to emote out of her traps, your guard stance should remain where it was before you emoted. She also should not have guard break vulnerability when throwing a trap. &amp;#x200B; That is the most I've typed in awhile, but I did this because Mr. Pope asked us to &lt;3. Also I love this game. Thank you so much for hopefully taking the time to read this and I hope I provide some insight as to how the game can improve. ALSO I WANT SPECTATOR MODE AHHHHHHHHHH.

Grab some pop corn because this a read, why so long?, because he needs a lot of changes in order to become a GOOD viable fun hero, one that still worth picking competitively. Currently play lawbringer is a frustating experience, only truly dedicated persons main him and at medium-high level of play his playstyle revolves around turtling, exploits of mechanics, extreme relyence of his feats, overtuned parrys and ganks, this rework aims to fix this by giving him an actual viable moveset. This rework is oriented to develop a game style based on: * impales * shove mix up *(his bread and butter)* * long arm * defensive options with focus on high risk/high reward (able to punish bashes and attacks not lock-on to him) * disruption of the battlefield and cc I like the fact that he has no safe options, even his mix ups has a chance to backfire due to never being confirmed damage, this demands the player to do reads in order to get any damage, to maintain this aspect of a no safe character, i will make him a real hard hitter this way evening the high risk/high reward ratio with almost every option. ***disclaimer, i have created this rework having in mind almost every AIDS match up that lawbringer has, this work for both sides, allowing not shuting down other heroes mix ups (shove on block) while also giving him tools to deal against the options of those heroes ( conq, bushi, highlander, glad, shino, warden, etc.)*** First, a buff to his versatility, every combination of a 3 hit chain should be good, this is considering that shove is a chain starter, his current chains are too predictable with no variation in timings, after every light comes a heavy, after every heavy comes a light, kind of ironic that the most versatile weapon ever invented has such predictable chains. &amp;#x200B; &gt;*Worth noting that i will be putting a lot of enfasis in his chains and finishers, this is because of how shove works, shove is a chain starter, this means that the jumps straight up to his chained attacks and then to his finishers, having that in mind i'll put his real strenght about reaching his finishers with shove being a threatening shorcut to reach them.* &amp;#x200B; # Changes to heavies &amp;#x200B; |Top heavy|Speed (ms)|Damage|Side heavy|Speed (ms)|Damage| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Opener|900|35|Opener|800|30| |Chained|800|35|Chained|700|30| |Finisher|900|40|Finisher|800|35| |Finisher (unblockable)|1100|45|Finisher (unblockable)|900|40| &amp;#x200B; * top heavy *(any version)* have stun property * top heavy *(any version)* guaranteeds a shove, blocked or landed *(more of this later)* * opener heavies have hyper armor starting 300ms before impact *(600ms top, 500ms side)* * chained and finishers have hyper armor 100ms after pressing the button * improved tracking on all of his heavies * Heavy finisher (unblockable) only comes after a chained heavy *(L-H-H and H-H-H)* The purpose of heavy attacks is to punish light parry attemps, giving his nature of heavily punishing baits and reads, 30 dmg is too low for a 900ms attack, one of the lowest of the non assassins heroes, with this rework he still have a preference about using his top heavy. (*worth noting that i will be taking away guaranteed shove except of landed top heavies, so the posible damage is reduced)* Hyper armor will serve him in teamfights, trading with powerfull blows outenduring with his huge healthpool, he can no longer be interrupted by a light or option selects, after all it seems reasonable to give him this mechanic to the hero who is clad in armour from head to toe. 700ms side chained heavies is, 1st is for the sake of the shove mix up, throwing those heavies will be way safer due to having only 200ms of diference from the light, 2nd is to preassure them to make reads, leaving a thighter window for reactions, 3rd to prevent externals GBs during ganks, this way his anti gank potential should improve leaving less time to process that an attack is coming *(his anti gank potential relies on keep shoving until it's done).* It's common knowledge that his heavies have awful tracking, for such long weapon he feels very short range, now balance wise, why this should be needed?, 1st a buff like this will give him a needed team fighting hability *(reach)* and 2nd improved the tracking of chained heavies will let punish back dodgers on red indicator *(this completely shut downs the shove mix up).* &amp;#x200B; # Light attacks tweaks &amp;#x200B; |Top light|Speed (ms)|Damage|Side lights|Speed (ms)|Damage| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Opener|500|18|Opener|500|15| |Chained|400|15|Chained|500|20| |Finisher|400|15|Finisher|500|10| &amp;#x200B; * side light finisher performs an impale if landed * chained lights are 20 dmg in order to put real preassure in the shove mix-up 600ms lights without a special property have no place in this game, i don't think i need to explain why i speed up his lights. Chained top light is a tool for the shove mix up, this tool is mean to be used against those super human players that can easily react to his shove mix up, this will force them to make a read if they want to dodge or even punish leaving them open for damage or against heroes with superior block on dodges *(the other option is to give the chained heavy a GB soft feint)*. The finisher are very dangerous, specialy the side finisher that would impale the enemy, if wallsplats guaranteeds a side heavy finisher *(a total of 45 dmg, also he needs some distance to perform this, nobody wants consecutive wallsplats)*, is too juicy this finisher to not do it but is the same for the enemy, it's too juicy to not parry it, being the definiton of high risk/high reward, this way really spicing up the option once he reach his finishers. About side chained lights, i would buff the damage in order to really put preassure on the enemy in the shove mix up, no one wants to eat 20 dmg, this way putting preassure on the enemy in order to commit mistakes like dodging based on read without reacting, *why i consider this fair?*, you have 2 oportunities to not get caught in the combo, first dodging the shove, second you can punish any option of the shove mix up, so for the trade off i would make each offensive option really pay off in the risk/reward ratio. &amp;#x200B; # Changes to mechanics: * shove no longer has hyper armor I'm going to speed it up, so with this change you would be able to stop it with a light on read. * heavies recoveries can be cancelled into shove , shove is 500ms Allows the shove to be performed even if the previous heavy was blocked, preassuring the enemy, 500ms would really put preassure, forcing the enemy to make a read if he doesnt want to enter the shove mix up. * shove still guranteeds nothing I like that you must make a read, the oponent is going to dodge the light?, stand still and accept his fate?, react to red indicator?, with propers reads it becomes a threat of 20 or 30 dmg. * side dodge shove is 500ms and is performed 300ms into the dodge Just improving his speed, side shove is almost useless being defeated by varius bashes even if the shove was inputted earlier, 600ms is too slow for a defensive move giving more than enough time for the enemy to react and punish it, leaving him exposed too much time, 500ms still needs a good reaction but is not oppresive. * fix shove --&gt; Heavy feint --&gt; GB, it whiffs almost all the time Just another option to the shove mix up, for the deflect happy or if they wanted to parry the heavy *(could be a soft feint into GB to make this more effective)*. &gt;*Worth noting that shove is still a chain (re)starter, what i mean with this is that a heavy finisher followed up into a shove will let you throw another chained heavy, this way having an pseudo infinite combo, not usefull in a duel because you should be able to dodge the shove safely after a finisher but in team fights or 1vX situations this will let him keep attacking, with improved chains, damage reduction feats and the hability to shove even if his heavies are blocked will give him finally good anti gank/revenge potential, they are spammers, one trick ponies, without skill, but you, you will be worse, heavy and shove until it's done.* &gt; &gt;*Let's be clear, he need this changes, a revenge lawbringer right now is as terryfing as a puppy, you're better with emote spamming during revenge, at least this will provoque a reaction in your enemies.* * remove hability to long arm from GB *(i'm pretty sure this is a bug)* * long arm is 700ms *(from 1000ms i think)*, guaranteed a chained side heavy (30dmg) plus a shove, same input *(back+ GB)* This move by itself is useless in 1v1, but can be used against a stunned enemy *(especially after an AD MORTEM or top heavy followed by a shove)*, the idea of being 700 ms, is that when you realize that long arm is coming is already too late, you have 500ms to dodge it *(you need to be 200ms into the dodge in order to avoid bashes)*, but the fear of being Gb for the first 400ms would maintain people still waiting for the light or to CGb, this way long arm will punish enemies that would stand still and GB will punish enemies that try to dodge it. * an enemy that is long armed have reduction dmg while he is being flipped His gank is very powerful, guaranteeing kills easily, if we are going to buff his dueling and teamfighting habilities we need to nerf his overtuned gank, this woud nerf that aspect of his gank allowing enemies to survive more reliably *(the gank would still be allied GB into impale into long arm into heavy, your ally would land 2 heavies but one of them is with reduced dmg, would be like 30dmg less, still borderline op but at least will not guaranteed a 100-0 in a gank).* * heavy start up and recoveries can be cancelled by a new embrace mechanic, which is performed by holding back your guard *(more of this later)* * zone attack is 700ms *(from 900ms)*, 25 dmg *(from 20)* and hyper armor start 300ms after pressing the button For such slow zone attack and low damage its existence is stupid while in the same game you have zone attacks like pk, glad or any other 500ms ZA, this would give him a ""safe"" *(read oly 100ms of GB vulnerability)* option select but slow enough to be a free parry/deflect if baited. * impaling charge is a fixed 400ms, 10 dmg, cost 1/3 of stamina In 1v1 is useless, and without a teammate it's also useless, if blocked you're useless, for such stupid stamina cosumption you enter full turtle mode until regain stamina. Fixed 400ms because is a variable attack that can go from 233ms *(stupidly speedy and speedily stupid)* to 500ms *(EZ parry)* because of how telegraphed it is. 10 dmg because it would be followed by a 35 dmg top heavy making a total of 45 dmg at minimun, same value as now but with the rebalancing of the neutral top heavy this also need a rebalance. &amp;#x200B; # Openers: I have come out with 3 options *(nothing too great tho, other options are welcomed)*. 1. Heavies are soft feintable on startup into a light attack, comes from the top, 10 dmg, stuns, 400ms 2. Shove is 500ms, performed 300ms into the dodge, guaranteeds nothing, discount headbutt, poor's man shield bash *(prefered one due to him being a bully that shoves people around, also entering his chain with ease)* 3. Heavies start up can be soft feinted into shove, 500ms, guaranteeds nothing, a worse valk *(given the fact that this doesn't work so well for valk i would not want this on LB)* Like a hybrid beetween vanguard and a heavy he should have a simple but effective offense from neutral. &amp;#x200B; # Parry changes: * ***light riposte***, same speed, stuns, 20 dmg, low recovery *(almost 0 if possibly)* The same riposte, wastes less stamina and as act a chain intiator, would be the preferred option due to the stun and entering his improved chains. Why low recovery?, because right now the Lb is GB vulnerable after a light riposte, exposing him even if the attack is followed up. * ***make way*** is 25 dmg, hyper armor as soon you make the input and 500ms *(or 400)*, improved range, low recovery, let it break even super armor This is a move to breath air in the middle of a gank or teamfight, but when you parry consecutive people most of them will recover in time to block the attack, it doesn't perform its intended purpose. The ""break even super armor"" part is to avoid scenarios where enemies would hyper armor through this attack killing you. *(i parry for god's sake why should i be punished) (****optional****, give it super armor in order to avoid being cheesed to death by bashes, being pinned down in the parry animation, no gank for you shaman).* &gt;Every mechanic in this game should have a counter, and with hyper armor becoming more prevalent among the cast it's necesary more counters besides of bashes, attacks like lawbringer's top heavies, deflects or raider fury among others should also have the hability to destroy hyper armor. * ***impaling riposte***, 800ms, 15 dmg, unblockable and soft feintable into GB, GB is special that goes throught any parry attempt but techable, is a true 50/50 This would make it non guaranteed from a heavy parry but transform it into a high risk/high reward move, the GB should get priority over any input *(except counter GB)* in order to create a true 50/50 *(no option selects, is a parry follow up after all)*, but it's parriable, if parried the LB is put in oos mode, still guaranteed from a light parry *(if wallsplat is your old 50 dmg).* Why 800ms?, this way no one would be capable of dodge it, but also gives a reasonable parry window. * ***blind justice***, 45 dmg, 900 ms, hyper armoured and soft feintable into a finisher side light or heavy, shove follow up is guaranteed Guaranteed from a light parry, a high risk/high reward move from a heavy parry, the soft feints is because the existence of option selects render this parry follow up useless, at best you parry the option select and back to the beginning. * ***shove***, pressing GB after a parry will perform a shove that can wallsplat guaranteeing a chained heavy, this would prevent a long arm from a parry, is a positional punish so i don't see any problem with this. &amp;#x200B; # New moves: * ***Righteous fury:*** you can end prematurely a chain into a top finisher unblockable heavy, only after an opener heavy, this attack can be soft feinted into a side light or heavy finishers *(you can actually semi do this already with feinting the unblockable, lock-off, input the heavy, unlock tech yikes),* some more options and ways to jump into his unblockable finisher wouldn't hurt*.* * ***Relentless prosecutor:*** foward dash + heavy, great tracking and pursuit hability, if you perform the top version of this, makes a 500ms 20dmg attack, if it's from the side is a 600ms 10dmg impale, both can be done from 300ms into the dash, why both versions?, because i found necesary an impale from neutral *(pursuiting rollers, no one escapes from the law)* but also is necesary an option with lower stamina consumption, top one is the safest but the side option is the more rewarding. &amp;#x200B; # Stand Fast (embracing) * new mechanic, his own special form of all block, made by holding back your guard This will be the all block version for the law, animation will be the first part of long arm, making him ready for embracing any kind of charge/attack *(something that pole-weapons are know for).* Why give him this mechanic?, i found necesary to give him a way to punish bashes and attacks not locked-on to him, giving the current meta of teamfights where this is norm, having tools to deals with this type of attacks is necesary for heroes *(assassins have deflects and dodge attacks for this, heavies should have all block types of tools like this).* * has super armor and reduce damage taken by 50 or 75% * the move is triggered by hit * doesn't actually block * 300 ms start up * 20 stamina upon activation and drain stamina just by maintaining it * gb vulnerable * can be cancelled into a zone attack ***Follows ups:*** * press GB and would conect a long arm * make zone attack and would perform make way * input heavy and would make an uppercut with the axe *(chain starter, 30dmg)* Each option has a purpose, the long arm is the maximun possible damage (30+shove), make way is for anti ganking or group fights but lower damage, finally the heavy is the quick option when you need that fast smack and move on. * every heavy start-up can be cancelled into Stand Fast This would give him a defensive tool against bashes and attacks not locked onto him, also 300ms start up means he can only do this upon reads, is very stamina intensive but more importantly cancelling heavy start ups into this would present a counter to zones option selects *(no option select for you glad).* &amp;#x200B; # Feats changes: * ***Harsh judgement:*** lowers enemy running speed by 25%, lowers stamina regen *(both normal and OOS)*, gives bounty hunter Hp and extra renown if the LB is the one that kills the enemy. This fits the glorious frase *""pray that you don't need them, and when they arrive pray ... that you have done no wrong""* while also giving him an actual useful tier 1 feat outside of body counter, nice for that roleplaying feel. * ***Righteous deflection:*** no cooldown, last 10 seconds This would increase the survival potential against ganks of the lawbringer as long as he keeps parrying the feat keeps refreshing, great sinergy with his new hyper armor on heavies. * ***Jugg******ernaut:*** take away slippery, make duration up to 30s from 10s With so many debuffs *(scout, chilling stare, etc.)* and self buffs *(morale booster)* in the game with long duration, we need actuals counters feats in order to stand a chance when those situations happens, slippery is worthless, 10 seconds is too short and easily wasted if the enemy keeps their distance, with very few occasions paying off, being 30 seconds should give you excellent stalling potential so needed in a game where ganking is too powerfull. * change regen for another feat, unkillable from tiandi is a good option *(not necesary this one but a usefull defensive feat)* This is to give him a defensive feats worth considering besides catapult and igneus imber in order to promove more playstiles and feats set ups."

Add some point in which it cannot be feinted on reaction when they see people aren't dodging. Allow fully charged sb to wallsplat for 40dmg. Conq: Reduce the amount of delay he can do for his shield bash. Will always remain dependent on this bash as long as he has relatively no other viable offense, needs deeper work if that were to be changed. Lawbringer: rework Glad: 500ms light chain, his zone should be reversed. If the attack hits, even if blocked, could confirm the bash to give stun effects that could possibly chain into other attacks such as his skewer. Cent: Allow him to soft feint zone after any of the first 3 hits. Speed up kick slightly, maybe 500ms. Allow cent to feint his unblockable. Let him soft feint it to guard break and to neutral. Could at least give him some sort of pressure. Raider: Less stamina cost on attacks, stunning tap gains undodgeable property, hyper armor on chained heavies and his zone. Warlord: Make crashing charge have an earlier startup so it could be dodged in 1v1s but could still be a threat in ganks. Give him new attack chains, he only has 2 as of now I believe. Faster HA startup on heavies for trade potential. Shaman: Maybe don't allow full stamina regen after a bite, it seems to continue to push the fight in her favor even after a high damage combo. I don't get bitten much so I'm not sure whether this is needed or not. Valk: Give back her stamina draining headbutt. I don't play her much. Orochi: Doesn't really have anything other than a decent zone and a 400ms light. Probably requires a more in depth look. Shinobi: Nerf his tackle the same as warlord. Give it an earlier startup so it's not so powerful in 1v1's but can still trip someone up in a gank. May require deeper tuning afterwards. Shug: rework, pretty atrocious at everything. Nobushi: Faster lights, less stamina consumption on hidden stance so she can attempt to get fancy without going oos constantly. Aramusha: Confirm the top heavy after blade blockade so it's not entirely obsolete compared to a parry. Reduce GB vulnerability window for blade blockade. Heavy finisher is unblockable and can soft feint into GB to catch dodging backwards. Wu lin are still pretty fresh so I'll leave them be. -Add external guard break indicators. -Fix the external attack indicators already. Holy crap. No more invisible unblockables. -Remove the giant breaking skulls from the middle of the screen, put them off to the side. -Move the 'player has left' notification to another part of the screen. -Fix the auto ready up bug after a game. -Orders such as ""play 4 breach matches"" should reward substantially more than 750xp as they take quite a long time to complete. -Reduce or remove the screen after the game that makes you watch you level up multiple times after a game. Along with this, allow us to dismantle more than one piece of equipment at a time after a match by selecting them as you would in your inventory. Also, fix the bug that does not show us the correct amount of gear we have in our inventory. -Make arcade mode more about getting huge buffs and fighting waves of endless slightly good ai, just in larger numbers. Would be a lot more fun. Make arcade mode less about attacks that entirely nullify revenge and is nearly impossible to do as it highlights how bad the external blocking/indicator is. -I read somewhere that players were having people leave ranked matches and they were not receiving their win bonuses, possibly look into that. I'm sure I've missed a lot of stuff but I mean for this to be pretty basic fixes that really shouldn't have been an issue for more than a few weeks at most. Will add anything I find later on. "
208,vulnerability,forhonor,Shinobi damage nerf and rework ideas. Updated. Finding common ground.,0,9fklka,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/9fklka/shinobi_damage_nerf_and_rework_ideas_updated/,2018-09-14 04:36:49,"I'm looking for support on the positive changes that will help my main. First. Let's talk about damage. As of right now, where Shinobi is at , he is weak overall, so that's why I think his damage is justified. But everyone is saying his damage is over-tuned. I kind of agree but there are changes that need to happen to justify lowering his damage. And these changes need to come from the perspective of an experienced shinobi main so that he isn't nerfed into the ground... again. The objective of these changes, is to make him feel a little less cheesy, but also give him incentive to use his kit and stay in the fight. 1. **DAMAGE.** Damage values should change to 17+5=22 for the double light, and 30+5=35 for the heavy light chain. As opposed to the current 24 for lights, and 40 for the heavy lights. The confirmed lights should drop from 10 to 5 damage, and the first light should raise from 14 to 17 to compensate a little and put them on par with orochi's double light. 2. **A light heavy chain**. This will give him an alternative option to the confirmed light and trade the confirmed light damage for a chained sickle rain heavy and mix-up potential to keep his light chain going. Light feint light, feint light, feint heavy, etc. As long as he feints the second attack and doesn't take the confirmed hit, he should be able to continue his chain. Maybe implement soft feints on this second heavy in the chain. The second heavy should also have increased speed to allow for a better OOS punish (#11). 3. **Single dodge chains.** Heavy and light attack chains on a single dodge. This is important to fully allowing shinobi to use his mobility and he is too weak on his dodge attacks, which are all interrupted by guard-break, and are slowed and taxed by stamina by double dodge. The purpose of the double dodge should be to throw off the timing and instigate a reaction. 4. **Ranged GB.** No Sickle rain after a ranged GB, instead, just a regular heavy light chain for 35. (Edit: instead of the 35 heavy light, I think the ranged GB should just gurantee a single heavy that does 40 damage, designed to execute low health players.) The sickle rain after ranged GB is cheesy because it allows for an instant kill and is sadly his optimal play right now, and out of his character. It does nothing for shinobi's renown to get the assist, and is a cheap kill on the enemy. 5. **Ranged Attack Punish**. Instead of falling to the ground on ranged parries, he should be pulled in (on his feet) for a confirmed light attack punish from any range. This will make his range irrelevant when countering. He's the only character than eats top heavies and can be insta killed for getting a heavy attack parried. So confirm a punish at ANY range, in exchange for a less extreme punish. He will be less safe in terms of being punished more often, but also not as extremely punished. It's a change for the better of both worlds and will make ranged fighting less annoying, but also fair. This ranged parry change of staying on your feet would also justify his terrible recovery and free guard break from blocking his ranged heavies, which I think should actually stay to get a better punish on ranged attacks that are used too close. So confirmed light from parrying at any range, and free GB for blocking at close range. You can also dodge and get a heavy because the ranged recovery is that bad. And he can still fall to the ground on the ranged guard break counter, that should stay the same. This will also give him an incentive to use his ranged kit even when people are paying attention, right now the risk is too high and ranged attacks are useless in 1v1 situations. This will also give the opponent more of a sense of control, they can now ledge with parry from farther distance if there is a ledge between you and he will always have a confirmed punish. Imagine parrying, getting revenge and the shinobi is pulled right to you from any distance with no escape. If you parry him OOS which happens a lot, he won't be able to roll away form a warden vortex etc. The situations where you parry and he's still safe 50 feet away, that needs to go, and being instantly killed for a heavy attack needs to go. Better for both worlds, ranged parries=stays on his feet, but pulled all the way in. 6. **Accidental Deflects**. You shouldn't get punished if it's on accident. I agree with making his deflect only do damage after an input of kick or light attack and make it in line with the rest of the heroes. I think his deflect should work as if he's out of stamina and it does nothing. But then only launches after a light attack or kick input and is safe with i-frames until after the input is complete. 7. **Deflect i-frames Needed**. His deflect is heavily tracked, it needs i-frames (invincibility frames). For the 700ms duration of the deflect, heavy attacks from other players will do a 180 degree turn and hit you on the other side of your teleport. So accidental deflects can be annoying for both parties. The deflect should be safe with i-frames up until the point where you input an attack. After a deflect, the i-frames should end after the light attack and allow you to recover instantly from the light to defend. These i-frames should make up for duration of the animation. You shouldn't be more vulnerable on a shinobi's deflect than Pk's deflect for example. She can punish and instantly recover because it is fast. Her punish is 500ms compared to his 700+ms. His deflect should be more elusive as an escape and punishing tool. 8. **THE BACK FLIP.** The idea here is to exchange a GB punish for i-frame or a hidden stance property. My suggestion is to allow a window in the startup of the back flip where shinobi can be guard-broke, but exchange that punish for a hidden stance property on the flip. So you can GB the startup, but external attacks will whiff. The key to this is that you should be able to punish the kick, if shinobi makes a mistake. The back-flip should be vulnerable to guard-break from startup until the moment shinobi's hands hit the ground on his flip. This way if they GB late, they can still be punished, but still get an opportunity to punish the dodge. This will make him more punishable in a 1v1 setting, but make him more elusive in group fights and the back-flip should be his safe retreat in group fights and not get tracked by external attacks. I think when his hands touch the ground is the perfect moment to end the GB punish window. 9. **ZONE ATTACK**. Another big one. HIS ZONE. It's absolute trash and the worst zone in the game next to centurion. For the love of god please allow him to cancel his zone. It's a free parry and you take more damage than you dish out. This one is a no-brainier, but very important. 10. **Soft Feints?** Consider adding soft feints into his kit somewhere, but I don't see it as necessary. Maybe add a soft feint GB with the zone cancel or on his heavies. He doesn't need any light soft feints imo, but I wouldn't complain if he got some. 11. **Out Of Stamina** **Punish.** Compare shinobi to orochi who get's 70 damage on OOS punish and revenge throws. Shinobi gets the current 40 damage no matter what, suggesting to nerfing it to 35. Whether it's a GB, OOS or revenge throw, wall splat, it's all 40 damage. I think shinobi should get 2 heavies on his OOS punish to confirm this. So 30+35=65 plus maybe the sickle rain follow up, or not, idk. Shinobi should be able to capitalize on stamina punishes. This is something that needs to change especially if shinobi gets a damage nerf. Shinobi's first heavy should stay the same speed, but his second heavy should be sped up. This will give him more options to get into sickle rain if a light/heavy chain is added and add more speed to his second chain heavies and when he rolls in for an attack, which would be really good as this move is often interrupted. 12. **The Kick**. 500ms is a good speed for the kick. Side kick should be 500ms like the forward. The overall double dodge kick is just too slow. It's a bad counter tool. It's a bad opener. And it's bad trading tool. It can do all of these things, but is inefficient in everyone of them. He should have the option of kicking on a single dodge or a double dodge, the startup of the kick itself is react-able, so shinobi can dodge as many times as he wants and not truly force you to move. The point here to to be able to use your mobility to change up the timing of your attack and instigate the enemy to mistime a dodge. Shinobi already has this aspect but he has to either double dodge or quad dodge kick to throw off the timing. It would just streamline this aspect and make the kick better as an opener and a countering tool by making the overall move faster and less anticipated. The side dodge kick would basically become as effective of a counter as wardens shoulder bash but with more timing options. So there's a couple ways this could play out. Punishing the kick on prevention or punishing it after dodging the kick or playing it safe. Here's more on how punishing the kick would play out. * Punishing the kick on prevention or interruption would be a pseudo 50/50, and punishing the kick with dodge would also be a pseudo 50/50. Or you can just play it safe and react to the kick and dodge safely, but if you want to punish it, you will have to risk getting punished. * For example, you feint a heavy, and shinobi single side dodges for a kick, a heavy feint into light attack should interrupt the kick and punish on prevention. However if shinobi double dodges, then he will dodge the follow up light attack after the feint and land the kick, so the correct prevention punish on the double dodge kick would be feint into GB. * Dodge timing will be more significant and shinobi will capitalize on mistakes and mistimed reactions. Dodging the kick on reaction would be the safest move and would opt out of all 3 options of his dodge attacks. It would dodge the light attack or kick and the heavy attack is slow enough to still block after the dodge. From here you can have another pseudo 50/50 opportunity to punish the kick. * Punish kick mix-up on dodge reaction. If shinobi misses the kick and begins to back-flip, a guard break should interrupt the start-up of this, however if you are late you can be punished with the ranged GB in your recovery. Shinobi could also not back-flip and possibly throw the ranged heavy, which you could then parry, or block and GB. But if shinobi whiffs the kick and then reacts and defends he can still counter the GB. However if you pre-dodge the kick on prediction you can punish with a GB. Similar to conq's bash. Your guaranteed punish will come from a mistake on his part, or a correct prediction or read on your part. If you're mad about this you need to realize that kick is punishable on read and safe to dodge. If you don't want to risk being punished, then don't risk punishing. That simple. * The safe and patient way to play against him is to react to the kick safely and make him throw out an unsafe attack, you would still punish the kick on prevention or reaction, but not without risks. The only safe way to punish the kick would be to dodge it and then GB the startup of backflip, which could also be countered if shinobi decides to hold his ground instead of flipping. This ultimately keeps some circumstantially safe ways to use the kick, but also gives it a good risk/reward. Note that this may require altering the hyper armor on kick, it has been delayed in the past so the kick startup is interruptible with a light attack, but may need further tweaking or removal. I do still think he should have armor on his kick just before it lands so that he can chain it to the hyper armor back-flip and use it as an escape tool in group fights. **The conclusion.** Shinobi will be less annoying to fight, punishable at any range and back-flips. But now he will have more incentive to use his ranged kit. The whole basis of shinobi's play style is in and out ranged and mobile ability. But his ranged attacks are shut down and his mobility is easily interrupted. These will change that. Make shinobi punished more often, but punished less extremely at the same time. Give him a healthy risk reward that allows him to use his kit and allows the opponent to punish reasonably. I am defensive about shinobi, he's my main and he's weak overall and has never been in an OP spot other than maybe the first 2 weeks of launch. I hope to get some support on the positive changes here so I can actually justify a damage nerf. Single dodge chains, and less extreme parry punishes are huge for shinobi and his overall health. Thoughts? **Edit #1:** Shinobi has no real option selects, this is pretty ridiculous for a counter attacker. I personally like some option selects, but some are too strong like Hidden stance and pretty much conq's whole kit. Shinobi is the riskiest counter attacker in the game, he should have the best option select, but it's not without risk, it would just give you the option to react to multiple actions in succession which fits shinobi's style and kit of being rewarded for good reactions. For Shinobi's option select, I think they should change one thing, make his ranged heavy charge cancel instantly. This will allow him to option select manually and react to multiple actions. It makes sense for hit kit being reaction based. For example, right now HL has an option select where he can parry attempt and hold for offensive stance and instantly cancel it to block or counter GB. This is particularly useful for HL when reacting to unblockable attacks, he can both attempt to parry, and counter the GB, covering both options. Shinobi is close to being able to do this with the same inputs as his charged ranged heavy into hard cancel, but the hard cancel has at least a 100ms of GB vulnerability, so it doesn't always work and you can sometimes counter GB with a ranged GB input, but it's very rare, the timing is very tight against bots and you pretty much have to do in on prediction in live game. So making Shinobi's charged heavy cancel instant would allow him to option select the way I believe he should be able to. So he could parry attempt, counter GB, block, or deflect, and pretty much react to anything if you are fast enough and can react in real time. Which I think shinobi is built for. And it's still a manual option select and requires follow up reactions, it's not a one input beats all no brainer option select like conq's zone, and other characters have option selects, so I really don't see why Shinobi can't have this. I would really enjoy the character a lot more if he could instantly cancel charged heavies. **Edit #2:** Shinobi's first heavy should be undodgable, as well as his heavy after a chained roll. These heavies are specifically only useful when trying to catch people dodging and predicting their dodge, but it doesn't always track and hit like it should. Not to mention they still have time to dodge and then block or parry the heavy. It would also fix another big issue for shinobi, he cannot catch anyone trying to run away. Everyone can outrun his ranged attacks even when he runs up right behind them, by the time you charge or throw a ranged attack, they are out of range. It's extremely hard for him to catch anyone because he doesn't have a running attack besides the slide, which is hard to do on someone running away and drains all his stamina. An undodgable heavy after a double dodge should be his way of catching people trying to run away. His sickle rain heavy needs a new property called Hyper armor penetration. I think Cent needs this on his pin as well. Beserker is really strong, and there's really no way for characters like shinobi or cent to address him without losing damage on trades. If we time a certain attack well it should penetrate his hyper armor and stop him in his tracks. For shinobi, I think his second heavy should have a hyper armor penetration property, as well as his heavy after a roll. **Edit #3:** Slide tackle tracking should be slightly nerfed. I didn't really ever use slide tack because of it's high stamina cost and clunky trigger with double sprint, but it's actually really strong. For example, I previously thought that duel was Shinobi's worst game mode because his range was not a factor and everything he has is reactable. But I was wrong. Slide tackle is 400ms startup, and even if you try to dodge on reaction it will track you, you have to pre dodge it or try to interrupt it, this sets Shinobi up to cancel it and react, maybe GB the pre dodge or parry the light they throw trying to interrupt it. You do have to sprint slightly longer to trigger it than with WL's or raider's charge. But it is still a very effective tool. Depending on the map it puts Shinobi in low S or A tier in duels, just to put some perspective on how broken this move is, if you decide not to abuse and use it, Shinobi will instantly drop to C tier in duels. I was trying to fight conqs without slide tackle and it was almost impossible, I had to work too hard, but you can just unlock, out run the conq, come back and slide tackle for free damage and repeat, and is actually really effective at winning against conqs because they are so slow. So just like that Shinobi went from C to low S. I just have to say, I don't want to play like this. I would rather Shinobi have viability in his actual kit and not resort to unlock running like warlord. So, nerf slide tackles tracking, and stick to these other rework changes. It's not an ideal play-style, but this does make shinobi less of a priority and about on the same level of warlord but a lot less damage and ledging potential, it also doesn't provide an OOS punish like WL's bash, but it is an opener that actually works. Another thing to note is that it does revenge lock until after your first hit, so it's good for ganking and will allow your teammates to get heavies in before they can revenge."

He has no openers(400ms lights are not openers, even if delayed) and so he hinges on his 400ms lights, which will not save you against high level players. So he's essentially a noob stomper in low level play, and a turtle in high level play. You know when a character design is terrible if this happens. So here's a proposition: Get rid of some of his chain 400ms lights in favor of on UB, some soft-feints and some useful dodge moves. &amp;#x200B; # Chains * 2nd side lights are now 500ms * 2nd side lights now deal 15 damage *This will be made up later.

212,vulnerability,forhonor,Attempting to Rebalance/Tweak Centurion in the least retarded way possible,11,9fvxzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/9fvxzo/attempting_to_rebalancetweak_centurion_in_the/,2018-09-15 07:20:00,"Greetings fair Ladies and Gents, Today I'm going to have a try at tweaking Centurion, according to what's considered meta/balanced today. First thing's first, about myself a little. I've played For Honor since it released. I've been a Warden main since day 1(occasionally playing pre-rework kensei and pre-rework conq too) and as you can see, slogged through what people call 'Dark days of For Honor' that was Season 2 Shadow and Might. How does this tie in all of the Cent talk? Well, I've had my share of Centurion shenanigans back in those days, even dueling people like Bandanaa(Finalist Cent on that one ubi hosted tourney, I'm sure everyone knows who that great lad is at this point) Anyhow, I thought to myself some time back when I had free time: ""Whatever happened to Cent through all this time?"" and I realized I kinda miss the ***INCREDIBILIS*** shout from 50 meters away when playing. You see, I never played this guy actively, he wasn't my cup of tea, but I still to this day find his design amusing. So, shall we begin a little journey down the short red line that are rework/re-balances? Here we go. The goals of this post are: * Centurion, at his core, was meant to be a bully. A harasser fighter who excelled at dueling isolated people and teamfight by wreaking havoc amidst the enemy line with stuns/pins/jabs and kicks. I want to keep that character identity above all else. * I want to give him more options, to make him stand up to the current standard of characters and have him compete with the current hero roster that is being used. * Still leave the character as an Angery Italian boi who will fuck you up if you let yourself make too many mistakes. Throughout the post I shall explain every decision I've made on my part and why I think it would favor Centurion in ways it would. Okay, first and foremost. Cent was from, release to now, always been 1 thing. A noobstomper. He dispatches new players in a heartbeat but at high level, he doesn't have much going for him besides variably timed heavies. 1. I suggest he gets reverted back to his release-self. Back when he had all that stuff at launch(besides Wallsplat combo, nobody likes wallsplat combo, that was an unintuitive side-effect of heavy&gt;jab chaining against a wall for a longer stun). Now that people have(mostly) gotten used to his tricks, this wouldn't cause that much of an issue. 2. Improve and keep his current tools(like light&gt;heavy combo). Now, what do I mean by improving his current tools? Exactly what I mean. Without adding any new moves, this character can become a good unit, because his kit already has everything it needs to be what he is supposed to be, it's just that it's very underwhelming. 1. Legion Kick - Straight forward unblockable. Guarantees a light attack. Stuns opponent for brief period of time(this thing stunned back in the day before it was removed, beat me if I know why it was removed because it wasn't even that bad to begin with). This moves' only problem is the fact that it is slow. Dodge+kick takes more than 700ms in total, which is in this meta very weak. It is reactable to even by the worst of players in this game. * ***Proposition:*** Speed up the kick. Dodge links into kick at 100ms and the kick itself is 400ms. Drains a little more stamina. * ***Elaboration/Explanation:*** This change speeds up the kick itself by 200ms and allows 'dodge to kick' link to happen exactly 100ms into the dodge, no more or less. * The pros of this change is that the Legion Kick itself becomes usable at higher levels. * The Cons of this: It still comes with its drawbacks like usual(The kick itself links from dodge, meaning that 100ms from dodge + 400ms kick makes the move itself 500ms and it is still locked timing(unlike Conq shieldbash that can be initiated anywhere between 100-500ms into a forward dodge) * One other thing I would like to give this move is the Tiandi Palm Strike treatment, meaning that missing the Kick will not allow Centurion to chain into a light(I think this is a thing already actually) or actually delay his guard coming back up for a brief bit. The goal of this change is make Centurion punishable for missing it. The guard would come back up 600ms from the end of the kick, allowing a light attack to land on Centurion after a dodged Legion Kick. However, Centurion would still be immune to guardbreak while his guard is not up, preventing the missed kick from being punished by a heavy instead. 2. Charged Heavy Cancel now affects Imperial Might and Centurion's Zone Attack. * As most of you know, Centurion's ability to soft-feint his heavies into guardbreak is one of the only good sides of him. This makes his already variable timed heavies almost incredibly risky to parry, because the soft-feint allows you to catch the opponent heavy start-up vulnerability for a guaranteed GB. This change makes his soft-feint to GB even more deadly, allowing him to chain his Imperial Might to GB(this is already in the game, I will expand later on it in the next paragraph) * Second part of this paragraph is about Zone Attack soft-feint. This would essentially allow Centurion to soft-feint his 3rd strike from the zone into a GB. Why not 2nd you ask? I'll elaborate it in the paragraph after next one. 3.Imperial Might hard-feint and soft-feint timings now match the regular feint/parry timing. * Now, Centurion's Imperial might(charged finisher unblockable) has a number of problems in itself: The soft-feint itself. The ability can be soft-feinted ONLY before the unblockable symbol APPEARS. What this means is that he cannot force a reaction from an opponent. Nobody is going to react that early, they are going to wait for you to soft-feint it to GB and if that doesn't happen, then they are going to wait for you to go to unblockable, then go for the parry. By moving the soft-feint timing to match the hard-feint(and parry timing, meaning 400ms before the attack hits) then opponent will be forced to react to the unblockable while still being in the risk to be guardbroken by the softfeint GB. * This creates a read/predict based reaction and allows Centurion's charged heavy/GB soft-feint to land more often. It gives Centurion a mindgame, an offense and more importantly, it brings you closer to that mix-up intensive playstyle fighter you are supposed to be. 4.Legion Kick now acts as a chain starter, replacing the first hit of the 3-hit Zone attack. * Legion kick was an opener to cent, it was never a TRUE chain starter. What I mean by this is that it could chain into light/heavy, but every time you kicked, your zone would start from 1st hit, risking your 2nd/3rd hit to get parried, because it's unfeintable. * This change would allow him to safely kick and go straight into 2nd hit of zone, allowing him to flow into his 3rd hit(which as explained in paragraph 2, can be soft-feinted into GB) and once again, allowing his pressure to continue and keep enemies on their toes. * This change also gives cent a stronger punish on kick(25 damage from 2nd zone hit instead of light) which is still acceptable in the current meta, because there are heroes like warden/highlander who get 40 damage from a neutral mix-up. * This will not make kick into light useless, it will just have a better trade-off. Again, will elaborate in one of the next paragraphs. 5. Zone attack now causes 300ms stagger on hit/block. * This change may seem stupid, but keep in mind the Centurion's hits on zone in milliseconds are 600/600/700ms respectively. * What this means is that when you use your zone attack out of neutral, enemy that gets hit or blocks it gets staggered for 300ms, making his 2nd hit safe if the 1st wasn't parried(much like berserker) and again, allowing him to flow into his 3rd strike for soft-feint mindgames. &amp;#x200B; 6. New Chain: L&gt;H&gt;L (Eagle's Screech) , Chain finisher Light is now 400ms(only the 3rd light), the light finisher now deals 12 damage; His first and second light still remain 500ms and deal same damage(nothing changed here) * This change allows centurion to choose his offense, either go for the unblockable heavy mix-up or stick with quick low damaging light. This again, allows for more options on Centurion's end. Nothing major, just mix-up potential, trying to bring that harasser playstyle ever closer to our dear Italian boy. 7. Imperial Might now has hyperarmor in the last 500ms of the move. * Simple change that allows Centurion to continue pressuring opponent without danger of being interrupted mid-charge of Imperial Might. 8. Eagle's Fury Alternate(Guard Mode) now has better tracking, allowing Centurion to catch rolling opponents; Eagle's Fury Alternate now links from dodge at 100ms and is now 500ms. * In a meta that is so prevalent with rolling to forcefully shut down your opponents mix-ups, this move is a must. * The timing speed up on it is to ensure the move will hit after the opponent rolls. Otherwise the Kensei fiasco is going to happen, meaning the opponent guard comes back up before the attack hits and it gets blocked. 9. Lion's Roar now drains more stamina-per-strike and deals 5 damage-per-hit innately. * Again, this makes the GB more frightening. * Naturally, this also makes Quick Throw GB after a light attack more threatening. 10. Stamina draining abilities no longer consume enemy stamina when they are OOS. * Don't want you to stay OOS forever now, do we? ***Conclusion:*** This Centurion enforces the role of his original design. A brutal bully Vanguard Assassin hybrid hero. A harasser that keeps pressuring you as long as he is near you. ***Pros(after update):*** * Actually lots of mix-ups besides variably timed heavies. * Quick access to unblockable bash * Dangerous unblockable finisher that forces opponent to react. * Decent damage guaranteed off a bash. * Actually viable zone attack. * Roll-catching ability * Strong mind games with new soft-feints. * Better stamina harasser &amp;#x200B;"

Especially when you're ganking. As you know heroes in revenge have their GB vulnerability on heavy startups removed. But that only counts for **normal GBs**. Centurion's **Quick Throw** (GB after light hit) ignores revenge GB invulnerability. So if an enemy in revenge is attacking a teammate, go for a Quick Throw. If the enemy is in a light chain, he can continue. If he throws a heavy or zone he'll get caught and you can cutscene them. My favourite situation is when a revenged Raider is attacking teammate. They are often throwing out a lot of heavy and zone attacks and therefore will get caught by a Quick Throw."

These changes are best for both worlds, fighting with and against Shinobi.",1,9kwsl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/9kwsl1/shinobi_rework_highlighted_nerfs_damage_nerf/,2018-10-03 11:41:33,"To highlight all the main nerfs for you haters out there: Damage nerf, slide tackle nerf, Range GB nerf. But all of this would easily make him the worst hero in the game and leave him with no viability. So hear me out. These other buffs are necessary. Just to note, I am a rep 60 Shinobi on PC and play in the top .01% of players. I am a credible source. 1. **DAMAGE.** Damage values should change to 17+5=22 for the double light, and 30+5=35 for the heavy light chain. As opposed to the current 24 for lights, and 40 for the heavy lights. The confirmed lights should drop from 10 to 5 damage, and the first light should raise from 14 to 17 to compensate a little and put them on par with orochi's double light. But he should still have relatively high damage, that's his role as a glass cannon. 2. **A light heavy chain**. This will give him an alternative option to the confirmed light and trade the confirmed light damage for a chained sickle rain heavy and mix-up potential to keep his light chain going. Light feint light, feint light, feint heavy, etc. As long as he feints the second attack and doesn't take the confirmed hit, he should be able to continue his chain. Maybe implement soft feints on this second heavy in the chain. The second heavy should also have increased speed to allow for a better OOS punish (#11). 3. **SINGLE DODGE CHAINS.** ***\* Most important change fundamentally.*** Heavy, light attack, and kick chains on a single dodge. This is important to fully allowing shinobi to use his mobility and he is too weak on his dodge attacks, which are all interrupted by guard-break, are easily baited and are slowed and taxed by stamina by double dodge. The purpose of the double dodge should be to throw off the timing and instigate a mistimed reaction, not to tax his stamina and speed and make all his counters ineffective and telegraphed. He needs single dodge chains. 4. **Ranged GB Nerf.** No Sickle rain after a ranged GB, instead, just a regular heavy light chain for 35. (Edit: instead of the 35 heavy light, I think the ranged GB should just gurantee a single heavy that does 40 damage, designed to execute low health players.) The sickle rain after ranged GB is cheesy because it allows for an instant kill and is sadly his optimal play right now, and out of his character. It does nothing for shinobi's renown to get the assist, and is a cheap kill on the enemy. Not sickle rain is currently around 52 damage and provides a one shot. A 40 damage heavy with no CC is a good and generous replacement. 5. **Ranged Attack Punish**. Instead of falling to the ground on ranged parries, he should be pulled in (on his feet) for a confirmed light attack punish from any range. This will make his range irrelevant when countering. He's the only character than eats top heavies and can be insta killed for getting a heavy attack parried. This is way too harsh. So confirm a punish at ANY range, in exchange for a less extreme punish. He will be less safe in terms of being punished more often, but also not as extremely punished. It's a change for the better of both worlds and will make ranged fighting less annoying, but also fair. This ranged parry change of staying on your feet would also justify his terrible recovery and free guard break from blocking his ranged heavies, which I think should actually stay to get a better punish on ranged attacks that are used too close. So confirmed light from parrying at any range, and free GB for blocking at close range. And he can still fall to the ground on the ranged guard break counter, that should stay the same. This will also give him an incentive to use his ranged kit even when people are paying attention, right now the risk is too high and ranged attacks are useless in 1v1 situations. This will also give the opponent more of a sense of control, they can now ledge with parry from farther distance if there is a ledge between you and he will always have a confirmed punish. Imagine parrying, getting revenge and the shinobi is pulled right to you from any distance with no escape. If you parry him OOS which happens a lot, he won't be able to roll away form a warden vortex etc. The situations where you parry and he's still safe 50 feet away, that needs to go, and being instantly killed for a heavy attack needs to go. Better for both worlds, ranged parries=stays on his feet, but pulled all the way in. 6. **Accidental Deflects**. You shouldn't get punished if it's on accident. I agree with making his deflect only do damage after an input of kick or light attack and make it in line with the rest of the heroes. I think his deflect should work as if he's out of stamina and it does nothing. But then only launches after a light attack or kick input and is safe with i-frames until after the input is complete. 7. **Deflect i-frames Needed**. His deflect is heavily tracked, it needs i-frames (invincibility frames). For the 700ms duration of the deflect, heavy attacks from other players will do a 180 degree turn and hit you on the other side of your teleport. So accidental deflects can be annoying for both parties. The deflect should be safe with i-frames up until the point where you input an attack. After a deflect, the i-frames should end after the light attack and allow you to recover instantly from the light to defend. These i-frames should make up for duration of the animation. You shouldn't be more vulnerable on a shinobi's deflect than Pk's deflect for example. She can punish and instantly recover because it is fast. Her punish is 500ms compared to his 700+ms. His deflect should be more elusive as an escape and punishing tool. 8. **THE BACK FLIP.** The idea here is to exchange a GB punish for i-frame or a hidden stance property. My suggestion is to allow a window in the startup of the back flip where shinobi can be guard-broke, but exchange that punish for a hidden stance property on the flip. So you can GB the startup, but external attacks will whiff. The key to this is that you should be able to punish the kick, if shinobi makes a mistake. The back-flip should be vulnerable to guard-break from startup until the moment shinobi's hands hit the ground on his flip. This way if they GB late, they can still be punished, but still get an opportunity to punish the dodge. This will make him more punishable in a 1v1 setting, but make him more elusive in group fights and the back-flip should be his safe retreat in group fights and not get tracked by external attacks. I think when his hands touch the ground is the perfect moment to end the GB punish window. 9. **ZONE ATTACK**. Another big one. HIS ZONE. It's absolute trash and the worst zone in the game next to centurion. For the love of god please allow him to cancel his zone. It's a free parry and you take more damage than you dish out. This one is a no-brainier, but very important. 10. **Soft Feints?** Consider adding soft feints into his kit somewhere, but I don't see it as necessary. Maybe add a soft feint GB with the zone cancel or on his heavies. He doesn't need any light soft feints imo, but I wouldn't complain if he got some. 11. **Out Of Stamina** **Punish.** Compare shinobi to orochi who get's 70 damage on OOS punish and revenge throws. Shinobi gets the current 40 damage no matter what, suggesting to nerfing it to 35. Whether it's a GB, OOS or revenge throw, wall splat, it's all 40 damage. I think shinobi should get 2 heavies on his OOS punish to confirm this. So 30+35=65 plus maybe the sickle rain follow up, or not, idk. Shinobi should be able to capitalize on stamina punishes. This is something that needs to change especially if shinobi gets a damage nerf. Shinobi's first heavy should stay the same speed, but his second heavy should be sped up. This will give him more options to get into sickle rain if a light/heavy chain is added and add more speed to his second chain heavies and when he rolls in for an attack, which would be really good as this move is often interrupted. 12. **The Kick**. 500ms is a good speed for the kick. Side kick should be 500ms like the forward. The overall double dodge kick is just too slow. It's a bad counter tool. It's a bad opener. And it's bad trading tool. It can do all of these things, but is inefficient in everyone of them. He should have the option of kicking on a single dodge or a double dodge, the startup of the kick itself is react-able, so shinobi can dodge as many times as he wants and not truly force you to move. The point here to to be able to use your mobility to change up the timing of your attack and instigate the enemy to mistime a dodge. Shinobi already has this aspect but he has to either double dodge or quad dodge kick to throw off the timing. It would just streamline this aspect and make the kick better as an opener and a countering tool by making the overall move faster and less anticipated. The side dodge kick would basically become as effective of a counter as wardens shoulder bash but with more timing options. So there's a couple ways this could play out. Punishing the kick on prevention or punishing it after dodging the kick or playing it safe. Also the delay window for the kick should be slightly increased. Kick recovery should stay exactly the same. 13. **Un-dodge-able heavies**. Shinobi's first heavy should be undodgable, as well as his heavy after a chained roll. These heavies are specifically only useful when trying to catch people dodging and predicting their dodge, but it doesn't always track and hit like it should. Not to mention they still have time to dodge and then block or parry the heavy. It would also fix another big issue for shinobi, he cannot catch anyone trying to run away. Everyone can outrun his ranged attacks even when he runs up right behind them, by the time you charge or throw a ranged attack, they are out of range. It's extremely hard for him to catch anyone because he doesn't have a running attack besides the slide, which is hard to do on someone running away and drains all his stamina. An undodgable heavy after a double dodge should be his way of catching people trying to run away. Especially because he has no running attack. Also adding a running heavy attack would be nice as well, but it doesn't change the need for this property on his heavies as this is how they function, but not as consistently as they should. If he doesn't get this property I think they should at least speed up his heavies that way they can't dodge and block so you are at least rewarded for your read. 14. **Slide tackle nerf.** Slide tackle tracking should be slightly nerfed. I didn't really ever use slide tack because of it's high stamina cost and clunky trigger with double sprint, but it's actually really strong. For example, I previously thought that duel was Shinobi's worst game mode because his range was not a factor and everything he has is react-able. But I was wrong. Slide tackle is 3-400ms startup, and even if you try to dodge on reaction it will track you, you have to pre dodge it or try to interrupt it, this sets Shinobi up to cancel it and react, maybe GB the pre dodge or parry the light they throw trying to interrupt it. You do have to sprint slightly longer to trigger it than with WL's or raider's charge. But it is still a very effective tool. Depending on the map it puts Shinobi in low S or A tier in duels, just to put some perspective on how broken this move is, if you decide not to abuse and use it, Shinobi will instantly drop to C tier in duels. I just have to say, I don't want to play like this. I would rather Shinobi have viability in his actual kit and not resort to unlock running like warlord. So, nerf slide tackles tracking, and stick to these other rework changes. It's not an ideal play-style, but this does make shinobi less of a priority and about on the same level of warlord but a lot less damage and ledging potential, it also doesn't provide an OOS punish like WL's bash, but it is an opener that actually works. Another thing to note is that it does revenge lock until after your first hit, so it's good for ganking and will allow your teammates to get heavies in before they can revenge. 15. **Penetration.** His sickle rain heavy needs a new property called Hyper armor penetration. I think Cent needs this on his pins as well. Beserker is really strong, and there's really no way for characters like shinobi or cent to address him without losing damage on trades. If we time a certain attack well it should penetrate his hyper armor and stop him in his tracks. For shinobi, I think his second heavy should have a hyper armor penetration property, as well as his heavy after a chain roll. 16. **Lights**. Consider speeding up his lights. The only reason I say this is that he has no speed advantage against someone like warden who also has 500ms lights. But I think asking for 400ms lights is too much. I think 450ms would be a good speed to start with. All I want is if me and warden attack at the exact same time, I should be hitting first. Also consider 0-50ms GB vulnerability on light attacks as well, as opposed to the current 100ms. **The conclusion.** Shinobi will be less annoying to fight, punishable at any range and on back-flips. But now he will have more incentive to use his ranged kit. The whole basis of shinobi's play style is in and out ranged and mobile ability. But his ranged attacks are shut down and his mobility is easily interrupted on dodge attacks. His ranged and dodge attacks are supposed to be his biggest strengths but they are his biggest weaknesses instead. These will change that. Make shinobi punished more often, but punished less extremely at the same time. Give him a healthy risk reward that allows him to use his kit and allows the opponent to punish reasonably. I am defensive about shinobi, he's my main and he's weak overall and has never been in an OP spot other than maybe the first 2 weeks of launch. I hope to get some support on the positive changes here so I can actually justify a damage nerf. Single dodge chains, and less extreme parry punishes are huge for shinobi and his overall health. He is also getting a lot of nerfs from stamina and revenge stats being removed and all of his feats being nerfed into the ground as well. With all the ways to get guaranteed damage in the game, shinobi can no long survive long enough to get revenge or be of an use in a fight. This is based of my experience in the 2 breach tests. It was really bad for Shinobi. Thoughts?"

Storm Rush is pretty garbage but I believe that it can be the key to bringing up Orochi. 1. Remove GB vulnerability from Storm Rush. The fact that this can even be done is really stupid. 2. Dodge canceling Storm Rush. Canceling Storm Rush does nothing but waste Orochis stamina because theres nothing that you get out of canceling it. Instead of adding plain ol hyper armor, dodge cancels will allow Orochi to get deflect punishes as well as the ability to avoid being hit out of Storm Rush. The hard canceling option will still remain. 3. Left Stance initiates a 600ms version of Wind Gust. This creates many opportunities to use the undodgeable property of top stance of Storm Rush. If they will predict either of the two the right stance Storm Rush will still be there to mix things up with its speed. This change alone gives Orochi a great opener. 4. Finisher Canceling. Finisher Recovery Canceling doesnt work well since Orochi has to land the attack first to be able to dodge cancel. Feinting the heavy finisher into dodge cancel can work but that"
222,vulnerability,forhonor,The Praetorian: A Roman Faction Heavy Concept,1,9mrm53,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/9mrm53/the_praetorian_a_roman_faction_heavy_concept/,2018-10-10 05:17:55,"&amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Hello there, everyone! A while back, I set about writing a story about how the Legions came about allying with the Empire in their war against the Chosen and Warborn. I've recently been hit with a nasty case of writer's block, though, so to help my mind get back in the writing mood, I decided to make little lore tidbits about the fan-classes I made for the story in the style of the character reveal trailers, and that eventually spiraled out of control into a full fan-hero-mockup-thingy. It was pretty late at night when I made this and I'm not super familiar with the inner workings of the game such as MS timings or reasonable stamina values, but I tried to tidy it up and make the functions of the moves as clear as possible. I hope you enjoy reading it! &amp;#x200B; ~~----------------------------------------------~~ ~~----------------------------------------------~~ ~~----------------------------------------------~~ &amp;#x200B; *To the common plebeian, kings or emperors are alike the gods themselves, wielding power unfathomable, spending their whole lives in splendor, immortal and untarnished.* &amp;#x200B; *Nothing could be further from the truth. For all their clout, for all the gleaming baubles and grand frescoes they surround themselves with, lords are but men, and wanted men, at that; forever hounded by the shadow of death, whether it be by angry mobs, rebel factions, or surreptitious assassins. But in the great Empire of the south, something grants these highborn peace...* &amp;#x200B; *...Enter the Praetorian. With her tower shield, she keeps her ward from harm, deflecting even the most terrible blows, and crushing all but the stoutest armor with it's great weight.* &amp;#x200B; *A master of combat, the Praetorian commands lethal skill with two weapons. With her Pilum, she can keep foes at bay and control the battlefield, and with her Gladius, she can lunge in for the kill, staggering her enemies with shield-strikes and bleeding them with deep wounds. Determined and ever-vigilant, Praetorians will die before they surrender, and under their aegis...* &amp;#x200B; *...Their masters become the immortals they appear to be.* &amp;#x200B; ~~----------------------------------------------~~ ~~----------------------------------------------~~ ~~----------------------------------------------~~ &amp;#x200B; **PRAETORIAN** Heavy/Hard Versatile Debuffs, Twin Weapons &amp;#x200B; Weapon Customization: Pilum, Gladius, Scutum &amp;#x200B; Armor Customization: Helmet, Armor, Cloak &amp;#x200B; Gender: Female default, not genderlocked. &amp;#x200B; Armor Appearance: Whereas the Centurion has a muscle cuirass and an anthropomorphic face mask and the Gladiator has the equipment of a murmillo, the Praetorian wears a set of lorica segmentata, over a tunic of either cloth or chainmail depending on the armor set, with a classical roman galea, leaving the face visible. The left arm, the one holding the shield, is lightly armored to prevent clipping. The tunic ends at the knees, and the shins and feet are protected by greaves. Instead of arm armor, the third armor piece is their cloak, which varies from a classic, superhero-esque cape ala Cent or Nuxia to scarves wound around the neck or animal pelts like lion or wolf hides. As the gear rarity gets higher, these capes become less ragged, made of finer materials such as silk instead of rough cloth like burlap, and gain floral embroidery or gold thread accents on the edges. Like most heroes, her beginning armor is dented and worn, but, fitting her royal theme, the later armors are not merely studded, spiked, or gilded, but polished and repaired until the legendary gear is essentially untouched, gleaming and adorned with precious metals like a proper Emperor's guard, without the slightest blemish or scratch. It's up to you to dirty it back up ingame. &amp;#x200B; ~~----------------------------------------------~~ ~~----------------------------------------------~~ ~~----------------------------------------------~~ &amp;#x200B; Moveset Overview: &amp;#x200B; The main aspect of the Praetorian is her weapon switching mechanic; by holding the feint button in neutral, she will sheath her current weapon and draw the other one, changing the properties of her attacks. Her Pilum has a long range on both lights and heavies and deals more damage than her gladius, allowing her to safely poke enemies by keeping out of their attack range. She also gains access to several moves that can move enemies around and improve her defensive options. Meanwhile, her gladius moveset is quicker and has access to bleed and stun moves, allowing her to get in close and disorient her opponent. Holding the feint button after an attack causes her to cancel the ending lag of the attack into a quick swap. &amp;#x200B; Moves: \---------------------------------------------- *Fury of Olympus: Pilum Chain* &amp;#x200B; With the Pilum, she can chain any three heavies or lights together. Every attack is a stab with the Pilum. The second and third hit of the chain have hyperarmor, and the third hit pins if it is a heavy, allowing the Praetorian to throw their opponent in any direction, similar to Nuxia's final heavies, with the control over the throw direction of Gladiator's skewer. &amp;#x200B; \---------------------------------------------- *Maw Of Tartarus: Gladius Chain* &amp;#x200B; With the Gladius, she can chain any two heavies or lights together. Both lights are quick cuts with the gladius, the first heavy is a stab with the gladius, and the the second heavy is a shield swing. The first light has active block frames from any stance. Meanwhile, the first heavy causes bleed, and the second stuns. &amp;#x200B; \---------------------------------------------- *Eagle Dive- Forward Dodge Heavy* &amp;#x200B; With the Pilum, she leaps forward and stabs, a relatively slow top-stance attack with hyperarmor, allowing her to trade hits with the opponent. She can then follow up with guardbreak to shove her enemy back with her shield, draining their stamina slightly and keeping them at a distance so she can attack safely with her long range stabs. This shield bash followup can wallsplat, guaranteeing a heavy if it does, but has no follow up if it does not. This attack is not feintable, it can execute, and it counts as a heavy parry. &amp;#x200B; With the Gladius, she sprints forward a short distance before stabbing forward with her Gladius, an undodgeable attack from right stance that's good for catching dodge-happy assassins. She can follow up with guardbreak to slam her opponent's head with an overhead pommel bash, draining their stamina and stunning them without sending them back, allowing her to begin a close-range onslaught. This attack cannot wallsplat enemies like the Pilum version, but a light is guaranteed afterwards. This attack can be feinted, but cannot execute and counts as a light parry. &amp;#x200B; With both weapons, the initial stab can be chained into the main combo without the bash component. &amp;#x200B; \---------------------------------------------- Nemean Guard: Fullblock stance The Praetorian holds her tower shield in front of her, guarding from all directions. The startup for this stance is similar to Conqueror's, and the ending lag of any attack in her basic combo can be canceled into it. &amp;#x200B; With the Pilum, she can move slowly like Conqueror, and cancel out of it with a light or heavy like Nobushi's hidden stance. When canceling in this manner, she starts on the second hit of her chain, allowing her to trade against unblockables with hyperarmor heavies or interrupt guardbreak or bash attempts with a light. Stamina drains quickly in this mode and canceling out of it with an attack costs extra stamina, so it can't be used excessively. &amp;#x200B; With the Gladius, she is locked in place like Warlord, but can cancel out of it with a dodge. After the initial stamina cost, this stance can be held indefinitely, though the vulnerability to bashes, guardbreaks, and unblockables discourages this. &amp;#x200B; \---------------------------------------------- Spear Wrench: Pilum Fullblock follow-up Upon blocking an attack with Nemean Aegis, the Praetorian can follow up with a heavy, pinning her target and allowing her to throw them in any direction like the last hit in her chain. In lieu of any walls, hazards or ledges to throw her enemies into or off of, she can follow up the throw with a guaranteed light. &amp;#x200B; \---------------------------------------------- Vital Stab: Gladius Fullbock follow-up Upon blocking an attack with Nemean Aegis, the Praetorian automatically stabs the enemy in the gut with her Gladius, inflicting bleed, and can followup with a heavy to smack them with her scutum, dealing more damage, stunning them, and draining stamina. &amp;#x200B; \---------------------------------------------- Eagle's Flight: Backdodge Attack &amp;#x200B; With the Pilum, launching a light while backdodging will make the Praetorian stab forward while stepping back, similar to Viper's retreat. This move has hyper armor. Combined with Eagle Dive, a smart praetorian can keep herself in the optimal range to attack at all times &amp;#x200B; \---------------------------------------------- Gladius Soft Feints &amp;#x200B; The first heavy of Maw Of Tartarus can be softfeinted into Eagle Dive with forward dash or the stunning pommel bash that follows it with guardbreak. Eagle Dive can be softfeinted into Guardbreak any time before the attack indicator appears, similar to pre-buff Storm Rush. &amp;#x200B; \---------------------------------------------- Zone Attack &amp;#x200B; With the Pilum, the Praetorian swings her shield from the left, then stabs from the right. The stab has a very narrow hit box, so the shield swing is the main mook-clearing tool. After the initial shield swing, the Praetorian can softfeint into the follow up shield bash from Eagle Dive, but this is not guaranteed. &amp;#x200B; With the Gladius, she swings the shield from the left, then swings the Gladius from the opposite direction. As both attacks are horizontal swings, this zone is better for killing soldiers on the minion lane. After the initial shield swing, the Praetorian can softfeint into the first attack of Maw Of Tartarus, or the follow up pommel bash of Eagle Dive. The pommel bash guarantees a light like the Eagle Dive version, and is guaranteed itself if the zone attack hits. &amp;#x200B; Both versions can be hard-feinted after the initial swing. \---------------------------------------------- \---------------------------------------------- \---------------------------------------------- Punishes &amp;#x200B; Light Parry: Any heavy. Any heavy after a light parry counts as the second heavy in a chain, allowing the Praetorian to attempt a spear pin afterwards with the Pilum, or stun their opponent with the Gladius' shield swing. &amp;#x200B; Heavy Parry: With the Pilum, Eagle's Flight. With the Gladius, however, the first heavy of Maw of Tartarus is guaranteed. &amp;#x200B; Guardbreak: Any Heavy. &amp;#x200B; OOS Parry/Guardbreak: Light-Heavy for Pilum, and Eagle Dive-Heavy for Gladius. Since the second heavy of the Gladius chain stuns and drains stamina, the Praetorian can keep their opponent exhausted longer. &amp;#x200B; Wall: Any Heavy. If sufficiently far away, the Praetorian can intentionally whiff a light from the Gladius and hit with the second heavy, which deals more damage and stuns. \---------------------------------------------- \---------------------------------------------- \---------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Feats &amp;#x200B; Tier One: Body Count Conqueror Throw Farther- Also Applies to Spear Wrench and the last hit of Fury Of Olympus. &amp;#x200B; Tier Two: Rock Steady Juggernaut Inspire &amp;#x200B; Tier Three: Takedown- Also Applies to Spear Wrench and the last hit of Fury Of Olympus. Weighted Pilum- Throw a spear that deals low damage, exhausts enemies and knocks them over Barbed Pilum- Throws a spear that deals medium damage. &amp;#x200B; Tier Four: Heroism- Creates an aura that gives a large increase to defense to every ally in range, at the cost of reducing your own defense massively and exhausting you. This aura persists around your body for the duration, even if you are killed. If you are killed during Heroism, every ally affected by the aura is given full revenge. Catapult Savior- Gain the benefits of Protected and Fast Revive, and allies are revived at full health. \---------------------------------------------- \---------------------------------------------- \---------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Executions &amp;#x200B; Upon killing an enemy with a heavy, she will return the weapon she has equipped currently to it's place, the sheath on her hip for the Gladius and the strap on her back for the Pilum, and the execution selected determines which weapon she has equipped at the end. &amp;#x200B; Facepalm- Drawing her Gladius, she raises her sword arm up for an overhead blow, and the enemy tries to uppercut her. She brings the elbow of her raised arm down into the rising fist with an audible crack, sending the enemy staggering back holding their broken hand. They attempt another punch with their other fist, but she stabs their hand as they attempt it, and, angling her blade and their hand towards their head, thrusts forward, pinning the enemy's hand to their forehead. She then shoves them off her blade with her shield, leaving her with the Gladius equipped. &amp;#x200B; Roundabout- Stabbing her Gladius into their shoulder, she uses it as a handle to spin them around. Leaving the sword in their shoulder, she draws her Pilum and stabs it through their back, spinning it to turn them back around. Removing her Gladius from their shoulder, she sheathes it as they collapse to their knees. Walking calmly past them, she pulls the Pilum out of their back as they slump over, leaving her wielding it. \---------------------------------------------- \---------------------------------------------- \---------------------------------------------- Voice Lines- Alas, I failed Latin class badly. If anyone's got suggestions, I'll happily take them. Personality-wise, they're not a grandstanding showboat like Centurion or Gladiator, but serious, calm, and protective of their teammates. They are bodyguards, after all. &amp;#x200B;"

Still good, still fast, but actually dodgeable with longer recovery. Hold heavy to charge flail as always. In this ""stance"" you can walk around and block, but you can't light attack, gb, or cgb. You can also press gb to bash. You can dodge but it cancels your charge. You can fast flow into charged form after light or heavy attack. You already have momentum from the hit so you just keep on swingin. Very similar to highlander OS but instead of dodging you block. The gb vulnerability is due to the fact that all your mixups would come from this stance and you want to try and remain in it but it needs to have a downside i think. Maybe not, im open to anything. Release heavy to start your unblockable heavy. From here you can softfeint it into a light or heavy from any direction. You can also soft feint into bash (like you already can now, but slightly faster so its more effective). You can add undodgeables to the attacks to make them catch preemptive dodges as well. All of this is hyper armored so people cant just hit you out of it plus conq wears a ton of armor so it makes sense. I would give anything to fight against a conq who actually uses his flail to attack. An actual heavy hitter. With cool mix ups. Not this one trick pony easy mode garbage. Have shield bash just be an opener to fast flow into charged flail. I think this would be more fun for everyone. Who would support something like this? "

226,vulnerability,forhonor,Sheathed weapons when unlocked discussion,0,98qura,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/98qura/sheathed_weapons_when_unlocked_discussion/,2018-08-20 15:14:21,"Its well known around the community that theres alot of bullshitery around unlock fighting. Whether thats from;  unlock rolling out of mix ups warlords unlock crashing charge ""mix up""  the old unlock tech some characters could exploit  old shugoki unlock oni charging  and more recently the lawbring kiting ""strat"" Spliced has shown As far as i know the general consensus around these things is that most players hate the fighting while unlocked side of the game. Its unfun and uninteractive most of the time (atleast for the victims of these things) and its not the way the game was intendid to be played. Anyway, i was watching an old clip i recorded of the latest executions, specifically conquerors ""get off"" execution, when i saw that wardens sword ~was~ on his back for the animation and i got to thinking. What if each character had a seperate animation for being unlocked that had their weapon sheathed, or otherwise tucked away. Each character would still have access to their out of lock attacks (such as wardens rushing slash or lawbringers impailing charge,) but has a very brief delay before getting access to their basic moveset and guard capabilities. I think one of the issues with fighting while unlocked is the ability to lock back on and instantly be ready to parry/attack, leaving almost 0 vulnerability or consequence to being unlocked in the first place. Here are some things i thought up;  locking onto an opponent (or air/nothing) activates a 500-600ms animation where the hero is drawing their weapon, or otherwise getting ready. During the animation the hero cannot block but can counterguardbreak. Taking any form of damage/displacement or countering a guardbreak during the animation instantly readies your guard.  unlocking from an opponent has a similair animation (400-600ms) that puts your weapon into a holstered/sheathed position. During this animation you can not roll or dodge but you can re-lock on to cancel putting away your weapon allowing you to dodge. Getting hit during this animation will instantly sheathe your weapon unless you lock back onto your opponent. (This last part is so you dont get locked in the animation during a gank) succesfully landing (maybe even wiffing) a out of lock attack can 'fast flow' into readied stance, after the attack animation is done. (This is to help characters like warlord land his heavy attack after charging you to a wall) this doesnt affect the normal recovery times of these attacks however, so wiffing a running attack will be punished as usual. My goal with these concepts was to add some risk to fighting while unlocked and randomly unlocking from your target. The small animations for unlocking stops players from rolling away from anything and everything. The animation for locking on shows vulnerability for someone who isnt ready for the fight, removing some of the saftey and stopping a players ability to easily defend or counter your attempt of punishing them. For the hell of it heres a few ideas on new sheathed/idle animations; Wardens sword sheathed/drawn from his/her back Orochis same as normal but longer with a scabbard Berserkers draws axes from loops on his/her belt Peacekeeper draws and twirls her daggers from her waist Shinobi swings his sickles from his hands then flicks them up (similair to the ""show of skills"" emote) Raider thrusts his/her axe with a warcry In the end, after typing this all out i can see alot of flaws in this concept. (For example; The in-ability to block during the lock on animation means attacks like wardens valiant breakthrough completely shut down any attempt at running attacks) and its a massive change the the system that is unlikely to be implemented. Im no balance director and ive never worked on making a game, im only plat 3 in ranked duels so im not that great a player and im sure you all have many issues with what ive thought up. However i would still like to hear other players thoughts on what ive said, and any changes you would like to see. "
227,vulnerability,forhonor,Conq is an issue...,3,98ykyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/98ykyt/conq_is_an_issue/,2018-08-21 09:47:56,"...but WTF do we do about it? As a day 1 Conq main at rep 34, here's what I got. I'm trying to take the enormous amount of power in Conq's SB and option select zone and spread the love around his kit. I'm about to make all of this look like patch notes. - **Neutral Game** - **Branch to Neutral SB at 200ms after dodge (up from 100ms)** - Light attacks are 15 damage (up from 13) - Side Heavies are 28 damage (up from 25) - Top Heavies are 35 damage (up from 33) *He's described as a ""Hard Hitter"", but he consistently does not ""hit hard"". These changes make his already heavily telegraphed and slow attacks more useful and threatening. Conquerors can survive ganks currently, but they can't end them.* *Also, Neutral Shield Bash nerf! It is currently too good to make Conqueror use any part of the rest of his kit. That is a REALLY strong sign that the move is actually overpowered, or that the rest of his moves are underpowered. In this case, both are true. Now, his bash is 100ms slower, meaning you'll see him dodge more before his bash starts, giving you more time to ready yourself. His bash is now 700ms at it's fastest and he can't delay it as long.* - **Conscript's Attrition** - Chained heavies are 700ms (down from 800ms) *For some reason, his heavies are slower in chain than outside of his chain. This might be because of Shield Uppercut, but that move is not very useful when looking at his kit, especially considering how much stamina it takes to perform it. This will incentivize Conquerors to go for more than just the second delayed light when chaining.* - **Charged Heavy** - Top Charged Heavy does 48 damage (up from 44) - Side Charged Heavies do 38 damage (up from 35) - Charged Heavy guard has Superior Block *His Charged Heavies are currently very weak. They are used primarily for (sparse) gank utility and confirmed damage. You don't see Conquerors charging their heavies anymore, and part of the reason is because they can't. Blocking attacks while charging his heavy stops the charge. In this state, he cannot Counter Guard Break or Parry, which I think is sufficient for giving him Superior Block passively while he is charging his heavy. Now, he can actually charge the thing!* - **Shield Bashes (other than Neutral SB)** - Shield Uppercut is 700ms (down from 800ms) - Shield Uppercut now costs 35 stamina (down from 42) - Shield Bash Mix-up is 700ms (down from 800ms) - Shield Bash Mix-up guarantees a Side Heavy - Shield Bash Mix-Up grants a Guard Break on a whiff - Shield Bash Mix-up has a slightly larger horizontal hit radius - Shield Bash Riposte re-introduced *This section is very important. This gives Conqueror plenty of reasons to use the other bashes in his kit. Shield Uppercut tracks better and more quickly while Shield Bash Mix-up guarantees a heavy if it lands.* *Of course, Shield Bash Mix-up is able to put more damage out there, which means it must have a vulnerability. Being able to Guard Break a Conqueror after a successful dodge will make the move seem more fair. This also gives Conquerors a reason to actually go for Shield Bash Mix-up over Shield Bash Riposte as Shield Bash Mix-up will hit to the side more often and is slightly faster.* - **Zone** - You can no longer zone attack from Full Block Stance - Shield Bash Riposte is re-introduced - Shield Bash Riposte is 800ms - Shield Bash Riposte has Full Block Property when active - Shield Bash Riposte guarantees a Side Heavy - Shield Bash Riposte grants a Guard Break on a whiff - Flail Uppercut does 35 damage *Conqueror's Full Block Stance is currently very strong. It allows him to Zone, which stops him from being Guard Broken. By removing the ability to Zone from Full Block Stance, he needed something to compensate for the loss.* *Not much compensates for the loss of an option select, but Shield Bash Riposte can do a good job of it. Chain Heavies can now bait parries for Shield Bash Riposte. Attacks will bounce off of the bash and guarantee him a free Side Heavy.* *However, if he misses, he is punished for it as he could have waited for a Flail Uppercut. Flail Uppercut does more damage, yes, but by doing Shield Bash Riposte Conqueror will be safe from soft-feinted Guard Breaks, which I think the lower damage compensates for. Flail Uppercut is the carrot on the stick here. Go for the bash, or wait it out?* --- That's all I got, lemme know what you guys think. With these changes, I sought to: - **Nerf the neutral Shield Bash** - Make Conqueror hit hard finally - Give his other bashes reasons to be used - Make Charged Heavies another ""carrot on a stick"" for Conqueror - Make FBS have more Risk/Reward in its gameplay loop What do you guys think? What needs to be changed? Where did I go overboard?"

His recovery frames are literally the longest out of all the Assassins, Vanguards, Hybrids and Heavies (Not including Shugoki two moves). The devs tried to rationalise it as ""Oh, well he can cancel recovery frames with a dodge"", but considering every player GBs when they see their opponent in their recovery frames, you're still going to be eating an untechable GB. Not to mention Orochi can *STILL* be GB through his Riptide Strike, ***DESPITE*** it now being a Light Attack, all because they massively increased the terrible back-dodge GB vulnerability. That back-dodge GB vulnerability addition literally made 85% of the Orochi's kit useless against a competent player, as they can GB you just as you go to initiate 85% of your kit. There's still no CC/easy unblockable combos to force a reaction, meaning in higher level player, the Orochi can ***STILL DO NOTHING TO TURTLES***, which was his primary problem pre-rework, aside from his speed being too slow. The funniest part about all this is the Devs literally gave Nuxia everything we Orochi mains have been asking for; A heavy dodge attack so that dodge attacks aren't going to be 100% parried on use, as it could be a heavy or light, and a CC that punishes turtles."

A character either is overtuned or has a broken mechanic, and the devs take nearly months to even acknowledge that with a rebalancing, buff/nerf or a rework. But instead of doing that, they should just do some quick easy fixes. Disclaimer: These fixes are not aimed to make a character immediately better, they are to make the character less annoying and less turtle-like. So in the end, they may be weaker than they were before.(But then again, nearly half of the entire cast was underpowered, so hey) # _____________________________________ &amp;#x200B; # Warden Get rid of Warden's ability to feint a fully charged Shoulder Bash *while it's moving.* Also, increase the release time of an uncharged Shoulder Bash to make it possible to react.(Right now, I hear that with the feint window and lag comp. taken into the equation, the reaction window to dodging Shoulder Bash is 33ms, which is impossible for any human to do) ALSO also, fix the animation on Valiant Breakthrough. Right now, it looks really janky. Change the animation to look more like a stab, like Apollyon's neutral unblockable stab, but faster(of course). ALSO ALSO also, purely for looks, change the heavy finishers to look like murder strokes.(Seriously, we need Warden to be an actual ""master of the longsword,"" not ""master of the shoulder"") \- # Peacekeeper Allow her to chain after using a dash heavy or a dagger cancel. And also, to help her outside of 1v1s, transfer some of her bleed damage into direct damage.(ex: let's say that dagger cancel does 1 direct + 10 bleed. We can change that to 4 direct + 7 bleed.) \- # Conqueror Change his dodge input for the forward shield bash to 100-300ms instead of 100-500ms. Also, bring his light damage back to 15 instead of 13. ALSO also, to actually make his Charging Stance, the stance with the UB heavies, useful, allow him to dodge and block lights without losing charge. Why devs, would you take the Charging Stance, one of the things Conq is known for, and make it only useful for punishing OOS throws? ALSO ALSO also, fix the full-block bug where the start-up is 600ms instead of 300ms. \- # Lawbringer Get rid of shove-on-block. That's it. Also, if possible, change the recovery so that the side heavy punish after a parry doesn't land even on a heavy parry. ALSO also, replace one of Lawbringer's bomb feats. I am perfectly fine with him having at least 2 bomb feats at once, but not 3. \- # Centurion Get rid of Charged Jab. There. FINALLY NO MORE CUTSCENE. Also, if possible, change Eagle's Talons so that it has an input of back + heavy so that it's less annoying to deal with when a Cent is in revenge. ALSO also, give him some more tracking on his Eagle's Fury Alternate(in lock). Seriously, the tracking is horrible. \- # Gladiator Change his guard duration to be 800ms. 500ms duration is impossible to use when in an anti-gank or a 4v4. 800ms make's it much less difficult. Also, give his zone GB vulnerability. At the very least, 100ms. \- # Warlord Fix his shield charge so that you're required to run more than 1 meter to use it.(lets say 10 meters) And if anyone says that this will ruin his out-of-lock mixup potential, then go home. A character shouldn't be powerful based off of their out-of-lock moves, they should be strong *in-lock* as well. Also, buff his damage back to before the nerfs to his damage. But nerf his zone to be less than 25(Zones that deal *much* more damage than lights after a heavy parry shouldn't be a thing. It's fine if they're at 20, give or take one damage, but it isn't okay to be at 25) ALSO also, buff his hyper armor to appear at least 100ms earlier. \- # Berzerker Nerf the damage. A character cannot have a high damage output while also having hyperarmor on every single attack. And since the hyper armor is the whole point of the character, I feel as though the Berzerker should only be an average damaging character. \- # Shaman Nerf the throw recovery for opponents. Basically, don't allow Shaman to get anything off of a throw, be it a bash, bite or dash heavy. If Shaman tries to, the opponent can just dodge out of the way. Now if it's a wallsplat, then anything's guaranteed(obviously). # - # Raider Fix the combo zone. Right now, it bugs and looks like it's going in a different direction, even when it's locked onto you. Fix that devs. Also, make it so that Stampede Charge is interruptable on run when he's carrying you, but when he pins you to the wall, it remains uninterruptable, but has damage reduction for the opponent on all external attacks. \- # Highlander Change the Kick-to-grab soft-feint so that it's in line with all other hard and soft feint timings. Right now, the soft feint occurs 300ms before the kick lands, instead of what should be the standard 400ms. So change it to 400ms before the kick lands. Also, give Highlander's kick a soft-feint to dodge. *But this dodge will* ***knock him out of*** *Offensive Stance and into Defensive Stance.* The point of this soft-feint is to give Highlander a way to catch rollers with the use of Celtic Curse when he dodges forward from the Kick.(This change appears to be large, but it's also probably the easiest for the devs to do for soft-feint options) ALSO also, decrease the delay time for the Toss from neutral down to 200ms from 400ms. But if the Toss is used from an unblockable heavy, the delay is further reduced to only 100ms. ALSO ALSO also, decrease the Unblockable heavies from Offensive Stance to deal only 35 damage instead of 40. \- # Shugoki Get rid of the 25% damage increase done to Shugoki when his hyperarmor's down. Also, get rid of the one-shot potential of Demon's Embrace when Shugoki's at critical health. Instead, increase the health gained when using DE while at critical health. ALSO also, give damage reduction to anyone who is getting DE'd. \- # Shinobi Decrease his overtuned damage output. I'm not waiting 4 seasons for his rework to fix that. Also, make his ranged heavies enhanced. And make it so that they don't unbalance them if parried, but instead bring them close to his opponent to guarantee the opponent a light attack.(They could use the same animation where Shinobi pulls the opponent to him after using a ranged GB) ALSO also,(speaking of ranged GB) a successful ranged GB does not guarantee Sickle Rain. Instead, it only guarantee's a regular starter heavy.(Basically, a ranged GB doesn't default to Sickle Rain) ALSO ALSO also, Sickle Rain is now interruptable. (This one is purely optional, because I don't know what effects the change will have, but I want the backflip to be replaced with a simple dodge out of recovery. It may be broken or useless, I don't know. But it seems less annoying than the backflip) # _____________________________________ And that's it. The aim of these changes were to get rid of moves that prove to be abusable or broken or unfair and, if possible, compensate with some added properties. This may make your main worse, that's an inevitability. But it also gets rid of the turtle potential/high-reward, low-risk properties of these characters. With this, the devs can easily improve the quality of fights by getting rid of flawed moves or properties of some characters. &amp;#x200B;"

Dash attacks Every character in the game except shugoki has a dashing attack or bash, but a theme among some weaker characters is a lack of side dash attacks for punches and the like, so my idea is instead of your stance widget deciding where the dash attack goes it's the dash direction, and the teleport side dashes could have I frames so it works more like a deflect punish(this way the mist he shoots makes sense). Regular chains Aramusha has two attack chains which are pretty easy to predict, so if he had some alt chains that only worked from side to side or from the same direction that could lead into better mixups. Also the unblockable side attack on the blade blockade could be used as a chain finisher that forces reactions as well as going into the deadly feint. Blade blockade The issue with blade blockade is the vulnerability and recovery. How I think it should work is you can hold it like any other all guard, take away the inability to block between activation and stuff, and give the player more time to activate the abilities. I've seen too many aramusha try to ring the bell and end up throwing a light attack that gets blocked or parties. For punishes remove the side heavy unblockable and make it so if you successfully block and you hit heavy the following heavy automatically comes from the top. Blade blockade kick Just let people mix it into chains like Ghandi will. Maybe it can replace a chain finisher and maybe it can replace the second half of the zone. There are my main ideas. If anyone else has some other ideas or wants to see more rework ideas/speculation I'd love to hear about it."

236,vulnerability,forhonor,The Orochi Rework from the view of Scotland's Ranked #1 player.,6,94xxcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/94xxcc/the_orochi_rework_from_the_view_of_scotlands/,2018-08-06 13:36:45,"So it's been 2 months since the Orochi Rework dropped, and I've held back judgement until I felt that I'm accustomed to the new kit. Here's my thoughts on the Orochi Rework: *Cool, I guess.* Don't get me wrong, we wanted the speed changes, sure, and we're thankful for them, along with the Storm Rush change. However, the part where every Orochi main agreed on was that he needed an easily accessible UB/CC to force a reaction, as you could easily block all of his attacks without much effort. This is still the case. What about the 333ms lights? Only the delayed light after a heavy can achieve such speed. And after a heavy, you expect a side light, so you can even predict it. Worst case scenario you take 17 dmg, once. Also, the 333ms is the best case scenario, where you delay your light perfectly at the last point in time where you can chain your light input. This is almost certainly not always the case. Currently, Orochi is back to where he was pre-rework; He can't open turtles at high level and is unable to get damage. All you need to do is block his 500ms lights, and parry his slow heavies to get damage. Nothing else. I dunno about you, but 500ms isn't that fast anymore. In the first few months of For Honor, 500ms was absolute hell however we're now a year in and accustomed to 500ms. The Orochi needs an easily accessible UB/CC so that we can force reactions from our opponents, otherwise he'll never be viable in higher tier play. I've played as the Orochi since the Closed Beta, and reached max rep before the rep was increased multiple times, and have been still playing the Orochi since last patch, his flow is just so satisfactory, but when my opponent is OOS, all I can do is some chip damage. And likewise, when I face one of the thousands of Orochi we see left and right these last days and I run OOS, well, nothing happens because nothing really can happen. Riptide Strike: Good overall, but still suffers heavily from the old RS's major flaw; Being guardbroken mid-animation. The old Riptide was all fair and good, considering it was a heavy attack, however the new RS is considered a light attack, and as such, shouldn't allow a GB on use. I can't stress how many times I've went to Riptide an attack only to get GB due to the GB vulnerability time. I can't stress this enough, he only needs two buffs; 1) Give him an easily accessible UB/CC from neutral to encourage players to react and to help with turtles. 2) Remove GB vulnerability for Riptide Strike. It's considered a light attack now, and shouldn't allow a GB. That is my thoughts on the rework; Good but it didn't fix his core problem. u/MrEricPope"
237,vulnerability,forhonor,Severe Rebalancing And Add-ons To Conqueror V.3.0(Warning: long read),2,8rlbm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/8rlbm7/severe_rebalancing_and_addons_to_conqueror/,2018-06-17 04:38:12,"After making the first version, I searched throughout the [r/forhonor](URL and [r/CompetitiveForHonor](URL subs, looking for rebalancing and improvement suggestions for the Conqueror. I found them, and realized something else. Assassins are leagues above more powerful than heavies due to having many effective tools, those of which outshine the heavy class, which have fewer, much less effective tools. So I propose this. Give the Conqueror's tools some major viability and effectiveness buffs to finally even out the playing field. What we know: Conqueror's moveset is a mixed bag. His Charge Stance is useless in 1v1s or 1vXs, his Shield Uppercut is underpowered for its stamina cost(which is 42), and his full block soft feints and flail uppercut are easy to deal with in high level play. These were all the previous versions of this post: [Version 1.0](URL [Version 2.0](URL [Version 2.1](URL \*Editor's Note: All of these changes are without feats in mind, and are to balance the moves to be more viable in either 1v1s, 4v4s, Xv1s(Ganks), and 1vXs(Anti-ganks).\* # Shield Bash His Shield Bash - specifically his neutral Shield Bash - is too safe and spammable, while his chained bash and uppercut are underpowered. Time to fix that. \*\*Neutral Shield Bash\*\* * His guaranteed light after neutral Shield Bash is reduced to 11 from 13 * His tracking on side dodges is reduced mildly * His tracking on back dodges is increased to have the possibility of catching back dodges. * He can follow a whiffed Neutral Shield Bash with a heavy or light, but their damage is reduced to 7 for the light, and 15 for the heavy(Now this and the next point may make it safe, and that's because I cannot think of a solution that is a balance between too safe, or too vulnerable, so someone else should think up of an idea) * Shield Bash from neutral's dodge input window is shortened to 200ms-500ms from 100ms-500ms * Neutral Shield Bash cannot take away the stamina of an OOS opponent, only pause the stamina regen(This feature needs to be widespread across all characters) \*Editor's Note: These changes are to make neutral Shield Bash a lot less spammable. It is still useful as an opener, but that's all it should be. In this sense, it's a much more flexible version of Warlord's headbutt, but not made as spammable.\* \*\*Chained Shield Bash\*\* * If hit, grants Conqueror a side heavy * The guaranteed side heavy's damage is decreased to 23 damage * If the Conqueror does not want to perform a guaranteed heavy, he could still perform a guaranteed light. \*Editor's Note: Chained Shield Bash is slow and low-rewarding(unless opponent is wallsplatted). This higher reward complements its slower speed. \* \*\*Shield Uppercut\*\* A high stamina-costing move, with low rewards, that fails at its job at catching dodgers. * Range is increased, to catch back-dodgers * If hit, grants Conqueror a side heavy * The guaranteed side heavy's damage is decreased to 23 damage * If the Conqueror does not want to perform a guaranteed heavy, he could still perform a guaranteed light. \*Editor's Note: The increased range works at fixing the move. It's supposed to catch dodgers, but can't catch back-dodgers. The higher reward complements the slow speed and high stamina cost of the move.\* # ""Dodge Attack(Name: Full Force, Disobedient Retaliation, etc.)"" This is a new move I've thought of. Conqueror can, while in mid-heavy attack, can input a dodge in two other directions of the guard to perform a heavy in that direction. Like with Highlander's Celtic Curse, only you dodge to change the attack direction, and you don't have to dodge forward before heavy attacking. (Ex: Top heavy, dodge right, heavy changes to a right heavy.) * When performed, Conq has around 100-200ms of invincibility to have a chance at dodging an attack * The attack speed is about 600ms for the side dodge inputs, and 700ms for forward dodge input * The damage is 23 for side dodge inputs, and 28 for forward dodge input * The Dodge input value is the same as Shield Uppercut \*Editor's Note: This move is meant for mix-ups, and for tricking opponents.\* # Full Block Conqueror's full block is useful against new players, but is not as useful in high level play. So we only need to look at his soft feint timings and his options from blocking while in Full Block. \*\*Soft-Feinting\*\* * FB soft feint window from mid-attack is increased to last from 100ms as soon as the attack begins, and 300ms before the attack ends * FB soft feint window from blocked attacks is to be as early as 200ms into the blocked attack animation * FB soft feint window from whiffed attacks is increased greatly, by about 500-600ms earlier than before \*Editor's Note: These changes are to make him more mix-up potential in 1v1s, and to help him greatly in 1vXs, the one area he is at his worst.\* \*\*(Technically) New Move: Stand Clear\*\* * If hit while in Full Block, Conqueror can perform an unblockable zone attack * Stand Clear has high range, about 1.5-2 meters * Stand Clear's knock back ability * Stand Clear is one hit, that can be be continued as a regular zone, or be continued into Conscript's Attrition * Like Flail Uppercut, it's unparryable, but deals low damage * After three swings, the full guard property reverts to Conqueror's regular zone, only guarding from the sides \*Editor's Note: This move is to give him the chance to create space for himself in 4v4s and 1vXs. It allows him to continue to fight when outnumbered.\* \*\*Flail Uppercut\*\* * The damage of the Flail Uppercut scales up if, while in Full Block, Conqueror is hit by multiple enemies * Minions cannot scale up the damage \*Editor's Note: This situation would be very unlikely, but should allow for a quick kill. The scaling would be so: 1 hit, 1.0 x damage; 2 hits, 1.5 x damage; 3 hits, 2.0 damage; 4 hits, 3.0 damage. This accentuates Conq's ""Hard Hitter"" aspect.\* \*\*Shield Riposte\*\* * Shield Riposte returns, same properties * If used after blocking an attack in Full Block, will be guanranteed and knock the enemy down \*Editor's Note: Since the soft-feint into guardbreak is viewed as pointless and awkward, the Shield Riposte returns. This is just another possible option for the Conqueror. While it may not have been known as useful pre-rework, it may see more use as when it comes to selecting an option after a blocked hit.\* (I wouldn't know how to balance out some of the GB vulnerability of Shield Riposte or the regular zone attack, I'll leave that up to the devs or someone else) # Zone Attack An attack that is *very* safe. If you're in revenge with unlimited stamina and uninterruptability, you're practically invincible. So here are a couple proposed changes. * After one hit, the Zone Attack loses its guard on top(the move looks like it can't in any way block in every direction while also attacking) *Editor's note: This change is to grant it a weakness and not make the zone a must option for defence. This is also to incentivize Conquerors to use Stand Clear, which keeps its top guard for more than three hits. So the normal zone is still good for option select, but not made as safe, and not as annoying to deal with if a Conqueror is in revenge mode.* # Charge Stance Conqueror's charge stance is useless in 1v1s and 1vXs, as it take time to charge any unblockable, which anyone can see and know what the Conqueror will do. This only makes the charging stance useful as OOS punish, in Xv1s and 4v4s. Lets change that. \*\*Charge Stance Properties\*\* * Charging Stance can block lights without losing his charge, but blocking heavies makes it lose the charge * Guard switch delay decreased to 100ms from 200ms \*Editor's Note: These changes are to make it so that, while in Charge Stance, it's possible to block lights. The inability to block heavies will make it so that enemies throw out heavies more often, thus allowing Conq to use his Superior Heavies to counter-attack.\* * While in Charging Stance, Conqueror can dodge while keeping his charge \*Editor's Note: This gives Conqueror a way to close the distance of his target. The problem before was that Conq was slow in this Stance, and the enemy could just dodge away to stay safe.\* * If Conq deflects any attack(light or heavy) he keeps his charge * When Conqueror is in Charging Stance, if he uses his pseudo-deflect to deflect an attack, he can perform a dash heavy attack \*Editor's Note: The suggestion in the previous version was to give him the ability to unblockable dodge heavy from Charge Stance. But I thought that giving him that kind of power would be too much. So I restricted it to only being performed if Conq deflects an attack, which would incentivize him to deflect more often while in Charge Stance.\* \*\*Soft-feinting From Charge Stance\*\* * Performing a Shield Uppercut from an Unblockable Charged Heavy gives the Uppercut the ability to wallsplat * A Shield Uppercut from a Charged Heavy can be performed 100ms later than from a normal heavy * Performing a Full Block Soft feint from an Unblockable Charged Heavy decreases the start time to 200ms from 300ms * Performing a Full Force(Dis-Ret, name not yet chosen) from an Unblockable Charged Heavy grants it unblockability \*Editor's Note: The Stance is unique to Conq(somewhat), but it is so unrefined that it feels like an add-on. Giving these moves special properties accentuates the power of this stance, and gives the stance enough viability to become a powerful way of fighting.(like how some people are more focused on feinting, or how some people focus on bashes.)\* # Stamina Conqueror is a heavy, and thus has a low stamina pool. But the stamina costs of some of his moves are either too high or too low. So this is to balance them out. * Conqueror's charging shield crush's stamina cost is reduced to 50 from 60 \*Editor's Note: This move confirms, at best, a Shield Bash into light, which is 13 damage without feats. And if whiffed, can be punished severely. A lower stamina cost is meant to balance out the low damage reward.\* * Conqueror's Shield Uppercut's stamina cost is reduced to 30 from 42 * If performed from Charge Stance, Shield Uppercut's stamina cost would remain at 42 \*Editor's Note: The stamina decrease may seem like too much, but the added guaranteed heavy should add to the stamina cost, balancing the move.\* (Took away the Neutral Shield Bash's Stamina Cost increase to 20 from 10) Conclusion: After these changes, Conqueror becomes more focused on his Charge Stance, his mix-up potential, and his Soft-feint capabilities, instead of just his Neutral Shield Bash. His soft-feint into full block timings become godly, to complement his non-existent hard-feint potential(none). His Charge Stance becomes terrifying in its own sense, like Highlander's OS, but still has its fair share of weaknesses. And he's granted more mix-up potential from the soft-feint options from a heavy. His 1v1 and 4v4 performance is more balanced and complex, in 1vX he can survive better, and in Xv1 he's not so dependent on Shield Bash. With this, he's now solidified as a Good Defender(but not too safe), and a Hard Hitter(because now his hard hitting damaging attacks are more viable). "

Proposed agility: Orochi can dodge out of the recovery of all lights and heavies(starters, chain attacks, finishers). *Orochi is agile, and can dodge out of his chain finisher's recovery, which is great, but not enough. If an Orochi cannot reach the finisher and is in a gank, he'll suffer due to his long recovery from his attacks. This will mainly help him in ganks, but also give him some more mix-up potential.* Present Storm Rush: Orochi has to dodge back and immediately press the heavy input to go into storm rush, the input which is difficult and clunky. He cannot dodge while in sitting position or while running to his opponent to perform Storm Rush. Proposed Storm Rush: Orochi can delay his Storm Rush input like he could before his rework, for more flexibility. He can also dodge to the sides and forwards while sitting. He can also dodge forward or to the sides while running towards his opponent until the last 200ms of the run before the Storm Rush attack(meaning 200ms before the red indicator shows). *Storm Rush is better with its omni directional fast attacks(with the left input being somewhat useless for many reasons other than ""more choices"") but it is rather inflexible and clunky, which is weird considering this is meant to be for an assassin. The increased input window is to lessen the amount of attempted failures when trying to perform Storm Rush. The increased ability to dodge either while sitting or running is to give both more mix-up potential, and to also help in ganks(and also to give a counter to a well placed light that can stop Storm Rush entirely).* Present Riptide Strike: A backwards dodge move that is meant to counter attack an attacking opponent. Usually guardbroken out of even when in mid-animation, and does not chain either on whiff or block. Proposed Riptide Strike: The move cannot be guardbroken after 100ms into the attack(I am pretty sure complete guardbreak vulnerability would be broken). Orochi can chain from a whiffed or blocked Riptide Strike. *The reasoning behind this buff is that the move is rather distinguishable from any other move that the Orochi can do, and is much more easily parried than most moves(it is still a 600ms light dodge attack). The small guardbreak vulnerability is meant to fix the problem of being guardbroken mid-animation, but still give it a small weakness to GB, and the ability to chain from block or whiff is solely meant for increased mix-up potential.* All of this is to make the Orochi a little more flexible and agile, but not in ways that makes him broken beyond repair.

If I can dodge his heavy, kick, or grab and go for a guard break and he can counter it simply because he let go of the heavy attack button, that's not balanced. If I can force him to dodge by feinting an attack and can't get any punish out of it because he can immediately go into a kick, that's not balanced. He feels far too safe in offensive stance considering he can just dodge constantly and punish you any time you go for a guard break, and that punish gives him 40 damage. It's been this way for two seasons, people who put tons of time into HL have said he's too strong and needs tweaking, so where are the balance changes? Are we going to have to wait for another two seasons? Even longer?"

NOW TO THE NEW PARTS... \- 2 new Combo Chains Light+light chain heavy+heavy chain \- Zone attack changes His new zone contains two attacks. The first part is a bash with his shield that can hit everybody in front &amp; on the sides of Warlord. It has a 600ms start up &amp; deals 5 damage (just for minion clearing). The second part is an unblockable top heavy. It's a 1000ms attack with uninterruptible stance that deals around 45-50 damage (enough so people care about to not get hit by it like Raiders chained zone). He can switch his target (like Highlanders Celtic Curse) between the first 300ms of the attack but the attack always comes from top (target switching just for anti ganking purposes). Uninterruptible stance activate after the first 200ms of the attack &amp; there's also a 200ms guardbreak vulnerability in it so everyone should do some sort of punish after dodging the first part of the zone. \- Gudmundrs Hug (didn't come up with a name for it...) New Move: move back + guardbreak. 800ms start up. Costs 10 stamina &amp; another 20 when missed. Drains 30 stamina from opponent &amp; replenishes Warlords completely. Doesn't deal damage. Guaranteed after Wallsplat. SO MUCH BUFF, WHERE'S THE NERFS? \- 50/50 has to go... Crashing Charge no longer Wallsplats opponents, instead it knocks people down. Warlord DOES NOT profit from the knockdown &amp; can't get guaranteed damage in. Just like Conquerer. \- Headbutt start up increase by 100ms.

This gives lawbringer a opener, mixup potential, ability to deal with bashes and reduces vulnerability when going on the offence.(ability to deal with bashes comes from the hyper armour and the fact that long arm is faster than a heavy) new moves/abilities may also need to be added to bring him on par with the large kits of reworked characters and newer characters, which is open for debate.

Last match whenever I'd guard break he'd throw a heavy on reaction and I'd eat it. It feels like Aramusha, where his heavies have no vulnerability period. I do NOT remember that before.

Now the objective of this suggestion is to make him viable and fun, a dangerous foe but with no spamable trick, in order to achieve this, we should keep in mind what type of character he is. This is mix from very good ideas i have seen here but i always feel that those have something missing. Sorry for my english. # General traits &gt;***Attempted muder of a Lawbringer, sentence: death*** * side dodge recoveries still 700 ms. I know it's terrible, but, fixing his shove should be enough to punish consistently, besides with this rework he will become a hero with deadly punishes, allowing a decent mobility would be op. * He is a static fighter, relying more in his armor, damage and ressilience rather than low recoveries, soft feints and ways to avoid damage. * Shove becomes a way to turn the momentum of the fight in his favour, allowing easy access to deadly chains and finishers. * Heavy focus on his vanguard\-heavy mix and disabler abilities, with high damaging hits while revolving around shoves, stuns, reads and baits \(no spamable tricks\). * He is stamina innefficient, he cannot keep attacking for long, before going out of stamina \(and with 700 ms recoveries that is a very big weakness\). * With an armor with no\-equal and the most versatile weapon ever he should have tools that should reflect this \(i.e everything is counterable\). # Offensive changes &gt;***I am the LAW!*** * GB count as chain intiator, throw re\-start the chain heavy after GB will be the second heavy in a chain, while throw into a wall will count as neutral heavy, more of this later * all heavies should increase either range or tracking In it's current state he is easily out ranged, and his only ranged options are slow with mediocre damage \(30 dmg really?\), those also lack tracking and doesn't cover much ground, which is silly having in mind he has a pole\-weapon larger than him, a common issue is the weapon clearly hitting the enemy but doesn't register, this should fix it sorry i don't it's current range but feels short for such large weapon * neutral heavies are 40 damage with hyper armor, 900 \(from 800\) ms side and 1000 \(from 900\) ms top, hyper armor kicks in 500 ms into the attack for side heavies while top is 600 ms LB lacks damage, relying too much on combos and parries, but the problem is that his combos are soo slow that rarely conect and when is does is only 30 dmg each heavy, feels lackluster and takes a lot to finish any oponent, as a stationary fighter he trades mobility for staying power relying in outlasting every oponent through damage and his superior HP why not making his heavies faster?, because faster than 800 ms become safer from feint into GB, making a parry speacialist have safe parry options is bad design * every light is 500 ms, be it neutral, middle of the chain or finisher 600 ms lights should not exist, unless those have a nice niche like hyper armor, especial counter properties or easy ways to bypass it like conq shield bash into his 500 ms chain or berserk feint into 400 ms lights, also LB lights has no momentum or movement while being short range, this will compesante while making it excellent at baiting light parries * every side heavy that is second in a chain is 600 ms, top is 700 ms, both 30 dmg, hyper armor kicks at 100 ms into attack one of the worst things in ganks is to shove/combo someone to follow up with a heavy just to be guard broken in the middle of it, this will prevent that \(attacks under 800 ms only have 100 ms vulnerability frames\) why 600 ms? \(could be 700 ms side and 800 ms top\) is to put preassure with the shove light/heavy mix up, low recovery heros can block the heavy even if they dodge anticipating the light and if your enemy accepts the light, the heavy is a free parry. * Heavy finishers \(not unblockable ones\) are 700 ms side, 40 dmg, 800 ms top with 45 dmg, hyper armor kicks 100 ms into the attack same thing, sides ones cannot be guard broken while top has more properties with stun and 10 dmg confimed follow up light * Zone attack, 700 ms hyper armor into 100 ms into the animation, 30 dmg current zone attack is laughable of how bad it is, low damage \(20\), decent range but can be guardbroken in the first 400 ms while also being 900 ms, now is a trading tool, high damage but slow for a zone attack, can help with easy accest to hyper armor * **Make Way** \(zone attack from a parry\) 600 ms, hyper armor and unblockable, 30 dmg \( maybe if it is too much, 25 dmg optional\) Make Way is bad, lacks range and is easily blockable by everyone, the worst case is when you parry consecutive people and use make way to punish them, if the first person you parry threw a heavy, he would recover IN TIME to block make way, to be a move speacially designed to punish ganks it doesn't do it's work, being unblockable will be a powerfull move a powerful tool against ganks while also being excellent in team fights \(remember this move is locked behind a parry\) * **Blind Justice**: top unblockable finisher, 1100 ms, 50 dmg, acts as a finisher, soft feint into a second chained side heavy \(30 dmg, 600ms\) and tracks back dodges such emblematic move is useless outside a light parry, with this changes you will force an opponnent to make a decision, you cannot back dodge it, and low recoveries or characters that can be safe from a GB during a dodge \(raider\) cannot shut down this move thanks to the soft feint. * \(optional\) Every top heavy can break hyper armor or super armor \(blind justice\) this a mechanic that i would like to see, big bois with big weapons should be able to stagger anyone with some specifics attacks, Highlander, raider, shugoki, are some other character that should have this mechanic, this would make them actual dangers to heroes that relay too much on hyper armor or revenge \(revenge highlander OF cannot be staggered while throwing unblockables that deals 60\+ dmg\) why so much hyper armor?, who needs low recovery dodges and i frames when you have POISE, on a serious side with this he cannot be light interrupted upon seeing red, this will be his answer for his awful recoveries giving him 1v1 and anti\-gank potencial. # Impale &gt;***Judgement time*** * reduced range to 80&amp;#37; from current state and every external hit \(to the oponent\) will end the charge a successful impale is a death sentence, nerfing it is necesary, this should be enough * 500 ms unblockable, 5 dmg, 10 dmg from a parry, only cost 60 \(from 74 i think\) stamina and acts as a chain initiator current impale is hard countered by blocking left, unblockable will make the impale an actual threat giving him OOS preassure, the 5 dmg and chain initiator is to make it 35 dmg on wallsplat, 10 dmg from a parry, 40 dmg on wallsplat, is not perfect but it's a nerf * parry the impale should still put the LB OOS and reward a light parry punish pretty self explanatory, with a great move comes a great punish why maintain the impale from a parry?, because is more useful as a disabler move, an example would be parrying a berserk while in revenge, impale into wall will waste his revenge, or putting away a highlander away from the team fight # Shove &gt; ***There is no such thing as a plea of innocence in my court. A plea of innocence is guilty of wasting my time.*** Shove is one of the core mechanic of the law, but is trash, it's reactable and countered by back dodging when you see red, this proposed changes are meant to transform this into something dangerous. * shove is a chain initiator allows easy access to his chains, the follow ups are 500 ms, 15 dmg light, or a 600 ms, 30 dmg heavy, right now if the oponent accepts to be hitted by the light and you do a heavy is a free parry also in ganks with a heavy as fast you can quickly change oponent and keep shoving to put away your enemies, while still being hard to parry \(a revenge LB has the danger potential of a puppy\) * shove is 600 ms from 700 ms \(could be 500 ms but i don't want to make him an harrasser\), earliest you can triggered from a dash is 300 ms should be a counter attacking/preassure \(in the middle of your chains\) tool, not one to harrass \(from neutral\), but on the other side dodge shove losses to most CC moves due to it's low speed * shove on block removed It's a braindead mechanic that can't be balanced, annoying, rewards blocking without risk, no debatable, also feed revenge with nothing in return * distance reduced from a succesfull shove \(i don't know the current distance\) Right now a heavy attack feint into GB will wiff putting the LB in danger, reducing the distance should fix this issue \(or just fix feint into GB to catch any dodge\) * shove can be used to cancel heavy attacks recoveries This should allow a shove even if the previous heavy is blocked, this will create preassure and potential damage to turtly opponents, preassure from blocking heavies should be more a common thing, like valk or nobu * GB is 100 ms earlier \(still 400 ms, just comes out 100 ms earlier\) A conq can just dodge and bash without needing to react, nullifing shove into light, heavy and GB, shutting down almost every mix\-up from the LB, with this you should be able to catch him forcing anyone into react properly * shove is only confirmed after a successfull top heavy or heavy finisher, blocked ones can be dodge similar to kick being confirmed from hidden stance * shove miss recovery 500 ms \(current one\) i think this is more than enough, i doesn't confirms anything so no reason to big recoveries # Long arm &gt; ***There is no such thing as innocence, only degrees of guilt.*** * new mechanic, his own special form of all block, made by holding back your guard This will be the all block version for the law, animation will be the first part of long arm, making him ready for embracing any kind of charge or attack \(something that pole\-weapons are know for\) * has super armor and reduce damage taken by 50&amp;#37; * the move is triggered by hit * doesn't actually block * 300 ms start up * 20 stamina upon activation and drain stamina just by maintaining it the first two it's beacuse is not a block but a trade, as a static fighter, it's vulnerable to GB, rewards reads, if triggered can be converted into a long arm by pressing GB or make way which both are confirmed, if pressed side heavy will make a side unblockable 45 dmg 800 ms heavy finisher, not guaranteed but this could be usefull in ganks * all block can be cancelled into zone attack \(not make way\) pretty much like conq, with the zone attack being 700 ms no one should have a problem with this * every heavy start\-up can be cancelled into all block everything upon this point is to make 3 things, first is to give him a tool to defend himself from bashes, his main weakness but only upon read, second is to have a counter to options selects, be it PK zone or Glad, this will punish those intent heavily, third and last is to punish attacks locked onto someone else, common Tech to make attacks unparriable, the only ones that can punish those kind of attacks are conq and musha, both with their all blocks, now the LB can punish with other means than parrying * pressing GB during all block will make the current long arm this is the offensive part of the moves, the transition beetween all guard and long arm is as soon you press GB from all block position * Long arm as a move is 700 ms from 1000 ms right now long arm is too slow to be effective, 1v1 wise, the only time that can connect is from a shove with a stunned oponnent, but even so if they wait they can easily dodge it, this change will put more preassure to a stunned opponent. * Long arm is vulnerable to GB in it's first 400\-500 ms this is just so you can't long arm upon reaction to GB * long arm is chain initiator and confirms a side heavy with a shove follow up is a chain initiator because the follow up heavy would be 30 dmg, instead of 40 dmg * reduce wiff recovery in order to be punishable for 600 or 700 ms recovery heroes it takes too much time, i have been GB from OOS heroes after a backdodge, you want to punish, side dodge # # New moves and mechanics: &gt;***Innocence proves nothing.*** * **Righteous fury:** after any side heavy if the follow up is a top heavy should be unblockable \(blind justice\) this move is one of notable of LB, but is terrible outside of a light parry, with this changes you will force an opponnent to make a decision, you cannot back dodge it, and low recoveries or characters that can be safe from a GB during a dodge \(raider\) cannot shut down this move note that shove cannot start Righteous fury, also this will provide an easy access to an unblockable like raider, kensei, highlander etc. * **Crime, Trial and Sentence: H=\&gt;H=\&gt;H**\(unblockable\), neutral heavy followed by a side one, 600 ms and 30 dmg \(a top one will start Righteous fury\) with the finisher being unblockable, side finisher is 45 dmg and 800 ms with a wide arc, while top finisher is blind justice he need this badly, in every combo after a heavy comes a light, easily parried, this would provide versatility to his mix ups and defending from ganks, why side heavy finiser 800 ms?, in both ganks and 1v1 is too slow to be effective, an easy parry * **lawful retribution: H=\&gt;H=\&gt;L** similar to the last one but with a final poke for 15 dmg * **And Justice For all: H=\&gt;L=\&gt;L**, after the initial heavy the poleaxe is pointing towards the enemy, it just makes sence that he would use it as a spear to stab the enemy both, perfect tools to complement the treath of a potential shove and to keep putting preassure * **judgement time: L=\&gt;L=\&gt;H**, more mix ups, more versatility * \(optional\) **officer warning** \(or a better name\): neutral heavy start up can be soft feinted into a light shaft strike, comes from the top, chain intiator ,10 dmg ,400 ms and causes stun LB potential danger goes up exponencially against a stunned opponnent, this would be a nice niche to constantly deliver the stun and open up turtles * **relentless prosecutor: foward dodge \+ Heavy**, 600 ms, 20 dmg, earliest can be triggered from a dodge is 200 ms, comes from the top this is to catch oponents tha would roll away from your shove and also being useful to close the gap beetween you and your enemy, to put it short, why i can't just charge with my poleaxe from neutral? \(side note, potential move\) *he could use a way to impale people from neutral, making fleeing oponents really think twice before run from a LB, especially useful since the new backdodge is unlock and run from the oponent, obviously not unblockable* ***Feats Changes*** * **Conqueror**: allow to capture flags quickly, \(Optional\) prolongs some self buff Feat duration \(in this case, juggernaut and righteous deflection\) * **Harsh Judgement**: lower objetive stamina, sprint speed and show them on the map while active no one escapes from the law, useful to prevent an enemy to escape * **juggernaut**: increased duration to 15 \(from 10\) seconds and gives Rock Steady right now juggernaut is too short, with a long cooldown, with this you will hold your ground for 15 seconds becoming a true wall that the enemy has to overcome or a unstopable force in the middle of a teamfight * **Fiat lux**: reduce range or increase it's time activation, increase cooldown, is too dificult to dodge and with low cooldown allows control B from afar or guaranteeds pugno mortis and igneus imber, it's too op and is the pilar of bombringer, also other bomb feats need a look but not nerf them into trash This is the Dream work of a rep 24 lawboi."

You can threaten a revive to bait an attack, effectively giving the reviver an advantage even though they've broken off from a fight to revive someone, and if a revive is successful you've added a full health player to the fight. What if revives couldn't be cancelled? You were locked in to the revive. You can no longer bait an attack because you can't defend yourself and in the midst of a gank or team fight you're risking extreme vulnerability for the reward of a full health teammate in the fight.

249,vulnerability,forhonor,Severe Adjustments And Rebalancing To Conqueror V.2,0,8qavyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/8qavyk/severe_adjustments_and_rebalancing_to_conqueror_v2/,2018-06-12 02:35:23,"After making the first version, I searched throughout the r/forhonor and r/CompetitiveForHonor subs, looking for rebalancing and improvement suggestions for the Conqueror. I found them, and realized something else. Assassins are leagues above more powerful than heavies due to having many effective tools, those of which outshine the heavy class, which have fewer, much less effective tools. So I propose this. Give the Conqueror's tools some major viability and effectiveness buffs to finally even out the playing field. What we know: Conqueror's moveset is a mixed bag. His Charge Stance is useless in 1v1s or 1vXs, his Shield Uppercut is underpowered for its stamina cost(which is 42), and his full block soft feints and flail uppercut are easy to deal with in high level play. \*Editor's Note: All of these changes are without feats in mind, and are to balance the moves to be more viable in either 1v1s, 4v4s, Xv1s(Ganks), and 1vXs(Anti\-ganks).\* # Shield Bash His Shield Bash \- specifically his neutral Shield Bash \- is too safe and spammable, while his chained bash and uppercut are underpowered. Time to fix that. \*\*Neutral Shield Bash\*\* * His guaranteed light after neutral Shield Bash is reduced to 11 from 13 * His tracking is on side dodges is reduced mildly * His tracking on back dodges is increased to have the possibility of catching back dodges. * He cannot follow a whiffed Neutral Shield Bash with a heavy or light * Neutral Shield Bash cannot take away the stamina of an OOS opponent, only pause the stamina regen(This feature needs to be widespread across all characters) \*Editor's Note: These changes are to make neutral Shield Bash a lot less spammable. It is still useful as an opener, but that's all it should be. And if Conq misses a Shield Bash from neutral, he cannot follow up with an attack. In this sense, it's a much more powerful version of Warlord's headbutt, but not made as spammable.\* \*\*Chained Shield Bash\*\* * If hit, grants Conqueror a side heavy * The guaranteed side heavy's damage is decreased to 23 damage * If the Conqueror does not want to perform a guaranteed heavy, he could still perform a guaranteed light. \*Editor's Note: Chained Shield Bash is slow and low\-rewarding(unless opponent is wallsplatted). This higher reward complements its slower speed. \* \*\*Shield Uppercut\*\* A high stamina\-costing move, with low rewards, that fails at its job at catching dodgers. * Range is increased, to catch back\-dodgers * If hit, grants Conqueror a side heavy * The guaranteed side heavy's damage is decreased to 23 damage * If the Conqueror does not want to perform a guaranteed heavy, he could still perform a guaranteed light. \*Editor's Note: The increased range works at fixing the move. It's supposed to catch dodgers, but can't catch back\-dodgers. The higher reward complements the slow speed and high stamina cost of the move.\* # Full Block Conqueror's full block is useful against new players, but is not as useful in high level play. So we only need to look at his soft feint timings and his options from blocking while in Full Block. \*\*Soft\-Feinting\*\* * FB soft feint window from mid\-attack is increased to last from 100ms as soon as the attack begins, and 200ms before the attack ends * FB soft feint window from blocked attacks is increased by about 300ms * FB soft feint window from whiffed attacks is increased greatly, by about 500\-600ms earlier than before \*Editor's Note: These changes are to make him more mix\-up potential in 1v1s, and to help him greatly in 1vXs, the one area he is at his worst.\* \*\*(Technically) New Move: Stand Clear\*\* * If hit while in Full Block, Conqueror can perform an unblockable zone attack * Stand Clear has high range, about 1.5\-2 meters * Stand Clear's knock back ability * Stand Clear is one hit, that can be be continued as a regular zone, or be continued into Conscript's Attrition * Like Flail Uppercut, it's unparryable, but deals low damage \*Editor's Note: This move is to give him the chance to create space for himself in 4v4s and 1vXs. It allows him to continue to fight when outnumbered.\* \*\*Flail Uppercut\*\* * The damage of the Flail Uppercut scales up if, while in Full Block, Conqueror is hit by multiple enemies * Minions cannot scale up the damage \*Editor's Note: This situation would be very unlikely, but should allow for a quick kill. The scaling would be so: 1 hit, 1.0 x damage; 2 hits, 1.5 x damage; 3 hits, 2.0 damage; 4 hits, 3.0 damage. This accentuates Conq's ""Hard Hitter"" aspect.\* \*\*Shield Riposte\*\* \*Editor's Note: Since the soft\-feint into guardbreak is viewed as pointless and awkward, the Shield Riposte returns. This is just another possible option for the Conqueror. While it may not have been known as useful pre\-rework, it may see more use as when it comes to selecting an option after a blocked hit.\* (I wouldn't know how to balance out some of the GB vulnerability of Shield Riposte or the regular zone attack, I'll leave that up to the devs) # Charge Stance Conqueror's charge stance is useless in 1v1s and 1vXs, as it take time to charge any unblockable, which anyone can see and know what the Conqueror will do. This only makes the charging stance useful as OOS punish, in Xv1s and 4v4s. Lets change that. \*\*Charge Stance Properties\*\* * Charging Stance can block lights without losing his charge, but blocking heavies makes it lose the charge * Guard switch delay decreased to 100ms from 200ms \*Editor's Note: These changes are to make it so that, while in Charge Stance, it's possible to block lights. The inability to block heavies will make it so that enemies throw out heavies more often, thus allowing Conq to use his Superior Heavies to counter\-attack.\* * While in Charging Stance, Conqueror can dodge while keeping his charge \*Editor's Note: This gives Conqueror a way to close the distance of his target. The problem before was that Conq was slow in this Stance, and the enemy could just dodge away to stay safe.\* * If Conq deflects any attack(light or heavy) he keeps his charge * When Conqueror is in Charging Stance, if he uses his pseudo\-deflect to deflect an attack, he can perform a dash heavy attack \*Editor's Note: The suggestion in the previous version was to give him the ability to unblockable dodge heavy from Charge Stance. But I thought that giving him that kind of power would be too much. So I restricted it to only being performed if Conq deflects an attack, which would incentivize him to deflect more often while in Charge Stance.\* \*\*Soft\-feinting From Charge Stance\*\* * Doing a Shield Uppercut from an Unblockable Charged Heavy gives the Uppercut the ability to wallsplat * A Shield Uppercut from a Charged Heavy can be performed 100ms later than from a normal heavy * Doing a Full Block Soft feint from an Unblockable Charged Heavy decreases the start time to 200ms from 300ms \*Editor's Note: The Stance is unique to Conq(somewhat), but it is so unrefined that it feels like an add\-on. Giving these moves special properties accentuates the power of this stance, and gives the stance enough viability to become a powerful way of fighting.(like how some people are more focused on feinting, or how some people focus on bashes.)\* # Stamina Conqueror is a heavy, and thus has a low stamina pool. But the stamina costs of some of his moves are either too high or too low. So this is to balance them out. * Conqueror's charging shield crush's stamina cost is reduced to 50 from 60 \*Editor's Note: This move confirms, at best, a Shield Bash into light(without feats). And if whiffed, can be punished accordingly. A lower stamina cost is meant to balance out the low damage reward.\* * Conqueror's Shield Uppercut's stamina cost is reduced to 35 from 42 * If performed from Charge Stance, Shield Uppercut's stamina cost would remain at 42 \*Editor's Note: The move has low reward, and is a slow move. This change, at best, allows the Conqueror to do 4 Shield Uppercuts in a row. So, this would not change much over all.\* * Conqueror's neutral Shield Bash's stamina cost is increased to 20 from 10 \*Editor's Note: The Shield Bash's extremely low stamina cost added to its spammability. So this change is intended to making it a opener.\* Conclusion: After these changes, Conqueror becomes more focused on his Charge Stance and his Soft\-feint capabilities, instead of his Neutral Shield Bash. His soft\-feint timings become godly, to complement his non\-existent hard\-feint potential(none). His Charge Stance becomes terrifying in its own sense, like Highlander's OS, but still has its fair share of weaknesses. With this, he's solidified as a heavy: a slow, but very deadly adversary. "

If you're in revenge with unlimited stamina and uninterruptability, you're practically invincible. So here are a couple proposed changes. * After a second, the Zone Attack loses its guard on top(the move looks like it can't in any way block in every direction while also attacking) * Once the Conq stops performing the zone, they can continue the recovery into Conscript's Attrition *Editor's note: This change is to grant it a weakness and not make the zone a must option for defence. This is also to incentivize Conquerors to use Stand Clear, which keeps its top guard for more than three hits. So the normal zone is still good for option select, but not made as safe, and given an alternate way to start a chain.* # Charge Stance Conqueror's charge stance is useless in 1v1s and 1vXs, as it take time to charge any unblockable, which anyone can see and know what the Conqueror will do.

The problem before was that Conq was slow in this Stance, and the enemy could just dodge away to stay safe.\* * If Conq deflects any attack(light or heavy) he keeps his charge * When Conqueror is in Charging Stance, if he uses his pseudo\-deflect to deflect an attack, he can perform a dash heavy attack \*Editor's Note: The suggestion in the previous version was to give him the ability to unblockable dodge heavy from Charge Stance. But I thought that giving him that kind of power would be too much. So I restricted it to only being performed if Conq deflects an attack, which would incentivize him to deflect more often while in Charge Stance.\* \*\*Soft\-feinting From Charge Stance\*\* * Doing a Shield Uppercut from an Unblockable Charged Heavy gives the Uppercut the ability to wallsplat * A Shield Uppercut from a Charged Heavy can be performed 100ms later than from a normal heavy * Doing a Full Block Soft feint from an Unblockable Charged Heavy decreases the start time to 200ms from 300ms \*Editor's Note: The Stance is unique to Conq(somewhat), but it is so unrefined that it feels like an add\-on. Giving these moves special properties accentuates the power of this stance, and gives the stance enough viability to become a powerful way of fighting.(like how some people are more focused on feinting, or how some people focus on bashes.)\* # Stamina Conqueror is a heavy, and thus has a low stamina pool. But the stamina costs of some of his moves are either too high or too low. So this is to balance them out. * Conqueror's charging shield crush's stamina cost is reduced to 50 from 60 \*Editor's Note: This move confirms, at best, a Shield Bash into light, which is 13 damage without feats. And if whiffed, can be punished severely. A lower stamina cost is meant to balance out the low damage reward.\* * Conqueror's Shield Uppercut's stamina cost is reduced to 30 from 42 * If performed from Charge Stance, Shield Uppercut's stamina cost would remain at 42 \*Editor's Note: The stamina decrease may seem like too much, but the added guaranteed heavy should add to the stamina cost, balancing the move.\* * Conqueror's neutral Shield Bash's stamina cost is increased to 20 from 10 \*Editor's Note: The Shield Bash's extremely low stamina cost added to its spammability. So this change is intended to making it a opener and make people think twice before using it.\* Conclusion: After these changes, Conqueror becomes more focused on his Charge Stance and his Soft\-feint capabilities, instead of his Neutral Shield Bash. His soft\-feint timings become godly, to complement his non\-existent hard\-feint potential(none). His Charge Stance becomes terrifying in its own sense, like Highlander's OS, but still has its fair share of weaknesses. With this, he's solidified as a heavy: a slow, but very deadly adversary."

It has been going on for multiple seasons and really hampers his fighting capability fixing this would go a long way to make him better * fix throws to stop taking additional stamina for no reason this is to fix the issue of lawbringer from being unable to do his max punishes due to the extra tick of stamina being taken away * Fix the poor hit-boxes/tracking of his attacks so they match his weapon length and the momentum he supposedly has this would go to help fix his team fighting ability allowing him to step into other opponents to either/ save his teammates from punishes. or to switch targets to further his chains * remove guard break vulnerability on his parry followups (light riposte is the worst example of this) simply to stop lawbringer from being punished for using his followups when being ganked * update his unlocked chains to match the updated move-set this is more of a minor issue since you normally don't use the unlocked chain however it should be fixed anyway to make it consistent ---------------------------- Move-set updates ---------------------------- * speed up dodge recovery to 600 ms this is a simple fix that would allow him to punish reckless bash moves and leave him less vulnerable for playing correctly * make his side lights 500 ms, and the book chapter verse finisher 400 ms as-well this would mean that his side lights wont be as easy to parry or block , as-well as upping the speed of his book chapter verse finisher would make it worth it to use as he has to go through his chain to get to it and would be a worthwhile option to use * speed up his side heavies to 700 ms and his top heavies to 800 ms Speed his side unblock-able to 800 ms and his top unblock-able to 900 ms goes without saying this would help him out with his offense as its damages would be more in line with a good speed to damage ratio ----------------------------- Longarm ----------------------------- * speed up longarm to 800 ms and reduce and allow it to count as the first part of his chains hit or wiff to keep flow going this will allow him to have an option to use it on wall-splat and get him into his unblock able much faster this also means he wont be as vulnerable on a whiffed longarm as he will have the option to keep his chain going thus not halting the flow of the fight * Make the animation/recovery(1800 for the animation and 800 ms for the recovery) to (900 ms animation and 700 ms recovery) lawbringer would still be able to land his side heavies however reducing the time an enemy is stuck in longarm would help counteract its faster speed. he should be able to land it more often * remove free longarm from guard break as stylish this is in my opinion it has to go as it lawbringer will have more ways to land it . this would also weaken his gank game abit ---------------------------------- Shove ---------------------------------- * Shove on block no can no longer chain as simple as this , he now only has a means to shut some chains down to keep pace, however this would also encourage lawbringer to try to parry followups more often and will frustrate opponents less he can still use it to drag fights on but he will not be rewarded for it as he can still take chip damage (it can add up even if its minimal) * forward shove is now 400 ms at 200-300 ms into his forward dash . as this move technically has no confirmed followup i thought it would be fair to speed it up on forward dash to catch people and give him some OOS game vs turtling opponents By making it so it can be activated at 200-300 ms into his forward dash would allow him to take advantage of his 400 ms dodge recovery to catch people who back dodge or side dodge too early much like how conq/warlord/warden can * shove is 500 ms at 300 ms into side dash this should be used as his means of counterattack and getting his shove mix-ups in vs reckless bash moves , speeding it up will also man people have to act as he is doing the shove not late as it is currently -------- Zone -------- * Raw Zone is 800 ms and now does 30 damage this zone is one of the slower zones currently and it only does 20 damage by speeding it up slightly and allowing it to do damage makes its risk a bit more worth its risk while not allowing lawbringer to spam it * zone and make way hit-boxes improved to better match the weapons animation currently his make way and his zone can clip through still opponents despite the weapon going through them ------------ Parry followups ------------ * Make way is now 700 ms it still has hyper-armor as well as do the 25 damage from parry however by speeding it up will let lawbringer to catch opponents to the side and prevent it from being as easy to block because of external parry mechanic *Make way now uses the stamina of a normal heavy as he has to parry to get make way it seems fit to reduce the stamina usage * Impaling riposte now does 10 damage instead of 20 the reason for nerfing this is to make it not as punishing for people to get parried by the law making the maximum heavy parry punish with a wall 40 instead of 50 while still a high punish its nowhere near as harsh for making a mistake vs him this also means his top heavy from light parry will see more use as it will become the go to light parry punish *Reduce the max range of impaling riposte by 25% (I don't know its current max range off number the top of my head but i know the feel of it) this is to once again tune down his parry power by making lawbringer be more aware of his positioning and to further encourage the use of his other followups * impaling riposte now uses 40% stamina (used to be 80% ) to counteract the damage change he now can use it to keep his momentum going if he gets a wallsplat instead of stoping after a top heavy ( and somtimes followup light) to recharge stamina this improving the flow of the fight ------ Chain updates ------ * make his side lights 500 ms, and the book chapter verse finisher 400 ms this would mean that his side lights wont be as easy to parry or block , aswell as upping the speed of his book chapter verse finisher would make it worth it to use as he has to go through his chain to get to it and would be a worthwhile option to use * speed up his side heavies to 700 ms and his top heavies to 800 ms Speed his side unblock-able 800 ms and his top unblock-able 900 ms goes without saying this would help him out with his offense as its damages would be more in line with a good speed to damage ratio * All block-able top heavy chains now do 35 damage his chain starters still do the same as they do now however this will reward lawbringer for landing the riskier and easier to parry top heavies * any shaft strike now counts as the first part of Swift justice/book chapter verse/judge jury executioner this is to give light riposte and his finishers more versatility as to keep pressure up say lawbringer lands swift justice finisher he can keep the pressure up after the shaft strike to reward him for landing the combo * swift justice finisher now can be used on side heavies once again to reward lawbringer for landing the final heavy in swift justice and to keep pressure on the opponent -------------------------------------------------- Add new chains as to increase his V E R S I T I L I T Y ---------------------------------------------------- ------------------- Law and Order L,L ------------------- TL 500ms (15), L 400(15) SL 500ms(15)*, L shaft strike (5)(shaft strike is a chain starter for either swift justice or judge jury executioner/book chaper verse) TL 500ms (15), L 500 (15) URL URL URL i made a rough concept of it earleir and it would not require much of a new animation but synching already existing animation by also having the top light treat the chain differently and giving it a more damaging yet not confirmed fast poke gives him options to keep the opponent from getting easy parries on him ------------------- Righteous fury H,H,H ------------------- SH700 ms (30) Th 800 ms (35) Unblock-able finisher side 800ms(45) unblock-able finisher top 900 ms (45) its an alternate way to get to his unblock-able finisher and to once again make his chains harder to predict/parry as well letting him pressure oos people abit more as they nolonger just need to simply block his first light to stop the chain this would require no new animations but would require some syncing of existing movements ------------------- Dead Or Alive HF (Cancel)&gt;L-Shaft strike) ------------------- allow lawbringer to cancel his heavy finishers into an undodgeable shaft strike for low damage but counts as a chain starter to keep pressure up and can be used as an alternitive means of a parry bait/dodge bait this can also be used to swap targets to help increase his teamfighting capability The shaft strike itself is 400 ms and does 10 damage and has a minor blind it will always come out on the opposite side of the side heavies and on the top heavies he can choose what side it comes from Dead or Alive starts right at 400 ms into his side unblock-able finisher and 500 ms into his top unblock-able finisher 300 ms into his block-able side finishers and 400 into his top block-able finishers super-armor this may require a new animation but it might not as you could blend the animation to the shaft strike ----------------------------------------------- NEW PASSIVE , Righteous Momentum ----------------------------------------------- Whenever lawbringer is using his finishers/ shove/longarm he gains super-armor and gains 25% damage reduction to help with trades this is to make it harder to knock The armored people in the game out of his moves as well as preventing reckless bash moves from stopping him from using the finishers in teamfights --------------------------- Feat Re balance --------------------------- * conqueror- Allow it to capture flags faster in tribute Currently this feat doesn't have a use in tribute despite it being use for quick captures , it would make more sense for this to work in the game mode * Harsh Judgement Allow lawbringer to use it when locked on to assassins when they have stealth active(currently does not bug perhaps?) /let it Drain 70% max stamina for its duration/stamina bar now shows whats left as well as an indicator showing you cant gain more stamina when this feat is active This is a feat unique to lawbringer but never really changed how the enemy played , by removing half the opponents stamina this would mean the target would need to be much more mindful about how they would attack the opponent. lawbringer could also use this feat on an opponent an ally is fighting to help him out or to force one to back off if they are being ganked Adding the indicator to your stamina bar would help people tell where their stamina would lie instead of guessing where its at. I'm unsure whether or not its a bug for lawbringer to be unable to use it on people in stealth at all * Righteous Deflect When activated law bringer gains hyper armor for the duration This move required you to parry your opponent in order to gain the damage reduction, however despite the damage reduction it was fairly easy to shut down him due to his lack of natural hyperarmor lawbringer often could get stunlocked out of his followups in situations where he was outnumbered with this change he would have another valid option to chose over the other tier two feats on top of letting him be a front line fighter more effectively * Juggernaut- Increase duration to 20 seconds Can now move at full speed \Guard break attempts now bounce off Juggernauts duration was pretty short and often times people could guardbreak you over and over in for allies to get free damage on you leaving the feat kinda useless for that time By causing people to bounce off it would give lawbringer some room to fight when outnumbered or perhaps work his battacks in people also would often run away because it slowed movement down where you could never catch up without canceling the feat by allowing the lawbringer to go at full speed with this feat he could keep up with opponents much better aswell as activating it before team fights and initiate into the fight * Regenerate Can now be used when sprinting (any form of attack and locking on will stop this effect) Regenerate was an underwhelming way to get health back especially in dominion where you could stand on a point to get said health back, by allowing it to activate while lawbringer is sprinting means he could me more mobile and heal up between fights to be ready for the next encounter * Pugno Mortis- Now does 50 Damage instead of 70 Reduce area of effect by 10% Pugno Mortis is a powerful tier 3 feat that explodes fast and could be thrown far with its only downside being its long cool down By lowering the damage it will punish players less for being unable to escape * Igneus Imber Reduce area of effect by 10% /Increase cooldown between bombs by 10 seconds once again reduce its damage to 50 lawbringers bombs where often a point of annoyance among many players as they can be spammed easly and are hard to avoid mid fight by increasing the cool down and reducing the area of effect it will be easier to escape and will mean the lawbringer must use his bombs more tactically while not reducing the power of the move too much * Catapult- Increase time to impact by 25% increase self damage and damage to teammates by 25% By increasing the time to impact this should allow players to better escape the ohko range of the catapult perhaps even dodge it all together, As well as making it do more damage to teammates it would mean people need to use it more tactfully as-well as communicate with teammates that you are going to use it in a fight"

253,vulnerability,forhonor,"Complete Shinobi rework, utilizing only his current animations. Focuses on cutting out all the ranged cheese and making his combat flow way more fun and diverse rather than annoying and scummy.",7,8j5hv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/8j5hv3/complete_shinobi_rework_utilizing_only_his/,2018-05-14 03:42:25,"Shinobi is one of the most mis-implemented characters in the game. I believe the way to implement a character with ranged weapons into this game is not to make ranged attacks, but instead to weave them into combos effectively making them melee attacks. In Shinobis current state, his ranged attacks are useless in 1v1, and utterly infuriating in 4v4. This rework aims to completely remove all his ranged cheesing, and instead incorporating kusarigama ranged attacks into his core kit and flow of the fight. **And before you read on please keep in mind that all these changes will work in tandem together, and be coupled with nerfed damage across the board so please read until the end before criticising the changes.** Let's get into it. **The huge problem with Shinobi.** Shinobi is supposed to be a very mobile character with a long meandering moveset, one move flowing into the other and leading into several potential moves giving him tons of options to keep the opponent on their toes, balanced out by a low healthpool and vulnerability. The problem is the fact that 90% of these pathways are utterly useless and nonviable in any situation reducing shinobi to a kick and light spamming hero as those are his only 2 options that ever land. This makes him annoying to fight against, and once your opponent knows how to deal with fast lights and a rather predictable kick, shinobi becomes useless in 1v1. Here are the changes i propose along with their justifications. **Damage nerfs to standard attacks and health** 1. Light does 12 dmg, guaranteed follow up light does 5 dmg for total of 17 dmg double light. Remove the weird slide in property they have giving him crazy range on the normal lights. 2. Heavy does 25 dmg, with the follow up 5 for a total of 30 dmg. 3. Health reduced to 100. Shinobi currently does too much damage. His damage needs to be nerfed to make up for the increased amount of options he will have. He shouldn't be brought back down to 90 health, as that's simply too little for this game, but he still needs to be squishier than the rest. **Ranged attacks from neutral** 1. Remove charged ranged heavy from neutral. Removes his ability to throw ranged atracks from neutral which is the most annoying thing about him in ganks. This is going to be coupled with the next couple changes. 2. Charged ranged heavy is now only accessible out of a backflip. 3. Backflip is no longer available on whiffed attacks, only on hit or blocked attacks. Also meant to remove his ability to initiate from range as he can no longer play with himself at a distance then throw a ranged attack. Also removes his ability to backflip after kick whiff. All of these changes in tandem remove his ability to initiate with ranged attacks, but also carry big consequences which i will adress after. **Double dash** 1. Double dash recovery can be cancelled with a dash. The changes to his ranged charge remove his ability to quad dash which i believe is a very important part of shinobis kit as mobility is one of the main selling points. This will allow him to double dash consecutively until he runs out of stamina. **Ranged heavy and gb** These moves are almost never used by any shinobi because they have an insane amount of risk and are super easy to counter. I dont remember the last time i threw a ranged heavy that wasn't guaranteed off a kick that didnt get parried (in duels). So here we go: 1. Ranged heavy is now a ranged light, deals 13dmg and is 400ms. The reason its 400ms is bc its now a chain light. Most assassins have 400ms chain lights at this point, and this is actually a more predictable light bc its only accessible out of backflip. It's also his main mixup initiator, so it's important that it hits often and does low damage. It's also proportional with the heavy punish it gives on parry. No more guaranteed gb on block for obvious reasons. 2. Ranged gb no longer gives sickle rain, only guarantees a single light that applies bleed (the parry follow up light). 3. Counter guard breaking a ranged gb now acts like a normal cgb. Since ranged gb is only accessible in a combo and not at long initiation range, and only gives a light, theres no reason for a punishment like a knockdown. For animation, the normal cgb animation can be used for the opponent, and the normal animation where the sickle returns to his hand for shinobi. These changes are meant to increase the value of ranged attacks by giving them way less risk and way less reward, now serving as chain connectors. Since they can only be accessed in a chain shinobi can no longer sit back in a gank and pull people from off screen using ranged gb. **Kick** It needs to be sped up a bit. It shouldn't be as fast as it was at launch of the character but it should be faster than now, because it's just really easy to dodge on reaction. (If you don't believe me just hop into training and practice dodging as soon as the unblockable indicator comes up, you'll get it in a few tries. Just dont dodge too early cuz shinobi may not actually kick and gb your dash recovery instead). I dont have frame data on it but it should be just a bit faster. **Kick recovery will not be punishable by gb**. The kick guarantees 13 dmg and you cant backflip on whiff. No bash move in the game that guarantees only a light is punishable by gb except for cent's kick (which also needs to be changed). **Front roll and follow ups** Here it is. What's supposed to be Shinobis bread and butter is actually his most useless move. Why? Because everything that comes out of it can be countered by standing still and blocking. Here are all his options: normal light-&gt;block. Sickle rain heavy -&gt; block. Backflip kick -&gt; unless your back is to a ledge, it doesnt matter if you get hit by it. It doesn't guarantee anything. It doesn't wallsplat. It may put you OOS, but shinobi has 0 OOS pressure. Not even an OOS punish. Below I'll be proposing changes to fix this area of his kit too. **Backflip kick** 1. Backflip kick guarantees a ranged light With the changes to ranged light speed this would probably become the case anyways, but this is important because now there's actually a reason to dodge the backflip kick. **Sickle rain** Now that ranged gb doesnt give sickle rain, Shinobi needs a new way to land the move. Here's my idea: 1. Sickle rain is now unblockable. Heavy damage is 25, and each hit applies 3 for a total of 34 dmg. Can be soft feinted into backflip kick or hard feinted. Still his most damaging move, but not nearly as much. Gives him a really strong mixup out of the front roll with lots of options. Also gives him a mixup after the first heavy incentivizing him to stay in front of the opponent instead of backflipping away. **Zone attack** Make the last hit feintable dammit. It guarantees a parry even if the zone connects successfully. Its amazing that this is still a thing. And that's about it. Hopefully you guys like this rework, as i think it completely changes the character to be more fair, more fun, more interesting, and infinitely less cheesy. And if the devs decide to implement any of these changes it'll be of no extra animation cost to them ;) **TL;DR**: damage nerfs to everything. Small health nerf. Removed ranged attacks from neutral, inserting them into chains only and made to be much faster and hit weaker. Removed backflip on whiffed attacks including kick. Exponentially increased mixup potential. "
254,vulnerability,forhonor,Ganking Techniques and Explanations with Video,14,868elp,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/868elp/ganking_techniques_and_explanations_with_video/,2018-03-22 14:02:18,"Hello All, &amp;nbsp; Thanks to u/themmeatsweats, Past mistakes and Predator for helping me out with this. Also thanks to u/FreezeTT for inspiring me with his video on ganks. Thought that it may be helpful to some of you to have a visual representation of how to efficiently and intelligently kill an opponent when you have the numbers advantage. There are certain techniques and combos that you can do to maximize your damage proportional to the amount of revenge you give your opponent. You keep them locked down long enough to kill them without giving them the chance to defend or pop revenge. &amp;nbsp; Some of these techniques require team coordination to pull off but others are very simple. The most important techniques featured are: **Counter Guard Break Vulnerability** &amp;nbsp; During the counter guard break animation, your opponent is completely vulnerable. Besides a bit of damage mitigation, they are unable to block your attacks or dodge any sort of CC moves. This means you can confirm moves like impale, long arm, shaman pounce, etc all off a simple counter guard break. So in effect, you can punish your opponent even when they properly defend! Getting as much damage out of every GB attempt as you can is important due to the large amount of revenge gain your opponent gets for countering GB's. You will see some examples in the video. &amp;nbsp; **CC/Hit Stun Recovery** &amp;nbsp; Moves like shaman pounce, raider stampede charge and impale are what are called CC moves, or crowd control moves. They pin down the opponent leaving them unable to act or defend. These moves give huge opportunities for burst damage when used intelligently, often you can one shot an opponent from full health with proper coordination. An important thing to note with many of these moves is that you have to time your attacks carefully so you dont interrupt them. This doesnt apply in the case of moves like impale or stampede charge, but it does with moves like longarm or shaman pounce. Making the most of these damage opportunities allows you to quickly and efficiently dispatch your opponent. &amp;nbsp; **Heavy Hit/Block Stun** &amp;nbsp; This one is probably the easiest to perform and has a variety of uses. Essentially, when an opponent is hit by or blocks a heavy attack, they are held in place for a period of time, unable to dodge. This is important with moves like shaman pounce, stampede charge or demon embrace that require the opponent to be standing still to hit. If your enemy is bleeding and your shaman is nearby, throw a heavy attack. If the shaman is smart, they will recognize the opportunity and pounce. No matter if the opponent blocks, parrys or is hit by the heavy, the pounce is confirmed. Even when they parry they are held in place long enough to confirm it. They can dodge the heavy, but that requires precise timing to dodge both the heavy and the pounce and also leaves them open to GBs. Essentially its an easy and safe way to confirm certain CC moves. &amp;nbsp; Those are just a few examples of the different ways in which you can help your teammates confirm their CC moves. Even when you dont have direct communication with teammates, good players can recognize when you are trying to set them up for these moves and after a couple attempts you should be able to have it down even without being on comms. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask and you can see all these techniques put to use with example combos in the video below: &amp;nbsp; URL URL URL URL URL URL URL URL"

Great trades with uninterruptable stance|Has no way to force a reaction from an opponent, gets completely shut down by turtling. Good gb punish (demon ball or wall hug)|Parry changes removed his ability to land GB consistently. Hug is terrifying when it lands (dmg+heal gives you an 80 hp difference, can one shot) + a death sentence if you have a teammate (hug Is not interrupted by friendly fire)|Terribly slow and telegraphed, basically only usable after a wall throw, on miss deals 60 damage to self + opens up for a free GB (with PUS down and taking 25% increased damage). This means that on average you would lose around 90 hp or more. Good minion clear with sprint attack|Does not really do anything to players. The attack is too slow to be threatening and even if it lands deal only 20 dmg. Nice range on zone attack|Again too slow, only 20 dmg and after the parry nerfs this attack being long range (you would whiff your gb after parrying it) is mostly irrelevant. Good damage on heavies (charged heavies are devastating when they land) + the ability to delay the timing (1100ms  1600ms)|1100ms heavies are free parries. Even with different timing the attack is too slow to be a threat from neutral. Only useful when trading. If charge fully, a parry will drain Shugokis stamina completely. Vulnerable to GB after fully charging the heavy (can be circumvented by moving backwards or switching guard 2 times, however I cant see why we should have to jump through these hoops at. Headbutt drains stamina nicely and resets the fight|Cannot be used form neutral, need to land a hit to use, DOES NOT ledge even if standing on the edge of a cliff, only usable on first hit in a combo. Lights arent interrupted by blocking|Lights are pretty slow at 600 ms from every direction. Now there are other general weaknesses Shugoki has like slow dodge recovery, slow roll, slow recovery on missed attacks, a useless demons embrace soft feint, a useless charge of the oni, slow sprint speed etc. but I wanted to make a point. For every strength Shugoki has, he has an even stronger drawback + a few cherries on top. He has no move that he can use that cannot result in him taking more damage than he would land. All of this makes him a massive TORTOISE BOY and the most boring kind of tortoise. He is boring to play as and he is even more boring to play against. Now that we have an idea on what his weaknesses are, we can try to think how to fix them. We should however keep in mind his archetype and design, so we cannot just make all his attacks 500 ms and call it a day. THE FINAL SOLUTION TO THE FATSO QUESTION Let us get to it then. 1) PUS needs work. For starters taking 25% more dmg when its down does nothing but add on to the pile of problems. Then its negated completely by double attacks (pk, shaman, shinobi etc.). One way to fix this is to make PUS extra duration i.e. instead of popping it instantly it lingers for 400-500 ms. This way you can actually use it to trade with these attacks. 2) Charge of the oni needs a rework. In its current form its utterly useless, before the nerf it was utterly overpowered. To me that sounds like a major design mistake and the move just needs to go. If it was up to me I would make it similar to raiders charge. But instead of carrying the enemy forward when it connects, Shugoki would grab the enemy, stop, and slam the enemy into the ground dealing around 15 dmg and some good stamina damage + stun (basically [this](URL ). This move would be usable from neutral as well from sprinting and drain around the same stamina as the old charge. It would also pause the stamina regen for both the enemy and Shugoki so you wouldnt be able to spam it all day. It needs to be pretty fast and have good tracking (think highlanders caber toss). From neutral the input would be forward dash + gb. The move can also be soft feinted from a heavy (when chargin heavy press gb). If the enemy dodges in time Shugoki should keep charging forward so he loses a bit more stamina but doesnt let the enemy get a free gb (For Honor now with 50% more bull fighting). 3) Demons embrace needs a buff and nerf at the same time. For starters, the one hit kill needs to go. It has no place in this game. Then the damage on missing is ridiculous. To compensate for that, the damage needs to be nerfed to 25/30 damage and 20 heal. Because the moves is not as devastating, it should be significantly quicker down to 700ms + it should be feintable into a gb 400ms in and have better tracking. If you miss, you still give the enemy a gb. Same as charge of the oni, can be soft feinted from heavy charge (back+gb when charging). Can be interrupted by getting hit by allies and enemies alike + if you are interrupted before the heal is applied, you lose it. 4) Headbutt can be used from combo hits and can ledge. I do not see why this is the only bash that does not ledge no matter how close you are to the ledge. 5) Heavies can remain to be slow but it should be offset by the ability to soft feint into charge of the oni and hug. Can be made quicker down to 800-1300 ms. Also his startup vulnerability to gb needs to be toned down a bit. 6) Heavies in a combo can be charged and can be soft feinted into all the grabs. 7) When the enemy is OOS, Shugo should get enhanced moves. Head butt on top of pushing the enemy back, knocks them down, which can be followed up by the first part of Shugos zone attack (that where the range comes in handy). Charge of the oni becomes more brutal  Shugoki grabs the enemy and slams them over his head dealing 25 damage and stunning. Demons embrace on an OOS enemy increases the heal received up to 40, health damage is the same. 8) Buff the dodge recovery and increase roll speed so shugo gets on par with other heroes. 9) Decrease the recovery time on charged heavies. If I hit an OOS guy on the ground I should not worry about getting gbed. Decrease the stamina cost for charged heavies significantly. Remove the extra little stamina cost on recovering after using headbutt (the weirdest thing in this game I have no idea why is it ther). 10) Increase gb range a bit. Not a necessity but just something I personally would like. Aaaand I am done. Feel free to give your feedback and tell me how I am wrong and should never touch For Honor ever again.

256,vulnerability,forhonor,"Gladiator is not ""the golden standard""",2,89cgul,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/89cgul/gladiator_is_not_the_golden_standard/,2018-04-03 20:54:25,"Again, something all the tryhards already know but i feel is important to discuss outside the competitive sub. This common misconception has been floating aroumd the sub since season 3: many people like to say that gladiator is the best balanced character out of the whole cast. As the months have rolled, and we have learned how he plays, i can confidently say this is not the case in any universe. Gladiator suffers from a few huge problems: 1. he has little confirmed damage 2. His mixups, while definately hard to react to, give very little damage. 3. Gets punished greatly for relatively low damage attacks. So in short gladiator has a amount of good mixups,but they have horrible risk/reward -ratio. I used to actually hate glad, but tried him myself, i saw how i continuosly had to outplay my opponent to get wins against good players. But glad is s-tier still? Yes, because of his zone attack. Zone is not that fast nor is it that damaging. However it has 0 gb vulnerability and the startup animation is VERY subtle ( basically he just lowers his hands like his guard would expire) and it is 100% unpunishable if feinted by anyone without a dodge attack. You can even feint it after you have seen your opponent dodge it so no need to commit to it. You can give gladiators zone to any character in the game and they immediately become s-tier. Is this how you think a character should be balanced around? I personally would much more prefer the shaman balance where all moves serve a purpose and true threat but everything is punishable when properly read. And apparently my preference is the games direction because of the reworks. All the reworked characters are roughly same power level which to me indicates this is what they have in mind for the future standards. Whew. Another long fucking post. Can't wait to get my pc today from the repair and play a bit :). "

Can Ubisoft plz revert this back to the way it was? It was a really good tactic to punish parry attempts without the the vulnerability of trying to parry. 
259,vulnerability,forhonor,My little grain of salt to the work mah boi Orochi needs desperately to be viable and fun without losing his core identity,17,80ift6,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/80ift6/my_little_grain_of_salt_to_the_work_mah_boi/,2018-02-27 12:28:23,"Orochi main since Season 1. Eventually moved out to nobushi and pk for viability and ended up with glad. But i dont want to see my boi roach end up dusting in damiens basement. Here is my contribution! #The Goal The main goal of Orochis rework is to make him viable and fun without losing his core identity. In my humble opinion Orochi is the character that has it the hardest in the roster. Not only he is extremely unviable, but his identity as a counter attacker in a world of turtles makes him struggle. We need to help him force a reaction of the opponent so he can get to use his counter attacker moves. #New Animations gIvE oRoChI ToZEnS kiCk Jokes aside: 1. **Slip strike** Heavy soft feint. Inputted by pressing dodge during the first 500 ms of a heavy. Made for when someone baits an attack, you can press heavy for parry or soft feint into a special dodge where orochi crutches and dodges into a 10 dmg and stun elbow strike. Kinda similar to left throw. Has i frames so it dodges heavy feint into another attack. Inmune to gb during whole attack but punishable with gb on dodge. 2. **Riptide strike** Changes to riptide. Now it acts as a special parry and now needs to be inputted right before an attack connects. When orochi pulls his sword up, he actually gets to parry the attack and the attacker bounces backwards because of the force of the roach. This stuns them. (Not the effect, just they cant input any action) If the riptide didnt connect, orochi does the same riptide as always. Exactly If it did, during the stun, orochi has 4 options: ~unblockable, inputted by pressing R2, 30 dmg and guaranteed on light riposte ~unblockable stun backwards or forward throw, pretty good throw distance ~Unblockable, inputted by pressing R1, 25 dmg guaranteed always ~Feint The animation? Both light and heavy riposte have the same cool ass animation. Orochi does a top hilt unblockable attack, only parriable on heavy followup on heavy parry. 10 dmg the hilt stun and 15 or 20 depending on the followup. In the followup he grabs your hand, gets behind you with your arm stretched, and he kicks you in the elbow. 2 second animation. Sorry if i didnt express myself right, think about conqs dislocator, but the foot on the elbow 3. **Parry punish** Input gb right after a parry to do the new parry punish. Knee to the crutch and then a sick ass kick to the side of the head that stuns ofc and throws you in the ground. Allows for top lights 4. **Tobi Kadachi or idk some badass japanese name** Inputted by dodging forward and pressing gb. Roach dashes forward and does a knee to the guts. Whats special about it? You can redirect the knee to either delay it forward or do it to either left or right. This way Roach can predict the direction the opponent is going to dodge, and redirect the knee to catch them. Delaying it to forward catches rolls and backdashes, no exceptions. After the kick (that does 10 stamina dmg) orochi can flow into a omnidirectional 25 dmg unblockable inputted by pressing R2. This is feintable and soft feintable into slip strike If you dodge right, Orochi wouldnt be able to catch you on reaction, only on prediction. It does not grant a gb on dodge, but it leaves you enough vulnerability for every single character be able to punish it with at least a light. The animation would be a kick to the stomach and while grabbing the sword backwards a cool ass strike. 5. **Storm Rush** Now storm rush gets also a top attack. Animation would be orochi doing a mini jump (with one feet on the ground) and grabbing the sword backwards he would do a top strike. 6. **Onislayer** Inputted by walking backwards and pressing gb. 600ms total. Orochi does an unblockable bash similar to caber toss. He grabs your hand and does a martial technique where he kicks your knee and counts as chain starter. #Minor Tweaks 1. Storm rush now is a bit faster. 100 ms maybe. 2. Storm rush now has a top attack. Every side storm rush guarantees top lights and every top storm rush guarantees side lights 3. Storm rush is now soft feintable till the last 200 ms. Thats to prevent parrying 4. Storm rush now 20 dmg 5. Top lights now 20 dmg 6. All lights now are 500 ms. Chained or not. 7. Storm rush now has superior block on the side roach is attacking 8. 2nd chained heavy is now 600 ms and unblockable. 25 dmg and soft feintable into slip strike 9. Now wind gust tracks rolls. Well, thats it. Probably unbalanced and very difficult animation-wise but i wanted to it anyway. Feedback is appreciated, and i hope we get news about Orochi soon. Thanks for reading. "
260,vulnerability,forhonor,How to Counter Shamans Unblockable Mixup,50,83q90f,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/83q90f/how_to_counter_shamans_unblockable_mixup/,2018-03-12 09:38:57,"Hello All, Shamans unblockable mixup is something I see many players struggling with and asking for tips about. After speaking with Bodrat, he informed me of a simple counter that works for MOST heroes. Basically, any time you BLOCK any shaman heavy (that includes neutral heavies, or any wildcats rage variant) you can simply back dash as soon as you see the unblockable startup. You will be put out of range for all her follow ups including the gb soft feint. The block stun is short enough that you can escape. If you get hit by a heavy though this will not work. Some clarifying information though. After some testing there are heroes that this does not work on. This works for all assassins first of all. The only heroes this appears to not work on are kensei, shugoki, aramusha and LB. other people will be looking into this so perhaps theyll discover why it wasnt working for me on those characters. Even highlander can do this. Below is a video along with explanation. Also, if your hero has a zone with 100ms or less gb vulnerability you can simply zone parry to protect yourself as well. If they follow through with the attack you will parry it, if they soft feint you will knock them out of it. Use this on a hero such as aramusha that cannot escape by back dashing. Just be sure to watch your stam. This not only allows you to avoid damage, but most heroes can even punish her in whiffs recovery. Using this renders shamans whole mixup basically useless in 1v1. In 4v4 where you may be getting hit by multiple attacks this is much less useful. In those instances its usually best to just roll if possible. One other thing of note, depending on your back dash recovery, the shaman may be able to catch you if she predicts you will do this and soft feints with a forward dash into wildcats rage in a direction you werent guarding. But it would have to be on read and even that may not work. Video: URL If anyone has any questions, clarifications or other comments please leave them below. Thanks!"
261,vulnerability,forhonor,My take on PK rework,22,843j3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/843j3i/my_take_on_pk_rework/,2018-03-13 22:50:35,"Recently, I saw multiple posts about problems with PK and started to think about what to do about these. She definitely needs a rework, as there is very little that can be done to balance her without gutting her completely. So my ideas are: Lights: Leave speed unchanged, but reduce damage to 15 and 11(12). Heavies: Reduce damage to 25, dagger confirm to 10 and make them 700ms (while lowering guard break vulnerability duration, to prevent heavy from GB). Also make the confirm tick faster, either 4 instead of 3 or 2 but every second. Dodge attacks: Forward dodge attack to 15 (I'm not sure if it does 15 or 20 right now) and leaving side dodges at 15, but adding ability to continue to the second heavy in her chain, while keeping the ability to dagger confirm (for 10 dmg, same as normal heavies) Deflect: Keeping her light stab with it's damage, but adding new move similar to valk sweep, with GB input (she could go to the side of an enemy and either kick backs of their knees, or force them to ground otherwise). That itself would do no damage, but would allow her to do a confirmed heavy. It would be slower than stab, so unsafe in gank situations, where the occassional stab would still be a better option. Soft feints: Keep her dagger cancel from every heavy (dagger cancel still does 15 damage, unlike dagger confirm), but make it work similarly to shamans (around 400-500ms, so it is still blockable inside a chain). Also keep her GB soft feint on first heavy from neutral. Add ability to soft feint into dodge to all her heavies, in chain or not. Lastly, add a melee move as a soft feint where she swaps position with the enemy, allowing her to do a confirmed second light, leading into rest of her LLH chain. It would be 500-600ms unblockable grab, which tracks through dodge (like HL grab, where you get grabbed if you try to dodge the kick, not that it is undodgeable). That would prevent being able to dodge the heavy soon and being free of consequences. New move from neutral: Backdodge heavy, unfeintable, unblockable, 800ms attack similar to orochis backstep top heavy. It would always come from top, do 30 damage and should be used to punish bashes and similar melee attacks, or slower normal attacks. It would be activated shortly into backdodge, to keep its usefulness as a dodge tool. It would look like a normal dodge during which PK would stop, and twirl forward to the side of opponents attack, effectively bypassing it and landing a blow from top with her sword. It can't be followed by dagger confirm, or a chained heavy. It can be dodged, leaving her open to GB even by classes with worst dodge recoveries. Zone attack: Keep its speed, but reduce the damage of first hit to 12, while buffing damage of second hit to 25. That's it for my ideas. Please leave an input about what you think may be a good idea, bad idea, or your own take on this thing. Also, I probably unnecessarily used different tenses and such while writing, because I wrote it on a phone with little space to read through the text over and over, so please overlook that. Edit: Apparently, any formating I tried goes through the window once posted with phone, so the text is probably unorganised."
262,vulnerability,forhonor,A perfect solution for people running away in Elim/4v4 in general (IMO),10,847fvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/847fvz/a_perfect_solution_for_people_running_away_in/,2018-03-14 07:37:29,"What if the less health you had, the slower you run? Imagine all those times you beat that assassin down to his last bar of health, only for him to turn tail and run for buffs with no chance of catching up, only to have him come back 30 seconds later with max health, shield and damage buffs, and his whole team behind him. This change would reward good players by allowing them to catch up to someone they already nearly killed to finish the job, rather than being punished for simply playing a slower sprinting character. Not just that but it makes sense. When below a certain health percentage, characters should limp like they do while out of stamina, visibly showing that they're exhausted. It would add a sense of immersion to see your teammate, who may have just survived a dangerous encounter, struggle past you to get to a health buff. It would also mark players on low health for others to see. When's the last time you were low on health and went to heal from a buff, just to see that your teammate grabbed the health first to heal his one bar of damage since he had no clue you were near dead? On top of that, enemy players could tell who's weak, adding a whole nother layer of vulnerability to low health Please tell me what you think, there may be one huge downside to a system like this that I'm not seeing, but personally I would love to see it incorporated."
263,vulnerability,forhonor,Abridged Warrior's Den (Feb 1st) Patch Notes,164,7umnax,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/7umnax/abridged_warriors_den_feb_1st_patch_notes/,2018-02-02 09:31:16,"Hello! I said on stream I wanted to post the Patch Notes from the items we discussed on the show today. Here that is! Reminder that FULL NOTES will come next week on the 8th! ***PARRY*** **General** - You can now Counter Guard Break if grabbed during a Parry Reaction. - Parrying now moves you 1m forward (was 0m). **Parried a Heavy Attack** - Heavy Parry Reaction is now 1500ms (was 1400ms), and now allows Stance Change during the last 100ms. - If you Parry a Heavy, now you get 600ms frame advantage in which your opponent cannot block, parry or dodge. *Developer Comments: This means any hero can land a guaranteed Light Attack. Some heroes can also land certain other special moves.* **Parried a Light Attack** - Light Parry Reaction is still 1800ms but now allows Stance Change during the last 100ms. - If you Parry a Light, now you get 900ms frame advantage in which your opponent cannot block/parry/dodge. *Developer Comments: This means most heroes can land a guaranteed Heavy Attack. Some heroes can also land certain other special moves.* - Added a Visual and Audio Effects to parrying a Light Attack, to indicate that your opponent will be vulnerable for a longer period than if you parried a heavy. *Developer Comments: When Parry used to guarantee a Guard Break, it meant that the attacker had a negative expectation of the result: the amount of damage your original attack could inflict was usually less than the amount you risk to a parry, including scenarios such as:* - *Thrown off a ledge (instant death)* - *Wall-Stagger punish* - *Out-Of-Stamina-Unbalance punish* *Now, if you are parried you can Counter Guard Break. The opponent will still be given a window to strike you, so youll still take damage, but the amount is much more reasonable compared to what the original attack that was parried would have done.* *We also think this will improve the pace of the Parry  before the Parry was usually followed by the Guard Break, which seemed to slow the pace of combat. Now, the Parry will be followed by an actual weapon-based attack and combat should feel a little more dynamic.* **Character-Specific changes based on the New Parry Vulnerability Timings:** **Berserker** - Removed early connections from Parry to Light Attack and Heavy attack. *Developer Comments: We left Berserkers dedicated Parry follow-up Skilled Slash as it was. We removed the specific early connections to attack because Berserker always got a Top Heavy, and now Berserker only gets a Top Heavy after Parrying a Light. This is more in line with the rest of the casts options.* **Highlander** - Fast-flow to Offensive Form from Parry now starts at 700ms into the Parry (was 600ms). *Developer Comments: This change is so that if the Highlander Parries a Heavy, it does NOT guarantee a Fomorian Kick. Instead, Highlanders should use their Light Attacks against Heavies. If the Highlander Parries a Light, Balors Might will be guaranteed.* **Lawbringer** - Counterattack Heavy now starts at 500ms into the Parry (was 400ms). - Counterattack Zone Attack now starts at 500ms into the Parry (was 400ms). *Developer Comments: Although theres a change here, Lawbringer has exactly the same parry rewards as on before. These timing changes are just a consequence of the general Parry changes made above.* **Orochi** - Reduced Top Light to 15 damage (from 17). - Reduced Top Light 2nd Combo Strike to 7 damage (from 15). - Increased Wind Gust to 35 damage (from 25). - Increased Riptide Strike to 40 damage (from 30). *Developer Comments: The Orochis Top Light into Top Light Combo damage output is reduced to 22 (from 32), so that it is in line with the rest of the rosters punishes when parrying a Heavy. Orochi is compensated with better damage on the special counter-attack moves.* **Shinobi** - Reduced backward movement during Parry Reaction to match other heroes. *Developer Comments: This is so heroes with low range attacks can still connect, such as Warlords Top Light.* **Shugoki** - Reduced forward movement during parrying to 1m (from 2m), to match other heroes. - Shugoki used to be able to act 700ms into the 800ms Parry. Now, Shugoki can launch Light, Heavy or Zone Attacks at 600ms, but must wait until 800ms to perform other moves like Dodge, Guard Break or Demon Embrace. *Developers comments: This means Shugoki can punish a Heavy Parry with a Light into Headbutt, and punish a Light Parry with a Heavy Attack as before. Shugoki no longer needs to switch stance to make this happen (he did before).* ***HIGHLANDER UPDATE*** **Celtic Curse** - The Top Strike can now be Cancelled into Fast Flow to Top Offensive Form, by holding the Heavy Input Button - shows the pink flash of entry in Offensive Form. - Slightly increased rotation of Top Strike to better track sprinting opponents. - Improved ability to acquire targets that are sprinting at the Highlander. - Celtic Curse can now switch targets when cancelling to the side attacks. *Developer Comments: Celtic Curse needs to be strong so that Highlander can initiate combat, and here the cancel into Offensive Form will make the real attacks much harder to identify, while protecting the Highlander from the Full Block Stance of Conqueror or Warlord.* **Stamina** - Removed the stamina cooldown for entering Offensive Form. - Can now regen stamina while dodging in Offensive Form. - Reduced stamina cost of Balor's Might to 24 (from 30). *Developer Comments: The Highlander has been heavily limited by his stamina consumption and regen. Often, the Highlanders would do a lot of work to only get one hit in, then have to back off. Now, the Highlanders should be more able to sustain their offensive. Note that while Offensive Form's Enhanced Lights still cost 3 stamina when cancelled from Balor's Might, when accessed directly they are reduced from 33 to 27.* **Damage** - Increased damage on Offensive Form Balor's Might to 40 (from 30). - Increased damage on Defensive Form Side Heavy Openers to 35 (from 25). - Increased damage on Defensive Form Side Heavy Finishers to 35 (from 30). - Increased damage on Defensive Form Top Heavy Opener to 45 (from 40). - Increased damage on Defensive Form Top Heavy Finisher to 45 (from 40). *Developer Comments: Part of the Highlander's fantasy is to hit hard and now he finally can.* **Defensive Form's 2nd Lights** - Uninterruptible Stance is now applied to Defensive Form's 2nd Lights, starting at 100ms. - Interrupt Blocked reaction is reduced to 800ms (was 1100ms). *Developer Comments: This move no longer gives up a free Guard Break when blocked. Furthermore, the Uninterruptible Stance allows it to be used occasionally in-group fights.* **Caber Toss** - Improved rotational tracking. - Improved ability to move forward during the strike. *Developer Comments: Caber Toss is now better able at catching players who are attempting to dodge. The intention is to improve the Fomorian Kick and Caber Toss mix-up, especially against back-dodges (and diagonally backward dodges).* **Offensive Form Dodge** - Increased movement on Offensive Form's Forward Dodge by 0.25m. *Developer Comments: Small movement increase to help Highlander catch up to more opponents while holding the Offensive Form.* **Fomorian Kick** - [Bug fix] Removed a loop of Kick into Forward Dodge, repeat, by removing the 100ms early connection from kick-to-dodge. - [Bug fix] Reduced the knockback distance slightly on Formorian Kick, in order to reduce the situations in which you land the kick, but then whiff the Unblockable Heavy afterward. **Throw** - [Bug fix] Fixed an issue where Stance Change prevented Highlander from Fast Flowing into Offensive Form. **Execution** - [Bug fix] The No Mercy execution now executes at 2200ms (was 4300ms) ***NOBUSHI UPDATE*** **Zone Attack** - 1st strike: Reduced to 20 damage (from 33 damage). - 2nd strike: 1 + 20 bleed damage (from 6 damage+ 20 Bleed damage). - Total = Reduced to 41 health damage (from 59 health damage). - [Bug Fix] Added visual effect on Zone attack 2nd strike cancel. **Kick** - Kick startup reduced to 600ms (from 800ms). - On Heavy the branching to Kick was delayed by 100ms. - Updated the attack range to 3.5m (from 4m). - [Bug Fix] Reduced invulnerability to Guard Break by 400ms on Miss (was from 0 to 700ms, now from 0 to 300ms) and by 300ms on Hit (was from 0 to 600ms, now from 0 to 300ms). *Developer Comments: Now when the Nobushi misses her Kick, the opponent is able to Guard Break her.* - Removed the stamina cost on hit (10 stamina points). - Kick trajectory has been updated. **Attack Post Hidden Stance** - Hidden Stance Top Light attack startup reduced to 500ms (from 600ms). - Hidden Stance Top Heavy Feint: - [Bug Fix] Defense was missing during the last 100ms of the Feint. It is fixed. - [Bug Fix] Feints could be performed while Out of Stamina. It is fixed. **Side Light Finishers** - Side Light Finishers startup reduced to 600ms (from 700ms) **Swift Recoil** - Swift Recoil can now connect to the Vipers Retreat (after 200ms) **Chains Top Light and Heavy** - [Bug Fix] Inside chains, the Nobushi can move horizontally during all her Top attack startup, which allows her to dodge the Block into Shove for example. It is fixed. *Developer Comments: Now the Nobushi cannot move on side direction during her chain top attacks, she only move forward as the other chains in the game.* **Side Dodges** - Increased the Nobushi side dodge recoveries durations to 600ms (Before was 500ms). **Cobra Strike** - [Bug fix] Nobushi Cobra Strike can hit an opponent without any visual contact when opponent succeed a dodge. It is fixed. *Developer Comments: The trajectories were updated to be closer to the Cobra Strike animations.* - [Bug fix] Nobushi was unable to cancel the Cobra Strikes Recovery into a forward Dodge. It is fixed. *Developer Comments: It was not allowed to make a forward dodge during the Cobra Strike, only side dodges were allowed. Now, the Nobushi can cancel Cobra Strike by a forward or a side dodge.* **Sprint Attacks** - [Bug fix] The Nobushi sprint light attack allows opponent to go through the guidance while the Sprint heavy doesnt. *Developer Comments: So we did the opposite for the logic:* - Sprint Light no longer causes the opponent to be knocked off ledges. - Sprint Heavy now causes the opponent to be knocked off ledges. - [Bug fix] The Nobushi can perform Slithering Thrust and Coiling Slash while out of stamina with the Iron Lungs feat active. It is fixed. *Developer Comments: Now the Nobushi has the same behavior as the other characters which share the same feat. She cannot perform her sprint attacks.* **Light Attacks post Hidden Stance** - Reduced the damage to 8 damage (from 18). *Developer Comments: Light attacks post Hidden Stance into Light (combo) now confirms 34 (instead of 44) damage.* **Sidewinder Form** - Removed the ability to cancel Sidewinder Form recoveries by a back dodge. Can only be cancelled by a Front or a Side Dodge. Developer Comments: Same behavior than the Cobra Strike, will avoid to be able to escape. ***SHAMAN*** **Predators Hunger** - Reduced the knockback of Predators Hunger by 0.5m. **Throw Left** - Left Throws no longer Unbalance the opponent if the Throw itself reduces them to 0 stamina. It now only Unbalances if the opponent was at 0 stamina before the Throw (this now makes it consistent with other heroes throws). ***SHINOBI*** - [Bug fix] Fixed an issue that caused the Shinobi to be interrupted by a Guard Break from an external attacker during the teleport behind his opponent after a deflect. *Developer Comments: This was inconsistent compared to other characters deflect. Now, a Guard Break cannot interrupt the Shinobi during all his teleport (when he is invisible) and during the 1st part of his recovery (before he starts to turn in the direction of his target).* - [Bug fix] Fixed an issue that cause the Shinobi to send the opponent in the wrong direction after performing Charged Kick mix up while he is not locked to him. *Developer Comments: The rotation speed of the target was too slow and do not have time to face the Shinobi when he hits him. Now the rotation speed is changed to allow the target rotation to face the Shinobi.* - [Bug fix] Fixed an issue that caused the Shinobi Guard Breaks to sometimes affect the opponent behind his targeted opponent. ***SKIRMISH*** - Skirmish now uses a pulse respawn mechanic. *Developers comment: This means that all dead players will respawn simultaneously every 10 seconds, with a minimum of 3 seconds. This should make it much easier for teams to regroup after losing team fights, which in turn should make the whole game mode fairer. To supplement this change, executions will no longer inflict a respawn duration penalty and will instead give more hard points based on the duration of the execution (Short: 15 pts, Medium: 35pts, Long: 50 pts). This should ultimately create shorter and more intense matches that feel more like what a Skirmish should be.* ***Improved Player Reporting Dialog*** - Added more granularity to the Player Reporting Dialog, now players can be reported for the following categories: - Abusive Chat (PC Only) - Inactivity / AFK - Cheating / Botting - Offensive Emblem - Offensive Name (PC Only. On Console, please contact Sony or Microsoft.) - Griefing - Spam - The Reporting dialog also includes the Do and Dont of reporting in a selected category. - Reports are reviewed on a daily basis, and we will continue to monitor For Honor for inappropriate behavior, as well as take action as needed to preserve the integrity of game. You may refer to our code of conduct here: Code of Conduct. - Please Note: Abuse of this feature can lead to Sanctions against the Reporter. Furthermore, the ability to report each player is now limited to once per match. *Developer Comments: Thanks to this, players will be able to report toxic behaviors more accurately. Its crucial for us to have a safe and fun environment when playing For Honor. We are committed to continue fighting against toxicity in our game.* **Faster Access to the Interactive Scoreboard** - Players can now access the Interactive scoreboard faster by using the following Shortcuts: - With a Controller: While Holding (View/Share) press (Menu/Options) to switch to the Interactive Scoreboard. - With Keyboard &amp; Mouse: Press F5 to access the Interactive Scoreboard directly. *Developer Comments: Now players will find it easier to interact with a specific player name during a match.* "

Every move I use as Conqueror is a vulnerability, and isn't worth doing for the little damage it outputs. From duels to dominion, Conqueror is truly useless against an enemy who knows how to play the game, and it's become too frustrating to wait for the buff. I've been trying to grind out PvAI solo so I can keep up in terms of gear since the nerf happened, and I've been telling myself that the buff/rework would be ""soon"". Quite frankly this game feels like an abusive relationship to a Conq main (since Beta), I convince myself it will get better like it was in the beginning but it never shows any improvement. There are balancing issues with a lot of the heroes, and it has been a well known fact that Conqueror, Kensei and a few others have completely been made more irrelevant each season. I want to love this game so badly, but until my baby is viable again I'm afraid I just can't play against the heroes who are (especially with the addition of the Aramusha and the Shaman). I hope to be back some time soon."
265,vulnerability,forhonor,"The best PTS2 mechanic tweak was cut from S4, and I'm extremely confused!",0,7ahfg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/7ahfg4/the_best_pts2_mechanic_tweak_was_cut_from_s4_and/,2017-11-03 16:28:39,"&gt;You cannot parry while out of stamina This was an *incredible* change to the game. In 4v4, OOS hardly affects you if you have maxed out equipment, meaning you won't get boned in a 1vX fight... though you have to be careful for that two seconds; you could get boned by something unblockable if you just mindlessly turtle! In a gear-less environment, however, going OOS actually made you panic in PTS2. Right now, if I'm OOS against the following heroes, I chuckle to myself; they aren't scary to me if I just block and dodge! * Kensei * Shugoki * Peacekeeper (arguably; she's significantly easier to defend against if I'm not trying to actively kill her) * Berserker * Orochi * Lawbringer * Valkyrie * Nobushi * Shinobi * Highlander All of these heroes are a complete joke when you're OOS currently, because you can easily deal with them in turtle-mode. If you couldn't parry *in addition to* losing superior block; that expanded that roster of ""oh shit, I'm OOS and my opponent is X hero!"" Raider, Kensei, Shugoki, Berserker, Valkyrie, Centurion, Shinobi, Gladiator, and Highlander *all* become significantly more dangerous towards OOS opponents if parrying is disabled while OOS. This forces you to be *good* at defense in order to win every time you go OOS; be it for 2 seconds in dominion, or 20 seconds at the hands of a skilled Gladiator. You know what this allows? *Offensive play*, the thing Ubisoft is *trying* to create. By nerfing parries (which, I'm pretty sure they still plan on doing), and disabling them during OOS state, they create a period of vulnerability. #Now, for a suggestion Since they aren't disabling parries while OOS, perhaps doubling chip damage against OOS opponents to heavily incentivize those infamously risky parries would also do the trick. Food for thought."
266,vulnerability,forhonor,Broken mechanics are making impossible to survive a gank against competent players.,22,73rp20,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/73rp20/broken_mechanics_are_making_impossible_to_survive/,2017-10-02 20:10:22,"TL;DR The mechanics around being gb'd and the state in which you are Cgb'ing another player need to be adjusted to eliminate the current unfair , broken no win situations that are currently in the game. Plain and simple when one player gb's you even if you cgb them immediately there is a small window of vulnerability to the person being gb'd where they literally cannot defend themselves at all from outside sources of damage. (Ex) Your a Conq your facing a Raider and a Shougki the Shougki goes to gb you , you cgb the Shougki but during this time the Raider manages to get a top heavy on you. You just took 45 damage with absolutely zero counterplay. Thats just the basics issue across all characters. Lets assume the same situation except this time the Raider is the one gb'ing you and the Shougki is going for a Demons embrace. You counter gb the Raider however as your cgb'ing the Raider the Shougki rips you out of the Raiders arms and demons embraces you. You just took massive damage with absolutely no counterplay. Worst part is Raider can pick you up as you get up from the Shougki dropping you with his charge and slam you into a wall and Shougki can once again demons embrace you off said wall. Again there is absolutely no counterplay to such actions. The solution is simple during the time where a player is getting gb'd and or in the action of cgb'ing another player have all outside sources of damage set to 0 and have any and all stagger or ""stun-lock type moves"" Bounce off the Cgb'ing player like when two players try to gb each other at the same time. Problem solved ganking issues eased and no skill spam to win gameplay removed , everyone wins."
267,vulnerability,forhonor,For Health: A Better Foundation,4,6uxvzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/6uxvzn/for_health_a_better_foundation/,2017-08-21 05:56:06,"For Honor is a great game, but it has it's issues, no doubt about that. Ranging from mechanical issues to hero balancing to connection problems. One of For Honor's biggest issues is it's foundation; or the pillars that hold up the game. The ideas are great, the implementation could use some work. These are just my suggestions on what could be done and they have already gotten some good feed back. Any other feedback is welcome and please keep in mind none of these are a 'MUST' rather just ideas on what could be done to possibly improve the game. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #***Chip Damage*** So in the PTS Chip was finally increased. However, it still isn't where it needs to be. Currently it only applies on non-interrupt block attacks; meaning mainly heavies. This also means Conqueror is completely immune to chip but I'll go more in depth about that later. What should be done? - Both heavies and light attacks (even if interrupt blocked) should cause chip. This further reduces the turtle meta so that all attacks do some type of damage on block. - Increase the chip damage values and have separate values for lights and heavies: 30% for light attacks. On a 15 damage light this would be 4.5 damage. 25% for heavy attacks. On a 30 damage heavy this would be 7.5 damage. Now chip actually has a meaningful effect. This leads to parrying being more of a necessity to reduce damage. Thus leading to potential mix ups. Superior Block Counter attacks like Warden's or Highlander's crushing counter would not suffer chip damaging using them. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #***Time Snap*** This is essentially a lag compensation mechanic the developers made to combat inconsistencies with attacks during lag. In patch 1.09 it was removed/turned off and since than attacks (especially on console) have been wildly inconsistent. 500ms becoming 400-499ms and parrying timings being drastically changed. This change was not at healthy for the game and makes heroes like Gladiator or Peacekeeper (anyone with fast attacks) a menace to deal with; especially on console. Despite the fact that parrying was made harder because of this change. this was not the right way to go about making parrying harder. Time Snap should be re-enabled to give attacks consistency and another way should be found to make parrying more difficult; which leads me to my next point. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #***Parrying*** Parrying is a great mechanic. It is very much the counter that all heroes have access to. However it is incredibly easy to pull off once you master it. The window for parrying from what I recall is 200-299ms. The 200ms is where you would get the parry and the extra 99ms is essentially a safe partial parry. You missed the parry but it still does the parry start up animation to block. I'm sure most, if not all of us, have seen it happen. The partial parry is being removed according to Roman so now it would be a strict 200ms. However, how often do people actually miss parries? The window is incredibly big. 200ms is almost HALF of a 500ms to get a parry. The window should be made smaller so that parrying is more difficult and a more precise skill: - Reduce the parry window from 200ms - 100ms. This changes parrying so that instead of parrying the attack as it comes towards you, you parry it RIGHT BEFORE it hits you. 100ms is a big difference when it comes to parrying. A smaller window leaves more room for mistakes and makes parrying harder to do. Now I know console will be a concern, however, if time snap is enabled again attacks will be more consistent and it was also much easy to parry attacks on console while time snap was on. I think it should balance out. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #***Parry Rewards*** In the PTS all parries lead to a light attack. Now Light's are faster than heavies so they are harder to parry. With the smaller window suggested, parrying light's will be even harder. You should get a bigger reward than parrying a slow heavy. - Light Parry gives LEAST DAMAGING heavy attack (Warden's side heavy instead of top heavy) Heavy Parry gives only a light attack A little work would need to be done on the damage values of hero heavies so that side heavies have different damage values than top heavies or vice versa. For instance, all of Conqueror's heavies do 25 damage, but his top heavy his 100ms slower (800ms vs side heavy 700ms) conqueror's top heavy damage could be buffed to 30-35 damage. Separating the rewards by splitting up which type of heavy is used (left/right or top) allows punishes and rewards for specific actions to be fine tuned. Most damaging heavies (Raider's top, Warden's top) are reserved for knockdowns and/or wall bounces. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #***Guardbreak/Parry/Feint*** So there is supposed to be a mini mind game when it comes to parrying. Parrying shouldn't be 100% safe. In the PTS it pretty much was safe. This was due to the 100ms vulnerability time on heavies. Now the reduction in vulnerability to 100ms was a good change. However, it pretty much killed the mind game of parrying for those who don't have heavy soft feints into guard break. So what should be done to bring back that mini-mind game: implement a feint recovery time. - After a feint you cannot CGB or block for 200-300ms (the smaller the better, needs to be a prediction; not a reaction) Just like the Warden nerf of shoulder bash feinting where you are vulnerable after feinting, the same thing would apply to feinting heavies. Now there is a mind game: Is what is the opponent going to do? - Looking to guard break my feint attempt? Let the heavy fly. - Expecting me to let the heavy fly and parry me? Feint it, possibly into something else Heavy beats guard break that beats feinting that beats heavy. Everyone has access to this. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #***Removal of Interrupt Block Lights*** This one may be extremely controversial, and again not all these ideas have to be implemented but I feel strongly about this one. The turtle meta is not just due to the lack of chip damage. Currently blocking is EXTREMELY powerful because it reduces damage heavily AND it stops most momentum*. It stops momentum because most of the combo strings in the game are composed of more lights than heavies. Interrupt block negates the momentum because as soon as a light is blocked and the fight is set back to neutral. If interrupt block was removed, you could preform combo strings while an opponent is blocking (aka block strings). This makes parrying the combo breaker of For Honor. It also makes parrying more of a necessity and defensive tool than an offensive one. This wouldn't effect superior block counter attacks (Warden's Crushing Counter, Conqueror's Heavies, Kensei's dash, Valkyrie Lights, etc) or the superior block/interrupt block properties of all block; both of these would still interrupt attacks. 2 Wardens are dueling: - The first Warden starts his aggression with a light, light, heavy combo string - The heavy is parried and the other Warden starts their aggreasion with a light into a heavy feint guard break mix up. - The first Warden goes for a feinted parry attempt, expecting the other Warden to go for another parry, but gets guard broken because guard break beats feinting (Rock Paper Scissors) and the combo continues. Removing interrupt block also puts more of an emphasis on aggression, than just being defensive. You can no longer be defensive and stop combos easily. You have to be pro-active in your defense; if you just block you are going to suffer damage through chip and that WILL add up if you continue to do nothing about it. Parrying isn't the only way to get out of the block string, you can dodge, roll out, etc. Most combo strings are only 3 moves long so players are going to have to be creative to make longer combos. This whole thing also puts LESS of an emphasis on openers, and more of an emphasis on mix ups because you either suffer the damage by being super defensive, or you take the initiative and counter attack using tools every hero has at their disposal: lights, heavies, parrying, dodging. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #***Superior Block &amp; Conqueror*** Superior Block (Not superior block counters like Crushing counter) in unique to Conqueror in that it is active on neutral block. Superior Block is supposed to be immune to chip damage and interrupt all attacks and it allows Conqueror to do just that from neutral. This should not be the case. - The idea I had to replace he free gb is Conqueror's passive neutral Superior Block could give a passive 10% reduction to chip damage (adjustable according to chip values, I got 10% off my values above). If it can't be done because of coding of the other Superior Block type moves (Crushing counter, etc) rename it to something like ""Sturdy Shield"" and make the mechanics different from superior block (passive 10% chip defense). Conqueror is supposed to have the strongest defense in the game and this really solidifies that role. Other idea's for changes to Conqueror can be found [here](URL --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #***Dodging vs Dashing*** In a previous Warrior's Den, the devs stated they thing dodging as an offensive tool. This is the reason they gave for non-reflexive guard heroes having a delay after dodging or changing guard. The devs also said this is what makes the assassins unique. All heroes should have the ability to block and dodge effectively; even more so now that we have heroes like Glad who have fast attacks but also fast unblockables that need to be dodged. This puts certain heroes (most of the cast) at a distinct disadvantage against heroes like Gladiator. Now there should be something to differentiate assassin dodges and non-assassin dodges as Assassins should have better dodges than other heroes (Assassin's vs Heavies). This would be dodges and dashes: - Dodges and dashes are 2 different maneuvers A DODGE would be defensive, while a DASH would be an offensive dodge. All Assassin's would have dashes while every other hero would have dodges. The difference between dodges and dashes are that dashes have more utility to them than dodges. Dashes have deflect property, dash attacks, dash distance and speed as well as more I-Frames. Assassin's are meant to utilize their dashes and deflect properties more than their blocking. They're meant to be slippery and weave offense and defense together with deflects. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- These are just my thoughts on what should be done to improve the foundation. I'd love any feedback and opinions! Again not all of these (or any) would HAVE to be implemented. These are just my suggestions. Cheers!"

These were just numbers I came up with after testing and making calculations. Feedback is welcome! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #***Foundation*** --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Chip Damage*** In the PTS Chip was finally increased.

This leads to parrying being more of a necessity to reduce damage. Thus leading to potential mix ups. Superior Block Counter attacks like Warden's or Highlander's crushing counter would not suffer chip damaging using them. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Time Snap Replacement*** So what Time Snap did was it added essentially an inconsistent 0-99ms delay depending on how close you were to the next 100ms snap. Essentially what I've heard floating around is add a consistent 100ms delay so attacks are now as they were before Time Snap removal. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Parrying*** Parrying is a great mechanic. It is very much the counter that all heroes have access to. However it is incredibly easy to pull off once you master it. The window for parrying from what I recall is 200-299ms.

Warden's top light Crushing Counter has Superior Block on start up. Kensei has it on the side he is guarding while dashing. Valkyrie has it in any direction she dashes. However, Superior Block (from my experience) only effects Heavy attacks. This is what allows assassins to parry something like Highlander or Warden's crushing counter if it's off a light attack; the recovery is quick enough to parry and Assassin's can parry right after recovery. Superior block should effect both light and heavy attacks. This is would allow ALL superior counter moves to actually hit and not just ones that are unblockable or off heavy attacks. Now that superior block is only for counter attacking (removed off Conqueror's normal block; see the Conqueror notes below) it makes sense to allow it to effect all attacks, not just heavies. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Dodging vs Dashing and Dodge Recovery*** Non-reflex heroes cannot switch guards after dodging or vice versa. All heroes should have the ability to block and dodge effectively; even more so now that we have heroes like Glad who have fast attacks but also fast unblockables that need to be dodged. This puts certain heroes (most of the cast) at a distinct disadvantage against heroes like Gladiator. Now there should be something to differentiate assassin dodges and non-assassin dodges as Assassins should have better dodges than other heroes (Assassin's vs Heavies). This would be dodges and dashes: - Dodges and dashes are 2 different maneuvers A DODGE would be defensive, while a DASH would be an offensive dodge. All Assassin's would have dashes while every other hero would have dodges. The difference between dodges and dashes are that dashes have more utility to them than dodges. Dashes have deflect property, dash attacks, dash distance and speed as well as more I-Frames. Assassin's are meant to utilize their dashes and deflect properties more than their blocking. They're meant to be slippery and weave offense and defense together with deflects. Dodge Recovery should be the same throughout the cast; 500ms for all (or 600ms if 500 is too small). This makes dodging safer and a more valid option; especially for assassins who are supposed to be using deflects. You don't see many deflects because of how unsafe dodging is. The only concern is making sure dodging doesn't become over powered with the feint recovery change. Maybe 600ms for Non-reflex heroes, 500ms for assassins? It would be a small difference, but it should work out. If you want different classes to have different dodges, you can use distance to differentiate. Heavies: Shortest, Vanguards: Medium, Assassin: Longest Hybrids: Variable based no type of hybrid (Lawbringer Short, Valkyrie Medium, Nobushi Long) ------------------------------------------------------------------------- #***Hero Changes*** ------------------------------------------------------------------------- #***Warden*** The first 2 [attacks](URL would essentially be semi charged heavies. - The first swing would be semi charged Heavy and the second swing would be normal follow up Heavy. A semi/partial charged follow up Heavy would essentially look like a semi charged heavy (1): a wild one handed swing). - [Warden's Oath](URL . - A fully charged heavy. Simply hold down Heavy. Unblockable and hyper armor attributes would not be added to the move until the wind up (charging) is done and it reaches the fully charged state and the move begins. - Top Heavy Warden's Oath is 1500ms with attributes coming in at the final 400ms - Side Heavy Warden's Oath is 1400ms with attributes coming in at the final 400ms - [Stabbing Charge](URL - Leads to a thrust that pushes forward, a lot like Lawbringer's impale. Just take away the animation at the end so we don't have cut scenes like Centurion. Just like a fully Charged Heavy no attributes would be added to the move until the wind up is done and the fully charged move begins. The push back would be shorter than Lawbringer's for balance purposes (maybe half as far?) but slightly further than Warden's throw as to give it purpose. - That stab would only be dodgable, not parryable; rewards guard break on dodge - The stab would do 25 damage damage and would not reward a heavy off wall bounce, only a light attack - serves as a way to get into his shoulder bash mix up - Stabbing Charge is 1400ms from a heavy follow up with attributes coming in at the final 300ms and is 700ms from a dash heavy with attributes coming in at the final 300ms There are 2 ways this move could be preformed: - The first would be to make it a fully charged follow up heavy. *OR* - A forward dash + Heavy would lead to a Stabbing Charge. The preferred way would be to give Warden both of these options to preform the Stabbing Charge. Much like how he has 2 ways to go into his shoulder bash: Light into shoulder bash, or dash into shoulder bash. - [Warden's Fury](URL In an early build of the game, Warden was doing what looks like a Heavy into a Light. It was a slash into a Mortor stroke. The light could be combo-ed into a shoulder bash mix up. The follow up light would be 500ms-600ms. *Buffs* - Remove free guard break on zone block - No attack should ever reward a guardbreak on block; not to mention peacekeeper's and warlord's zones are MUCH better than Warden's and are safe on block *Nerfs* Warden really doesn't need any nerfs, he is pretty good where he is after all the nerfs he received. However, a lot of people still disagree with the shoulder bash/guard break mix up. Mostly because he is the only one who can do it. While at one point I did agree, I learned to counter it. However, I do have a suggestion to remove the guard break off shoulder bash, but still keep shoulder bash viable. *If guard break off shoulder bash was removed:* - remove charge time for level 1 shoulder bash from neutral; so it acts like other openers (flows with dash) - Keep the level 1 shoulder bash charge time off shoulder bashes after light attacks (light attack, 600ms for level 1 bash) this stops vortex from being broken - replace level 2 shoulder bash with level 3 shoulder bash, (hyper armor and top heavy reward) - level 3 shoulder bash would have the charge up time of the fully charged shoulder bash in the story mode - increase feint window of shoulder bash from 400ms to 600ms This would be a slight nerf to warden's potential shoulder bash damage; all he would get off a uncharged shoulder bash is 2 lights, instead of the potential guard break into side heavy or top heavy with a wall bounce ------------------------------------------------------------------------- #***Raider*** - *Opener* - **Hilt Strike** A hit with the butt of the ax. Runs forward and does something akin to an [this](URL Can only be done from forward dash. *Nerfs* - Stampede Charge start up reduced from 300ms to 500ms - Stampedge Charge as it currently is, is way to fast for how good it is. - Either reduce the stamina drain on stampede charge/fireman carry or reduce the damage off wall bounce - The amount of stamina drain you get off a stampede charge or charge from guard break is incredibly high (it's like centurion's entire purpose in one move); coupled with the high confirmed damage off either a wall bounce or straight throw into knockdown makes the move too devastating if landed. Either reduce the confirmed damage, or reduce the amount of stamina drain (preferred) - Increase Stamina drain on Raider while using Stampede Charge - For the amount of stamina it drains, next to nothing (if anything) is drained from Raider, look at Lawbringer's impale ------------------------------------------------------------------------ #***Kensei*** - *Opener* - **Knee bash** (600ms) Kensei launches forward into a rising knee [straight into the enemy's jaw](URL The elbow coming down would either be kensei's elbow or the butt of the hilt. Applies blinding effect. Can only be done from forward dash and gives a top light(?)(balance purposes) - Kensei can soft feint his heavy into a light in any direction - If the light is blocked it counts as 1 part of his chain, if it lands, it counts as 2 parts of his chain meaning he can go directly into his unblockable if it lands. - Kensei can soft feint his heavy into a guard break - Kensei is meant to be the soft feint master of the game - Kensei can soft feint his hyper armor side heavy by dashing - This applies to all hyper armor side heavies; including the soft feinted one from his unblockable (soft feint into a soft feint) *Buffs* - Increase the speed of all dash attacks - Anyone with basic parrying skill can pretty easily shut any of kensei's dash attacks. They are also one of his best ways to get to his unblockable mix up so make them a little better. - This will also allow Kensei to get his dash attack in if he he dodges in the direction of an attack with his superior block up - Increase the speed of his unblockable - Against really good players, Kensei will either be knocked out of the unblockable, or it will be reaction parried after the feint window ends. Speed it up so it's more of a reliable mix up. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ #***Conqueror*** - (Passive) Bonus 10% on chip damage (Replaces Neutral Superior Block) - The flail was generally meant to get around defenses and do damage through blunt for trauma. Conqueror's attacks should reflect that by giving him a small bonus to his chip damage - (Passive) Bonus 10% chip defense (Replaces Neutral Superior Block) - Since conqueror is meant to have the best defense, he would get a natural 10% chip damage reduction. This solidifies his strong defense role. - Attacks on all-block lead to confirmed heavy shield bash - This gives more use to all block other than just blocking - Follow up heavies and heavy finishers can charged. - Fully Charged Heavies become Unblockable - Uncharged Chain finisher heavies have hyper armor (only after a minimum of 3 consecutive light attacks (even if blocked); shield bash into light counts as 2 attacks) - Charged heavy chain finishers have hyper armor AND are Unblockable *Buffs* - Buff light damage from 15 - 20 damage (adjustable) - Conqueror is a heavy hitter, he should hit like one; also synergizes with his passive 10% chip damage boost (using chip numbers suggested above: 20 * (.30+(.10)) = 8 chip damage) - Follow up light after shield bash is 15-17 damage instead of 20 - Buff Top Heavy damage from 25 - 35 Damage - Buff Side Heavy damage from 25 - 30 Damage - Speed up heavy shield bash follow up after heavy attacks and from all block - The heavy shield bash is EXTREMELY slow will almost NEVER hit. Speed it up and give make it more of a threat. - Superior block on Conqueror's heavy constantly lands - I'm sure many conqueror players notice that more often than not their superior block heavies often GET blocked, this should not be the case. - Remove the stamina regen penalty from all block - There is literally no reason for this *Nerfs* - Parrying a light should punish the conqueror - In the PTS, parrying a conq light gave nothing, a parry should always reward something - Increase the stamina cost of Shield Bash - Right now you can do 12 shield bashes in a row without a follow up light, and 7 in a row with a follow up light; that's a ridiculous amount of times. Currently, it's warranted with how weak Conqueror is, but with these buffs shield bash should have a higher stamina cost so it's not spammable CC. (7 times without follow up light, 5 times with follow light maybe?) - Remove Conqueror's passive superior block on normal blocks and replace it with the aforementioned passives - Removes his ability to get a guard break on heavy block - Dodging Light Shield bash rewards guard break unless it's followed up by a light attack ------------------------------------------------------------------------ #***Warlord*** - [For Vallhalla](URL - Gudmundr has what could be said is a charged heavy attack. This would NOT be unblockable, but it would have hyper armor once fully charged (this is because it has an unblockable follow-up). Only CHARGE UP would be feintable. But the fully charged heavy would not be; you would have to commit. - Side heavy charge is 1500ms with hyper armor at the final 400ms, top heavy charge is 1400ms with hyper armor at the final 400ms - The uncharged heavy would still be feintable - If the charged heavy is dodged, it leads to a guard break (Unless it was a charged heavy (1) in Hack and Slash, then it could be followed up with a light) - The follow up light in Warlord's Hack and Slash string (Heavy, Light) would still be an option after a charged heavy. Either shield uppercut, or light attack. - Warlord would be able to charge the heavy in Focused Strikes (Light, Heavy). The Shield uppercut can be preformed after this heavy, however, unlike Hack and Slash, a light could not. The shield bash would be Warlord's only follow up option after Focused Strikes. - [Shield Uppercut](URL - Off a normal heavy (not charged) the bash cannot be done if the heavy is blocked, but can be done if the heavy lands. If the heavy is charged, the bash CAN be done on block, but it is dodge-able and punishable by guard break, if the Warlord doesn't follow up. - Bash is confirmed on Charged heavy hit, but not on uncharged heavy hit - [Odin's Lightning](URL - After the bash, Warlord can follow up with another heavy (can be charged). Much like the first heavy, only the uncharged heavy and CHARGE UP could be feinted. This heavy would also only have hyper armor if fully charged. - Frame data same as 'For Vallhalla' - The follow up heavy (charged or not) can negate the potential guard break from the shield uppercut. If your opponent reads you however, you can be punished by parry or another dodge - Can be done in any direction, not just top - If Odin's Lightning is dodged, it's a free guard break - Further more, this little combo has A LOT of mix up potential if the charged heavy is started on a heavy instead of a follow-up heavy. Charged Heavy into either: the light attack or the shield bash. *** - A lot of people agree that Warlord should not have Hyper armor on his heavies and I agree. However, the hyper armor could be implemented to only be on the fully charged heavy. Almost all charged heavies in the game have the unblockable attribute, since this wouldn't, it makes sense to at least give it hyper armor. If a Warlord reads an attack coming, he can charge a heavy to go into a mix up. *Nerfs* - Remove hyper armor off normal heavy attacks - Changed to charged heavy attacks - Slow down headbutt or increase stamina cost - With how well it flows out of dash and how spammable it is it shouldn't be as fast as it is. Slow it down by about 100ms to make it 600ms, in line with the other openers, or increase the stamina cost - Reduce zone tracking - The zone tracks like Centurion. It is near impossible to dodge because it will track you through any dodge. Warlord is not meant to have a tone of range like nobushi's zone. The speed and damage would be fine if it didn't have so much range and tracking. - Lights from 500ms - 600ms - Warlord is a heavy class, but has some of the fastest lights in the game (on par with peacekeeper, an assassin) - Dodge recovery nerf - If dodge recovery is not made standard across the cast, then nerf Warlord's dodge recovery. He is a heavy and shouldn't have the best dodge recovery if everyone else doesn't as well. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ #***Shugoki*** *Opener* - **Bodyslam** A straight up body slam. A small charge forward. I think it fits shugoki really well considering his size. Can only be done on forward dash. - Allow follow up heavies to be charged - (Heavy into Charged heavy) or (Light into Charged heavy) - Headbutt should be allowed on follow up attacks; currently you have to headbutt off the first attack - (Heavy into light into headbutt) or (Light into heavy into headbutt) - Oni Charge knocks down OOS opponents - Currently Oni Charge is useless unless you are on a bridge - Allow the soft feinting of follow up heavies into Demons embrace *Buffs* - Decrease recovery of the fully charged heavy - As it stands, if you use the fully charged heavy on a knocked down opponent, it's a free guard break for them - Remove the 25% damage debuff while Shugoki's hyper armor is deactivated - When Shugoki's hyper armor is deactivated through guard break or other means, he takes 25% more damage. This effectively gives him as much health as peacekeeper. Remove this debuff to solidify his role as a tank - Decrease the Shugoki's recovery after headbutt - After headbutt you are frozen for about a full second or two and are unable to add pressure on the stunned opponent. This effectively makes the stun useless and renders headbutt as a mere stamina draining tool - Give Shugoki's Zone heavy/execution damage - He's meant to be a hard hitter and his zone is pretty slow. - Reduce the stamina drain on charged heavy parry - A single parry on Shugoki's charged heavy leads to instant OOS, with the upcoming OOS changes, one parry should not lead to OOS - Guard break no longer removes hyper armor, only a landed attack removes the hyper armor - This effectively makes shugoki's hyper armor useless because of how easy it is to negate it - Demon's embrace speed increased from 1200ms to 1000ms - Demon's embrace no longer consumes hyper armor - With the amount of damage he takes on miss, it's a bit much to remove this as well - Damage reduced while in Demon's Embrace - In team fights you can effectively take more damage than you heal during the animation *Nerfs* - Demon's embrace no longer confirmed on wall bounce - This is a bit much for shugoki and is only valid currently because of how weak he is, Demon's embrace should be a team fight or trading tool based on reads ------------------------------------------------------------------------ #***Peacekeeper*** *Opener* - **Backflip kick** Essentially the same as her forward throw. Peacekeeper charges in a direction and does a backflip with her foot landing on the opponents chin. Side dash attacks would essentially be a bicycle kick. If she dashes right, she would turn to the left as she dashes and back flip kick into the side of the opponents face. Can be preformed off forward and side dashes. - Allow us to change the direction of Dagger Cancel (Heavy into light soft feint) - Currently, dagger cancel locks you in the direction you did the heavy. This pretty much reders it useless ad the parry timings for the heavy and the dagger cancel nearly line up. Not to mention blocking negates the entire thing. - Make dagger cancel 500ms so it's not over powered - Allow soft feint into guard break off any heavy - Currently, Peacekeeper can only soft feint her FIRST heavy into guard break; if you allow her to soft feint any of her heavies in any of her chains, there is more use to them and you may see more than just light spam, especially with the feint changes - This would be no different than Centurion, except Peacekeeper would have a must stricter timing because she can't charge her heavies - Allow dash cancel off any heavy *Buffs* - Top heavy damage increased from 33 damage - 35 damage - Side heavy speed increased from 800ms - 700ms (to make up for the small damage nerf) *Nerfs* - Slow down the speed of her zone from 400ms to 500ms - Now that Peacekeeper would have an opener, she has no need for such a fast zone to open up players - Follow up light reduced to 500ms from 400ms - With interrupt light on block removed and parrying being made harder, having a 400ms follow up would be a bit too powerful - Increase the recovery on zone cancel (like nobushi) - Zone cancel recovery is instant on peacekeepers zone; with how fast and good it is, it shouldn't recover as quick - Side heavy damage decreased from 33 damage - 30 damage ------------------------------------------------------------------------ #***Berserker*** *Opener* - **Lariat/Haymaker/Hook** A straight up swing. Fits zerk really well with his reckless style. Can only be done off forward dashes. - Turn Top Heavy Finisher into a feintable Unblockable - Many berserker mains have been asking for this and I agree, the top heavy finisher should be unblockable. It's too easy to mitigate most of the damage just by blocking and considering the potential risk a berserker takes to get to his top heavy, I think it's warranted. - The top heavy would become unblockable ONLY after a minimum of a 2 chain hit (signified by the same red glow conqueror has on his fully charged heavies) - Either his Light, Heavy chain into top unblockable, his Heavy, Light chain into top unblockable, or his triple heavy chain with the last heavy being unblockable if it's done from the top - This would be for balance purposes as being able to do a 500ms light into a high damaging top heavy unblockable would be too much - Berserker should be able to soft feint any of his attacks in his infinite chain by dashing (besides his Top Heavy Finisher) - Berserker is meant to string many attacks together and flow in his chains; like a bladedancer or a river. Keeping up a relentless assault while reacting to the opponents actions. However, currently, all a berserker can do is soft feint the first attack he does or the heavies in his infinite chain. Change this to both heavies AND lights and berserker now has the ability to flow through his chains and truly be an unpredictable relentless *Buffs* - Top Heavy Damage buffed from 38 Damage - 40 damage - Side Heavy Damage buffed from 33 Damage - 35 Damage ------------------------------------------------------------------------ #***Orochi*** *Opener* - **Windmill Kick** Tozen has a [kick](URL in the story mode that would make for a GREAT orochi opener. Slow it down a bit, remove the hyper armor and knockdown, and remove the taunting Tozen does so you can get in a light attack, and you have a unique looking opener for Orochi. Can only be done from forward or side dashes. - [Form of the Dragon](URL - Tozen has a type of all block or all parry. This would be a unique feature to the Orochi in that he would be the only assassin to have a type of all block. - This would be done just like all block, hold back on the guard stance. - As to not render normal parrying useless, if a player can bait out orochi's all parry, he is vulnerable to a gb so there is now risk to using it. - Functions just like conq or warlord all block in that there is a slight delay to activation so it is not a reactive tool - Drains stamina during use - If someone hit's the all parry, you can go right into Windmill Kick or Sky Strike and thus a mix up. - [Sky Strike](URL - Orochi can cancel out of Form of the Dragon directly into an unblockable -The direction can be changed by change the direction of the attack and hitting heavy at the same time as to not make it too predictable. - Speed it up a bit because it is incredibly slow - make it feintable for mix up potential. - Twister Cuts - A Light, Light, Heavy chain - Gives a little bit of synergy with his confirmed double top light - Double top light -&gt; feinted heavy into either another double top light, guard break, zone attack, opener, all parry unblockable. Having a feintable attack after the double top light would give Orochi access to a few more mix ups. *Buffs* - Speed up Orochi's side lights and follow up lights to 500ms - All assassins light attacks are 500ms, Orochi's should be the same - Speed up storm rush - As of right now there is almost no point to storm rush. Even if you read an opponent and dash back into it to dodge their attack, chances are they will recover fast enough to the point where they can just block storm rush - Increase the Damage of riptide strike to give it more use and make it feintable - Riptide strike is meant a prediction tool, much like nobushi's hidden stance; thing is it doesn't do enough damage to warrant it when deflecting or parrying gives more damage and is much easier. - Increase the speed of riptide strike - There have been times I have successfully dodged a move with Riptide strike, only to have it either blocked, parried, or deflected because of how slow it is. You should be rewarded for making a read, not punished - Increase speed of Zeypher slash, lightning strike, and crashing wave (running heavy) - Against anyone with basic parry skills, these moves are almost useless, speed them up a bit in order to have them be useful dash attacks *Nerfs* - Reduce the damage of his double top light - Orochi's double top light does heavy/execution damage. Instead, it should function like warden's double side light in that it does less damage than 2 different lights that aren't confirmed - Warden's light attacks and double side light's function like this: ( (double side) 24 damage total for 2 hits out of neutral 15+9, Side into top is 15+15=30 since neither are confirmed) Orochi's should function similar so it's not lethal damage off a confirmed follow up. *** DamnNoHTML had a GREAT [post](URL awhile back about Orochi and what could be done with his current moveset to make him more viable! Since this post is essentially a mass moveset expansion post, I thought it would be good to include a link to his post! ------------------------------------------------------------------------ #***Lawbringer*** - Allow Lawbringer to start a feintable impale if the final light is a side light in Book, Chapter, Verse (Light, Heavy, Light) by hitting heavy after the final light attack - This would give actual use to Book, Chapter, Verse as it currently has NONE when compared to something like Swift Justice (Heavy, Light, Heavy) that can go into a Riposte if the final heavy is from the top. - This would function just like the Riposte after Swift Justice, just instead of the light attack button, it would be the heavy attack button - Hyper armor on heavies - Lawbringer is clad in armor and has a giant pole ax that has a ton of momentum behind it, it makes sense he would have hyper armor - From a balance perspective it also makes sense since his heavies are pretty slow when compared to other heroes *Buffs* - Increase Lawbringer's top heavy do 40 damage, and side heavies to 35 damage (Top Heavy is 900ms and Side Heavy is 800ms, why do they both do the same damage? 30 currently) - Law bringer actually has some of the weakest heavies in the game currently. Considering his design, he should do more damage with heavies - Increase the speed of the final light in Book, Chapter, Verse from 600ms to 500ms. - In order to make the light in Book, Chapter, Verse useful, it has to be the same speed as the light in Swift Justice - Increase the speed of shove from 700ms to 600ms - No competitive player is going to be hit by shove out of neutral, it's too slow. Speed it up to make it more of a threat **Shove Changes** - Shove guarantees a light on hit (not dodge-able) when used from neutral - This essentially removes the mix up and more potential damage in exchange for confirmed damage - Shove mix up no longer reactable (shove post heavy hit) - Speed up the light so it becomes a true mind game mix up, in competitive play, the shove mix up is reactable; however, nothing would be confirmed *Nerf* - Remove shove on block - If shove is made a true mix up, or confirms a light, having it off block would be too much. Plus having shove on block re-enforces turtling ------------------------------------------------------------------------ #***Valkyrie*** *Opener* - **Shield strike** A little different from Conq's shield bash. Valk lurches in a direction and instead of charging forward into a bash, she swings the shield in a horizontal fashion to the opponents face, or upwards vertical if she dashes forward. - Applies a blind effect (ala Centurion kick or Stunning stap). - Can only be done from 3 dash directions: forward, left and right. The reason it can't be done from a back dash is she has her all block there. - Openers combo into her side dash attacks. - Valkyrie would dash to the side and smack the opponent with her shield horizontally (her opener from a side dash) if it lands, doing a light attack will make Valkyrie flow right into a confirmed dash attack. If the dash attack is done AFTER a side dash opener, she can either follow up with a light or a spear sweep directly after the dash attack. Or she can guard break much like she does currently. - Her forward dash opener could be followed up into a confirmed light into the same mix up above. - Forward dash opener, into light (NOT THE DASH ATTACK), into mix up *Buffs* - Top Heavy Damage buffed from 25 Damage to 30 Damage (800ms) - Side Heavy speed increased from 800ms - 700ms (25 damage) - Remove free guard break off dash attack block ------------------------------------------------------------------------ #***Nobushi*** *Opener* - **Naginata Kick** Just allow her to use her kick from neutral. If she dashes forward it does the normal kick animation. If it's a side dash, she does something similar to Shinobi where she does a mini round house using the Naginata as a lift kicking in the direction she dashes. Whether the neutral opener would lead into a bleed or not, I have no idea. Probably not as that may make her opener too strong, but who am I to say. Can be done from forward or side dashes. - Give Nobushi dashes instead of dodges - As exlained above, dashes are essentially offensive dodges. Nobushi is meant to be the Hybrid Assassin, she should have better dashes than the rest of the hybrids to solidify her assassin role. - Kick follow up after any attack - Attacks like Cobra Strike and Viper's Retreat cannot be followed up with kick. It feels weird and out of place to not be allowed to use kick after these moves for a potential mix up. - Attacks with bleed on them apply 5 bleed on block - (not stackable: can't reapply until it has run out and a potential time limit until reapplication) - Way of the Shark passive applies to chip (only 10% instead of the normal 20%) - Synergizes with 5 bleed damage on block. Puts a strong emphasis on parrying Nobushi instead of just letting her hit you *Buffs* - Reduce stamina cost of hidden stance - Increase kick speed from 800ms to 600ms (both opener and follow up) - Nobushi's kick is MEANT to be part of her mix ups. However, it is SO slow, it will never hit against anyone competent, even if someone delays the kick. Speeding up the kick allows it to be used in more situations and more mix ups. - Sidewinder Form Speed increased to [100ms]+500ms from [100ms]+600ms (Essentially makes it 600ms instead of 700ms) - the [100ms] is the minimum dash time until the move can be preformed - Cobra Strike increased to [100ms]+400ms from [100ms]+500ms *Nerfs* - Dodging Kick rewards a guard break unless it's followed up with a light attack"

270,vulnerability,forhonor,Where Do You Think The Turtle Meta Changes Will Put Raider?,0,6ol9dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/6ol9dd/where_do_you_think_the_turtle_meta_changes_will/,2017-07-21 12:58:02,"DISCLAIMER: This is all just speculation, no way to see the changes in action yet. :3 I'll be honest here: I don't think Raider is gonna be very good after the  changes. Let's go through some notes and see how it affects Raider. 1. Parry Punishes. No more heavy after light parry is BIG danger to Raider's viability. This is where we get our damage from. 2. Parry ability when OOS. No parrying when OOS removes crucial Raider mind games when it comes to the unblockable. Sure, you can still bait a dodge and GB, but That costs so much more stamina. You'd have to ZA&gt;Feint&gt;GB&gt;Throw&gt;Punish. And punish can be anything from a light into zone or a heavy into zone. Your stamina is gonna be FUCKED. And that brings us to our next point. 3. Vulnerability when OOS. We all know how much stamina Raider's mixups cost. Out of any hero, we'll probably be the ones who sacrifice our stamina bar just to get that sweet punish on something that we already spent so much stamina to do. So, basically we get OOS a lot. And OOS seems to be a death sentence now, so shit. That's all. For reference, I main Warlord with 12 reps and I have 7 reps in Raider. I'd be happy to hear what you more experienced Raiders think about these changes."

100 health - Kick > Heavy Parry follow-up no longer knocks him to the ground but grants a punish #Nerfs - Range reduced - Sped up Range GB to be consistent with normal CGB timing Lemme know what you think, even tho I doubt it will be noticed "
272,vulnerability,forhonor,Berfs and Balance (IMO),0,6tnfme,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/6tnfme/berfs_and_balance_imo/,2017-08-15 02:11:46,"####Warden ###Buffs - Zone is no longer GB on block (it's 500ms, a fast attack but nearly every character has a 500ms or faster attack so it's not unfair) ###Nerfs - Reduce stagger on side lights to prevent being trapped in a SB vortex, allow enough time for a light attack to interrupt a SB if not canceled ###Moveset Alterations To create a less SB reliant Warden we can add moves that flow outside of SB, but that would require a rework ###Raider ###Buffs - Hyper armor on Top Heavies (situationally useful) and throwing a top heavy can finish any chain, leading right into the 55 damage Raider Fury finish - No untechable GB on Knee > Light wakeup ###Nerfs - Zone to tap now has to be input 200ms together, providing the same animation as the current Zone to Tap and can now be feinted all together (even the tap) - Stampede charge Stam increase, interuptable, and 700ms ####Kensei ###Buffs - Dodge recovery to that of Warlord - Helmsplitter adds stun - Second Zone swing 700ms unblockable w/ mix-up into Helmsplitter - Superior block dodges attacks always land - Increase run speed to match Warden ###Moveset Alterations - ""Saint's Strike"": Dash any direction + Zone equals an unblockable 600ms 360 attack that can be feinted ####Conqueror ###Buffs - Charged LVL2 Heavy unblockable - Hyperarmor side heavies with 180 arc (Remove Warlord's functional side heavy and give to Conq) - All raw heavies 35 damage - Hyperarmor after second light in infinite chain - Unparriable raw heavies - Full guard exit stamina recharge instant - LVL 2 Heavy damage 50 - (as an incentive to ever use a top light) Top lights stun out of chain 500ms - No untechable GB on Shield Charge Heavy wakeup ###Nerfs - Full guard enter cost increased - Remove GB on heavy block (still stops chains and Superior block still active) #Moveset Alterations Top Light* > Heavy ####Warlord ###Nerfs - Remove Side Heavy Hyper Armor - Heavy from Fullguard available on block only - Fullguard enter stamina increase and GB vulnerability for 200ms on enter - Dodge recovery increase to that of Kensei ###Moveset Alterations - Light > Light > Heavy ####Shoguki ###Buffs - Headbutt has knockback, can now shove and ledge - Oni Charge on OOS adds knockdown - Heavy cancel into headbutt (600 Ms) (dodge punish gives light) wiith no knockback so you can follow-up - Oni charge breaks all Hyperarmor if Shoguki has hyper armor, costs less, and drains stamina better - Removal of increased damage when Hyper Armor down - Headbutt can be used from Neutral, 600ms, 25 Stam drain, Dodge attack punish with HA, GB on Dodge without HA ###Nerfs - More consistent Hyper Armor Regen - Attacks that guarantee another attack go through Hyperarmor (Warden side, Shinobi Light, Peacekeeper Heavy) without being interrupted ###Moveset Alternations - Heavy cancel to Headbutt > Light - Light* > Light ####Peacekeeper ###Buffs - Deflect is instant and stops all chains, interrupts everything, and breaks HA ###Nerfs - Lights cost slightly more stamina - Blocking second light adds 300ms recovery ####Beserker ###Buffs - Every attacks flows into a chain infinitely until you run out of stam, making it so any attack can be used to start a chain and even top finisher can immediately go into more chains - Zone has fourth hit can be mixed into top heavy finisher - Dodge attack speed increase - Top lights have same speed - Dodge attacks can be mixed up to top now - Top Heavy finisher feinted into dodge to continue combo (currently Top Finish ends combo) - Slashing Rush has an unblockable every other attack and if held forward moves forward - While entering the third hit of combos the target gets ""Feared"" meaning blocking both costs stamina and you take increased chip damage (35%) and Beserker can continue his chain even if his attacks are blocked or evaded - When Opponent is OOS a head slicer will knock down the enemy if it connects (even on block) ###Nerfs - Removal of GB on Deflect, goes straight to zone with decrease Stam cost - Normalize feinting (some feinted attacks seem faster IMO) - Reduce the extra time Zerk gets from GB ####Orochi ###Buffs - Dodge attacks can be cancelled or mixed up into a dodge attack into another direction (both ending that move, so you can't dodge cancel until you run out of stamina) - Riptide Strike feintable and mix up into dodge attack - Storm rush chargable unblockable with Fullguard, drains stamina if held (think Tozen's unblockable Fullguard charge) - Heavy delfect executable - Zephyr Strike can start the end of a chain - 400ms Crosswind Slash chain finisher ###Nerfs - Top light damage to 25 - Limit ability to enter Storm rush again and again ####Lawbringer ###Buffs - Long Arm speed increase and guaranteed on Wallsplat for extra stamina drain - Shove on heavy block stamina drain increase - Light Riposte combo into unblockable finisher ###Nerfs - Remove unblockable light on Light Shove, keep the unblockable shove light on Heavy Shove ###Moveset Alterations Parry > Light Riposte > Heavy Finisher (not guaranteed) ####Valkyrie ###Buffs - No dash or leap GB on block - Shield bash can Wallsplat for Heavy - Shield tackle mix up into dodge attack - Shoulder pin acts purely as deflect (so it's not blocked) and is a 400ms unblockable that can chain into Spear sweep - Shield Bash higher stamina drain - Top heavy damage increase 35 - Second zone attack mix up into Spear sweep ###Nerfs - Slower dodge attack - Sweep dodge no longer a GB but a free 600ms attack ###Moveset Alternations - Light > Heavy > Light ####Nobushi ###Buffs - Swift recoil kick follow-up - Faster kick - Hidden Stance costs less and dodge stays active for 300ms ###Nerfs - Light bleed from kick does 20 damage - Increased Recovery times on zone ####Cent ###Nerfs - Kick stun removed (still gets a light) - Only Heavy finisher is a guaranteed charged jab (meaning no more insane Wallsplat or light Parry damage) - Wallsplat punish = Charged heavy - Max Parry punish GB or his Parry counter on both light and heavy parry - TRACKING FIXED AND RANGE ALTERED (Still very strong hero with mix ups but his damage accessiblity nerfed so he can't Charge Heavy -> Full Jab -> Eagle talon you from a Wallsplat, Light Parry, charged heavy, and his unblockable finisher) ####Shinobi ###Buffs - 100 health - Kick > Heavy Parry follow-up no longer knocks him to the ground but grants a punish ###Nerfs - Range reduced ###Moveset Alternations - Light > Light > Light - Light > Heavy > Light for bleed - Side Dash > Light (a proper dodge attack) Lemme know what you think Edit: Added missing Zerker Suggestions "

Wow!,4,6e5kf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/6e5kf7/shinobi_wow/,2017-05-30 16:04:12,"I'm not going to pretend that Centurion is well balanced but oh my gods is Shinobi just the definition of unfair. I cannot, for the literal life of me, defeat a good one. I attack her and she will double dodge, kick, and land a free hit on me. I try to dodge the kick but my reactions are too slow, I guess. Does anybody have advice for a fellow Centurion on how to properly engage her? Guard breaking her double dodge worked for awhile but now it isn't as reliable as the Shinobi mains are becoming more and more aware of that vulnerability. She's just so damned fast, guys. Any tips would be great. I love this game but I'm flustered rn. "

Because of this, I settle for the backhand strike, still cool &amp; shorter, but not my absolute preferred. I propose this: We can assign all executions (2 for each activation button) 50/50 shot for each of the executions assigned to that corresponding button. BUT The longer executions give you slightly more xp/renown/health regen. This would be great because it will give more to the players, but not too much where it would get taken advantage of.

275,vulnerability,forhonor,Solutions to Timezone Round Imbalances (Long),0,621b91,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/621b91/solutions_to_timezone_round_imbalances_long/,2017-03-29 05:45:04,"So, I've been thinking about how to potentially fix how round outcomes are determined from the perspective of inactive players at the end of the round. As we know, Samurai have won Round 3 (Congrats!). What confuses me is why the Samurai so far seem to come back in the final 10 hours or so of the Round. I think this is due to timezone differences (maybe there are more Samurai located in Asia than the other factions?). The very last moments of the Rounds are the most important. Total War Assets accrued and prior land holdings do not matter. I've thought of 2 similar ideas to try to fix this: - Lock War Asset gain for a round at each timezone's respective 12:00AM (00:00) on the day following the Round end (Region determined by your copy's region). The East Coast US is exactly 12 hours behind Hong Kong. While the round was concluding earlier today March 28th in the East Coast, the Round was concluding in the nighttime for Hong Kong. A significant chunk of the playerbase (Eastern US) was at work/school during these closing periods, and places close to Hong Kong were late at night, a time where the players there could play. This is how it could look (hypothetical). I have a North American copy of For Honor. Thus, the game I registered says I am in North America, and cuts my War Asset contribution to THAT ROUND off once I hit the end date April 30th 12:00AM. For someone in the EU, AU, etc. it would cut off at THEIR April 30th 12:00AM (00:00). The fault I see in this particular set up based off of your copy's region is that some people buy cross region for cheaper games, and have copies registered in regions they aren't geographically located in. - The second option is identical to the first, except a functionality for selecting your region IN GAME is added instead of using your copy's region. If you switch regions, you forfeit results for that round, just like if you switch factions. The vulnerability I see in this is that everyone could pick the time furthest from their own location to give themselves an edge in the faction war. For example, someone in Hong Kong could pick NA, and get roughly 12 more hours to compete than they should have, which is the exact same problem as before, just less people would be benefiting from their timezone. [Here is a graphic I made in 5 minutes in MS Paint.](URL The length of the bars denote time spent in round, the black lines in between each bar is the cutoff for THAT timezone, and the colors of each bar represent different timezones. As soon as 1 time zone ends it's round, the next one begins FOR THEM. This system still has the same flaw of whoever is on latest most likely wins the faction war, but it provides less time for those in an advantageous time zone to make such a huge difference in the final hours for players currently negatively affected by the stop time of the Rounds (me). This system would be pretty close to perfect if the Faction War accounted for total War Assets accrued, as the timezones all have equal time to play the Rounds. Lemme know what you think!"
276,vulnerability,forhonor,Valkyrie Flaws Compiled,5,5v2y2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/5v2y2k/valkyrie_flaws_compiled/,2017-02-20 16:55:03,"I know I have been bitching about it but i'm a bit tired of the 'you're trash' insults whenever I lose as a Valkyrie. An astrick will be included near the ones being fixed in the patch. Put more in comments. 1. SETUPS TAKE TOO MUCH STAMINA: In order for the valkyrie to get in a position where she can do decent damage with a chain, she must either GB &gt; headbutt &gt; Legsweep, which drains 1/2 the bar, or heavy &gt; feint to bash &gt; leg sweep, which drains 1/3. This dramatically inhibits the amount of damage that can be done. 2. SHOULDER PIN BLOCKABLE: The shoulder pin is not unblockable and can be blocked with fair ease. This means that, for all of the risk the valk took to pull off the pin, there was no reward. 3. CHAINS TOO SLOW:* Valkyrie's rely on chains to deal damage, as their attacks are like wet noodle slaps. However, her chains are so slow that they can be easily blocked and therefore stopped. 4. LONG RECOVERY TIME:* After being blocked, or missing, the valk is in a HUGE vulnerability state. It is a free light attack. This punishes the valkyrie for not even making a mistake. 5. LOW DAMAGE ATTACKS: Light attacks do less than 1/2 a bar, heavies do less than one bar. This is an outrage, seeing as how telegraphed the attacks are, and how slow they are chained. The patch will somewhat fix this, but it will only apply to the side and forward dashes. 6. NO GUARANTEE AFTER PARRY: If a Valkyrie parries, nothing, no shield bash no light attack, is guaranteed. Her range and recovery time is too bad for her to land a light, guard break, or shield bash in time. The opponent can easily get away in the time it takes the Valkyrie to take control of the fight. TL;DR: The Valkyrie cannot force mistakes, and cannot guarantee damage. It is incapable of doing significant damage after a mistake was made by the opponent, because it suffers from low damage and low stamina.

277,vulnerability,forhonor,Valkyrie Vs Nobushi,3,5v94wo,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/5v94wo/valkyrie_vs_nobushi/,2017-02-21 13:56:51," &gt;VALKYRIE: Crowd Control - Slight - Nobushi does have a fairly good kick and GB range. Light Attack Speed - Slight - Similar, but edge to Valkyrie. Defense - Significant - The unblockable stance for Valkyrie is fairly good, probably better than other classes because it can be sprung into a charge. &gt;TIES: Health - Same numerical Value Range Control - Both have an equal number of tools to keep their opponents in optimum range. &gt;NOBUSHI: Damage - Significant - Every single attack on the nobushi does far more than its equivalent on the Valkyrie. Recovery - Significant - When a Nobushi is blocked, or misses, she can fairly immediately proceede into another attack. When a Valkyrie Misses, there are quite a few frames of vulnerability, same for when a valkyrie is blocked. Range - Significant - The Valkyrie has about as half as much range as the Nobushi. Stamina - Moderate - Same numerical value, but half of a Valkyrie's stamina is spent setting up for an attack, using multiple moves that consume 1/4 to 1/3 in order to deal damage. Heavy Attack Speed - Significant - There is a significant difference between the speed of a Valkyrie's heavy attack, and a Nobushi's heavy attack. Bleed - Monsterous - The Nobushi has quite a few viable ways to apply a bleed to its opponent, the Valkyrie has only one non-viable way to apply a bleed to its opponent. To me, it seems like Valkyrie is a worse nobushi, with an ability to pop a defense mode that can prolong a match, but against a proficient opponent is not enough to change the result. Take as you will."
278,vulnerability,forhonor,For Honor; The Player's Dictionary,30,5vn7jn,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/5vn7jn/for_honor_the_players_dictionary/,2017-02-23 12:47:03,"Preface; Hello, residents of For Honor! After watching the forums and seeing people ask about terms that we use to describe in-game moves, I've decided to create a dictionary for us to use that new players can refer to before diving into our forums. Please feel free to add terms in the comments below, and I'll add them! **THE FOR HONOR DICTIONARY** *The Basics* * **Light Attack** - A quick, short range attack that deals a small amount of damage in return for speed. * **Heavy Attack** - A slow, hard-hitting attack that trades speed for increased damage to an opponent, causing them to stumble. * **Combat Stance** - A stance taken by your character or an opponent, with one of three options; top, left, and right. Some characters have a ""hidden"" stance. * **Block** - The act of deflecting an enemy's attack through one of the three combat stances. Does not block *all* damage from a heavy attack. Different than a *parry*. Blocks drain stamina from the attacker if successful. *Intermediate Actions* * **Parry** - The act of blocking an enemy's attack with a deflection from your weapon; this is different from a *block*, as it causes the opponent to stumble. You take no damage from a parry if successful. Most of the time, a successful parry guarantees a light attack as followup. * **Unblockable** - A type of attack usable by nearly all classes, marked by the enemy glowing bright orange with a specific symbol with the appearance of a broken shield. **NOTE**; Unblockable does *NOT* mean unparryable - you can still parry some heavy unblockable attacks. * **Dodge** - The act of using your dodge to avoid an attack rather than blocking it, at cost to stamina. Useful to avoid unblockable, unparryable attacks * **Guard Break/GB** - The act of ""breaking"" an opponents guard by grabbing them. This can be countered by the opponent who may ""counter guard break"" by pressing the same button when prompted. Successful Guard Breaks can lead into combo moves * **Throw** - The act of forcible moving an opponent after a successful guard break. An enemy can be thrown FORWARD, BACKWARD, LEFT, and RIGHT. Throwing an opponent off the edge will instantly kill them, as well as throwing them into hazards such as spikes. * **Feint** - The action of cancelling a heavy attack mid-animation to confuse your opponent. Useful to attack an opponent who is able to successfully counter guard break multiple times. * **Zone Attack** - An attack that drains half your stamina, but will hit in a wide arc. Executed by pressing the Light Attack and Heavy Attack button at the same time. *Player-Given Lexis* * **Wall Stun** - When you throw an opponent into a wall (or another player) to cause them to enter a prolonged state of vulnerability. * **Daze** - Refers to abilities that cause your screen to flash white and your HUD to disappear briefly (Much like a flash-bang grenade from other games). * **Vortex** - The act of causing an opponent to ""guess"" what your next move will be. Characters such as Warden and Conqueror have effective Vortexes that allow you to keep your opponent guessing, and unable to predict your next move. * **Mixup** - Constantly changing your tactics and attacks in an effort to keep your opponent from realizing your attack pattern. * **Teching** - Cancelling an opponents guard break or action. * **Frames** - The issue that arises from the game's animations, causing attacks to miss/hit irregularly and cause unintentional behavior in the game. Attacks have active frames and inactive frames, active being when the attack can hit and inactive usually preceding and following the actives when the attack will not hit. * **Halberd** - Poleaxe * **Poleaxe** - The most versatile weapon *Community Credit;* * **ProblmSolvd** (Frames) * **TheGreyDwarf** (Daze, Wall Stun)"
279,vulnerability,forhonor,Balance Ideas for Dominion/Elimination,1,5y2w8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/5y2w8h/balance_ideas_for_dominionelimination/,2017-03-08 06:41:21,"Hey, i put some Ideas that i had, for sometime tell me what you think about them **!!Guard Break changes!!** (2) **-GB counter have bigger window time when hit by non primary target.** **-After GB counter theres no vulnerability time.** (It means that after success gb counter you still have possibility to block dmg from side, e.g. you succesfully countered gb on enemy from side and you are still in middle of pushing back animation but can put your guard on left side and block primary target heavy left) Sory its really technical change and cant explain it better but it would benefit good players and made some windows for gear balance change and thats where we get to the next idea. **!!Gear Balance Changes!!** (1) **-Effectivness of gear should be nerfed by a lot and the ones that actually benefit other kind of playstyle should stay or at least be bit less efficient to not make them primary** (e.g. Revenge builds-big nerf, regeneration after execution-Good and should be buffed e.g. after you execute someone while being high on hp get extra barrier off of it by value of 50% of the healing) nerf to revenge build is essential because its makes someone unkillable and make it unplayable in 2v1 (for 2 enemies) (after getting revenge and have Revenge mode defense and duration to the max opponent is really unkillable) **!!Change for Buffs!!** **-Elimination change: buffs spawn after sometime, and balance buff because some are just inferior to others** best comparision would be Regeneration to Barrier-Barrier is superior in every way it doesent have cast time just instant 100% hp more compared to regeneration that gives around half of it, it is overtime. There is 1 essential and 3 other changes to buffs on elemination that i think off it would made them actually good addition not frustrating i will list them. **--Essential change would be to nerf viability of them**, whatever of what changes are below e.g Barrier should give e.g. 1/3 of hp, Dmg buff should give 10% more dmg etc not game breaking and quality of them should be equal and make for some strategic decision. **1 Variation-** Buffs spawn after X time into match just like in skirmish **2 Variation-** **Buffs only works for losing team e.g 2v4 and these 2 players can use it the way as it is in normal mode.** there could be limit like if theres 1 player difference you still cant grab them it can be many variance best would be to gather more data (could be game breaking for people that let theyr teammate die just to gather them) **3 Variation-**Delete them (easiest way for now they bring nothing to the mode and make it actually hard for people that try to fight not run away at the start) Tldr: Gear Viability nerf by a lot, Balance to Gb, Variation to Buff changes in Elimination. Sory for sure its pretty bad wroten post but i wanted to give my insight on some things that makes the game frustrating for many players and changes that could make it way more fun to play with."
280,vulnerability,forhonor,Tips from a decent player.,7,5r9ez2,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/5r9ez2/tips_from_a_decent_player/,2017-02-01 04:03:17,"From my marathon of playing the beta, here are some tips that I have used with much success. - When someone is out of stamina, charge them and guard break/throw. Your opponent will most likely be trying to distance them-self due to their vulnerability, and a throw will send them to the ground, giving you an opportunity to use your most damaging attack without fail. *BONUS* - if their stamina is still out after the above, repeat. - A good combo when close is a quick light attack + guard break + light attack + guard break + light attack + heavy attack. Unless they roll away (which pretty much never happened to me), this combo can take a huge chunk out of their health, and most of the time, they'll be expecting another guard break, so the heavy attack at the end almost always lands. *BONUS* - Heroes with a quick zone attack (like the Warden) can also take another chunk out right after the heavy - just be weary of your stamina. - Try to parry as much as you can, especially on highly predictable heavy attacks. You'll be able to perform a free attack (light mostly) AND their stamina will drop substantially. *BONUS* - Obvious unavoidables (Kensei's down attack, Raider's sweep) can be parried pretty easily - don't be afraid! - Be aware of each hero's sprinting attack when not in guard mode (like the PK's guard break sprint, Warden's running slash) so you can start a fight with the upper-hand whether it's a free hit or an evasion - When facing two or more opponents *Rush to a ledge in hopes of getting an easy kill to even the playing field by throwing off an opponent *Focus on blocking and keeping your distance. Most players will start flailing attacks at you if it's one of you vs. 2+ of them, making it easy to fill your revenge meter, but you must be weary of those who wise-up and try to go for a guard break, so distance is key. - Have a plan and execute it. In the earlier stages of online play, it's easy to be overly-hesitant in your plan of action. Know which combo to go into and know how to predict your enemies. ex. start off a duel/whatever with a non-guard sprinting attack, expect to parry or block their attack, go into the guard break light attack combo, and then wait to recover some stamina. Their health will be basically depleted all in a few seconds."
