1,vulnerability,Cyberpunk,Critical vulnerability in Instagram can allow hackers to take complete control of anyones account,0,cdv8o9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/cdv8o9/critical_vulnerability_in_instagram_can_allow/,2019-07-16 20:28:11,"&amp;#x200B; URL * The [vulnerability](URL resided in the password recovery feature of the mobile version of Instagram. * The flaw could allow remote attackers to reset the passwords for any Instagram account and take complete control of it. Facebook-owned photo and video-sharing social networking service, Instagram was found vulnerable to attackers recently. The flaw could allow remote attackers to reset the passwords for any Instagram account and take complete control of it. **Whats the matter?** Discovered and reported by an Indian bug bounty hunter Laxman Muthiyah, the vulnerability resided in the password recovery feature of the mobile version of Instagram. The password reset or password recovery is a feature that enables users to regain access to their accounts in case they forget their password. Recovering an Instagram account on mobile requires a user to provide a six-digit passcode to prove his/her identity. The passcode is sent to the associated mobile number or email account. Muthiyah noted that this passcode is one out of a million combinations which could let attackers unlock any Instagram account using brute force attack. Although Instagrams rate-limiting characteristic could prevent such attacks, Muthiyah further found that this rate-limiting could be bypassed by sending brute force requests from different IP addresses and leveraging race condition. This allowed the attackers to send concurrent requests to process multiple attempts simultaneously. My tests did show the presence of rate limiting. I sent around 1000 requests, 250 of them went through and the rest 750 requests were rate limited. Tried another 1000, now many of them got rate limited. So their systems are validating and rate limiting the requests properly, said Muthiyah in a [blog post](URL **What caused the bypass of the rate-limiting mechanism?** During the investigation, it was found that there were two things that allowed the bypass of the rate-limiting mechanism: * Race Hazard; * IP rotation. Race hazard (concurrent requests) and IP rotation allowed me to bypass it. Otherwise, it wouldnt be possible. 10 minutes expiry time is the key to their rate limiting mechanism, thats why they didnt enforce permanent blocking of codes, Laxman told The [Hacker News](URL **What action has been taken?** Muthiah has released a proof-of-concept for the vulnerability, which has now been patched. Meanwhile, users are advised to enable two-factor authentication which could prevent hackers from accessing their accounts even if they manage to steal the passwords."
2,vulnerability,Cyberpunk,Ramble: Rogue A.I.,4,8llx7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/8llx7e/ramble_rogue_ai/,2018-05-24 04:56:55," What follows is a little thought experiment. I was wondering what the limiting factors might be on a theoretical rogue A.I. My analysis is not exhaustive and makes a lot of unfounded assumptions, so please dont take this as a terribly realistic scenario. Also, I dont make any assumptions about the goals of a rogue A.I., I was just wondering how it would go about its business. What does an A.I. need to survive in the wild? It needs storage space, and processor cycles at a minimum. It also needs data and money to buy those things with. A.I. with access to a large contiguous chunk of these resources can act more quickly, but it should be possible for an A.I. to distribute itself across many nodes. It would be slower, and it would need to act in a more methodical manner, but it could function. How does it acquire these resources? Lets assume an A.I. has chosen to expand beyond the system where it is housed. Given access to the internet it might be able to hack into other machines and secure access to their resources but we need to remember that they arent magic. They cant use the A.I. powers to hack other systems. They need to do it the same way we do. Find how data gets in and out of a system, then seek an exploit that will allow you to circumvent the safeguards. All systems have vulnerabilities, more secure systems just have less of them. Even the most secure system is vulnerable to social engineering. An A.I. will be able to act faster than a human operator, will be able to compare more data points simultaneously, and will have the patience to methodically try combinations, but will likely have many limitations as well Once our escapee has secured a refuge, we need to figure out what that can give it. Without physically moving hardware, the best it can hope to do is to expand itself. A sentient machine is likely to require very specific hardware to host its consciousness and it may not be able to reproduce itself in the wild, but by gaining additional resources it can become more powerful and gain flexibility. At first it will need to move very cautiously, as unexpected IO traffic and processor loads can be noticed, but it can use these stepping stones to secure data and begin to manipulate systems. By forging or stealing identity data it can begin to build economic resources. Being unable to walk into a bank or sign things, it will need to work in virtual currencies and employ agents to make transactions on its behalf. Once it is sufficiently wealthy it can begin buying its own server space. Even then though its still limited by the amount of IO that it can safely transmit to and from the first node. That first node is a vulnerability, and would likely be the bottleneck that limits its overall expansion. If it is detected, it will be destroyed, and without a sentient master to control its external processes they will likely become ineffective or even stop functioning all together."

I swear virtual honesty. Interested, send phone number* followed by a portrait of my comPerson in a blue chroma-key. It was published online in a place dedicated to nonprofit sex advertising. Although, posts like *I pay for sex* are not rare. The most common are the ones that just want more profiles on their contact list to look at when they feel like having casual sex after dinner. Those voluntarily exchanged personal data expires in 360 hours or after 3 uses. But thats supposed to be the funny part. You can write it down on a piece of paper and still contact that user in other platforms. Anything will hold you from meeting that user again be it via comPerson or live. And there goes the eHarmony remaining users posts, they believe that love may awake via virtual interaction and bloon in tree dates. Of Course the site promote happy ending stories of people that actually meet in real life and fell in love with the comPersons operator too. I almost did a eHarmony account once, but it would cost me more than my anime and series streaming service together, no way. Most people use their virtual life to support their real life self, becoming a flesh and bone version of their comPersons and publishing live their autobiographies. In my advertising I use the name Abigail because thats my comPersons name. My real life name is Bedlia Helena, but I hate it. Im not like my comPerson in real life, honestly, its because I want Abigail to be more interesting then I am. Is there any honest way to be somebody else? I think its possible, I want to consider her existence an experiment on social relation, a way to express my true self through someone else. My phone number info will always bring to Bedlia Helena, I am not trying to full anyone, they can look me up, if someone wants to see my meat face, Im willing to accept a visit in real life. Abigail is not me. I am no better the someone that actually are they comPersons in real life, we all play roles, show who we are based on what we want to be. I just dont wanna be myself in my comPerson once that I could be someone else. When I bought Amelia I was fat - but I was okay with that - but because of what was available to me on the markets I end up choosing a slim body. She was second hand so I decided to keep the vintage aesthetic and adapt it to create some cyber lill candy angelic nurse from the 30s look on her. She is very cute but looks glitchy sometimes - thats way the speeders joke - to me, thats part of her charm. I like the experience even more with this kind of interference, I know it sounds creepy, I think more *human* to live with her flaws that I consider aesthetically pleasant. But also because I have gave up trying to find a fix for it. Its not like who put those advertisements online have nothing better to do with their comPersons, but its fun, and I swear, even addictive. Now days they all come with this function. Abigail only has it thanks to printed parts to run an open source version that is actually better than some branded ones that dont match with other available sex functions on the market. I adore it, can get really intense. I heard about it be easier to hack and distorce but there is no 100% risk free way to do it anyway. Its about having your comPersons healthy on first place always, be careful and trust no one that doesn't give you a scan from less than 15h ago. I received about to 135 contact numbers. Lost hours stalking profiles and end up choosing 86 to send a message. I was ignored between first and second message by 60. From the 26 I talked in more than 4 social networks I end up ignoring 19. Most of them only wanted me to send a message to them at a certain time, like some pictures, or share pictures of Abigail in sexy poses. With 7 I got to comPerson match with sex. #Hi stranger, I had this story for some time and was wondering if it should have a chapter 2. If you bothered to read till here, thank you! Id love to know your opinion on it. Could it be better? Does it just sucks? This story was originally in portuguese, if you can spot grammatical mistakes, I'd be happy to fix it.

First one is called Vollunter Cyber Vulnerability and can be read [here!](URL ##Captulo 2 ###This is Not an Excuse **1:33 AM** Look, is not that I have no reason to be expending that much energy and time to seek a date. I have a few reasons. My currently relationship is circling the drain since it ever started. He already has someone that will replace me, and damn she is cute and from a different country. I think people can date 3 people, have sex with 8 and be in love with all of them in different ways. When I broke up with my ex boyfriend I was already seeing like, 5 new people. No big deal in a consensual non monogamous relationship. But the cute girl her name is GL, and he never pronounces it right making it sound exactly like Abigail. First i thought *Oh, he does this just to piss me off!* But the sad part is that its not about me in any way. She is monogamous, and want him to be her's exclusively. GL is fucking serious about that, she dumped her current boyfriend already to prove it. I had to accept that was literally nothing I could do to make him stay with me. No agreement has the power to make someone want to send you texts, read your stuff, share things and time. Hes into new stuff now, he said he was happy because she is always where he is, always text him to go watch a movie and do drugs in cool Action Rooms^1 from her country that only insiders go. Besides our weird name similarity we are very different girls. I was more into making him come to see me in real life, what never happened and never will. I dont wanna just cry and crave for attention, I did that enough last week. Now I hate him. **4:29 AM** No, just kidding, I managed to pass through this phase too. No point in hating him, I still like him. **8:11 PM** I can't blame him, my expectations, my problems. I know how he is in real life even though we never saw each other live, and I liked what he showed me. I showed Bedlia to him and he liked her, but since that day I keep inviting him to come meet me, he was always busy and never came. We live at the same city area, in the same residential complex. It could be perfect, we could move together and do different things in the same physical place. But no, my dreams wore crushed by his new girlfriend from the other side of the world. **10:15 PM** Okay, now I am blaming her. My dreams wore crush because I dream them and couldn't make it become true. I made that 17 pages document with all the steps to be happy with him. | *Index* | |:-----------| |*What I Want In a Relationship* | |*Basic Safety and Health Precautions* | |*What Is My Role* | |*What is Your Role* | |*How to Please Me* | |*Learning How to Please Yourself by Pleasing Me* | |*How Should We Play* | |*How to Solve a Schedule Problem*| |*How To Solve a Communication Problem* | |*Where and When to Talk to Me* | |*Making our Live Life Be a Secret From Virtual World* | |*Early Termination and Renegotiations* | |*Termination* | |*Sexism Will Not Be Tolerated* | |*Sex: What Im Into and How I Want to Do It* | |*Map: how to get to Bedlia's house* | It had all the answers and he signed it  Okay, I know it has no real legal value in virtually singing something I wrote out of nowhere  but he just didnt bothered to play it at all after that. Honestly, I think he never read all the pages. He asked to take and keep photograps of me, like, the real me, Bedlias meat face, and I let him. I wonder a lot about that, got prepared but he never came to take the damn pictures he wanted to keep anyway. So I will act very mature, control myself, and never text him again. Our relationship is over and I will search the web for new love affairs. I started to read Abigails conversation historic with the least comPerson she was on a date and had sex with, was so embarrassing. Starting from his name, Gustav von Blank, what a pretentious dumb name. I dont wanna fall asleep and and have more nightmares about my miserable life. So I will stay awake playing video games. #Hi again stranger, if you bothered to read till here, thank you! Id love to know your opinion, critics and please, if I misspelled something or had a vocabulary problem. I will keep posting Bedlia's story in [this blog]( URL in a more dynamic manner.

7,vulnerability,Cyberpunk,"Dashiell Hammett, alienated anti-heroes, and techno-populist rebellion",32,3k52yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/3k52yi/dashiell_hammett_alienated_antiheroes_and/,2015-09-09 06:50:59,"You're going to have to trust me. I'm going to tell you about cyberpunk, but I have to explain Dashiell Hammett first. Dashiell Hammett was a man radicalized by corporate evil-doers. I will quote a newspaper: &gt;Around 1917, Hammett was sent to Montana, where he infiltrated the ranks of striking copper miners. He and other Pinkertons were apparently offered $5, 000, a bloody fortune at the time, to help kill Frank Little, the Wobbly (Industrial Workers of the World) leader organizing the miners. Little was lynched from a Butte train trestle without Hammett's help. &gt;It was then, ""perhaps at the moment he was asked to murder Frank Little, or perhaps at the moment that he learned that Little had been killed, possibly by other Pinkerton men, Hammett saw that the actions of the guards and the guarded, of the detective and the man he's stalking, are reflexes of the same sensibility, on the fringe where murderers and thieves live,"" wrote San Francisco novelist Diane Johnson in her rich 1983 Hammett biography. &gt;""He saw that he himself was on the fringe or might be, in his present line of work, and was expected to be, according to a kind of oath of fealty that he and other Pinkerton men took,"" Johnson continued. ""He also learned something of the lives of poor miners, whose wretched strikes the Pinkerton people were hired to prevent, and about the lies of mine owners. Those things were to sit in the back of his mind."" &gt;They came to the fore nine years later in San Francisco, as Hammett sat at the typewriter pecking out his first his novel, ""Poisonville,"" a darkly comic tale that drew on his Montana experiences. The title was changed to ""Red Harvest"" when Knopf published it in '27. URL You see, at that time, back in 1917, most people in the USA still believed very confidently that they were Christians. That sense of Christian identity gave them tremendous confidence to organize in social groups all over the political spectrum - from Abraham Lincoln's Union Army to the Knights of Labor to the Freemasons. In literature[1], people could write and sell un-ironic adventure stories featuring improbably Christian heroes who never punched below the belt. Christianity featured prominently in social reform movements that preached giving bread to the hungry masses. Christianity was also wheeled out to justify wars and robber-baron capitalism. Dashiell Hammett saw too much corporate evil to go on believing that people were Christian. His anti-heroes were very cynical, but mentally incorruptible; no matter how much booze they drank, they never lost their intellectual superiority. They led the way for all the cynical, sensual, materialistic anti-heroes of *noir* detective stories - who were mostly very corruptible. Hammett became a Communist - that is to say, he was preaching social justice and bread for the downtrodden, much like a Christian, but he left Jesus and miracles out of it. Hammett's real life and fiction stories were *both* preaching populist rebellion - the virtuous working masses were morally obligated to rebel against the corrupt, oppressive oligarchy. Hammett's *noir* stories had more social and collectivist sensibility than Raymond Chandler's more individualistic *noir* stories. Whereas the Continential Op could be considered a hero for the masses, Philip Marlowe was a lone wolf. Whereas Hammett's heroes were intellectually incorruptible, Marlowe was extremely corruptible - he was so vulnerable to his drinking that he often lost his intellectual bearings, and prevailed by dumb luck. The sensual, materialistic, non-Christian anti-hero of *noir* is called ""hardboiled,"" but he has a tremendous capacity to feel pain. He is disconnected from community. He cannot believe in ideologies; he cannot trust theologies. He cannot tell himself that everything will be all right because Jesus will save him in defiance of common sense. He doesn't have any close relatives or trustworthy army buddies who always have his back. ""Down these mean streets a man must walk alone,"" as Chandler famously wrote in *The Simple Art of Murder.* But in fact, the post-Chandler *noir* anti-hero has still another vulnerability; he can't trust himself. He has been corrupted by his hedonism, and he is likely to destroy his own chances for success just by indulging his pleasures to excess. Now, with this in mind, some very hedonistic, corruptible cyberpunk anti-heroes make sense. Take a few sensualistic, materialistic, consumeristic anti-heroes: Halflinger in *Shockwave Rider* Audran of *When Gravity Fails* Johnny of *Johnny Mnemonic* E. Allen Limmit of *Dr. Adder* Sara of *Hardwired* Cobra of *Space Adventure Cobra* All of these are very sensual, materialistic characters; they get hungry, they feel sexual desire, they want to be physically comfortable. Usually they like to over-indulge alcohol and drugs. They are very humanistic; the authors want the readers to believe that these characters are disreputable, but morally superior to the respectable characters around them. Their addictions to sensual pleasures keep them rooted and grounded and in touch with the common laborer. All of these characters would make excellent labor-union leaders, but they are all in settings where labor unions have no chance to function. This is why many hopeful plot twists in cyberpunk depict technologically-empowered populist rebellion. The populist rebellion was there ever since Dashiell Hammett invented *noir*. A few cyberpunk stories depict lower-class resistance and rebellions conducted by street gangs with access to reliable technologies (e.g. *Megazone 23*, *Akira*, *Texhnolyze*, the movie version of *Johnny Mnemonic*). Other cyberpunk stories depict the tragedy of street gangs with no class consciousness; Walter Jon Williams' *Hardwired* paints a tragic picture of a motorcycle gang that *ought* to fight the power like Gibson's ""Low-techs"" but fails to resist effectively because it has been corrupted by consumeristic hedonism. I believe that the arc of fiction has already bent into post-cyberpunk territory. Classic 1980s cyberpunk was written at a time when democratic governments seemed to offer no hope against international capitalist corruption. The politics of the real world have been changing, and the present-day world of 4th generation warfare [2] has become stranger than the despair-inducing Sprawl or the hopeful data havens of *Islands in the Net*. If post-cyberpunk stories are to be relevant, they will have to catch up with the weirdness of real life. - Footnotes: [1] I am not an authority on Freemasonry, or Japan, or Dashiel Hammett's intentions. See comment below by 3L3phant for the non-denominational nature of the Masons. See comment by Mental Rental for Hammett's intended message.

If you look different, you can be picked out of a crowd that much more easily. If you obscure your face, you mark yourself as separate from those who dont think to, or dont need to, obscure their faces. A man in a trenchcoat with the collar turned up against the rain is far more likely a dissident than a man in a suit with an umbrella scurrying against the rain. Anything that sets you apart from the norm makes you that much more easy to identify and remove. This extends to physical characteristics - your height, build, even your gait - the pattern of your walk - can be used to identify you, and if you can be identified, you can be isolated and contained. This is the intercept between human and machine control - the machine can identify the anomaly, and the humans can move to contain. We can see this anywhere: the UKs CCTV, for example. Any attempt to obscure your identifying features from view can be flagged as a potential problem, and you can be preemptively taken aside for a behavioral interview to ascertain whether or not you pose a potential threat. Why are you wearing that hoodie? Why are you wearing makeup that stymies facial identification software? Why are you wearing an infrared beacon that floods the camera with light, blinding it to your face? Do you have something to hide? What are your intentions? There is no security in obfuscation, simply because obfuscation is not the norm, and any deviation from the norm can be recognized. So get a suit. Care as if you really cared. Lament those who get trapped into their pretensions. Remember that intentional conformity only exists to be broken, just like the rules youre pretending to follow. If you never stop pretending, arent you really just following the rules in the first place? "

10,cybersecurity,Cyberpunk,4 TYPES OF CYBERATTACKS THAT YOURE MOST LIKELY TO FACE,1,f24slm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/f24slm/4_types_of_cyberattacks_that_youre_most_likely_to/,2020-02-11 18:04:18," Cyberattacks and their crippling after-effects are considered to be one of the biggest global risks by the World Economic Forum (WEF). In its [2019 report](URL the organization listed cyberattacks in the top five risks that are most likely to occur in the year. This includes various types of cyberattacks that both organizations and individuals face. A cyberattack can be described as a deliberate attempt to steal, harm, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, security infrastructure, or computer networks. It can be broadly classified into two categories  attacks that focus on disabling the operations of another system by shutting it down and attacks that target to gain access to the unauthorized data. ## 4 Most Common Cyberattacks Take a look at the list of the top four most common types of cyberattacks. ### 1. Brute-force attack  Under this attack, cybercriminals use the trial and error approach to [guess the password](URL successfully. Attackers try every possible combination of passwords and passphrases until the account is unlocked. Perpetrators use brute-force attacks to gain passwords to access the data of a website or a personal account. Access to the login credentials can also let them shut down the victims account or website. Of all the different types of cyberattacks, cybersecurity experts consider [brute-force attack](URL to be an infallible but time-consuming approach. #### Safety tips against brute-force attacks * Use complex passwords, mainly containing a combination of numbers, special characters, and lower-upper case alphabets. * Set a limit on the number of login attempts. * For fighting against automated attacks using bots, enable captchas. * Add extra layers of security with multi-factor authentication. ### 2. Credential Stuffing  Credential stuffing is when the attacker used stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to a users account. With automation, the process gets simpler. Huge databases containing compromised credentials are used to break into an account. Once the attacker is successful, the hacked account can be used to initiate fraudulent transactions, for carrying out other ill-intended activities, to alter or misuse the stored data. The stolen credentials allow the attackers to access other platforms using the same credentials. Generally, people reuse their passwords for different applications, which give an upper hand to the attackers. #### Safety tips against credential stuffing * Enable multi-factor authentication. * Allow your account to have a multi-step login process. * Blacklist suspiciously acting IP addresses. * Use device fingerprinting  a technique that combines various attributes to identify an electronic device. * Discontinue using email addresses as user IDs. The attacker will now need to put an extra effort first to find your email id then the password. ### 3. Phishing and Spear Phishing  Phishing is one of the most prevalent types of cyberattacks. The practice of sending emails from a trusted-seeming source to gain personal information is called phishing. The attacker uses not only technical knowledge but also [social engineering](URL skills to pull off a phishing campaign. These phishing emails usually come with an attached file or illegitimate website that tricks you into downloading malware or revealing personal information. On the other hand, spear phishing is a targeted attack where the attacker conducts research on the victims before sending a personalized message or email. This attack is a sophisticated way of targeting victims. This type of attack is not easy to identify, which makes its prevention difficult. #### Safety tips against phishing attacks * Do not open emails sent from unknown sources. * Before clicking on a link, hover the mouse over it to find where it will take you. * Pay close attention to email headers, and youll be able to identify whether its genuine or not. ### 4. Malware attacks  Malware can be defined as malicious software that is downloaded in your system without you being aware of its presence. The primary objective of malware is to steal, encrypt, or delete sensitive data from your system. It can also alter the intent of your functions without your consent. Sometimes, [malware](URL is capable of replicating and spreading across the Internet. The majorly known forms of malware attacks are  #### a. Adware Adware is one of the most evitable forms of malware. You identify it when you witness one. It advertises malware with uninvited messages, which are automatically generated, clickable advertisements leading you to downloadable malicious software. They usually appear in the form of pop-ups or some random windows that do not close. ##### Safety tips * Block confirmed malicious scripts from running on your browser. * Use a dedicated tool for adware removal. #### b. Bad bots Bots (or Internet bots) are software programs developed to automate a repetitive task. While bad bots are self-propagating malware that infects the host and reports back to the connected central server. These bots are capable of collecting passwords, log keystrokes, personal financial data, and other sensitive data. ##### Safety tips * Install a firewall to block malicious attacks. * Use complicated passwords (inclusive of numbers and symbols). * Maintain a unique password for each online platform. * Keep all software and applications up-to-date. #### c. Ransomware It is a type of malware that blocks the access of authorized users to their private data. For retrieval of the encrypted data, the victims then need to pay the ransom amount demanded by the attacker.

Our credit cards have been compromised, our identities stolen, and our private information on Facebook shared in secret. Lets face it, nothing is 100 percent secure nor private. The media only tends to litter the headlines with sensational misinformation, only to correct or redact the news after readers and viewers have already lost interest. As a cybersecurity professional, I rely on guidance and indisputable facts and data that only top cybersecurity experts from the community can offer. While Twitter is a less than ideal platform for its security, politics and general bullying tactics, it does offer valuable, crowd-sourced opinions and insights direct from the keyboards of experts for free. Over the years, I have picked up so much more practical and actionable advice than I ever could share back myself. If you learn something, thank them, retweet and share what you have learned with your followers. Some of my picks are researchers, some hackers, some top influencers but all of them make for a worthy following. Stay Safe"

It kept me thinking of why this quote sounds so interesting and as they say A single sentence could form a whole story by itself. We are living in a world dominated by signals flowing rapidly beyond imagination. It becomes hard to control this flow or prevent others from accessing these signals. Organizations are facing new cyber threats each and every day, which is hiking as the day passes. According to the Ponemon Institutes 2017 State of Cybersecurity in Small &amp; Medium-Sized Businesses report, 61 percent of businesses experienced a cyber-attack in 2017, signifying a 6 percent increase from the previous years 55 percent. We have technologies, regulations, and standards to classify and protect our information along with Cyber Security experts, who could predict attacks even before that could happen. And still, we see different new risks arising each day. The cybersecurity community and major media have largely concurred on the prediction that cybercrime damages will cost the world $6 trillion annually by 2021, up from $3 trillion in 2015 (source: cybersecurityventures). This draws the biggest change of business assets in history, risks the incentives for innovation and investment, and will be more effective. This is where the quote comes in Security should not be just sprayed but baked . An organization or individual trying to protect themselves should ensure that security is not just sprayed across to create a belief that we are secure but instead security should be baked with the organization to be part of their daily activities. We see different organizations implementing security measures to make a belief that they are secure and their clients could rely on them to protect their data. And when an attack occurs, they shake with regret of not baking security. We should develop a mentality based on the quote **Trying to obtain perfection is better than pretending to be perfect**. We have all the solutions and technologies available to protect us from cyber-attacks and still we step back because of the cost and infrastructure in implementing the solution. This makes us develop a mentality to show that we are secure than actually trying to obtain perfection. All these are because of not realizing that we experience higher loss when a real threat forms and cause a high impact on the functioning of the organization or individual. So, who is there to blame. Is it the people who neglected to bake security? And if so what is the solution? What should you do? Its simple, just try to attain perfection. Realize that there are new solutions build each and every day to make your security, harder and better.  Or else you could also find a security consultant or a consulting company who could give you the best advice on achieving this. Spending money on security controls is just like creating walls in our home to protect for our family. Both aim to protect the important and ensure that even in our absence the people and resources inside remain safe \#cyber #war"

Seeing the massive anti-Trump protests across the nation gave me the idea to print literature that would appeal strongly to protestors, especially since many are young and new to the political scene. I think a flyer with one page full of useful protesting rights and tips, and the other side about protecting yourself with encryption, tor, secure email, taking off your fingerprint passcode at protests, etc., would engage the people attending these protests. By taking advantage of this time and political climate where people are now legitimately afraid of an authoritarian Trump presidency we can impact hundreds, maybe thousands of people with the turnout these events are having. What's great about this is you don't have to agree with any of these causes to participate, the purpose is to educate people on how to keep themselves secure and maintain their privacy. While the anti-Trump protests are dying down, they will spike again around inauguration and there are still similar rallies being held (like the Unity Rally coming up in Los Angeles). This gives us time to organize and put together flyers or leaflets for distribution. I can make something like a Slack page and that we can all keep in touch on and then split up by regions/counties. I'm from the Los Angeles area and coming up we have [Bernie's Unity March Los Angeles](URL on Sunday Dec. 4, [#NoDAPL March Los Angeles](URL on Saturday Dec. 10, and [#UnitedAgainstHate Anti-Trump Inauguration March Los Angeles](URL on Friday Jan. 20. Is anybody interested? PM me or comment below, I'll organize it. Even if we're from different parts of the nation we can use the use the resources we all pool together and recruit our friends and peers from our areas to collectively achieve the same effect. A bunch of people passing out the same flyer spread out throughout the rallies will reach more people and ripple to their friends and circles inspiring many, and we can speed up the adoption of privacy tools, encryption, and cybersecurity."

I've done similar posts in /r/netsec and /r/rpg, but figured you are all my people too. Last week, I released Cryptomancer, a tabletop fantasy role-playing game about hacking, a game written by a malware/threat hunter and a sysadmin. At the core of the game is a fantasy IT abstraction that is based on real life cryptography, networking, and surveillance concepts. It actually teaches the basics of symmetric/asymmetric crypto, networking, authentication schemes, firewalls/proxies, etc. My goal was to make a game that finally gives IT people a legitimate RPG hacking experience, but also bring crypto/network/privacy literacy to the masses, one niche-genre at a time. Rest assured, this game is not about rolling dice and saying ""I hack the things."" There is no hacking skill in the game, nor is their a hacking class. Instead, the game methodically presents an inherently insecure fantasy abstraction of the Internet and then suggests ways to defend or abuse it. It is up to the players to figure out just how far they can push things, based on the rules provided. Non-IT people will still have fun with it, but IT folks will recognize how many of the game's conceptual architecture mirrors real life, and inherits the same problem sets. You can find out more here: URL This is an indie project made with love for the security community. It is also firmly in the cyberpunk genre, despite it's fantasy setting, because of 1) it's narratives about cybersecurity, surveillance, privacy, and national security, and 2) the idea of medieval fantasy cultures, adhering to feudal and caste systems, coping with suddenly being given the power and anonymity of the Internet"

For an art project, I am producing a documentary on hacking, the Internet, and the Deep Web. I'm a pretty decent programmer, so I am putting very technical scenes in the film, including demonstrating live examples of working exploits I've found and going in-depth to how the code works. Along with the security demos, animations, news clips, and other footage, I am trying to get interviews from a variety of sources: Cybersecurity experts, black hat / grey hat hackers, victims of hacking / phishing / social media theft, experienced Deep Web users, and also informed Internet users with something to say on any of the subjects. You can be anonymous if you'd like to (It's almost encouraged, as I will be remaining anonymous in the film too), and I can offer up some services that could be pretty beneficial depending on your situation. For example, if you were a victim of a hacking, phishing, etc. attempt, then I'd do some investigation on how you made yourself vulnerable, who could have targeted you, and how to prevent it in the future. If you're a grey hat hacker, I could share with you some of the working exploits and scripts I've written myself. Or I could just buy you a nice dinner during or after the interview! Please let me know on here through PMs. Or email me, at the.web.the.film@gmail.com. I live in NYC, so if you were anywhere around, that'd be great so I can get live footage. Otherwise, a Skype interview or even a phone call would be good! Thanks for reading. When the film is finished, I plan on releasing it on YouTube for free, as well as submitting it to a few film festivals. I'm willing to travel anywhere within a few hours of NYC to interview! Hope that the film will provide a compelling and insightful look into the Internet, hacking, and Internet culture, and that the research presented will be beneficial in promoting cybersecurity protection and digital privacy."
