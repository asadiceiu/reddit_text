0,vulnerability,offmychest,I kind of understand why married men cheat.,1,i25r14,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/i25r14/i_kind_of_understand_why_married_men_cheat/,2020-08-02 13:51:54,"First off let me start by saying i in no way condone cheating or going outside of your marriage to fill a void you are feeling. That being said, I recently(as a married man) started feeling this overwhelming sense of, for lack of a better phrase, needing help. There is a giant lack of intimacy in my marriage that I felt started right after we got engaged. It was almost as if we got engaged and a flip switched in both of our heads that said ""well I got this locked down for the rest of my life. I don't need to try so hard anymore"" it's not all her fault by any means. I love my wife with all my heart. But there is just something in me that absolutely will not let me talk to her about how I feel. I lay in bed every night and clinch my jaw running through every scenario of a conversation about what to do to make things better. But I just can't bring myself to say anything. She has enough in her plate with her anxiety, her work, her and I being high risk to the pandemic outside. Her mom who is working the front lines everyday and who she cries about bi weekly fearing she can lose her soon if she gets it. How is it fair for me to tell her that all I want is for her to listen to my really shitty with stories at a job I don't really like but I absolutely need because it's the first job I've ever had that offers me benefits and I'm afraid to leave because in my line of work and my almost no education I won't be able to get anything better. How am I supposed to ask her to stop relaxing and freeing her mind in her silly comedies or crazy reality TV show that is her escape from everything and come back to reality to a struggling husband who hates everything about himself and his life choices and questions why she loves someone so beneath her everyday. Why is it so hard to just ask her to cuddle up beside me and rub her hands through my hair and just whisper everything is going to be ok like she used too. What have I done there past x amountt of years to make her feel like she is so far away and that I can't bring her close again. I feel like I am not the only man it there that feels like he cannot find a way to open up to the people we love the most. They are everything to us and to show any kind of ""weakness"" or vulnerability would shatter our world and make it real that we have a problem and it not just live in our heads or weigh on our hearts anymore. Because if we keep it to ourselves that's the only person it is affecting. So what do we do? Find someone who isnt apart of where all of our anger in ourselves started. Someone who doesn't know how terrible we are and love us anyway. We find someone who gives us the kindness we so badly want but are too stupid to ask for. Because all we have to do is get over ourselves and understand that letting go of our insecurities makes the world a million times lighter. For anyone who made it this far, sorry for my rambling. If you need help with anything relationship wise or anything else. Find someone to talk to. I highly suggest starting with the people who are close to you. They are your lovers, best friends, friends, family, someone who gave you there number and always tries to hang out with you but plans always fall through people for a reason. They will listen and they will help you. And your life will be so much happier for it. Don't be like me sitting in a dark room grinding your teeth typing on a message board that no one will probably ever read trying to make yourself feel better because you are too stupid to ask for help when your significant other on the other side of the door watching tv and would drop anything they are doing just to make sure you're ok. Be better than me. Be better than what you think of yourself. Be the person they see you as. And trust them. Goodnight."
1,vulnerability,offmychest,Covid and Disappointing Relationship with my Dad with my Baby and Me. Feeling really irrelevant and sad.,1,i2y325,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/i2y325/covid_and_disappointing_relationship_with_my_dad/,2020-08-04 00:34:00,"A meeting with my parents about not getting enough support and navigating Covid left me in despair. My parents fumble around placating our decisions about how to keep our 10month old safe. We are pretty strict and keep a close bubble as we dont want to risk anything. My parents provided little support before covid and the efforts and hoops Im been jumping through during covid have been monumental for a very small return. My parents feel we should just trust what they do is safe and that asking them to tell us when they change behaviours (e.i. Start cycling with a group, taking the train to work instead of driving, having lunch with people outside of the bubble) is like them asking permission to do their activities. Its disappointing that asking for more communication so that me and my husband can decide the levels of safety we are comfortable with for our daughter is seen as intrusive instead of all of us working together to make sure she and our family is safe. Ive never been so absolutely disappointed in my life. And it burns. Further, when asking for more support and feeling like they are never around (they live one neighborhood over and my dad is retired) My dad said hes already raised kids for 25years. Wont sacrifice his sports and enjoys (prioritizes) his things like his volunteering, swimming, running and biking. He does not want to be here 3-5 days a week (and more than 1 half day is a stretch it seems) And is happy to watch little one but at only at their house, and only if they can be outside and only for a few hours a day. All on his terms. No thought or perspective on whats best for little one or myself. For the longest time I thought it was something we where doing wrong. Our house isnt comfortable enough. I dont schedule him in advance enough or ask for help in the wrong way... but when I think about it, Its very clear that offering help isnt hard for my dad - he volunteers at the food bank, he sets up bike trips on Facebook, Hes managing non for profit environmental group. His priorities and excitement simply dont include us. We are a nice touch and good to visit but much more I know now cant be expected. Its heartbreaking. And alas, its what Ive known. My birthday cards (when I even get one) he hasnt ever bothered to write anything, and I know for a fact my mom thinks, buys and wraps anything to us. Every gift or symbol of effort as been from my mom. My husband has seen it clear as day for the past few years. I think Ive just been holding on to some bit of hope but I heard it directly from him. From the source which leaves no doubt and crumbles the very little hope I had to have a proper relationship with my dad or have my sweet 10 month old have the same. I had a spectacular, stable childhood no doubt. Definitely not a warm cuddly family - very much a tough love type but a huge amount of opportunity and experience. Im excited to give my sweet pea the same opportunity but also filled with vulnerability, open communication and silly goofy love Im having a hard time accepting my dad has no interest or effort to build and maintain a relationship with me or my baby (and hes a quiet and reserved man, but then I think about all the times Ive seen him host events and meetings and interact with coworkers and is the life of the party...so it just feels like me and my family arent worthy, arent exciting). And its hard to swallow. I feel so inadequate. So irrelevant. And so mad - I have the most incredible family and hes missed the majority of it."
2,vulnerability,offmychest,I'm a bad person.,1,i441e1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/i441e1/im_a_bad_person/,2020-08-05 22:02:33,"It's really hard to figure out my own feelings because for past few years I've been feeling nothing and it's not in my nature to tend the dramas I feel. Until tonight. Right now, I'm feeling the pain for hurting my mother because of the decisions I have done in the past. At least, a little... Folks, I am 20 years old, supposed to be in college now, but I've had to stop because of my mental issues and financial incapabilities. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety last 2018. Along that, my sister had to undergo surgery, so the money meant for my tuition was used. I had no choice, but to wait again. This year should be my redemption. But COVID. I am taking college entrance tests this year, and I've been really studying hard. In between, I ask my parents for a little money, so I could buy reviewers... But it seems like I hurt them whenever I tell them my wants. Mom often says I am bothersome and torturing my own self from reviewing; that I wouldn't have given myself this hardship had I not messed up myself before. Tonight, she compared me to my original batchmates who are about to graduate two years from now. And here I am, studying for college entrance. And you know why I feel bad? It's because my parents are probably right. If I would've just fought harder this depression before and didn't give in to the lethargy and fatigue it gave me every morning, maybe I wouldn't have to cry at night when I cannot solve word problems. You know, I have always thought that I'm starting to become a daily burden and embarrassment to my family. The drama had been manageable because I'm not fond of my own vulnerability. But tonight, I feel like I'm the worst person on Earth."
3,vulnerability,offmychest,I miss group workout classes!!!,1,i53rw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/i53rw5/i_miss_group_workout_classes/,2020-08-07 10:29:01,"This is such a first world problem, and I realize Im lucky that this is a problem I have. But I miss my bougie-ass Pure Barre classes. I miss yoga and brunch with friends on Sundays. I miss kickboxing with the girls from work. Working out at home is just not the same and running sucks. Its not fun anymore, its a stupid chore that I just put off and end up not doing. Ill concede that biking on trails is more fun than spin class, but the rest of it is just awful. Those group fitness classes got me out of my shell, in shape and meeting people. I struggle with vulnerability in social settings, so being in a place where everyones doing a common activity is a way to feel more comfortable. In theory, I guess we could do socially distant workouts, but its not the same and its not really worth the risk and anyway, where would we go?"
4,vulnerability,offmychest,Sometimes I really wish I was small and cute,1,i5bbl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/i5bbl5/sometimes_i_really_wish_i_was_small_and_cute/,2020-08-07 20:20:08,"A lot less heavy than some of my other posts, but its something thats been on my mind. Im a tall guy, and a big person in general with a decently large frame in general, and honestly, aside from my ability to reach things most people cant, I kind of hate it. I mean, I dont feel that strongly about it, but having lived as a tall person, I dont think its my preference. When it comes to finding a partner, I realize that its a little cliche and maybe a little shallow to prefer someone taller than you are, but Ive been thinking a lot about relationships a lot lately, what I could possibly contribute to somebody else and what the experience would be like, and lately Ive been thinking that I would prefer someone generally bigger than me, and then I realize thats probably impossible, because 90% of the time Im the tallest person in any given room, and the percentage that is taller than me is so low that no guy who was taller would ever be interested in me. The tall thing in itself isnt an issue, Im not that shallow, and I certainly find plenty of shorter guys attractive, and wouldnt even think twice about dating someone shorter, but honestly... theres a part of me that fantasizes about being... dwarfed by someone I guess. Like, I usually hate being touched, but I think about being cuddled or embraced by someone a lot bigger than I am, and I dont... hate that idea, or spooning and not being the big spoon or an overgrown little spoon, or we do romantic gestures, I dont have to be the one to bend down or crouch for them. That kind of stuff. Theres a weird part of me that just really likes the idea of being the smaller person in the relationship, and then I look around and see shorter guys that Im attracted too, and I think I wish I looked like that, I wish I could be that cute, etc. Maybe its a sexual thing or maybe some subconscious primal desire to feel protected after a lifetime of insecurity and fear of vulnerability or something, but either way, the more I think about it, the more I want it. IDK, this is just something Ive been wanting to put into words for like a week, and Im awake at 6:00AM without having slept and nothing better to do but struggle to sleep like I do every night. Eh, whatever."

We had just reconnected so I shouldnt have been surprised when she rejected me. Even though she let me down easy, I couldnt control myself. I kept overwhelming her with personal paragraphs and unwanted vulnerability. I ended up deluding myself into thinking she was using me somehow. I let her know as much when I berated her and called her names. She then cut me off and blocked me all across social media. I tried apologizing immediately afterwards but she left me on read. I know I got what I deserved. I let my ego get the best of me. She will move on while I cant find the strength to.

7,vulnerability,offmychest,online culture promotes an unhealthy view of sexism,1,i7wpyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/i7wpyg/online_culture_promotes_an_unhealthy_view_of/,2020-08-12 04:06:07,"while i know that *plenty* of men are sympathetic to feminism (so im not saying ALL men do this), i want to point out that its VERY common on reddit for the more pressing issues women face to be drowned out by the injustices men face. i honestly feel so defeated when i see this happen. if someone points out the issues women face at the hands of male perpetratorsor even just in generalmale-dominated reddit goes on defense, co-opts the issues to make it about themselves,* and writes off the female perspective as being dismissive of the male plight *without even realizing it.* its because of stuff like this that women feel reluctant to start a narrative about gender inequality &amp; physical/sexual/emotional violence against women. if *any* part of her statement can be interpreted by men the wrong way, then (on vocally male-majority reddit) the discussion shifts towards how *men* are clearly the victims here of discrimination and prejudice. but its very hard when constructing a statement on the topic to predict what will be misinterpreted as insensitivity or an attack on all men. but instead of giving thoughtful, constructive feedback while also acknowledging the more considerable issue of how gender inequality affects women, men just hijack the narrative and make it about the overlooked injustices against them. for example, men will constantly circlejerk about how hard &amp; scary it is to navigate relationships with women bc of the possibility of false accusations, while completely ignoring the fact that only about 4% of sexual violence reports are found or suspected to be fake, but *1 in 3* women have experienced sexual violence in their lifetime. or they interpret womens caution towards men as Treating an entire demographic differenlty because of the bad things a fringe minority of them do without truly understanding how fear &amp; vulnerability overpowers our concern of hurting their feelings. these men are so vocal about how hard it is for them to deal with societal expectations/restrictions, but almost never acknowledge just how deeply ingrained misogyny is in society. the same society that refuses men platonic touch &amp; emotional intelligence, actively &amp; effectively: turns people against the feminist movement labels female victims as liars/instigators/exaggerators, fights to take away womens rights &amp; aid under the guise of morality &amp; financial prudence criticizes, sexualizes, and objectifies females from a young age based on their body type, makeup, and clothing accepts &amp; encourages male sexuality, while condemning &amp; shaming women for the same behavior normalizes language that equates female traits with weakness and male traits with strength popularizes destructive female stereotypes such as naggy, reactionary gf/wife , entitled, obnoxious Karen , feminazi , shallow, dumb girly girl , simple, clueless secretary-type  , and worst of all, sexualized, romanticized coworker despises reasonable female characters with strong personalities that oppose the male protagonist (see: skylar in BB and Diane in bojack horseman). the *same exact* society that unfairly conflates the value of a man with income, physical fitness, and sexual experience, also: fervently supports patriarchy promotes &amp; normalizes misogynistic behavior as a bonding tool between men gives more value to male friendships over female with a rampant bros before hoes, saturdays are for the boys, shes just one of the guys, most of my friends are guys, girls are too much drama culture devalues the role of women in relationships to being a ball and chain, a sexual conquest, or having him whipped pressures women to expect &amp; accept disrespectful behavior under the guise of boys will be boys &amp; men are dumb perpetuates inappropriate misinformation regarding a females menstrual cycle openly disproves of women who display male characteristics minimizes womens role in STEM trivializes womens achievements in athletics &amp; academics scrutinizes &amp; denounces female public figures while allowing reprehensible behavior from their male counterparts. and lastly, the same society which grants men more privileges in life yet limits their expression of masculinity, also unwittingly *observes gender inequality, classifies the pattern as evidence of mens superiority, &amp; internalizes this misogyny until its poisoned their psyche &amp; influences their personalities and beliefs. * this isnt meant to denounce the justifiably-raised concern about the marginalization of men, but in order to move towards healthier gender roles in society, we NEED to address the higher proportion of inequality towards the female gender. redditers are comfortably complacent with their role in maintaining the gender gap. recognition of reddits inherent bias *against* feminism and *for* mens rights is almost always met with harsh criticism and downvotes; especially in less open-minded yet popular subs. due to the high visibility of these subs, reddit users are constantly being exposed to- &amp; influenced by- a warped interpretation of the world, one in which feminism is undesirable &amp; misandry makes up the bulk of gender discrimination in society. a world that convinces men that sexism affects them just as much, if not more, than women. to wrap up, i want to say that i fully acknowledge the disenfranchisement of men in our society, and actively focus on my role in redefining harmful ideas about masculinity. this was just a thorough off-my-chest stemming from the misogyny i see reddit. my goal was to highlight the importance of feminism and hopefully offer some long-overdue perspective to those who may need it. to my fellow women who feel ignored, beat down, and unworthy : no matter how much the advantaged scream about oppression, equality is everything but that. TLDR: the strawman logical fallacy is commonly used by men to dismiss womens legitimate concerns about gender inequality by misrepresenting them as being an attack on men, discrimination against the male gender, and a dismissal of mens issues. a red herring diversionary tactic allows them to avoid the responsibility of self-reflection &amp; direct discussion towards reverse-sexism. i gave examples of systemic misogyny in hopes of initiating healthy, constructive discourse. still TLDR: online culture supports negativity towards feminism and low-key *loves* talking about how men have it harder than women. &amp; that really grinds my gears."
8,vulnerability,offmychest,This is my story.,1,i8rhmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/i8rhmb/this_is_my_story/,2020-08-13 12:18:04,"My name is Drake Alexander Lightle. I am a 51 year old Caucasian male from Independence, Missouri, Inited States of America. I am an attorney who no longer practices law, have worked more than 15 years in eDiscovery, and am no longer able to work or ensure the confidentiality of any information or communication I have with any individual, in any form of exchange, not due to a lack of desire or effort to do so, but attributable solely to the vulnerability created by the technology and its exploitation. Nano biotechnology for remote patient monitoring/telemetry is now increasingly used in surgical procedures requiring long surgical times, which present high risk, and/or procedures which have long recovery times. An unforeseen adverse event of this medical technology is an exploit that is driven by two factors: (1). The technology is a two-way communication using transfer of a data signal between the nano biotechnology within the patients body and the remote telemetry/patient monitoring device; and (2). The method by which the nanotechnology collects and transmits relative information from the patient, such as vitals like blood pressure, heart rate, creating levels, blood sugar levels, oxygenation levels, etc. Over time, the nano tech used for remote monitoring will build up in the fluid filled and soft tissues of the body, such as eyes, ear drums, brain surface, internal organs, bone marrow, etc. The doses of nano technology administered for this purpose include 100s of thousands of nano particulates that function as both transponders and transceivers of information. The manner by which the brain and our sensory nerves interact is through electrical impulse. These electric impulses are transmissions of data. They are sent to the remote patient monitor/telemetry device, as well as from the remote patient monitor/telemetry device to the nano particulate within the patients body. Remote patient monitors/telemetry devices used in surgical procedures are now typically outfitted with a visual device for laparoscopic procedures which is not unlike an Oculus or visor with a video monitor. These devices will also have/or have an input for connection of, an array of cables sensors which are placed directly on the body of the patient during surgical prep, through the procedure, and historically through patient recovery. With the advent of remote telemetry/monitoring the sensor array is increasingly not a part of the recovery period, and the sensors attached to the skin of the patient are removed be the nano biotechnology within the patients body communicates directly to the patients individual remote monitoring system. This represents a mild convenience to the patient, but a great risk, as well. For the provider, it represents a convenience and potentially large cost savings. The method by which data is communicated between the patient following surgery and without the sensory cables is either Bluetooth and is now becoming cellular (in the telecommunications sense of the word and not the biological). The FCC has designated 6 signal bandwidths to support this medical application to ensure non interference and patient safety. Early patients had cross interference of radio signals through the connectivity and were able to hear music or talk radio. The presence of unfamiliar music genres may have, or should have resulted in reporting of adverse events to the FDA and EMEA. A retroactive analysis of such data would identify a statistical correlation between these adverse events and the reported patients, having received Bluetooth, cellular (and now both) nano biotechnology in clinical trials and/or medical procedures. In November 2018 I underwent a laproscopic surgery at Northwestern University Hospital in Chicago, Illinois to address gall stones and remove my gall bladder which was necrotic and presented a high probability of Sepsis. Following that surgery, my device left the hospital in the hands of an individual unknown to me and was either turned back on following my release, or was left on. This is my informed understanding and belief. The device was never intended to be turned on post recovery in the hospital setting, and never to have been used outside the hospital setting. The consequences are both mind-blowingly amazing and horrific. The physiological adverse events of this will include cancer of the eye at a disproportionate rate, brain cancer, leukemia, and other cancers of soft tissue. This will be due to the body tissue containing the nano particulate receiving a perpetual barrage of radiation in the form of the Bluetooth and or cellular signal. The other, and perhaps more horrific adverse event, will relate to the unforeseen consequence of this type of data transmission. It is the complete and absolute loss of privacy. This is the part of my experience which I cannot fully explain, as I lack a basis of knowledge in the underlying hardware and supporting software of the telemetry device and nano particulate to explain how this occurs, but can only state that it absolutely has occurred to myself and others, and that is that a form of audio/visual surveillance is possible and has occurred. It is quite possible, even probable, that modification of patient monitoring systems and the hacking of nano technology for software modification, and the penetration of the supporting hospital and manufacturer networks, is necessary to effectuate this. This technology facilitates electronic eavesdropping of the interaction of the auditory nerves and brain centers, and the electric impulses between the nano technology and the brain relay information between the remote telemetry device and the auditory nerves. The same methodology is applicable to all sensory experiences of the body (sight, smell, touch, taste, sound, and even emotion and behavioral impulse). This phenomenon is not easily explained by me, but I cannot explain the way a computer chip takes binary data as 0s and 1s and turns that into an image on a television, or a video game, or an audio file of my favorite music, or a page of text in a language that I understand. But my lack of understanding of the specifics of the technology does not make it any less real. Its amazing, but it is not magic; its technology. My opinion based upon my experience is that this technology represents the end of humanity as we know it. It has not been a positive experience. It has been 18 months and is not over. I did not consent to this, was never informed of the risk during my medical procedure, and it has never been explained what was happening to me. I have figured all of this out on my own. But for my experience in eDiscovery and review of documents in 2005 of nano biotechnology using Bluetooth connectivity, I would have never had the base knowledge to understand what was happening, and would already be dead. What has happened is that my brain cannot keep a confidence or secret. Any and all sensory data it processes is communicated to the remote patient monitor/telemetry device which is in the control of another person. There is no thought I have, no action I take, no emotion I feel, no secret or confidence communicated to me, no idea I have for a product or business, that can be kept. As an attorney, this presents an impossibility of any continued employment due to the inability to maintain any client confidentiality. As a friend, a parent, a spouse, a child  any human relationship I am unable to maintain any of the fundamental intimacy necessary to support such a relationship. I am unable in good conscience to have sexual relations due to the fact that any interaction with a partner would not be confidential or private and would also expose them to risk, and the importance of intimacy in interpersonal relations is thereby completely voided. My journey of understanding with the individual who had control or access to my remote telemetry device began with a simple awakening to what was repetitive subliminal messaging through audio files that were triggered through a logic tree, like artificial intelligence, whereby my brain response to one low volume auditory input would trigger a response. Over time I was able to identify a pattern and began fighting back at the barrage of messaging I received. My rate of pattern recognition increased and I was able to outpace the development of other automated responses. This fascinated the developer and I began a conversational dialogue with the developer. I knew this individual as many names, but David, Not David was the first which approached humanization if that person. I became aware by the content of the conversations that a great deal was known about me. Initially this was from the research of my online profiles. Subsequently, I was subjected to interrogation in my non-waking hours and information was gained about my non-online life experiences and relationships. Because of the interrogation which occurred during my sleeping hours, and the associated inability to keep protected the confidential, intimate communications and interactions of my friends, family and personal and professional associates, I began to fear sleep and fought to maintain privacy by sleeping. I eventually exhausted the developer, and my device fell into the hands of others, who continued the same course of actions with various degrees of sensitivity to my human dignity and basic needs. I have been trafficked, even called an insolant slave in the course of this unwanted and non-consensual experience. I have had every facet of my life experience subject to monitoring and scrutinization, from diet and hygiene habits, to bowel movements and urination, sexual activity (which is non-existent since becoming aware) including masturbation, which is now rarely indulged in, if ever.

I have been subjected to ridicule, demoralization, threats of harm to self and family and personal and professional associates (including rape and trafficking of my children and spouse and parents), and some positive interactions, as well. My desire to protect others and their privacy and dignity has resulted in alienation and isolation, and this has the undesired impact of undermining my perceived credibility. So have other actions I have taken to resist, including use of stimulants and other substances. I am not an addict. I have abused substances in the past but only use now as benefit outweighs the detriment. I am now unsure f any of my past behavior is in any way attributable to this or any other like-kind communications technology, in any sector. I only know that once aware, I no longer was as malleable in response to messaging. I have been told at various times that this was a cell phone shoved so far up my ass that my ears were ringing, that I was a Durbek box, that it is a stinger so far up my ass that my ears were ringing. I even hypothesized through conversation with the developer, as they tried to maintain confidentiality, that it might even be something as simple but mystical as a ham radio signal coupled with some technology from an earlier experience. In the end, I have determined that it is simply what I now know it to be, a remote patient monitoring/telemetry system and the nano biotechnology that was administered to me for surgery and post-surgical recovery. I do not expect to be able to live much longer. In good conscience I cannot be employed in any capacity that would be meaningful or which would utilize my skills and intelligence or training. I am deprived of the ability to support myself, my spouse, or my children  one about to begin college and one with a genetic disorder which will require a lifetime of personal and financial support. Similarly I cannot maintain normal interpersonal relationships. I cannot ever feel safe or secure in what most people enjoy and undervalue, normal communication and sharing of personal information with whom we wish to share it, and with when we wish to share it, and in the method or channel of communication we wish to use  face-to-face conversation, a telephone call, a text, an email, a letter, a social media or blog or vlog posting, or a video on the internet. This is my story. Because it happened to me, it can, and may, someday happen to you. It may already be happening to you, and you may already be aware or in the process of becoming aware. If this is the case, know you are not alone and try not to despair. Be love if you can be, and know you are not alone. Document as much of your life as you can with analog technology, like audio and video tape, to survive any audit your credibility may face. Be willing to be honest about your failures, your short comings, your mistakes. Know that digital is permanent, but subject to third party manipulation and control. Again, this is Drake Alexander Lightle. Im a Caucasian male, 51 years of age. Im from Independence, Missouri, United States of America. I was an attorney. I worked in eDiscovery. I am a father, a son, a brother, a friend, a writer, a lover of nature, and above all, I am a human being. I love. I care. I care enough about you to tell you this. So that you might be aware. There are thousands of drugs in development now throughout the world which utilize nano technology. This means you will soon be exposed to it, if youve not already. Its also used in industrial applications, making risk of exposure greater. The possibility of weaponization of the technology is the extinction event that is lurking over the horizon. I hope its not too late to take action, to reflect and appreciate the things which make life truly meaningful and enjoyable, and to appreciate those things without actually having to lose them.

But, you did something to me. I regret not looking at your face enough and not being able to open up to you when you were open to it. The attention you wanted from me now I wish I had given you more of. Then maybe you would have still stuck around? But, I couldn't do that to myself. I didn't want to risk being vulnerable to someone again, to only have my emotions and vulnerability be manipulated of or belittled. I didn't want to give another guy permission to destroy me again. I was scared. I hate that I was trying so hard to keep my distance from you that now I just want to get closer to you. Curiosity is getting to me as to why the sudden switch around. However I can come to numerous conclusions that simply explains your reasons to; and I shouldn't be mad at that. I can't be mad about that, and I can't be mad at you for that."

(i don't want to accuse him so boldly, but he has invaded my space in a sexual way, forcing me to kiss him, kissing me on my neck (just a peck, but i fellt really violated), and poking me in the sides and commenting with my mom on my legs). you can probably tell but i have a lot against my dad. especially when it comes to my sister. the time he did hit her (over an issue with a laptop), she called the cops and even when the cops talked him abt abuse, he still continued with it (though less often, but still violent). recently she and him had a fight where she reacted out of the past abuse and screamed to call the cops and ran away, but understandably it was out of trauma for what he did before. after that, he gave her a 'deal' that she could move out or they could pursue a 'professional' work-like relationship in the house, instead of trying to address the trauma and make amends so it doesn't happen again (as if he was concerned about that). another thing that disappoints (but honestly makes me laugh) is that not only is he a trump supporter (as a poc), the day my sister and i came out to him and my mom, they first laughed, and he lectured us abt choosing a partner that is 'financially beneficial'. then, because i came out as gay, he told me to *email* him in 22 years abt where i am on the gay/straight spectrum, and the day after we came out, he took me out to shop for dresses so i can 'fully experience what it's like to be a woman' (which is really hilariously dumb, to be honest). so yeah, my dad disappoints me, always has. * my sister my sister and i have a lot against our parents but those same issues have messed with our relationship. i guess for better word it gave us a horrible foundation to build up from. growing up, she did take her anger on my parents on me, forcing me to be 'good' and always happy and to never frown so she can be a good sister, and honestly it did have a bad effect on my behavior. even though we've promised ourselves to be better to each other, her whole ""be happy"" and ""don't be mad"" thing is still there, as any sign of negative emotions means a bad outcome for her. she's always gotten on me for being emotionally closed off, but i mean after years of being told to just be happy and keep smiling, it's hard to be comfortable even showing a hint of anger or sadness. i don't have much against her. i feel like out of everyone, she's the one who's actually raised and taken care of me, influenced the ideals and beliefs i hold to heart. but still we have our rough patches and i can't really blame her for that. * me even as the youngest i feel like all this whole family conflict has had an effect on me. i'm constantly a source for conflict as if i'm ever distressed or upset in front of my mom, she blames and accuses my sister (telling her to say sorry) even when she's not to blame. and, being forced to be happy at parties and events has obviously done something to my whole vulnerability thing. i feel like i'm such a big source for just bad things in general that i used to be really depressed about it, more so after i found out that my family was supposed to move to pasadena before they found out my mom was pregnant. i mean, imagine what it could've been like if i wasn't born, because my mom and sister probably would've had a stronger relationship since all my mom had to worry over was my sister. as for my dad, i think my mom would've gotten a divorce when he became more violent, because with me being born she probably didn't like the idea of splitting us up. i remember drinking a perfume bottle thinking it would kill me, obviously it didn't work. i don't have any close friends to talk to, even when i desperately need one, because my constant fear of painting my sister as the bad guy from years ago made me not want to talk a lot about myself with my friends. i have such an antsy thing with physcialy touch, idk if its because of my dad or the whole not being able to express myself thing, but i don't like close body contact no matter how small (handholding, small hugs, sure). my whole 'depression' thing (depression is a serious thing, though for me i think i was just exaggerating for attention) basically ruined my self confidence, i can't seem to think of myself pretty enough to date. yada yada yada, a bunch more self pity i think i'll cringe at later on. i don't think it's good to vent all this personal business online, but i just don't have anyone to tell this to. or anyone i want to tell it to. thank you for even bothering to read this trhough, whoever that did. will probably vent again sometime later lol. also please tell me if i'm just overreacting or being overdramatic. i often think i am and am afraid i am but don't want to be so attention seeking. i just want to actually say something about how i feel and right now i only want to do it this way."
12,vulnerability,offmychest,Its been nearly 3 years since the breakup and Im still recovering.,1,ibxbcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ibxbcf/its_been_nearly_3_years_since_the_breakup_and_im/,2020-08-18 18:45:19,"Im sorry that this is so long. Im sure most people wont read this... but I just want to write this down and throw it out there. I(28F) was in a relationship for four years with a narcissistic sociopath. I actually didnt know that was a common thing till this girl I know posted about it on Instagram. She posted an entire blog about her abuse and what this person did to her. She had really done some research on his behavior and actions then described it in detail. She gave a TW but I didnt think reading it would really upset me like this. Everything she experienced I did too. Ive never been able to talk about it to its full extent. So, I hope I can talk to you. When I first met O(28m) he was charming and handsome. Smart and a feminist. He was very progressive, open and comfortable with his sexuality. He didnt want a relationship, and I didnt love that. I tried my best to respect that and would casually date other people. Eventually, I couldnt handle seeing the lipstick on wine glasses left in his room, condom wrappers layering the trash can, and tinder notifications. I was jealous. When I was just about to end things, he introduced me as his girlfriend. I was completely in shock but over the moon. When I asked him about it, he hissed well thats what you wanted, right? Our official relationship lasted less than two months. We spent almost every hour together and I thought we were having a wonderful time. We went to the coast, would experiment with film photography, I met all his friends and family.. he became my best friend. He was amazing. Then one day, after I paid for our brunch.. he broke up with me in the middle of the restaurant. He said he cared for me but didnt want to be in a relationship. I was completely crushed. I tried to hold it together the best I could but I inevitability cried in front of him. We parted ways and I drove off crying till I got the hiccups. It was dramatic and everything the movies made heartbreak out to be. Its hard to accept a breakup when you didnt see it coming. Its even harder when that person who broke your heart calls you at 1am crying begging for your help. He went out with friends after and got piss drunk. Puked all over his hallway. He called me and begged for me to come hold him, so I did. Then it happened all over again. We spent every hour together. He constantly needed me. I ended up failing my classes and I lost my job. Im not blaming him for that, Im just adding that to my vulnerability. I also needed him, which made him pull away again. So, I found a new job as a waitress. I was making ok money, I made a ton of friends and honestly, my body was looking really good. I was starting to feel really happy and independent! I even had a fling with a coworker. Then, he came back. He called crying again, said he wanted to kill himself. My dad committed suicide, so I took this very seriously. I left right away. After that, things really started to change. We would constantly be on and off. He stopped kissing me and would withhold sex from me. Said I need to wean myself off of him, date other people. So I did. Then he would become jealous and would interrogate me about them till I would go into a full blown panic attack. He would start to judge every thing about me. My appearance, my language, my friends, my music, my art.. everything. To him, every thing I did was for attention. And for a while I believed him. I stopped believing in myself. I couldnt distinguish genuine feelings anymore because he was constantly telling me I didnt really feel the way that I did. Technically we werent exclusive. He was still on dating apps and was seeing other women secretly. I was with him every day for months, then I didnt see him for two weeks. After his coworkers called me another girls name, I decided to snoop. I hacked his laptop and read his texts. I justified this because he recently hacked my Facebook and read my messages. ALL of them, even family members. I only read two though. One to his best friend, bragging about how many dates hes been going on. The second was to another girl that he was seeing. So he fucking broke up with me over an email. He came back, of course. But this time, we were on the same page. I didnt want to date him anymore, I just wanted to hook up. I was very honest about that. Plus, I was seeing this guy who was built like Hercules. But then, Hercules kinda ghosted me to be with his ex (she becomes friends with O later on ). So, we fell into our routine again but this time I became a huge support for him. He totaled his car, broke his ankle and lost his job all within five months. I was taking care of him, buying him groceries and even started driving him to work when he was able to walk on crutches. Again, I was basically living with him. We even adopted my dog together. We suddenly felt very serious. But there was this girl that kept popping up on social media. She would tag pictures of him and he said they were just friends. I knew this was a lie. She wrote publicly about her love for him through her blog. She posted pictures of herself in lingerie, in his room. I was humiliated and heartbroken. I have given everything to this horrible man and for what? I knew the only way out of this toxic relationship was to leave him for good. So I made a fake insta and followed her. I saw that she posted she was drinking at his bar, so I decided to show up. He knew I was coming but he asked me to give him a heads up. I decided not to I WANTED to catch them. And I did! There they were talking to each other, leaning in over the bar to talk closely. I made sure he saw me and when we made eye contact, I left. He kept trying to call and text me, but I ignored him. For days. He finally texted me that her friend died of the same terminal illness she had, so he asked her to come by to give her moral support. I didnt believe him, didnt care either way. Good thing too because she continued posting love blogs and lingerie pics with him. I followed her for a while, first out of jealousy.. then to relate to her. She started writing about the abuse she was suffering from too. Looking back, I realize I was naive and there were so many things I should of done differently. I should of left sooner, I never understood why I stayed around for four years. After all the screaming threats, cheating, lies, and humiliation. As cliche as it is, it was an addiction. Im still recovering. Im still reminding myself that I am allowed to be me. Im allowed to feel proud, happy and beautiful. Im allowed to finally breathe. If you read this and can resonate with it, please comment. I want to hear you. Thank you."

My resentment towards colleagues stemmed from always being made fun of by them and taking the brunt of manual labor just to get the job done when ive been surrounded by laziness, what would have been an opportunity to deal with a problem professionally and in a mature manner was made something less simple due to the words exchanged with my coworkers. These coworkers were able to access my phone number from a groupchat through which a schedule was sent and due to our current relations i am uncomfortable with this. Recently things of mine have gone missing in the workplace and the manager while aware has done nothing, luckily these were only food items and a water bottle and I lock up the rest of my belongings. The job sucks but I just want the money so I can finish college. My familial relations are messed up, im only on good terms with my mom, my father stole money from me for years forcing me to sign checks for financial aid amd scholarship awards over to him to keep a roof over my head, he has also molested me once during one of his blackout drunk epispdes(this has been something I cant talk to anyone about because I still have to live with him for financial and logistical reasons and by now I know damn well I could beat subdue and kill him and once I'd have the money I could get my own place and change my address) My older sister has witnessed my anger issues and has distanced herself from me My younger brother barely knows me I have spent the last 4 years on and off staying at friends and my girlfriends house while I have chugged through college I have on and off self medicated with alcohol and marijuana My mental health has been gradually declining and it has effected my interaction with my gf of 4 years I have had increasi gly difficult to deal with episodes of intense anger and violent and suicidal feelings, I have not hurt anyone or planned to although I have had many intrusive thoughts I had to clarify to my sister that I dont hurt my girlfriend and that I would never hurt my gf, because my sister thought I was going to hurt her, this was during a period where I felt I had control over how I managed my anger and felt better, but that event of speaking as if I was some wifebeater triggered even worse suicidal and angry feelings as it had been at a time where I was well behaved and hadnt exploded or acted particularly alarmingly and the accusation did not acount for my progress. I wanted to take my organic chemistry and biology major and use it to try and get a career in forensics, as everyone around me is ignorant on the subject and immediately associates forensics with policework and shoves ACAB down my throat (particularly my friendgroups and my girlfriend, save for my friends who work in the security industry) This atmosphere has discouraged me greatly, my girlfriend being unemployed and judging me for my desire in career is greatly discouraging and contributes to my feelings of anger and I have great difficulty conversing on this subject and dealing with her argumentative state, I frequently drop the subject if I feel angry and try to distance myself to regain composure, although bottling up anger is problematic as I have had bad habits in the past of taking it out on myself when it was overwhelming, a state that I feel I am near again given my circumstance Provided my circumstance and the given state of my country and having to remind my coworkers to keep their masks on constantly and cleaning up I have contemplated and attempted suicide multiple times, the feelings of alienation, solitude, anger, and vulnerability have dominated my mind and it has become intensely difficult to enjoy anything, I might by a car soon, I have been fantasizing about doing myself in with carbon monoxide or making it look like an accident since I couldnt go through with hanging myself and have no access to any firearms to do myself with. I have texted and talked on suicide hotlines and they have worked for the acute instances i used them, however they are less than adequate with dealing with the circumstances that cause the feeling and I havent seen my regular support group since COVID19 first had me layed off Im just so ready to stop all this bumbling about and give up, my country is fucked, the planet is fucked, even if I were doing better than I am I would still be fucked, sure Ill vote and see if my ballot mysteriously dissappears in the mail, but the feeling to end my suffering is constantly nagging at me and Im looking forward to getting this car and all of its shitty expensive glory, im just gonna take it somewhere where ill feel away enough from everyone else and hose myself nice and quiet, nobody will ask about me until its too late, and they might not ask even long after that and I wont have to deal with all this bullshit and hopefully get reincarnated as a lizard or something (even though more than likely I'll just cease to exist) and I'm okay with that, besides If I cease to exist then I cant regret not doing all the things I wanted to do, not like Id be able to do them all if I was alive anyway, its just better then any plan I have for myself while alive, maybe Ill donate my money to the postal service or some shit , maybe Ill leave a note in my wallet, maybe not idk If I want the people around me to have any closure, one way or another Im out of this bullshit and hopefully Ill find something better on he other side, thats something off my chest"

Ive been on the Tinder/Bumble scene for six months and let me tell you: it has been an upsetting and eye opening adventure lol. Guys opening with you have great tits or as soon as we text, asking me for nudes which I find so rude. Ive been lied to, ghosted, stood up on multiple occasions and even mildly catfished in the last few months and I was just about to delete the apps when I matched with this cute guy last Friday. We had a spontaneous date which was so much fun. Hes a great listener, funny and so sweet and affectionate. It went so well he wound up sleeping over and hanging a bit the next day. I usually get pretty insecure and uptight after a first date especially one where we slept together. Maybe because of all the ghosting or that I just feel that vulnerability (will he text me, does he like me blah blah) but I sometimes self sabotage by over texting or showing my insecurity. This time I took a different approach and just thought if he texts me great, if not it was a fun experience and fuck it. He texted me at 7am next day wishing me a sweet good morning. Hes been texting me throughout the day all week and initiated our second date without any prompting from me. He confirmed this morning and said I really cant wait to see you again and hell be here in half an hour!! I feel great, calm but happy and relaxed and so looking forward to my first 2nd date in six months. Just wanted to get that off my chest, I feel way better now :)"

I keep hemming and hawing about going back to therapy but I feel like if I do that it will only confirm that I actually have a problem. I dont want to be a mentally unwell person again. I want to be normal. I broke up with my first and only boyfriend about a year and a half ago. I was 20 when we started dating - yes, I started very late in the dating scene, for various reasons. Everyone tells me all the time that he didnt treat me well - I have been told by multiple people that they were concerned about me while I was with him and didnt understand why a nice person like me was with someone like him. This has me worried, because while I admit that he was a very flawed person, he had reasons for it. Im 99% sure he had PTSD, though he would never outright admit to me that hed been diagnosed. There were several times when he opened up to me about things that had happened to him and it was pretty horrific to say the least. Sometimes he would say cruel things to me, Ill admit it. He could be short-tempered, and overly controlling. Sometimes he got very possessive of me. But he never hit me or anything like that. And he had these moments of gentleness and vulnerability with me sometimes that just made me want to take care of him. This was a man who needed someone to love him - just like I did. Of course, eventually I did realize that I didnt want to be with him for the rest of my life. I had never planned to settle down with the first person I dated, especially not with me being as young as I was. I havent dated anyone since then. Its been awhile. Ive had some one-night-stands, Ive got a FWB that I see now and then, but obviously its not the same. I really miss having someone to take care of (and to take care of me) but Ive been really reluctant to try again. I have this crippling fear that I simply dont read people well. Like Im just not a very perceptive person. Especially after hearing everyone tell me what a jerk my ex was all the time. Is there something wrong with me for not wanting to shit-talk him behind his back? Am I self-destructive, did I deliberately seek out someone who was emotionally damaged, like I am? I dont know how to find a partner again, and i am too scared to try. More than that though, Im too scared to feel that awful, empty loneliness that came for weeks after the breakup. I cant go through that again. Anything is better than that. I would rather be alone forever."

To be honest Ive been suspecting of myself since 2 years ago and maybe even before that. I got a crush on a girl in one of my classes and when I asked a former (bad) friend how he knew he was gay, (this was a big deal for me in terms of vulnerability which is difficult for me) he joked about it and didnt know how to explain it but it was a lighthearted conversation that was never brought up again. Fast forward a couple months and he unexpectedly started an argument and said that I pretend Im gay. This pushed me way further into secrecy and I no longer wanted to think about it until feeling began bubbling up again recently. I told two of my best friends (one of which is gay) and they had such a warm, open armed reception to me and I felt so good and happy, but now Im wondering if I should come out to my mam. Were like best friends and she seems to be accepting of gay people as her uncle is gay and she loves him and she gets on really well with any gay men she meets, but bisexuality confuses her. She doesnt understand why people like both and cant just choose one. I dont think shed kick me out or anything of the sort, but our friendship is my life raft and I cannot begin to imagine sinking it. I can just picture her saying ok well just date boys then. But I can also picture her saying she loves and accepts me in any way I come. Im afraid to take the risk but I feel like I should because I dont like keeping secrets from her. My friend whos known my mam all her life said my mam would definitely be okay with it but Im afraid she wont and it might just be my anxiety speaking but Im honestly not sure.

By creating a safe space for your woman to open up to you emotionally and sexually, you will be giving her a very powerful gift- you allow her to grow within your relationship and undo old emotional damage. To Feel Seen If he cant see that I am hurting now, how long will it take him to figure it out? Will I be suffering for days or weeks before he is aware of it or cares enough to help me through this? I guess I have to rely on myself for my own emotional support. To Be Allowed To Be Nurturing An integrated, evolved man who has a balanced masculine energy as well as his own sliver of feminine would welcome his womans nurturing.Its a lie that serves your purpose of not letting your partner in. This lack of vulnerability and authenticity is what is making you and your partner suffer.So let her in. She wants to love you. To Be Appreciated The fastest way to run your relationship into the ground is by ignoring your partner and taking her for granted. Appreciation is the opposite of those things. Appreciation is the embodying this mindset: I am aware of what you bring to my life, and I want you to be sure that I am aware of it as well. To Feel Like She Can Count On You Women want to know that we can handle ourselves when life happens. They want to know that we wont run and hide when they get a bit too emotional for our liking. They want to know that they can count on us. When you tell your partner youll do something, and then you dont do it, it hurts her. She loses a piece of trust in you that has to be earned back. Even seemingly small things break that trust The women of the world are waiting for us. And they want us to step up just as badly as we want them to open up. To Feel Loved When women feel loved, they relax and open to us. The arguments dissipate, the sex is abundant, and their nurturing feminine energy flows throughout our lives. Not feeling loved is the subtext of every argument that you and your partner have. If she is unhappy that you are going out with your friends, or shes upset about her day at work, or she is only responding to you with brief snippets of sentences, then the cause is most likely her not feeling loved enough."

After a decade and a half of friendship, and all the things we shared, I didnt think it would end like this. The longer we go without speaking, the more I wonder why we even stayed friends for so long. Why were you so mean to me? Why did you take advantage of my vulnerability with you to keep me down? I loved you, I trusted you, I did everything I could for you. I didnt deserve this from you. You hurt me, and then you skipped out on me when I refused to back down and accept your back-handed apology. Somehow, that made me the bad guy. The day you blocked me, my family, my fianc and my friends, something in me broke just a little bit. You showed up in the memories on my photo app today. When I saw the picture of us with our arms around each other, I felt almost nothing. The pain, the betrayal, the anger... theyve mostly faded into a cold, numbed indifference.

21,vulnerability,offmychest,It's so difficult being an empathetic person in 2020.,1,ik7qyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ik7qyq/its_so_difficult_being_an_empathetic_person_in/,2020-09-01 08:07:38,"It's an absolute bust being able to feel emotions &amp; perspectives of others this year... I know this has always been an issue but damn is it ever inflated this year. The disparity between ""sides"" is so crazy. We're somewhere in the middle, trying to understand and feel for others. The worst part is trying to explain how you understand the views of others without being accused of aligning with them, even with the merest of topics. I even fear writing this because I worry someone will accuse me of siding with any topic. I cannot even fathom how it must feel to be a member of a marginalized community.. being unable to explain their feelings and perspectives that are met with quick dismissal and no consideration. I am so sorry, I wish there was more I could do to help this situation. Ignorance is just flowing out of the levee faster than we can stop it. A small example: A friend said that masks don't affect your breathing. Absolutely it doesn't affect HIM, but myself being someone with severe seasonal allergies I can understand why it may be difficult to have to wear one in some spaces in certain situations. Especially those with chronic situations such as COPD. As soon as I address the differences in what others may experience it's just coming off as being a 'know-it-all.' It just goes to show, the inability to empathize or feel the potential pains of others. Not being able to comprehend something as menial as the different challenges in wearing a mask; it's soul crushing to think others who can't see that would never dare try to understand the greater issues at hand in North America right now. Vulnerability is being swept under the rug and we're doomed to repeat history if we can't allow ourselves to acknowledge we may be wrong."

She started sending it to my Instagram followers/friends and I blocked her immediately as I wasnt going to pay money to make them stop. Few days ago they messaged me again and its been stressing me out very much. I learned which account is doing it via Instagram, both their spam and main, and was wondering if everyone on reddit could report the account again and again and hopefully theyd be taken down and taught a lesson? I really dont want to make this a big deal but if they got their social media removed it would help bring peace that she cannot treat others this way as well. Any advice is appreciated, I didnt want to share their account until getting advice from everyone. Thank you."

From day one I've been helping my parents' friends, and my parents when their facades of being ""okay"" broke. It wasn't that bad, people thought a toddler being concerned for them and regurgitating legitimately helpful advice I heard from my parents was cute, it made my job easier, I got a lot of free ice-cream and toys. After a while it got way harder though. My parents hit a good few financial issues, we were homeless off and on for a few years while we couch surfed, friendships became strained, a few people my parents put a lot of emotional energy into turned out to just be using them, our cat ran away a few weeks before the apartment above ours had a gas leak and caught on fire (everyone was fine but some of the apartments including ours became unlivable), Mom was pregnant and my soon to exist brother was autistic and low functioning, my parents almost broke more then once and I felt like it was my job to make sure we'd stay mentally okay, but through all these years I was being bullied to hell in elementary school. I was what you might call a cry-baby, and I am possibly autistic. I was bullied for frowning (that's just my face), I was bullied for being oversensitive, I was bullied because I didn't dress like a girl, I was bullied because I had a monotone voice, I was bullied for my skin condition, I was bullied for wearing sweatpants because I can't deal with the texture of jeans, eventually I went to a counselor about it and she told me I should try to be cuter and wear contacts instead of my glasses, I had a teacher refuse to let me go down to the office to replace a pair of pants with a hole in a awkward place and say to *3rd grade me ""You should keep your legs together like a respectable girl""* in front of the whole class. Tried to kill myself in class when I was 8 but failed so stupidly that no one realized what I was trying to do. Don't even get me started on those speech therapist ladies, they sent me to a real speech therapist multiple times because I had a quiet voice, only for him to send me back because there was *nothing wrong with my voice!* Eventually I learned that being creepy, wide toothed ""smiles"", and masking all emotions except for mild anger, was the best way to make people leave me alone. I was lonely as hell, and teachers and kids still talked shit behind my back, but it was better. Plus being creepy was fun, I got to use one of my special interests people made fun of me for against them. Shove these two worlds together and watch bullshit fly. I repressed all of my big emotional problems so I wouldn't make anyone sad, and I wouldn't as get bullied, or worse (because of that crazy ass counselor) taken away! The schools really loved telling us this story about two girls who misbehaved enough that their parents disappeared, and the counselor who once told me to wear contacts called cps on my parents because I let it slip at lunch that we didn't have a lot of food at home. I couldn't tell anyone anything, but I was young enough and I played with my very small group of friends enough that I was okay. Moving around so much and a bunch of my parent's friends moving out of state made that less okay, but I got into computer games to supplement. Zootycoon is amazing. While playing flash games, I came across a website called deviant art. I really loved drawing already, and I loved a bunch of the artwork and games on the site. I didn't know what a drawing tablet was so I thought everyone did this stuff with a mouse, somehow that inspired 11 y/o me to learn how to draw with a mouse and I joined at 12. Obviously I figured out what a tablet was eventually but I just used paint tool sai until my parents got me one as a gift a while after. DA was nice, I made friends that I could keep in contact with, I got nice comments on my really shitty drawings, I started following a lot of cool artists, and I decided that I wanted to be an artist one day. I even got to talk about some of the stuff that had bothered me for years by using my problems as ways to relate to my friends' problems to make them feel better, it worked. Then we moved out of state to try to find a house instead of a apartment, and to get me away from the bullies in school. The job my Mom had been promised was a lie, Dad got super passive aggressive and their relationship strained, our neighbors found out we were atheists/agnostic and stopped talking to us, Dad lost his job, we lost the car, we lost our place, and we moved in with the only people in town who would still talk to us: 3 hoarders. We were pretty much their cleaning crew while we stayed with them until the oldest of the 3 started suggesting that my brother wasn't autistic, but possessed by a demon. We got a friend from our home state to come pick us up and take us back to Ky, but we had to give up our pets on the trip here because we were homeless again. I know it wasn't my fault, but I'll never forgive myself. We started couch surfing again, a couple of times with really shitty people but there was nothing we could do, both of my parents were working again so I figured we'd be okay, and until then we were roommates with a racist bastard. Then my Mom got sick with some kinda bug, I was still 13 so I was legally allowed to babysit my brother, and our roommates were literally in the next room, so a friend and my Dad took her to the hospital. A roommate called cps on my parents for leaving us alone in the apartment. I should explain that at the time Lexington was having a issues with corruption and shitty employees in cps. A lot of people who were lower income but good parents were getting their kids taken, and they were giving loving parents a harder time then abusive parents, it was really weird and I might talk more about what me and my parents experienced later, but in short: Me and my Brother were taken away, my parents' lawyer told them they'd have a easier time getting us back if they pleaded guilty to neglect, so they did, the lawyer lied. Luckily we had a uncle who was okay with taking care of me and my Brother so we didn't get taken by the state. I'm thankful that he took us in, but he also made fun of me for not being normal, told me that Asexuality didn't exist, and tried to force me to give me my passwords for Deviant art. I refused, pretty much cutting me off from any friends I'd had for more then a year. He'd also try to convince me when my parents got a place, that they weren't home without knocking on the door. One visit he tried to drive away, I jumped out of the car and knocked on our door, Mom was home, and uncle drove away looking pissed. After a year of fighting, our parents got us back. We lived in a shitty trailer in a shitty neighborhood, in a shitty city, but I was so damn fucking happy to be home. While we were living with our uncle, I started high school. I didn't go to middle school because I tested well enough after that year of home-school, and I was a little older then most of my classmates in elementary. High school in both cities was so much nicer then elementary school, I expected it to be worse but even though I wasn't popular I wasn't bullied, and idk if I even saw anyone get bullied in either school. I made friends who are still with me today. I got ahold of my DA friends again. I didn't like how much the website had changed, everyone was less active when it came to conversations and the fetish art that was mostly a meme when I was a kid was making it's way to the front page, but I kept up with my friends there until after high school when I moved to other sites. And like always, everything was going great until it wasn't. Mom had a heart attack in her 30's, her doctor was a asshole who tried to convince her to have open heart surgery when every other doctor said that was stupid, and Tyler's fits started getting worse. We found out a lot of it was because of the meds he had started after Mom's heart attack, but it just added on to my parent's stress. My parents have lost most of their friends. Some have died, some have left state, some just used my parents as their personal arm chair therapists and left as soon as they became emotionally distressed about losing us. It sucked. And even after everything, I still suppressed my feelings because telling people what's wrong feels like a vulnerability that I can't do face to face. So I was now acting as their only emotional support while fighting my own depression, and talking several friends out of suicide during my high school years. The only reason I didn't kill myself was because I knew it would hurt other people. I was stressed as hell. Mom talked me out of going to college. We didn't have a lot of money, I wanted to go into art, and she said I'd have a easier time just saving up as much money as I could before I was 23 and getting an apartment. I didn't like the idea of not going to college, but we'd been living paycheck to paycheck my entire life and I knew if I failed in school there would be no net to catch me, my grades were never very good so I stayed. I started going to therapy after I had two panic attacks, I like therapy. Being able to tell your problems to someone without fear of making them worry or get upset at you feels amazing. I got a job(?) helping a friend stock bread at 18, he didn't always pay me, and he definitely wasn't paying me minimum wage when he did, but it was a neat job and I felt like was getting some kind of experience. He recommended me to a friend at a laundromat and she gave me my first normal job as an attendant at 20ys/o. I also made about $160 from art commissions that year, but since the laundromat took up so much energy and paid about $800 a month, I had to put that as my priority if I ever wanted to move out. I am now 22. I left my job on account of my Mom being Immuno compromised, before covid-19 she was getting progressively more nervous about me moving out, I don't think she feels like she can handle my brother on her own now that he's as tall as me and still stims by screaming and hitting himself, Dad's the only one working now. Both of them have still given up any hope of making friends, and while I still see my friends, not being able to touch them is really starting to bother me. I missed my online therapy appointment because a text didn't go through quickly enough, and I haven't been able to draw in weeks. &amp;#x200B; I want to leave. I want to somehow magically fix myself so I can start doing art commissions or get a job behind my parents back and move out. I am so tired, I've been doing my damnest to make things better. I can't do anything though. If I get a new job I risk hurting Mom, if I move I put all the pressure of taking care of my Bro on 2 depressed as fuck people with barely any support system, and I have everything I need to start an art career, I have everything I need, but I just keep sleeping or trying to distract myself from all this bullshit, and when I push myself I just feel worse. I have to keep trying, it's my only option to have anything I want in my life. I think I'm going to start depression meds, we didn't before because it's a long process of figuring out what works and what has bad side effects, but I don't know how much longer I can do this. I just want to feel like my head isn't full of fog and to hopefully feel a little better day to day so I can work to get myself and everyone else out of this."

And the fact that the last time I got therapy, my mother insisted on staying in the room and by the end of the session her and the therapist both had me basically admitting to being a shit persoooon! Fun times. And I know not all therapists are like that, but I just don't have the emotional fortitude to go through therapists to find one that would work. I don't exactly want to risk my mental state any more than I have to be, and it could be argued I'm doing that by not getting help. Whatever, this is ciruclar and I'm going to get on with it. I've never had a healthy view on what love and relationships are. I found out one of my parents was cheating on the other when I was 11. So I guess I learned pretty early on that love is bullshit (or at least my parents relationship, which they're still pretending is A-Okay, ten years later. They had a drunk argument last year about getting divorced and my mom was in 100% denial, it was rough to see). And then I got into this very toxic/manipulative friendship with this boy in high school who was hellbent on ""fixing me"" and making me a better person, to his own standards. I was head over fucking heels for him so I didn't see the damage he was doing to my self-worth. Even despite him telling me he manipulates people to get what he wants, I thought he never would've done it to me because I was fucking delusional. He made me wholly dependent on him and like I had to tell him about every bad thing I do and have ever done otherwise I'm a bad person. The further away I get from it, I realize it was an emotionally abusive situation. And his fucking voice is still in the back of my mind, telling me I'm awful and what he'd do and blah blah blah. So we move on to college and meet this girl. In college, I've been pretty damn alone thus far, having isolated myself completely because I'm deathly afraid of rejection. But I meet this girl and she basically says, we're gonna be friends, you don't have a choice. Like she physically restrained my bike at one point until I agreed to hang out with her. Which was bad. But quite frankly, I was so alone, and didn't have the energy to do anything about it. So we became friends and she ""fell in love with me"" (i'm bi) and basically became very obsessed with me. Shit happens, I try to reject her several times but eventually I finally fucking give in to get her off my back. Our relationship was awful, we screamed at each other non-stop, she cheats on me, the works. And I didn't realize how bad it was because I've never seen a fucking healthy relationship play out before. The dumb high school boy made me think love is supposed to hurt. And I feel like I'm just the type of person who was meant to be alone, who's mental health is better when they're alone. I just fucking can't open up to anyone again, give them all of me. Because I give them the opportunity to break me, to crush me. And I won't survive being crushed again. So I'll be lonely, but goddamnit I'll be alive. I need a fucking therapist. If anybody other than me actually read all of that, first of all, I am surprised, second of all, thank you."

R was beautiful, such a cute little face and soft skater cut hair- i admired everything about them and expressed that in every way i could, every single moment i could. but things quickly turned sour. after 3 months we started fighting with each other. it was really scarce, ended with me apologizing relentlessly and begging for forgiveness. this was something that annoyed them, i had a really bad issue with over analyzing every single thing they said, every change in tone, every dismissal. i grew borderline obsessed. i based my mood on everything they did and everything they said. if they were in a bad mood, i would be too. it was miserable and i always blamed myself for getting upset at everything, i always apologized and R would look down on me because they didnt see why i was upset. i tried so hard to help them understand. i ended up becoming sick and depressed and suicidal when i wasnt around them, because no matter what happened between us, i still wanted nothing more than to be with them. i expressed this, i told them they were my fp (favourite person, its common for people with bpd), that they could do anything to hurt me and id still look at them with stars in my eyes. i didnt realize the shit that entailed. around our 8 month anniversary i left home to live with them and their family. around this time, my nana was diagnosed with cancer and was set to move in. around this time, covid hit. i was selfish for doing the things i did. i fought with my mom, stopped taking my medication, fought with R, stressed everyone out who was in my life because i couldnt find happiness anywhere i went. i thought i knew everything, i thought it was smart. i passed up a guaranteed job to stay with them because thats where i thought i was getting the best life. i was so so fucking wrong. this is where things get uncomfortable. and i didnt realize anything was wrong until we broke up. every night i began hearing the same thing ""we never have sex anymore"" ""you dont love me"" ""you think im ugly"" i didnt understand what i was doing wrong. i did my best and tried my hardest to show my love for them, despite our constant quarrels. i did so in my words, my actions- i fed their 30+ animals every night, i would get out of bed and run up and down the stairs several times to get things for them, i would do EVERYTHING they asked of me because i knew it would make them happy. the only thing i couldnt do was muster up the strength to do those intimate things with them. i was so physically and mentally tired that i didnt WANT to do those things with them. and i said that countless times. but every night, i heard the same things. and then they began ignoring my reasoning. and had started to push my boundaries even further. before this, they would always be touching on me in public. undoing my pants, touching my thighs, groping my crotch (very aggressively, many times in front of their family and it made me so uncomfortable to the point of being able to talk to them, let alone look them in the eye), and every time i said ""no"" or begged them to stop, they wouldnt. they wouldnt until there were tears in my eyes and then theyd ignore me. claim it was because they were uncomfortable and upset with themselves, then jerk away if i tried to touch them. it made me feel embarrassed, like i said or did the wrong thing. this was something that happened constantly, with no end. i was always the one in the wrong. i was always the one fucking up. i couldnt be touched. i felt repulsed by the thought of being touched. i wanted loved and affection, not constant reminders that i wasnt good enought because i couldnt deal with my body issues. i wanted everything to go away. so i started crushing up and snorting my wellbutrin. that might be a story for another day, but im now taking it as im prescribed to and im feeling much better. &amp;#x200B; im home now. with my mom, my nana, my family. im happier, but i still fucked up. i experienced a year of shit where my boundaries were always ignored. i was being touched and groped by my partner without consent, i was being manipulated into having sex with them- when physically i felt like i was taking my last couple of breaths. i was always being made out to be the bad guy who didnt care about anyone but himself. and i thought it was okay, i didnt see anything wrong with it because we were together. i stayed with them. i almost ruined every relationship i had with everyone in my life. i let them use me after expressing direct vulnerability. because thats what partners did, right?"

Thanks for reading this mundane, everyday, wholly ubiquitous dialogue. After 6 years single (no dates, no physical contact or emotional connection with a girl), how can I trust my heart that a connection exists when it may simply be a reflection of my loneliness?"

One cannot be courageous without being vulnerable to the situation. Is this why its so hard for you to be honest? Honesty takes a huge amount of courage as you open up so many possibilities. If you are scared and feel fear, or have the need to manipulate, you dont open up you are robbing yourself of what can be. To be honest and show your vulnerabilities, you gain respect as you are showing your true strength providing truth. By living the truth without manipulation of reality is integrity. Could go on forever but what the main point is to cultivate and live out virtues, through that you develop ones moral character and that is what renders one as truly desirable."
32,vulnerability,offmychest,I blamed myself for years because of the way I felt growing up.,1,ht9b66,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ht9b66/i_blamed_myself_for_years_because_of_the_way_i/,2020-07-18 12:47:53,"Four years ago, I moved away to get away from my family. I want to be clear: they weren't abusive. I think I was spanked once or twice, but otherwise I was never physically harmed. The reason I left was because I had no (positive) emotional connection left. I felt so alone living in a house with three other people I'd known my entire life. Things were fine when I was young. Almost all my positive memories with my family are from when I was young. Somewhere around my teenage years is when things went wrong with us. I know I was an asshole as a teenager. I take full responsibility for that. But I grew from that too. I recognized when people didn't like what I had to say, I learned from it, and grew. By my late teenage years, I had changed pretty drastically. I became significantly more social in school, and finally felt like I was understanding how to talk to people. People were finally liking my company. But, for some reason, my family still didn't. Any time I opened my mouth I got negativity back. It was always something I said or the way I said it (though nobody could explain exactly what I was saying that was so wrong--nor did they explain how I could have expressed myself differently). I spent so many hours over the years replaying these moments in my head, wondering what it was I said or how I said it. One moment stands out--my mom asked what the burning smell was in the kitchen. When my sister answered, my mom responded normally; when I offered another thought (""maybe just crumbs at the bottom of the oven"") she blew up at me (""OKAY! I was just asking!""). That memory is probably the one I've replayed most--I simply cannot fathom what I did wrong here. I tried to reach out to them and connect with their hobbies. My dad was into guns, so I went to a couple classes with him. It turned out to not be my thing, but at least I reached out to him to try and connect. I don't have any memories of my parents reaching out to connect with me. They always said I was so independent. I don't know if I was independent or if it became a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. I just wanted to fit in. To be a part of the family. To feel like I belonged somewhere. I spent years trying to get that feeling, to no avail. It killed me to watch how easily, how joyfully my parents could talk with my sister. Why couldn't I do that? I grew up privileged in several ways. I always had food and shelter, and luxuries too. I had so many books and video games, my own laptop, a TV in my own bedroom, I had martial arts classes...And for that reason, when I left I felt so...ungrateful...? Like, they gave me so many things, shouldn't I be more considerate of them? Was I just being selfish? What was so wrong with me that I couldn't accept the way my parents showed love? And that led me to be angry at myself. To hate myself. Since leaving, I barely kept my job, and for the past few years I've done little more than work, play video games, and inhale obscene amounts of weed. I haven't loved or respected myself. I don't know what clicked, but I realized something this week: I genuinely tried my best to grow and be a better person. To this day, I don't know what I could have done for things to have gone better. I worked hard to constantly learn and grow. For some reason, that went unnoticed. Or maybe they saw it, and just didn't say anything? It doesn't matter anymore. The point is, I can blame myself for how poorly I've managed myself these past few years, but I can't blame myself for the way I felt growing up. I can't blame myself for the love I didn't feel. This is getting a little rambley, so I guess what I hope people takeaway from this is, if you're raising a child--toddling, teenage, in college, whatever--you need to keep kindling that love if you're to keep them in your life. Even when it's hard. *Especially* when it's hard. Because if you stop tending to that flame, there's no promise they'll tend to it either, and no promise they'll want to start it up again if it ever goes out. I guess that's true for all kinds of love--familial, romantic, platonic.... Children need love. Not just food and shelter and *things*. They need a community too. A place to belong and be safe with themselves and all the bumps they'll take along the road of life. They need a voice, a listening ear, they need someone to help them grow and to grow *with* them. You don't have to be a perfect parent. You can (and will!) make mistakes when raising children. It just means you have growing to do. *Show that*. Let your children see you grow. Let your children see you love and be vulnerable. If you're raising a child, they're learning vulnerability from you. They're learning love from you. Love only lasts as long as we care to kindle it."
33,vulnerability,offmychest,NSFW I had my first positive sexual experience!,2,hwjyep,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/hwjyep/nsfw_i_had_my_first_positive_sexual_experience/,2020-07-24 03:30:19,"Freshman year of highschool I was in a terribly abusive relationship with a guy who would force me to perform oral sex on him. It put little 14 year old me into a place of utter disgust with all things related to sex, and it took me three years to be okay with just simply masturbating. I hated my body, and I hated the idea of other peoples bodies, and it honestly wrecked me. I didnt have any healthy relationships after that, and I had just about given up on ever having that special connection with someone. Looking back, I was in such a dark place. I dont remember most of that abusive relationship (yeah definitely gotta get therapy for that), and it makes me so sad that at such a young age I had those awful experiences. But right now I am just *glowing*. I started dating a boy that I was close friends with in highschool and he has been so gentle and sweet and respectful with my boundaries. The entirety of this sexual experience he would repeatedly ask me if it was okay, and would tell me that I was in control and that I decided what would happen. He made me feel confident in my body and I felt sexy for the first time in my life. He put my fears at ease and everything just worked perfectly. I could laugh and have fun with it, and I didnt have the fear of being taken advantage of looming over me. It was a beautiful moment of vulnerability that I will treasure for a very long time. I've been itching to tell someone but I live in a very religious household/community, so I thought this would be the best place to share :)"

Im very introverted and I was still a virgin at the time, because I wanted to lose it to someone who I had a real connection with. So, I started talking to this guy and he was great, good banter, funny, sweet, we talked a lot and we exchanged personal things. I told him at the time that my grandma was sick with cancer, and he revealed that his dad had previously passed away from cancer 3 years earlier. I felt as if we bonded on that, and I hadnt felt close to a person in a long time. After about 2 months of talking we decided to meet up. We went on a date and had a really nice meal together, he even paid! After I said we could split it, but he insisted to pay. We got back to his car and then he asked if he could kiss me, I said yes and so we kissed. It was wonderful, he was so nice and it was one of the best kisses Id ever had. It felt right. We cuddled in his car for a bit, until he started kissing me again and got a little handsy, I wasnt expecting it to escalate and he realised I was a little overwhelmed because he stopped and apologised, I played it off cooly and said it was okay. He took me home after that and we parted with another kiss, texting each other right after he got home safely. We arranged to meet again, this time at his house - where he lives alone with his dog. We set to watch a movie and get a takeout, this all happened until he began kissing me on the sofa. It got heated and my mind began getting foggy as I had an idea of where this was going. Id explained beforehand when wed began talking that I was a virgin, hed said that he wasnt. So anyway, he led me upstairs, I was anxious af because Id never done this before - I mean I wasnt totally naive but still, I was a virgin, I didnt trust people easy, this guy was the first person Id ever been truly intimate with. I was very self conscious but he told me I was beautiful, which helped me open up a little. But heres the thing, when I get anxious, I shut down, meaning I dont talk. I dont know exactly how to explain it, but I physically cannot talk, its like a pressure on my throat, my tongue turns to lead. I told the guy that I have bad anxiety beforehand, but Im not sure he really understood what it made me do. Fast foward to the sex, it wasnt great. As I said I was a virgin, but I was pretty sure sex was supposed to last a bit longer than 5 minutes and only a few thrusts. He rolled off and closed his eyes and I just lay there, staring at him and thinking Im an idiot. I was so mad that I couldnt talk, that I couldnt move. Dont get me wrong, I wanted to have sex, but at the same time, I felt I wasnt in the right mind because I was thinking too much and it was just ruining the experience. I wasnt turned on at all. He tried to get me to open up after hed closed his eyes for a bit, but I still couldnt talk. After a moment we redressed wordlessly and went downstairs to order food. It was only after we spent a bit more time downstairs eating our food that I began to talk again, and then we acted like nothing happened. But I was still thinking about it, I was hating myself. It was weird, because we were laughing and cuddling downstairs after it, it was fine. It eventually got late and I decided it was time to go home, he obliged and drove me home - the car ride was weirdly quiet. Eventually we arrived at my house and before I got out I thankfully found my voice; I explained that sometimes when Im anxious I shut down and my voice just doesnt work sometimes. He kissed me and assured me that it was alright and he expects a text telling me all about it, since he knew that I convey my words a lot better over text. I nodded and kissed him back and told him that I had a great time. Because overall I did, apart from the sex - but I didnt say that. After I got into my house and got ready for bed, I messaged him to see if he got home safely. About an hour passed and he didnt reply, I didnt think much of it - he couldve already gone to bed - so I went to sleep and In the morning I messaged again. Still no reply. I started getting a little worried. Another day passed, still no reply, so I left it alone for a couple more days. Then I realised he was looking at my Instagram story, but not replying to my messages. I sent him a message on Instagram and he just read it, no reply. I was pissed. I sent him one more message, and then called it quits. I was devastated. I felt Inadequate, I thought hed ghosted me because he didnt like my body, or he was embarrassed for finishing so soon. I still dont know what the hell his reason is for ghosting me. Whether it was because of my anxiety, or my body shape, or his embarrassment - or just the fact I got played by someone who lured women in with false compassion and vulnerability just to get them into bed. Its just the fact, I thought I saw a relationship with this guy. I was even going to offer help with his house because it needed interior work. I actually liked him, and thats a rare thing for me. I dont even know what advice Im going to take away from this, I just wanted to get it off my chest, for anyone else who has been ghosted. So yeah, thats how I lost my virginity folks."

Now, with that out of the way, Ill give some context. At the time I was around 10 or 11, and I had just come back from my Moms/Stepdads house. Ever since I was born I would switch between living with my mom and dad every 2 weeks or so, depending on my dads work schedule (sometimes it was more like 3 or 4 weeks). My Stepdad was pretty shitty back then, and I had some conspiracy in my mind that he was using my moms financial vulnerability to keep her around (I couldnt see then why else she would stay, with the way he treated my and my half-siblings.) I had no friends in school, I was moving pretty frequently, as well as switching between households every few weeks. Also, I was quite overweight, and gaining weight fast. At this point, I was contemplating suicide quite often, however most of the time it was for revenge, and seemed like the only amount of control I had in my life. I had ideas on how to commit suicide planned out in my head, knew the location of a gun, pills, rope, whatever method I could choose I had planned out. I never made any attempts of course, but I had been putting a lot of thought into it at the time. At the time I felt my most vulnerable, I decided to speak up to my father instead of keep my thoughts festering inside, and I just got shut down. I didnt tell him about my suicidal thoughts, I just said something along the lines of I think I might be depressed. This is where he brushes it aside, says Im just sad, and doesnt ask me why I thought I was depressed. I can see why he would think that way, especially from being his age. Even nowadays its hard for me to imagine an 11 year old actually being depressed. Of course, after that I just bottled up whatever emotions I got, and tried not to let my feelings be shown. Thats when I turned to youtube, porn, and video games, and in a way, it worked. When I turned on a Jacksepticeye video, I was no longer sitting in a household where I had no real control over life. I was with Sean, watching him play whatever video game he was playing at the time. When I played Skyrim I wasnt u/Slidewhistler having to deal with a verbally abusive stepdad. I was Shadow, the Khajiit Thief Dragonborn in Tamriel. It was only a temporary solution, but I stayed in my temporary solution so long that my reasons for being (possibly) depressed went away, and by the time I got into high school I was able to start making friends, have crushes on girls, get good grades, and other teenager stuff. TL;DR I felt like I was depressed, it got dismissed, I turned to Jackaboy and Skyrim for help, and got through my dark times."

I was beaten by my dad and grew up with a deep down craving to be loved. High school wasn't kind to me either, i got bullied for being flinchy. I grew up feeling incomplete, messed up and angry at the world. I went to college with no plans for the future. I planned suicide for when college ended. My idea was that I could live my life a bit longer for those few years of college. I felt suicide was the only option because I was so severely mentally ill I couldn't hold down a job. During college I got given a therapist who was supposed to help me. Instead of helping me she groomed me. She promised me the life I felt unable to obtain myself. She preyed on my vulnerability and my inner child's need to be loved by an older woman. As soon as I graduated college she discarded me like I was nothing. I was destroyed by this. She spent years making me reliant on her and feeding me lies. I felt like hope was dragged from underneath my feet. I slipped into a long lasting depression and attempted suicide many times. I felt lost. I spent the next few years living like a loser. I never left the house. I still lived with my parents whilst my old friends got jobs, cars and bought houses. I never dated anyone else and barely showered. I felt like nothing mattered and stopped taking care of myself. My parents would shout at me and force me to eat. If they didn't do this I would have starved myself to death. Eventually my mentality shifted. I don't know what caused it. I think it was anger. I lost empathy for other human beings. In my eyes I wasn't a person anymore. People were something else that never showed me compassion. They were something that I began to hate. As you can probably tell I wasn't a nice person anymore. I became this bitter, twisted and malicious person. Someone who enjoyed seeing other people suffer. When i saw others suffering, it made me feel better for my own suffering. Eventually I began to rebuild my self worth. I started wanting things. I couldn't get the things I wanted because I had no money and this made me angry. I decided I would make money somehow and I would do anything in my power to gain it. I tried many plans, and most of them failed. The final failure plan I tried was to be an escort for older men. I felt disgusting afterwards and decided if I was really desperate enough to sink that low then I could do anything. Eventually an idea floated into my head. I would become a content creator for youtube. My channel was made and I began filming, editing and uploading videos. My content was sorta terrible, but my music choices were great and it made people subscribe. I began uploading more and more content until I got monetized. Eventually one of my videos went viral and gained 6 million views. I was getting over 1,000 per day. Was I happy with the outcome? Yes. Was I satisfied? No. I continued to build my youtube channel. My subscriber base continued to rise. People who had channels doing what I did were getting less success than me despite them doing it for longer. I haven't even been doing this a year. I made 5,000 in the first week of being monetized. I plan to enrich my life with this money. My goal isn't finished though. I wont stop until I have a fancy house, a nice car, a cougar girlfriend and a Norwegian forest cat. Anyway. I'm still pretty much a loser, but now I'm a loser with money. I plan to not be so much of a loser one day, but I have to continue to gain revenue first. If you read my life story, good for you i guess."

At all. I dont want to talk as if Ive been through a close sudden death in my life and that I in any way can understand how it feels to have someone leave you so quickly, but living in the same home as a parent youve never been able to have the kind of relationship youd hoped for and knowing you probably wont ever be able to get the things off your chest on both parts about each other is just a lot... my father was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer 2 years ago now. My parents have always been private when it comes to serious issues that happen between them and to each other and Ive always admired them in a sad way seeing how much of a brave face and front theyve both shown my entire life, and we have gone through some s h i t as a family. like I said, my parents are very private people so I have no clue honestly how long my dad had been sick by the time my mom finally came around to telling us about it (another thing, my dad isnt the communicator- its always my mom). anyway, he went through chemo, extreme medication, and now surgery nearly a 2 months ago now and things have just gone downhill from there. When he checked into the hospital for surgery he was around 180 lbs. today hes less than 140. Ive had to watch someone Ive always looked up to as a big (510 but hes always had extra meat in his bones) and strong person turn into a skeleton. he seemed like he was doing well on his birthday which also happened to be Fathers Day this year, hed managed to come downstairs and eat at least half a crab by the time he went back to rest which is a lot these days... now though he doesnt eat at all. On a good day he might drink 200 calories.. and thats a good day. Im not really sure what the purpose of me writing this post is, I just honestly feel like I have no one in my life right now I can properly vent to about anything at this point. My family isnt the most comforting, we love each other yes, but when it comes to hugs, touches, any kind of contact thats reassuring or just there with another- no, vulnerability doesnt exist and is usually ridiculed so dealing with heavy things like this have just made siting in the house throughout all of this very uncomfortable. my boyfriends mother passed away a month ago and considering the fact hes an only child I really dont want to burden him further with what Im going through and I really dont have friends Im 100% comfortable confiding in. I dont know, I just wanted to get some of this weird hazy feeling off my chest. Ill be 21 tomorrow and its one of the most defeating feelings feeling like this may very well be the last birthday spent with a loved one."

I suffer from extreme depression and anxiety, and as such have ended up placing an intense emotional burden upon my friend. I truly believe that, regardless of her feelings, she is better off if I remove myself from her life. I do not think she cares for me the way I do for her: I am always the one who initiates conversations and hang outs, and I think she tends to just go along to help my mental health rather than engaging with me because I am enjoyable to be around. As such, ending the friendship is easy: I will stop initiating. I know she will not. The friendship will die. She is the best friend I have ever had, and my favourite person. I cannot imagine life without her. All this means is that I am overly dependent on her. As much as this hurts, it is whats best for both of us, even if it seems bad right now.

Not in a traditional sense, they were not raised this way. The knowledge of God was present, however their renewed faith was the foundation of their marriage. It made their convictions stronger, because they found their truth for themselves, rather than it being handed to them. This lead them to ingrain in us from very young the ways of Christ. It ended up having the opposite effect for me. I don't subscribe the way that they do. I hold nothing against it, but when one is given a way of life in early years they tend to lean away from it. I see Christ as a profound teacher. A man who could see good in everyone, even those who were dispised because of their actions or even professions. This I can appreciate, even if I can't accept his claim to Godhood. To be Christ-like is not a bad thing, and I try to emulate what I can. I was taught, and to this day still practice, the golden rule. ""Do unto other as you would have them do unto you"". Its become second nature to do so. Unfortunately it's become an excuse to isolate myself. My disposition is naturally lonely. When it comes to my inner thoughts or emotions being inquired about, I can't help but be cagey. I've become skilled in dodging personal questions like jabs. Always thinking ""You don't know me, how could you possibly care?"" I dont want to be known. At least, not by just anyone. Why I feel this way I couldn't say. Something primal keeping me from showing my vulnerability, like an animal protecting its innards. Maybe somewhere down the line I decided that knowing people was overrated. I find most people to be extraordinarily fake, feigning concern or interest either to gain something or simply to keep conversation. I've always been quiet, and people take that as me being rude or unfriendly. The truth is I typically have nothing to say, not even anything trivial or light. To treat others the way I want to be treated, I leave them alone. If they speak to me I resond. If they joke I laugh. If they decide to unveil something personal or sensitive, I try not to overreact, but I also don't want to make light of it. I can talk about something deep casually, but sometimes that makes people uncomfortable. I can understand how a person feels. Sometimes I can even relate or empathize. But sympathy is something I've never wanted, and so I don't give it to others. But as far as I have seen, most people are not the same as me. They want to be comforted. They want to be heard and soothed. Sometimes they want to be embraced. My emotional truancy has hurt many people, and I wish that it didn't. It's distanced me from people I wanted to be close with but didn't know how. Relationships have never lasted more than a year. The last several were only a couple months long. It has made me somewhat isolated from my family. They try to understand and do their best to accept it, but I feel like there's some unspoken resentment. In the end I suppose my options are either to try and change or accept it. On one hand I could make the effort. strain my mind and body to break the rule so embedded into my being. I could be better off for it, learning to love and show affection. Or maybe I should accept the way I am. Maybe once I've embraced the way I feel, others will too. I'm unsure how I should proceed, so I'll just get high and ignore it like I usually do. But thats another issue to work on eventually I guess."

She crosses my mind sometimes and I have even seen her in a dream of mine before. When we were camping and having a group conversation she seemed to agree with me almost everytime I said something. And also, everyone in the group listed their ideal type in a girl/guy. And when she went, about everything she mentioned was something I have/am. This really made me think this is too good to be true. I find it skeptical and like a trap like shes trying to bait me into making a move on her so she can knock my heart out of the park.

I had put her up on a pedestal in college, lowered her from there lately but still saw her from rose-tinted glasses. She never said she's perfect and I have only myself to blame for imagining her to be someone else. True, our value systems are similar but I tried to impose those similarities on other aspects of life as well, just because I wanted it to be so. The first reality check was when she told me that she smokes occasionally. It wasn't smoking that repulsed me so much but the realisation that she isn't the perfect person I had imagined in my head. Next, I realised our aspirations are different, a lot owing to our backgrounds. She is self-admittedly quite materialistic, and it isn't like she tries to portray herself any other way. She is narcissistic, again something that she admits, maybe in a self-effacing manner. I don't have a problem with that since she is self-aware enough about it, but what I am more worried about is an excessive focus on appearances. I hope there isn't a lot of that. I wouldn't want to be with someone who cares too much about brands and labels, although I don't mind if someone just wants to be fashionable. Another cause of concern is whether she is self-aware of her privilege. That's something I really care about. She has told me about her mental health problems, though that's not something which concerns me. It only makes her more human and her willingness to reveal her vulnerability to me is endearing. I hope she turns out to be what I know of her. She is not perfect, as no one is, but I just hope she isn't much different from what I expect from her. Anyway, this provides me an opportunity to re-evaluate my position, realise I don't need to 'pursue' her, and that our interactions need to be more than mutual. If she wants to relocate to my country, I'll be more than welcome, but if she doesn't, I am not going to bring it up. There are a lot many fish in the sea out there, and just because I know her since 7-8 years now, doesn't mean that I have to hold on to her. In fact, it's a blessing that we are not dating, else it would've become almost an obligation to stick on. There is no 'one' special person out there, and these are just romantic notions fed by popular media. I shouldn't be closing my options by being blindly in awe/love with her. Anyway, we can't be dating unless we are physically at the same place. It's unrealistic to begin a relationship over long-distance. Until that happens, what I have is a window - to get my career sorted, maybe find some new people, until I always have the recourse to go back to her. If she finds someone until then, I'll just make peace with the fact that it wasn't meant to be. And also, she should feel equally strongly if it is to work. If she is happy finding someone else, then I can't really do anything, right? If you love someone, set them free. I shouldn't be having to convince someone that there exists a connection, it has to be felt mutually."

I grew up in an environment where vulnerability was seen as a flaw and so this is kinda odd to write. This morning I asked myself... Am I truly happy? And the sad answer was no. I managed to identify one of my bad qualities and that is being a people pleaser and care too much about what others think. I always strive to make others happy, in any way possible. This way, I feel some kind of reassurance that said people will not leave me, will seek my company or simply like me. This has been consuming me soo much and stopped me from doing things I liked in fear of what people may think of me. I replayed every moment in life where I tried my hardest to help people, attempt to be accepted by them while simultaneously sabotaging myself. It is sad. I need to learn how not care about what people think. What family thinks. What friends think. Ill give you examples. I find posting a simple picture on IG scary. Why you may ask? Well, Im afraid that I will not get enough LIKES and that people will look at those Likes and assume things. I am afraid of what they might think. Worse, if its a picture of myself, I overanalyse it and critic myself. I will feel disgusted, and compare myself to my friends and cousins, and wonder how amazing they look, even when I know theyre using some kind of filter. I am afraid theyll think I havent glowed up or having fun (silly Ik). I seriously started considering going to clubs and drinking ( I hate both) just to prove to people Im like them... I need to start telling myself I dont owe anyone beauty. I am afraid of joining new societies and clubs without atleast having one friend by my side ( I literally quit soccer because my friend did, how absurd) I would always agree to what people say and never challenge them. Theres some instances where I disagree with their views and opinions, but foolishly agree with them so as not to hurt their feelings. Again, in fear theyll think Im rude or something along those lines. To summarise, Ive been a sheep my whole life. :/ and its consuming me I DO NOT OWE ANYONE ANYTHING, I DO NOT CARE ANYMORE! I dont care about your filtered pictures, I do not care about whether you see me as ugly or not, do not give a bloody damn about likes or snaps. I do not care whether my life doesnt align with what you view as fun. I do not give a toss about whether you think I never reached my prime, I do not care about heather you think of me as the boring cousin. I do not care about having X clothes or X make up to seem trendy. I.DO.NOT.CARE. I will do as I please. If I want to post a picture of a horse because I like them.. I will. If I feel I look ridiculous while running.. I still will run. If I want to post a picture that shows my imperfections.. be sure I will post it with pride. I DO NOT CARE!!!!! Feel free to add tor own experiences"

45,vulnerability,offmychest,False accusations that haunt me,1,gx11da,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/gx11da/false_accusations_that_haunt_me/,2020-06-05 19:01:30,"When I was about 15/16, I had my first girlfriend, who was 13/14. We were together for only about 4 months. She had a lot of problems, eating disorder, self harm, taking drugs, maybe something like BPD which I can't be sure of but looking back it seems like it. The breakup was kinda fucked (including her spreading humiliating, but harmless rumors about me) and it was overall not a healthy relationship. When I was 17, so almost 2 years later, another girl, who was in my class, approached me. She apparently had hung out with my ex, who told her and a few other girls that I had raped her (which did not happen). She also told me that she couldn't believe her and all the other girls didn't really, either. I was weirded out, but pretty much forgot about it. Now I'm 24 and for a few years have been fighting depression, anxiety disorder, ADD (which I've just been diagnosed with and which shows itself mostly as OCD and obsessive thoughts) and dissociative episodes. For some reason, this emotional vulnerability brought this old memory back up and for the last four weeks I can't stop thinking about why she would have said that, going over every single sexual interaction we had in those four months in my head over and over obsessively (and painfully, as this time is not really something I want to think about much). I did not rape this girl. There was consensual sexual interaction, or if it was not consensual I could have not known as she did not communicate it in any way and any time we did communicate about it we both gave explicit consent, and there was no penetration at all. Yet my own insecurities and obsessive thoughts won't stop making me feel like I did, like I'm a rapist, a potential danger, like I've put a guilt on my shoulder that I can never get rid of etc, making me dissect every little thing I did back then. There was a single situation where we were consensually going at it, I touched her breasts, she didn't like that and said no, but I continued touching it, and we consensually (apart from that hand) continued the sexual activity. I deeply regret doing that, but in my mind that does not warrant spreading a rumor of having been raped; the interaction itself was always, always consensual. But my mind keeps hanging on to details like this one, or to the fact that we were both smoking weed at the time, constructing this obsessive narrative out of it that maybe she could not consent being high on weed; but I was just as high, and she would always ask me to get some weed, so there's no way it could be interpreted as me intentionally intoxicating her or something like that, which also never was my intention. But still my mind is so insecure because of all my mental problems that I cannot find a clear cut with this where I can just say ""I did not do it, this girl has some problems, that's it"", which I was able to for the last few years but for some reason not anymore. I've lost all confidence in my self and in my mind, and in me being a good person overall, making me vulnerable to these feelings of probably unwarranted guilt. I just needed to get this off my chest. I don't know what to do about all of this. Right now I'm planning to speak to a therapist about it and maybe actually texting her and asking what that was all about, but I don't know yet. Sorry for the wall of text."

You don't know that, but it was. You harassed me because I'm transgender. Your actions are going to haunt me until the day I die. It was in February. And I still have dreams about it. I lost count how many. It was somewhere between 30 and 45 of you. All banded together to make me hurt. You have no fucking clue what I was going through then. You have no idea how much worse I got after this. You have no idea the things I did and had to do because of this. Things that probably could have been avoided, at least for a while. But no. You pushed me to that point. And one of you still tried to have a go at me even after they were punished, along with some others. One of you apologized personally, but it was so obviously fake; my friend was right there talking about giving names to the principal when you apologized. And I know you all would have done it again, if those kids I barely knew didn't tell on you. The memories were in the background for a while; I guess I wasn't ready to really feel it. And when I did I couldn't stop. I wondered for a while, ""Why would someone think it's okay to do that?"" And then it came to me: You didn't think it was okay. You knew it was wrong. You knew it would hurt me. That's what you wanted. I was vulnerable. I was already an outsider; and now everyone was learning that I was also FTM. (That's female-to-male if you didn't know) and you saw that vulnerability as a chance to get your laughs. That day, I wrote, ""I'm just a person. A regular guy. Why can't anyone else see that? I just want to be fucking normal. I'd give anything to just be normal."" You drained what little I had left in me. I was at rock bottom, and then I fell in hole and YOU made me fall through the floor of that hole some more. For a long time, all I could think about was how I was going to get payback. I still think about it, but honestly I don't think payback would cut it. In the end, you're probably going to remain popular jack offs and no one will ever have a second thought about it. But I'm not going to be silent about it anymore. Because it was a fucking hate crime."

I want cuddles, I want to take the garbage out together, I want to kick the sheets off when he makes the bed too warm, I want to stare at his sleeping face. I want him to want these things of me too. I'm so tired of people telling me that being single is the time to focus on myself. What the fuck do you think I've been doing for the past *many* years of my life? I hike, I camp, I took a wilderness course, I picked up hockey again, I try out different hobbies, I travel alone, I eat alone, I cook, I bake, I socialize, I maintain a successful career, my finances are in check, I go to therapy, I try to be genuine in my social circle. I hate when when I say I want a relationship, people assume I'm trying to fill a hole. It doesn't mean I think it'll complete me. It doesn't mean I'm gonna sacrifice my life for someone else. It doesn't mean I'm desperate. I want it because I want to share my life with someone and vice versa. I'm on and off dating apps constantly because of the anxiety it gives me. ""You're too picky,"" ""You're not being open."" Fuck off. I'm trying to match with guys in and out of my comfort zone. I try and pull the conversations along while they just lie there expecting me to do all the work. I get ghosted after 2 responses, *maybe* I'll meet someone in person, and then it almost never gets to a second date. It makes me question if guys online even know what they want. When my friends tell me that I'm great, and that they don't understand why I'm single, I'm like yeah, I don't get it either. I just don't. I know I deserve love, and I know someone deserves mine.

Every step of the way, he was there. He was patient, he was kind. Not just to me, but to everyone. To all of his friends, acquaintances, coworkers, colleagues - everyone he crossed paths with was blessed to have him imprinted in their memory. I was cruel. I didnt mean to be. Some say it wasnt me, it was my mental illness. No one understands that my illness was me...not even he got it. He saw me before and after treatment; to me theres no difference if I still treat people like shit or like idiots or like untouchable gods 24/7. I had no patience or love for myself; I needed to find it elsewhere. He was that elsewhere. But I didnt deserve it. No one owes me kindness or patience when I treat them the way I do; lashing out, complete emotional vulnerability, treating no one as special enough to hear my problems. If everyone was worth enough for me to open up, then no one was truly worthy, they were just another blank canvas I could have painted upon, but decided to tear apart because thats what depressed artists do, theyre so edgy. Im not edgy, Im not avant garde, Im not aesthetic - I am depressed, I am sick. I need care. Im no different from the old crabby woman left alone at the nursing home, whom none of the nurses like. Of course my children dont visit me; Ill never have children. He deserves so much better than to be an emotional caretaker forever. Hes going to need to find someone who can return the love, because they love themselves. And I cant wait for him to meet her. Im so excited for that day."

I guess I just don't want to sound pathetic to them or to be a burden. Forgive me for my grammatical errors. As the title says, she left me 10 months ago. Our relationship was rocky at best towards the end, but I was blind to it. Despite the fact that I had caught her red-handed using Tindr on two occasions through the years, I had convinced myself that she was my person. I wanted to work through it to make us stronger. I was so wrong though. Last spring she had a trip planned to go to Santa Cruz with her friends for work and I was comfortable trusting her. Come a few days later, I miss her so i check out her Instagram. She was tagged in a picture by her friend that said she was in London. She said she didn't want me to get mad at her for going to London without me, so she lied. Some-fucking-how, after everything else, I^(tried to) let it go, Probably because I'm a fucking moron. After that I was highly suspicious about everything. I was always trying to interrogate her about what she was doing and who she was doing it with. I was always certain that she was lying. Why would someone stay with a person that they have no trust for? Someone whom continually breaks their trust in very serious ways? I never thought I would be a person that could look past those kinds of lies. I feel so stupid and weak. Eventually she just left me. She blocked my number and all my accounts on everything. She has never responded to anything I've sent her. She just left me a text that said that she'll always love me, but that she could no longer stay with someone that didn't trust her. What a bunch of shit. I don't know why i still miss her so much, but I do. It makes me feel... I don't know... sad? I don't even think of her that often. Not even daily. But its still like, whenever I have a moment of vulnerability, a pang of heartbreak shoots though me. It feels like I could cry right there. It feels like tears welling up, but when I brace myself for them, they will not come. Instead I just feel so alone and empty. Like nothing. How can I let go of this? I want forget. How could I trust another again while i remember?"

I knew better to date coworkers but I was in a depressed and lonely state at the time and wanted/needed someone to lean on. He was married at the time and has a now 4 years old son. I also told myself not to get involved with men with children and nevertheless married. Off to a great start right? First it all started with him pushing me away out of respect for his wife (he seemed so determined to love her) then he started opening up. He told me all the awful things she put him through and how he found out she cheated and with everything piling up over the years and not changing for the better he decided to leave. He slept in his car for a while then I told him he can stay with me (not I realize you attract people at the same level in like youre at) we were both feeling like we hit rock bottom. He was back and fourth about fighting to stay with her and choosing her but she wanted NOTHING to do with him (good for her) and I always thought maybe it was so easy cuz she decided to move on with the man she cheated with. I always wanted a good, genuine man cuz I know Im capable of a functional relationship despite my personal issues. So I took him in. He was heartbroken and going through a lot of emotions of depression and even talked about wanting to kill himself. I saw an opportunity to tell myself and him that I can show him better. Things between us felt so right. We talked. I understood what he was feeling to an extend cuz nearly every relationship Ive been in, theyve been unfaithful. I made it clear and explain over and over what I was expecting out of him and this relationship. He had talked himself up about how all hes ever wanted was simple. To be a husband and a father. He jumped into his previous relationship with his first wife so quickly. Within a year they got together, engaged, pregnant then married. I always told him that dating and for a period of about 3 years you really see someones true colors and if you see red flags then you know better and leave or choose to accept it but not expect much. We were inseparable. Worked together at the same place, a one hour difference in work shifts. Spent all day in bed, out and doing fun things. Everything together. When we werent it was constant texts and calls, FaceTimes filled with I love you and I miss you. So I felt pretty secure. I felt I was obsessed and nice to see the same effort in him to talk to me throughout everyday. I started to have problems with seeing red flags and feelings of being put aside when I saw him flirt with other women. He had such a cocky attitude. But he told me thats how he was and didnt see anything wrong with this or that and I was just being insecure. Eventually every feeling I had was a me problem. I started to believe that wed be happier if I looked into myself before speaking about things I felt I was being insecure about. Ive always had trust issues. Looooong ass story short, the month of his anniversary he wanted to keep busy and distracted so we took a week off and traveled and had fun elsewhere. It still wasnt enough cuz when we got back I felt a strong urge to go through him Apple Watch. Its was the first time I ever went through his personal property. I found texts to his ex about how they should work things out and missed her blah blah blah and he caught me there reading it and hurt. We talked about everything and I eventually decided we can work through it but I couldnt fully trust him and he was gonna have to change that. As the months went on I occasionally brought it up cuz I was still hurt from it. I struggled on a daily basis about staying in the relationship. I thought itd all be worthwhile and shows how strong we can come out of this and other things that may arise. Fast forward to two days ago. I was at work and a new hire and I were talking and at work NOTHING is professional or private so he knew we were dating. Anyways here its is.... We were bringing up things just talking and he had stated that heard about another coworker being pregnant with twins and that my man was the father. Of course I defended him and didnt believe it. It weight heavy on me til I got home. I one him up telling him I had heard this rumor and he said well people are gonna make up stories, nothing but drama in that place. I asked him again and told him he has to be honest with me and why would people come up with this idea. Why him? I told him its okay if he did but to own up. Well to my surprise he admitted it to be true.... Needless to say heartbreak. I asked for details and it killed me. I got this rush of motivation and energy to leave. I always wanted to move away from my small, toxic home town and I grabbed my clothes and drove all day to a whole other state. I was experiencing sooooo many different emotions. It was like a roller coaster. Feeling strong and proud of myself then in the same instant thinking I reacted too quickly and making a mistake. To sobbing and screaming my hurt feelings out on the road. To feeling numb. I had to much support from friends and family which never been so close to me before and their excitement made me feel I was doing the right thing. Of course he blew me up with calls and texts and I never spoke so emotionless to anyone like this before. Monotone and just dishing it all out to him. Im not necessarily strong enough yet to let him go and weve been talking like we did before all this and with promises of everything I want to hear and some I didnt but he was finally being open to communicating and being honest. We went back and fourth to decided what was best was to not have contact and move on cuz he didnt deserve me and I deserved better. Then next call or text crying about how much we loved each other and considering to work through it all. Im conflicted. Stupidly. And such a waste. I feel betrayed, embarrassed and not respected. I feel pathetic. I just want it all to stop and looked forward to my new life without him. But still showing my vulnerability for him. I know what I need to do. No question about it. He did it cuz he wanted to have some fun and excitement of the adrenaline rush thinking he could get away with it meaning if she didnt get pregnant not worrying at all about being caught and to be completely honest THAT type of thought process has me worried and hurts THEE most. We talked about moving out of state together. We talked about starting fresh together. We argued and nearly broke up a few times cuz of this and that. And I always begged and he was always so quick to drop me like I didnt mean anything. That hurt too. But now it all makes sense. He knew he was in the wrong and was gonna lose me but hoped I had enough live for him to work through it. I dont see how if Im not that strong and already throwing his stupid and careless previous life decisions in his face. I thought it was a five month secret saying he cheated five months ago (January, I believe) then not only knowing about her pregnancy but checking in on her (cuz thats what she requested) and he admitted the same month (remember, October) that he had made the mistake of getting caught messaging his ex when things were bad and we argued all the time he started talking to this other girl who got his number without his permission, from our office and bashing my name about how Im a hoe, but yet here she is, knowing were together. I dont believe at all he ever had any love for me. I was something he needed at the time and a distraction. And easy way out of his previous bad situation. I mean I cant really be too surprised. Talking and confiding in each other is how it all started. I dont really know what Im expecting out of posting this, I just need opinions. Or motivation or a hope that we can get through it. Whatever you (the reader) are thinking. And most of all I needed to get it all off my chest. And maybe even a journal entry. As a reminder later in life about what I endured and seeing whether we made it through or not. Any and all opinions are welcome. Thank you for taking out such time from your day."

You are absolutely perfect in my eyes. You are probably one of my favorite people to be around and to talk to and to be with. I sometimes feel like I'm suffocating in the feelings that I have for you. I'm so sorry she hurt you the way she did, but I'm here now and I won't let that happen again. I don't think you realize how much I would want to give you the world. We want the same things in life and honestly it just makes it easier for me to fall for you. When I think of you I can't help but smile because you are the cutest person ever. I get so easily lost in your eyes when you talk to me. I've had kind of a shitty life and it's only starting to look like it's getting better. I so desperately want to build a life with you. I will and can offer you the world and I don't think you understand that. I can be open and honest with you without fear of judgment. You have shown me so many cool things. You taught me to enjoy the moment, you cared when no one else did, you've given me such amazing advice that I will forever cherish, and you've helped me out when I had no where else to go. You sometimes sing songs in front of me (you usually just air-drum while you drive to the song). You get mad in front of me and let me comfort you. You cried in front of me and let me see the vulnerability you have. I probably annoy you with how often I flirt with you and compliment you but how can I not when someone so perfect is speaking to you on a day to day basis. When you flirt back my heart just pounds right out of my chest. There are so many things I want to do with you and I'm so excited to see where this all goes. Maybe we don't end up together. Maybe I am foolish. It doesn't mean I regret spending all this time with you. When I wake up and get to see you asleep it makes me happy knowing that I woke up first so that I could be the first to say good morning. I try to fall asleep after you that way I know you get some sleep and that you are resting nicely. I will always be here for you no matter if we end up together or not. Don't get me wrong; I will absolutely CRUSHED if we didn't end up together, but in the end as long as you're happy than so am I. I know that you're still healing and that's why I encourage you to take all the time in the world to heal because I will help you and I will be with you every step of the way. You told me that you didn't want to have sex with anyone because you're tired of meaningless sex. If I were ever blessed with the opportunity to sleep with you it would actually mean something. I just want to reassure you that everything will be fine and I will make sure of it. I don't expect anything in return because that's not how relationships are suppose to work. Thank you for being in my life. EDIT: I told you that I'm on reddit and I regret doing so because I kind of hope you don't see this, but if you do oh well that's out of my control."

I had always been reluctant to elude to the fact that he looked like greener pastures. But, it was his effortless, goofy, charming, &amp; inviting romance of life. He didnt seem to just live in the moment like most optimistic people, but he also found the detailed enhancements of them. Someone that could draw you in with just the way he described something, yet still paint a genuine smile on your face. He was an amorous Utopian. And he felt like the words that could define unexplainable art. I now realize the depth that I had let him in within that short timeframe as I type these words. Sometimes it helps to just put it out in the universe, or have something to look back on to remember the purity of your feelings when you go down the rabbit hole of self understanding. It also wasnt particularly a situation I could really open up to anyone about. He was my best kept secret. Id like to try to admit that there was regret, but truthfully, theres always going to be sweet bitterness. I think it was still too soon to say I was in love with someone I had never met physically, but for once in almost half of my life, someone helped give me hope in myself again. I had never PMd anyone from those NSFW subs before. Followed, yes, but I was kinda tequila tipsy &amp; full of temerity for some reason. And well, I had been smitten by his profile ever since he had given me one of those gold stars. I know, I know, juvenile. But man, it was flattering he even noticed me, &amp; there was just something about him. So there I was, alone &amp; inebriated, browsing like all the perverts in those subs, &amp; he popped up in my feed again. Tequila took over. And he responded. Instant connection. He made me laugh. I was already sold on whatever face appeared in that verification photo. But then, dem eyes doe. Holy. Hell. Strong, piercing blue eyes that could make me buckle &amp; fold, paired with a smirk I couldnt wait to turn into a full grin. Total package with pun intended. I wanted him. BAD. In my defense, I never knew what our definition was, despite me asking several times. I had reached out 1st with vulnerability, but he got personal first. Fast. It felt like a vertiginous rush, yet I strangely trusted him. Soon he was showing me pics of his kids, telling me (what I think) was his &amp; his familys real names, &amp; I found myself reciprocating. To full honesty. Something I never imagined doing, yet I found a friend in him too. He truly made me feel beautiful in a world where everyone else just made me feel sexy. NSFW Reddit was great at building someones confidence, but he built my spirit with all the in-betweens he would state. We both knew we had separate lives states away, yet we often talked of meeting one day. Anytime I feared we were going too far with personals, he made it feel as though we were still in a safe-zone. Kept assuring me that we should just enjoy each other. Whatever that truly meant, I did thoroughly enjoy him. Im not naive to the fact that he was definitely popular enough to be enjoying many different &amp; beautiful women. His Snap was public to his profile! He tried to state otherwise &amp; I tried to go along with my just-having-fun attitude, pretending life was perfect at home. I did hold that flattering best friend emoji on Snapchat with him though, so it was always a giddy feeling to know I was still continuing to be doing something for him too. I wasnt judging him for any extra curriculars, nor was I trying to change what we had. I was trying to keep it flattering fun, be self-aware to all circumstances, &amp; basically, not let my emotions get in. In reality, I knew there wasnt ever a true verisimilitude for us given the details, but he stayed on my mind often. I just kept telling myself our situation would lose its luster with him eventually. The bad part was,...I was beginning to really care if it did. We never video chatted (sent tons of snaps), but we did share our only voice call as one of our last communications. That part makes this all sting a little more. I honestly probably shouldnt have laughed so much. It truly is the most obnoxiously horrid laugh in the universe, but he even could make me go all snort-like. I knew after that call I mightve went too far. I didnt want to turn back though. Anyways, he deleted all of his accounts &amp; fell off the face of the earth recently without explanation. Just...gone. I would like to think that whatever it was had nothing to do with me. And thats just it. It didnt. Probably, just like many women before me in his several years of posting, I was of no significance. Only a nice distraction, which is what I thought he would only be to me. I knew this deep down, but he led me on in more ways than one before he became invisible. Maybe he didnt realize it, maybe he did, or maybe it was just the rush for him. Maybe it was just something truly tragic (I hope not). Ill never know now. And though I knew this part of our moondance was inevitable, dammit. Shit. Fuck. I at least wanted to experience him IRL one day! I couldve handled him just saying he was leaving. It wouldve sucked either way, but this sudden Casper move, hurt my Wendy heart. We both probably omitted or bent the truth on things, &amp; there was obviously a void or I wouldnt have filled it with him. We lived in a world together where we could be whoever we wanted to be. But, I honestly gave him the real me. Ill never give out more info than what I have, or even out his old profile due to the respect &amp; care still being there somehow. Plus, he could bury me with what I sent him. Im not a stalker &amp; wont try to find someone that clearly doesnt want to be found, nor reach out again to someone that plainly wanted to end communication either, if he ever decides to make a new profile. I highly doubt he would ever harass me in any way. I never saved his stuff, but I did humble my portrait drawing a little (just in case). Downside is, I can still remember very intricate physical details of him without reference. Tequila evidently doesnt bring out the best in me guys, so thanks bot friends for letting me get this off my chest. I plan to at least share my story eventually with some that are closest to me, but I still have some shit to figure out as I unravel everyones perception of my perfect life. It really is hard to be the smiley friend when youve been full of despair inside for so long. Still, Ill continue to wear a filter in my daily life. It might even appear that he didnt even phase me at all. But he did. He moved me. Life will go on, &amp; I have to move on without trying to replay what I couldve done wrong. Thats what I despise out of it all. I let someone I truly didnt know but for a short time give me more doubt in myself than what has already been burdened to me over the years. I let something not real, hurt me...a monster under my bed. But I was the damned one that invited him in. This is definitely one of those things that Ill bottle in &amp; send to the deep sea of my subconscious emotions. But as I ride the waves out there, Ill try to think of him kindly when I smell the blooms of my magnolia, or for making me realize one valuable thing while Ive been picking up my broken pieces this past year,...I just need someone who makes me snort-laugh again."
53,vulnerability,offmychest,I don't want sex as much as I am supposed to,1,hcglo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/hcglo7/i_dont_want_sex_as_much_as_i_am_supposed_to/,2020-06-20 15:39:26,"I don't express my love through words or gifts. I do say I love you and make gifts, but the people who are closest to me *know* that I make a consistent, everyday effort in showing I love them in many ways: time, company, listening, support, and small daily acts (like breakfast, cooking, a walk listening to music, etc). So I actually show it all the time, in every possible way, because that's just how I express my love. I say I love you and make gifts, but I actually never felt words or material things as resources through which I can express my love. In the same way, I don't express love through sex. I have never understood the concept of ""making love"" - I get why other people feel like that, with vulnerability and pleasure and stuff, but never owned it myself as a way of showing love. Or receiving it either. Even though I'm a very loving, understanding, affectionate person. When I get involved in romantic relationships, they are usually stable and, relatively and proportionately to my age, long term - I'm 18F and never been in a relationship that lasted less than a year. But those relationships were more like teen romances, so sex was not necessarily implied. In fact the few times I've had any type of sexual intercourse, did not take place with any of the people I've been in a formal relationship with. The things is, now I'm starting to *actually* date people. And for most of them by this time (18-20 years old, I'm about to be 19) sex *is* implied. Like there comes a time in life in which people assume that part of being in a romantic relationship is having this type of intimacy. Well. It sure as fuck is not the same for me. But I mean, I do feel sexual attraction, I do feel sexual pleasure. But I feel like I'm the other way around. That being in a really close, intimate, long-lasting, loving relationship with someone, means I don't really want to have sex with you because for me it's something so much more *banal*. So the more I get involved with someone the more I would rather talk, go to places, listen to music, be in peaceful company with each other. Cuddle, in an extreme ocasion of showing love in a physical way. But damn if I love you I probable won't feel like fucking with you. Because it's not my way of showing love and intimacy. Anyway, the takeaway from all this stuff is, I'm afraid I will never have a mature romantic relationships for never or rarely wanting to have sex. Or that it will just come to an end when I tell them that - which would be fully understandable because sex is a basic human part of most of the people I know. And I really hope things will find their way and that everything won't end up like that, because I have *so* much love to give and I am so happy when involved in romantic relationships and I really do take them seriously and always make my best for them to be nurturing for both of us and oh well. There. I said it. PS: I don't think I'm asexual because I do experience sexual attraction (although I often choose not to act on it even when everything is perfectly set and I could easily do it), and I experience sexual pleasure. I also don't think I'm demisexual because it's actually the other way around - the more I know and love you and feel comfortable with you, the less I want to have sex with you. But if you ever come across for a word for this feeling, it will be very welcome. TL;DR --&gt; Im afraid I won't have the possibility to be involved in serious romantic relationships because I never or rarely want to have sex with people the more I am close to them, love them and am comfortable with them."
54,vulnerability,offmychest,I (20M) recently discovered I put all women on a pedestool,2,hdftgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/hdftgm/i_20m_recently_discovered_i_put_all_women_on_a/,2020-06-22 08:19:48,"&amp;#x200B; I grew up thinking that the female sex is inherently morally superior to the male sex. It all stemmed from childhood. In grade school, I got in trouble a fair amount. I'd do stupid stuff, and would get scolded at by teachers and my parents. It didn't help that my dad was particularly critical of me, and I tried my hardest to be a good kid, so I internalized all the criticism as a reflection of my flawed character. It's not that I thought as myself as the worst person possible- I also noticed boys got in trouble so much more than girls. When you're younger, you base your worth on how much adults approve of you, and based on my observations, girls are better than boys. Girls in school hardly gets scolded at for wrongdoing, and the only explanation was that they just don't do wrong. I grew up with a female cousin, who I am fairly close with, and I observed that same discrepancy in criticism between me and her. My dad would point at her and compliment how she could do things correctly and I'm always screwing up in some way. I envied how she never got in trouble (or in my eyes, never did anything ""wrong""). Every single trouble maker I knew growing up was a guy. It didn't help that I only had male friends until college, so I never got to see the more personal side of women. The list goes on- there were a number of girls I met my age who I thought as literally perfect people. They seem like they are immune to any sort of criticism. To add, of all my friends, I'm easily the one that is takes the brunt of the jokes. Of course, the jokes don't personally affect me, and apparently I receive them so well that over half of my friends (and I have a decent number of close friends) find pleasure in relentlessly physically and verbally teasing me. Compared to women, I'm always screwing up in ways they never would. Here's a surprise though: none of this ever manifested in me having low self-esteem. I had HIGH self-esteem, and I loved myself for my flaws. It's just that I saw women as flawless compared to men. Of course I saw that some girls did get criticized and show vulnerability. But at this point in life, the mindset was already ingrained in me. I went through life thinking that most girls also believed they are morally superior to men- it was just a truth to life. It was unfathomable that a girl could want a guy's approval instead of it being the other way around. I grew up absorbing the message that a guy needs to be extremely talented, rich, smart, funny, maybe even a hero to earn a mere woman's approval (thanks Disney) and I often fantasize about having many a particular talent to get the attention of women. This insecurity has manifested itself in many ways even till today. I find something special about getting a girl's approval, especially one of those seemingly immune to fault and criticism. If they like me it means to some extent I'm quite as good as they are. On another note, I don't want a girlfriend ever, partly because I don't think I'll be good enough for any woman. There are far better men than me out there, who are smarter, more handsome, rich, funny, etc and by dating me they'd be doing themselves an injustice. I've never a had girlfriend and do not plan on it anytime soon. My ultimate sexual fantasy was to simply see a girl naked in a intimate setting. That is literally it. I realized why that was is because I believed a woman's nudity is sacred. It was the embodiment of all their feminine morally exalted character, and a woman showing herself naked is saying that you are on par with this. I know how this sounds- pretty toxic. I practically sound like an involuntary celibates despite not wanting sex or a girlfriend. It's shameful. What I really wanted was a sister, or a close female friend, to like me unconditionally and let me feel as though they aren't truly better are less flawed than I am. Within the last 6 months of hardcore introspection, I realized this worldview isn't a true one. Girl's don't actually feel this way, and as odd as it sounds, I really struggled to come to terms with it. I don't quite how to change this mindset even though I recognize it- it's so part of how I see women."

Or to hide our insecurities and vulnerabilities....We're just broken people who were raised by broken people. We're trying. Sometimes it's best to show our vulnerabilities to others, to our families, to our friends. Heck, to strangers. Even if the truth makes us uncomfortable, the best first step to recovery from the hell we are in, is to acknowledge that we are the horrible people too, we are these labels that we feared we would become. Once we've took this very uncomfortable truth in, then the journey to recovery begins. ... That's all. This is not my....ideology or whatever it's called.

57,vulnerability,offmychest,I do not deserve ti be sad because I have caused myself to be this way,1,hgr9ra,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/hgr9ra/i_do_not_deserve_ti_be_sad_because_i_have_caused/,2020-06-27 20:33:41,"I'm sorry if this whole post seems a bit messy, I'm writing this as I'm crying. I am also very insecure but I'm trying to tell my story as objectively as possible. English is not my mother tongue so I'm sorry for any poor grammar/wording. FOR CONTEXT: I am a 17yr old girl with cystic fibrosis (chronic disease/no cure), I have to inhale twice every day, take pills in the morning and the evening and have regular check ups every 3 months. Parents together, 2 younger sisters. These are some things I want to talk about not with the intention if getting sympathy but with the intention of getting to listen to the objective opinions if people that have never met me, I want to confirm wether I am being overdramatic with my thoughts without realising or if I truly need help. My whole life I've pretty much been a failure to my parents. It seems like a reach but after reading this you will understand. Firstly, in grade school - like everybody else - I had straight A's, the only problem I'd have was being unreliable and lying to my teachers about dumb stuff and being shameless. I was also very lazy, sometimes I just wouldn't study for a test/barely study because I'd rather do something else and I would get a C (happened in gr4). Scoring any grade below a B in grade school honestly just seems like a sign of low IQ to me. Moving on to middle school (year 5-9), my grades declined DRASTICALLY, i would barely ever study or do my homework and i would get Bs-Fs. My mindset was (and still is in a way but I'm getting to that later) that what we are studying in school is useless to me and that I'd never use it anyway. I would only pass because whenever exam season at the end of the year came around id put in a bit of work to pass the school year. My grades were always embarrassing and mediocre and I caused my parents to constantly get angry with me and I put them though the stress of having an embarrassment as their child. Then highschool came, I just finished year 11. I maintained the same behavior from middle school til now. Mediocre grades, not caring about studying, disappointing my parents. Another way I disappoint my parents is that I sometimes don't do my treatments/inhale and don't take my pills. It seems insane because my disease is chronic and my life span is already shortened but whenever my parents/doctors ask me why I am like this I can never tell them a straight up reason. But there is one, I genuinely do nit care, it is nit because I am suicidal or want to kill myself, I genuinely do not care and am too lazy to bring myself to do it. I don't see the point in trying to lengthen my life span if my early death is inevitable anyway. Back to the topic of school: Every year throughout my school ""career"" I'd tell myself I would do better the next year and finally start making my parents proud. This year I actually had good start but then corona came around and I just stopped doing my homework and school tasks. The past 3 weeks I had to scramble to pass again. I'm telling myself for my last year if school I want to get straight As but as hard as I want it to happen, knowing myself I don't think I'm going to go through with it, again. Also a short side step: I genuinely believe I have an extremely below average IQ or I have some learning disability, because I have never ever motivated myself enough to study more than 1-3 days for something (unless it was a maths exam) without getting bored midway through. I set expectations for myself that I doubt that I will ever reach. For example I am planning on studying something related to physics but considering that I've never done well in a math exam even when studying hard makes me doubt everything I've ever learned. What I do want to add is that whenever I actually try to do well in a subject I enjoy (eg physics) I do well. I'm sorry for the rambling but I had to get this ""off my chest"" (a joke without the intention of being funny). I have never ever told anyone this as explicitly as I have now. I am interested by the opinions of people I have never met that will truly give me an objective way if looking at the situation. Which brings me to the next topic I want to discuss. Emotions. My mother always told me that as a child I was always very quiet and closed off. To this day I am still the same. Throughout middle school I was very cringy and loud because I did not get enough attention for my taste, as soon as I though about how cringy I was acting I stopped. I was also suicidal and depressed at 12-13 (which is normal) but I just wanted to add that. I was an Infp my whole life up until year 9-10. My emotions would constantly get in the way of my daily life and break me down, so I put up a wall. I do not let them control me anymore but I feel like I've been breaking lately. My self esteem has never been as low as it is now and as much as I don't want ti admit it I need validation. I have never gotten real love from my parents, my father was always straightforward and did not express emotions. He is very sympathetic and whenever I need advice I ask him because I know that he will give me an objective answer that is going to help the situation in the best way possible. That applies to everything except for when my mother is angry with me. He protects her toxic behavior and it is destroying me. As I have already talked about my parents are constantly embarrassed by my grades and they get angry at the fact that I sometimes do not take my meds. My mother especially. She has threatened me multiple times, called me names, broken my phone, put her hands on me (eg soft chokehold, pulling on ear, slap on the wrist, belt, etc) in an attempt to turn my disappointing behavior around but it has never worked. What I hate most about her is her lack of understanding for others, she has never in her life wanted to admit that she is wrong, which I am so glad not to have. She does not express affection and she always expects me to be doing disgusting things on the internet (talk to pedos, etc). In a way it is my own fault because I have never in my life trusted her enough to give her my phone and go through it with my permission, it always had to be forceful. A few months ago she was very riled up and found out I wasn't taking my meds again. Throughout the years I have learned nit to be bothered by her words but the things she said really made me laugh in a ""you are fucking insane"" kind of way. She told me ""I will kill you before you kill yourself"". What I forgot to mention earlier, whenever she would get mad at me and I'd start crying she would tell me I do not deserve to cry because it is my own fault. I have learned not to cry during her periods of abuse. As I'm writing this I finally kind fo understand that that might be the reason for me not being able to show vulnerability in front of others. What I want to add, my mother has done a lot if things for me, she is not evil, she always does things for me and sometimes even lets me go out when I am not deserving of it. I am very closed off to her though (as I am to everyone) and she has a problem with that. What I would like to say again: I don't like expressing emotions and let them control me. I said I was an infp up until yr 10 then I became an intp. I always try to be objective in my way of thinking even when I end up looking like the bad person. I am good at admitting when I am wrong and putting myself in other people's shoes and understanding their thought process. For example, I don't think my mother is bad person inherently even though I really want to, I think she has no other way of getting me to do things other than being rough with me, hence why I think something is wrong with me. To sum up my personality ONCE AGAIN: i am lazy, i do not care for anything, i am apathetic and i dont like dealing with my and other people's emotions and my friends consider me funny sometimes. I stopped crying throughout half of this post, I want to genuinely hear your thoughts and objective opinions. Is there something wrong with me? I don't want sympathy, be as harsh as you can. Whenever people give me sympathy without any information that can help me grow I don't want to listen. Please tell me what you think is wrong."
58,vulnerability,offmychest,I don't really know what this is.

H, as I'm going to call them, isn't anyone romantic or anything. They are my best friend, my sibling, my (genetic) cousin. They are probably the person who knows me more than anyone else, ever. They have seen me at my lowest of lows. Highest of highs. They've been part of my worst experiences. My most memorable. We share the same humor, we share so many memories together, and they are the only person in this entire fucked up family that I've felt have given me a semblance of kinship. But, there has also been so much toxicity. So much pain and trauma and anger and it's inexcusable - on both sides. As both H and I have said before, it takes three good to at least make a slightly bigger crater than the bad deed, and the bad deeds have been so bad. I've found myself sitting, thinking back to my past, reevaluating my choices, reminiscing on experiences. I've always known I wanted to recreate myself, to run away and disappear. To become myself and distance from the pain that not just my family had caused, but the pain that I have caused myself. Either by allowing people constantly into my life, knowing that they weren't good for me, or at the malicious and aggressive self destruction that destroyed the good, hurt the innocent, and molested my own self into something warped and scared and in even more pain than I was previously. I have stuck with friendships that did nothing but hurt, manipulate, and abuse, simply because I didn't know anything different. The friends I chose were always someone I could relate to, in some degree. But they were dealing with so many if the same problems, that we were amplifying so many of our own toxic traits and cruelties. It has been hard to realize that while similarities are familiar and often feel safe, on introspect, they force you into the box you thought you wanted to escape. They strangle any of the good that you have left, because the environments that you have both had complete control and no control over whatsoever plays by vile and malignant rules. The only way to survive is to give control to the game, to play by its rules. Lest be damaged far beyond your cracked skin and frayed seams - or worse; never make it out. I can't play by this game anymore. Not after I've fought so hard to become someone who is good, and kind, and forgiving. I know I have a long way to go, and that I have so many tools that I need to collect and actively use before I can become who I crave to be. I want to be happy, and to make other people happy. I want to be safe and be a safe haven. I hate that I often only focus on the negative, that I have allowed myself to be enveloped in an abusive and cynical cocoon, one in which you may never leave once comfortable - it will slowly digest you, liquify your body to reach for your soul. I've seen what this does to people. I've experienced what these people are capable of. I can't allow that cycle to continue. However, the hardest part is realizing the the person who means so much to me is inhibiting that growth. I look upon them and I see a television screen, replaying all of our hostility and manipulation. Abuse. I see so much pain and anger, and I cannot try and be ignorant to the notion that it's tearing me apart, piece of ragged piece. I never intended on isolation. I just never realized how many toxic people I had surrounded myself with until they weren't there anymore. Until I had no one left. It makes me think internally to who I am. To what I've done. And now, as we reach the one person I thought was untouchable, I see them standing there, blocking the road to my self reconstructionism. I fucking hurt. Like the last part of my soul that I protected, hidden behind my chest plate, has been revealed. An exhibit behind shattered bone, torn skin, soaking blood. Wrapped in barbed wire, begging to not be touched. I know that it's just fear. The fear of vulnerability. The fear of losing the one thing that truly anchors me to my past. I never believed in soulmates. If I did, I prefer to think of them as more than just a singular individual, but as many. People that you come across and you meet, you fall in love with, you care for, and who eventually takes a piece of your soul with them as they continue their journey, but the hole they created is filled with them. With their memories and their stories and their impact and their beauty. Marked and scared and filled with imperfections, but so genuine and human. It's a hauntingly alluring idea, one I wouldn't see as being so bad if proven true. I just hope H knows that, if anyone could be one of mine, they were one. The hole that they created was giant, and it felt empty and cold. But as I move to the next road, I realize that they had filled it perfectly. Petals and scars. Neon lights and bruises. They are all there, and there is nothing I would rather have to fill it. No one else could have. Neither mortar nor paint could hold the same memories and beauty. It contradicts itself, doesn't it? How I can care about someone so much, to hold them so fondly to my heart, but I say that I can no longer have them in my life without causing more damage and inhibited growth. Everyone thinks that you can only leave someone if they've truly damaged you beyond repair, or that you have to hate them, or at least feel nothing, to end a relationship. I disagree. Relationships come and go like the tide. They will come into your life, bringing new ideas and thoughts and experiences. And they will leave their mark when they go, littering upon your shores rotting plastics and vibrant shells. And that's the beauty of it all, isn't it? Being able to see the ugly and the beauty. The heart wrenching confrontations and the comforting peace and safety; those experiences are unavoidable with anyone you meet and decide to share a piece of your life with. It's the scariest and the most remarkable part of life. For that enlightenment, for the memories and the kinship, I thank you, H. So, so much. I love you. My brother, my best friend. I hope you're life is as beautiful as you deserve. Low Roar ""Please Don't Stop Chapter 1"" ""Half Asleep"" ""Phantoms"""

And hes so INTERESTING. I love to have deep conversations but I, sadly, dont get to have them often enough. But while I really like this guy, I dont like everything he says or does. It particularly pissed me off when he started rating a group of girls who are sisters by how hot they are (and dont worry, I always call him out on this behavior). This isnt the first guy that Ive been attracted to like this either. Im always attracted to the know it all kind of guy who just says and does what he wants and doesnt really care what others think. I think this is because Im naturally a really caring person, so in a way being with this kind of guy is my way of fullfilling that life that Ive never made for myself. I know Im a lot better than to be attracted to someone like this! Im smart, kind, thoughtful, and strong. I deserve someone who cares more. But its like I cant HELP that I like him! What can I do?

I asked him for space and he blew up my phone with 30 messages, ranging from ""you're giving me flashbacks"" to ""please don't leave me"".

I spent the morning of my 20th birthday at a crisis counseling meeting to figure out how to handle a situation where someone is suicidal because of YOU. *Do you know what it's like to feel like it's your fault someone gave up on living, because you weren't talking to them? It's crushing.* It was hard coming out because he kept trying to interact, but it died down. I told a member of leadership and they didn't believe me, chalked it up to ""oh, its just \_\_ being \_\_\_."" I didn't feel connected at all to the club, and he lied to a friend about what happened. I decided to leave that club. While I'm not a part of the club anymore, I'm still part of the groupchat because I have a few graduated friends in it. He posted Yvonne's story about how she's been harassed by Fed, and ""Fed GTFO, you hate to see it"". I got panic attacks the past school year whenever I read his name or he tried to talk to me because of the same behavior he's looking down upon. There's even a paragraph from Yvonne's story that could be used to describe him exactly. I'm just incredibly upset and angry. Sorry about the long post."

Acting cold and unaffected and robotic did help me through a lot of shit in my past. But its like thats all I am now. With the exception of three of my best friends who I absolutely love, everyone else leaves when they get bored, usually very quickly. I dont blame them. I dont ever show them any vulnerability that would make them really connect with me. But what am I supposed to do? Just respond to open up! with a story about the most tragic shit Ive ever been through? Something about talking about my traumas has never sat right with me. It feels like Im exploiting my past pain in order to win someone over. It feels performative in a way. Honestly, the things that make me who I am arent my passions or dreams or talents. I dont know if this makes sense, but when I think of *who I am*, I identify more with the person inside my head that tells me how to think and feel than I do with the things I do in everyday life... I guess the way I see it, I am my thoughts, not my actions. Maybe thats the problem, I dont know. But what I struggle with is that the way I think has been constructed by all of the worst things that have ever happened to me, and obviously those things dont come up, like, ever. So how is anyone supposed to ever know me? God, its frustrating"

Cried my eyes out and the only thing I wanted to do was reach out to my mom, we were never really close for these kinds of things. But in that moment of distress all I could think of was I wanted to be comforted by my mom. Even though I was doubtful that she would understand me, I called her up. I told her what happened and I just kept crying. This was the first time I felt her being gentle towards me opening up, she asked me what was wrong, she asked me if things ended on a bad note. I told her no, I told her how hurt I was and how painful this process is for me. I had to brief her of what happened and how it led us to end the relationship. And surprisingly enough, she understood. She comforted me and told me that its okay and that there really are just somethings we cant do right now. She told me that I shouldnt block my ex, that I should be more understanding towards him and the whole situation. She told me all these other things like, look on the positive side of it, and how beautiful it was. Heartbreaks come and go. Maybe shes not always the best at explaining things but at that moment where I showed her my vulnerability, it was taken with care and compassion. Something I thought I would never get to experience with her. I still feel sad about my relationship but really, it feels like a mixture of comfort and sadness and how I think I can get through this. After all, things will get harder before it gets easier"

I hated how the men would do something so vulgar and disgusting to her and others. It made me think about real life scenarios, and that shit really makes me feel like shit when you hear it on the news. Many stories of women speaking up from a similar form of it makes me proud of them for telling their story but hurts me a bit of what they went thru. I wish women could just somehow protect themselves so none of that shit ever happens. I wished they were buff and muscular that way men wouldnt do shit like that.

I feel like there are two versions of me. One tries it's hardest to help others and do the right thing, desperately trying to block out this horrid version of myself, feeling guilt every time any thought related to it comes through . The other brings thoughts of horrid things such as murder, torture and rape, and a strange bliss when thinking about such things, even something urging me to commit these things at some point. I feel like I am losing my mind. I do not remember feeling like this until 1-2 years ago. I don't understand why these thoughts cross my mind, for I feel empathy and compassion, and yet I have thoughts of such horrible things that would do nothing but hurt others, and yet bring a twisted pleasure to this bastardized version of me. Most of the time I find myself feeling the most wondrous sensation of happiness because I know that I helped bring somebody happiness or helped them out of their own struggles, or even the smallest thing such as making them laugh... and at other times I feel my mind drift to dark places when a person's vulnerability is shown to me, such as how to manipulate them to my own benefit or to drag them down further. Or when I feel desire, how I could get away with using somebody against their will to fulfill my dark desire, or even bringing my mind to even more depraved, sickening places, which I really feel like I should not get into, as I feel immense shame just thinking about it now. I feel nothing but hate for this side of me, and no matter what I do it always seems to come back to haunt me. Sometimes when I look in the mirror, I feel like I'm no longer looking at myself, and instead I'm looking at this dark part of myself. Hell, even now I feel like erasing all of this and just deleting this account. But I just can't keep this within me any longer. I can't tell any of this to anyone I know, because even telling them half the things I keep within me would change the way they see me forever, and even cause my life to fall completely apart. I feel like a fucking monster and I don't want to feel this way anymore. I want to help people, not harm them. I want people to remember me fondly, and I don't want to be remembered as some sadist or killer if I eventually can't contain these urges inside. I feel like this is the first step to overcoming this, and I pray to whatever god there may or not be that I can be rid of this demon inside me before it causes me to do something I regret. Am I crazy? The thoughts that cross my mind shouldn't happen in a person that's sane, right? I'm sorry if this is hard to read, as this was all just a sudden stream of consciousness, spurred by a certain set of events that eventually inspired me to attempt to get this off my chest in an attempt to help myself get whatever this is away from me. If I can remember, I will check this thread and maybe respond to any comments it gets. Thank you for reading this all the way through if you did. I appreciate any responses I may get."

I hate cheaters, but I hate homewreckers more. For someone to keep preying on someone until their relationship is having a hard time so that you can pounce on a vulnerability, I hope you get karma. How do you look at your own kids and teach them to be honest and kind when you have no morals? I hope you find someone that you love more than yourself and then have someone wreck that for you so you can feel what kind of hell I am going through."

I hear your voice in the back of my mind. Your touch transforms my skin into something that is no longer mine. I wasnt even at double digits before petals were plucked from my pores and crumpled, discarded. One by one. You acted as if what you were doing was normal, how casually your hands crept towards me. How often had you done this to act like it was no big deal? I was wearing corduroy pants that were a size too big for me, so I was constantly pulling them up. I wore my favourite shirt at the time, cotton underwear, odd socks in white sneakers. I, barely pubescent. You, old enough to be my father. How on earth was a young girl to react? Scream? Cry? Fight? Remain frozen in fear? I hate myself as parts of my flesh no longer belong to me. Theyve been claimed by someone else, stolen from me, replaced with the empty words you used to hush me. Like a tiny bandaid over a huge, gaping injury. I still feel like washing my hands over and over but I can never seem to clean the feeling. Your wife was in the next room, she was just a couple of months away from giving birth to your child, yet here you were, your focus on another child as you forced her hands down the waistband of your underwear. A child, whose childhood you selfishly stole. Silence does not equal consent, not that consent should have mattered in the first place, I was not an adult, nor a teenager. I was nine years old. A child. I was still in primary school. I hadnt started growing breasts, I hadnt gotten my period, yet here you were with your hands down my pants. My body still remembers the painful feeling of stretching, tearing. NINE. You repulsive, vile human. As a police officer, you should have known better. You were supposed to be someone that people can trust. Do you know how much you hurt me both physically and mentally? Are you even aware? Do you know how agonising it was to go to family gatherings and act like everything was normal for years? Do you know the shame I feel? I cant even bring myself to tell my parents. I feel like theyd never forgive themselves. They tried so hard to protect me. As a teenager, I wasnt allowed to sleep over at a friends house if they had an older brother or if my parents hadnt met the father. I didnt have the heart to tell them that it was too late. Im an adult now, but I still havent worked up the strength to tell my family. I dont want pity, I dont want people to tiptoe around me or be overly cautious of what they say around me. I cant bring myself to tell people. Ill no longer just be me, Ill be forever haunted by my association as a victim and that thought is unbearable to me. Ive already had part of my identity taken. I am so much more than a victim. I refuse to be identified by something that wasnt my choice. The first time I even tried to be intimate with my boyfriend was when I was nineteen. Ten whole years since you laid your damn hands on me. What should have been a moment of chosen vulnerability with someone I trust and love had me reduced to a scared girl, having a panic attack, sitting on the bed in my underwear, crying, shaking, nose running and mascara streaming down my face. My poor boyfriend was confused and very concerned, he asked if I was alright and held me. I knew I had to tell him that it wasnt anything he did and I knew I had to tell him what happened to me. He held me and stroked my hair while I cried and unloaded ten years of repressed emotions. With each passing year, I feel more and more disturbed. I see children who were my age when it started and they look so, so young. I hate how youve forced your constant presence in my life even though I havent seen you in many years and I hope that one day if I do see you again, Ill be brave enough to tell you how much I despise you."

I am in college and a bit too conscious about my sexuality here. Mindful in the way that people know about me being a bisexual guy but at that time I wasn't sure that they would be comfortable with me dating a guy. Due to this, I wasn't available to him during the relationship as I was busy hiding my feeling to both sides of my world. Our time together was great. And he is the most adorable guy ever. He loved me, indeed. We called off the relationship in January, but last night he asked me to give us another chance. I wasn't sure that I could keep him happy in future so with a weighty heart I said no to him. He might hate me for being this asshole, and I probably deserve that treatment. I just want him to be happy. I don't want his forgiveness because I probably don't deserve that, and I am not going to pretend to be someone else to anyone or myself from now on. I have had a serious commitment and vulnerability issues, and it has affected my relationship with him and to myself a lot. Also, I wasn't sure about saying no to the relationship, because even now we might have had a chance. He was ready to take that but what made me sure about ending it is that if I say yes now and later it turns out that I am back to not being a nice guy to him, it will be bad for both of our mental healths. While I was dating him I was too naive with my ways. I was dumb and I regret being one."

I was bullied verbally and emotionally, both in-person and online. I hate opening up about my health. I'm very quiet and reserved, and I suck at speaking up for myself. Whenever there is a problem, I usually try to fix it and handle it on my own. If I can't solve it, I give up because I'm so afraid of judgement, and that it shows my vulnerability. I don't ever speak to my doctors or therapists. I have selective mutism which basically means I shut down whenever I get anxious or I'm in an uncomfortable position. My mom always talks at all my appointments, and get confirmation from me that what she's saying is accurate. I just nod my head ""yes"" or ""no."" In 7th grade, things just took a turn for the worse. After all the years of taking the bullying, I couldn't handle it anymore. I wanted to d\*e. I was suffering in the silence, and I didn't want my mom to know. I thought the feelings and emotions I felt were normal. I thought that everyone wanted to k\*\*l themselves or SH. I felt that everyone had major depressive episodes, so I didn't think much of it. As I kind of hinted before, I HATE going to doctors. I hate expressing my feelings to complete strangers who are being paid to fix me up. I attempted many times until the ""one."" I won't go into much detail due to it being triggering, but let's just say I needed to be put in the ICU. Years and years later, I've received countless of treatments, from antidepressants, to tons of psych appointments, to specialized therapy for trauma. There have been times where I relapsed, but I come back stronger after each one. I still struggle with speaking up at appointments, but I've worked my way up to a whisper!! I know that doesn't sound like much, but coming from not talking at all and avoiding eye contact to a low, soft whisper is a huge step for me. I don't really know what the whole point of this post was but I'm kinda proud of myself for doing that lol My message to those who are afraid to speak up, or who are struggling mentally: you are amazing. You will get through this and you are not fighting this battle alone. I know it seems like nothing will ever get better, but it will. I love each and every one of you."

We both have. I'm so happy I never saw you again, because I don't know if I'd be able to be mature. On the off chance you read reddit: I'll narrow this down enough that you'll know who you are but no one else will. I googled it, there are a ton of people who have a very similar life to you: You're a Minister's wife. An upstanding member of the community. You look like a model. You published a book. You have a dream family (at least, outside looking in. I don't know what happens behind closed doors.) Why did you have to come for me at one of the most vulnerable points in my adult life? In secret, at that? What possible threat could I have possibly been to you that you would get to the level of trying to fuck my LIFE life? I'll do you the favor you never did me and be 100% real and authentic with you: Yes, I did talk some minor shit behind your back. Specifically, I remember telling a coworker that I didn't know if I could trust you. I told them you seemed sneaky. Like you might be a snake. I also told them it seemed like you were trying to take your ministry to the job instead of doing the work functions. It seemed like you were leaving us out to dry, and you reminded me of aspects or church culture I grew up with that I didn't care for. They said the same and we commiserated with each other on having the same gut instinct, but I will take full responsibility for leaning into that conversation. I'm an adult, I can take responsibility for my words and mistakes. Do I regret this venting session? Yes I do. I always regret saying anything like this at work. I try to avoid it, and this time I failed. Because I didn't wanna be that kind of person, I decided I wanted to talk to you. At one point, there was some very real tensions between us I could sense. I decided to talk to you directly and see if we had a problem. I wanted to not continue the pattern of venting to coworkers and be direct instead. Make sure that any issues we had were solved between us and I could look you in the face and say anything I ever said about you to you. You said no, we were fine. You said you had things going on in your personal life. At my lowest points in life, I have a problem with word vomit. I know this. I know it's a bad thing. It's something I have to mature past. After we 'made up' because you said you didn't have any beef with me I made the mistake of being very real with you. This was after you put in your two week notice. I told you that job was killing me (it was) and the only reason I stayed was family pressure. I told you I didn't know if I could take it anymore. I told you I was in a very dark place and felt like I couldn't leave because I needed to prove to my family I was responsible. You went behind my back and told my bosses. I know you did because one of them told me...who luckily I ALREADY TOLD I was looking for work and needed to leave for personal reasons. This was a big risk on my part, but I was at a point in my life where it was either get out or end up in inpatient psychiatric care. Possibly one of the darkest points in my life. They already knew, and thank God they understood. I got the vibe that most of the staff hated me anyways, but AT LEAST they understood enough to let me go and help me find a place I would be healthy. You took my vulnerability. You took one of the weakest points in my life. A time where I felt completely alone and outcasted. You took that and you became a silent predator. You were the snake I always knew you were. You can have your good, Christian life. You can have you beautiful face and body. You can have all of that. I won't lie and say I don't want to be beautiful, but I don't want your life. Why? What threat was I to you? Why did you have to try to fuck up my life at the level you did? I am no angel, but I did not try to destroy your livlihood and your world. Yes, my life is not picture perfect. I am a very flawed being. I am an average, kinda chunky woman living a basic life with a lot of baggage. I was a problem child who learned the hard way and made a lot of mistakes in the past. But I am something I don't think you will ever be: Real enough with myself to acknowledge who I really am and look at the fucked up mistakes I've made. Im brave enough to look at myself and see the real me. I see myself with scars, shitty decisions, reasons I'm actually kind of a bad person sometimes, and all. You will never be the real you to yourself. You are a snake. You are a snake trying to act like a saint."

Backstory: My best friend has a girlfriend I've never really liked... She has never seemed genuine to me, but I attempt a relationship with her because she's my best friend's person. Anyways, she had told me about this women's circle (it's the fucking women's circle loom.. google it. literally the first result is about it being a pyramid scheme which I failed to do until after reading through all of the bullshit rules for the group) she was a part of &amp; I've been having some crazy happenings in life lately &amp; it honestly sounded so sweet. She explained that to be accepted into the circle one must ""gift"" a total of $234 (this is no small fee) but then presented it as you getting a refund or ""gift back"" of the same amount once completing your stages or whatever. Anyways, I was just genuinely trying to get to know her better &amp; decided why the fuck not? A group of women to learn from &amp; through &amp; with... sounds pretty sweet for the shit storm that my life is currently... so I invested. Immediately there are all of these rules &amp; regulations for the group including reading an 18 page document &amp; then watching numerous videos all within a time limit of 48 hours. but so then, you also have to post an intro, your first embodiment video, &amp; respond to people within the group. what's next? you ALSO have to wake up before 8 am to participate in a burn ceremony through zoom... already, I'm way in over my head. so whatever, i'll read through what I need to, I'll watch what I need to watch. I'm being accountable right? setting initiatives &amp; truly being present... oh, I'm falling for the scheme already. IMMEDIATELY the documents stating that you can't post/talk/share about the loom by any means as ""it's easy to judge the movement if one has not experienced it."" then it goes on to say that after your first week in, to progress you must invite &amp; welcome two more members (of which also have to ""gift""). I mean, I honestly stopped reading at that point as I was disappointed with myself for not only falling for this, but also so angry that someone who consistently claims care &amp; love for me would invite me into such a fucked up scheme. at this point I'm not sure what to do. I ""gifted"" her specifically, &amp; since we do personally know each other I don't think it's wrong to ask for that money back. but then again, I feel bad because a part of me genuinely thinks she just really believes in the power of this scheme... she's a victim herself. but still, it IS a scheme... In my mind, it's a huge judgement call on her character whether she'll refund me my money or not as it's already soured from this entire situation. Additionally, I keep thinking about what to say to her but each time I find myself getting more &amp; more enraged... listen, she's my BEST MOST CLOSEST FRIEND'S GIRL. It's not that I'm scared of his reaction to it all but rather I just want to make the situation easier for myself... civilized conversation vs. me going off on her kinda deal, we're adults after all.. I think I have a good grasp on what my response will be but I just don't know how I'm going to get over the fact that she did this. I already had such uneasiness over her, &amp; this essentially solidifies it. I'm just so upset this happened, that she'd even get me involved in such a thing... literally taking advantage of my vulnerability over my current situation in life &amp; putting me in this position. just sucks man :/ TL;DR my best friend's girlfriend took advantage of my feelings &amp; involved me in a pyramid scheme &amp; now I'm really angry/upset/sad &amp; am not entirely sure how to approach her now."

Ive become reasonably successful in my field without anyone knowing what happened to me, its my worst nightmare that all that barbaric trauma becomes part of the narrative - I want to be known for being talented and skillful, NOT talented and skillful in spite of everything that happened. I hope that makes sense. Fairly new to reddit, and I find this anonymity fascinating and Im using this as an exercise in vulnerability. I wont name it, but there was a huge crime drama in the early 2000s, and while I dont know if this is how they wrote all of their episodes, the season 1 finale is directly taken from a rather public and terrifying stunt my father pulled. Ive watched the episode a few times (its difficult to get through, for obvious reasons) and the level of detail is downright scary. The actor they cast looks like my father, the story that leads up to the incident is exactly what happened in real life, even the vehicle involved is a close copy. It was all over every news station and newspaper in a major metropolitan area, so all of the information they pulled was publicly available, including photos of me that the news station apparently thought it was a good idea to post onscreen while covering the ongoing situation - who does that to a kid? I digress. One day I hope it can become another wild story for a cocktail party, but even now at 28 years old I cant imagine telling people to their face - in order to disclose the unique and kinda cool thing that a TV show stole from my life, I also have to disclose what my father did. Four hundred people were basically hostages that day, many of them children, and I really do not want to make light of that. It was traumatic enough for me watching the live coverage of it on the television, I cant imagine what it was like for those people. Anyway, my father is quite dead now so I hope it doesnt go against any rules talking about him. He took his own life about a month after this incident. He also very much made himself a public figure, but if this needs to be taken down I understand! Whew. That was uncomfortable to type out. Vulnerability isnt my strongest virtue, but I refuse to live my life being closed off and untouchable so Im practicing! Thank you for providing a space to do so. Howd I do? And does anyone else keep mum about major trauma because theyre afraid their successes will be tainted by having that as part of the narrative? If you have any insights as to why people (or just me) might do that, Im certainly open to hearing. Thank you kindly."

76,vulnerability,offmychest,I'm scared of losing the one person I truly love,1,glgbi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/glgbi3/im_scared_of_losing_the_one_person_i_truly_love/,2020-05-18 00:30:29,"I had a dream that I lost him. That he found someone new who was much funnier, interesting, and beautiful. He was happier with this new girl best friend. When I tried talking to him, he told me he didn't want to talk to me anymore. He stonewalled and refused to let me say anything to revive our friendship. Our friendship was completely over and I was heartbroken. It was the worst dream I ever had. Even now that I've woken up, I'm crying. I'm so scared of losing him. He's the one guy who has never judged or criticized me. The sad part is, I don't trust in the fact that he'll never leave me. Because in my subconscious, I feel like everyone does. They get tired of me and bored of me. Last night, I was reading his texts to me and reread the part where he said that I was his best friend and that I will always be his best friend. A part of me felt contented, but another felt terrified. I don't know if it's because I've had trauma from past friendships or times where people have turned their back on me, but I felt like I could lose him at any moment despite the fact he told me I couldn't. I feel guilty that I don't believe him. I've believed everyone else who's hurt me and as a defense mechanism, I'm left not trusting the one person who I should trust. But I just can't do it. If I let myself relax, I feel as though he'd leave me. These past few days, talking to him has reopened some wounds of mine. My fear of vulnerability, intimacy, and abandonment have resurfaced and I showed them all during our conversations 2 nights ago. I'd never felt so anxious in my life. Sharing how I felt about myself to him was the most terrifying thing I've ever done. I was scared he'd leave me when he saw how insecure I truly was. My fear of losing him is negatively affecting our friendship. I'm starting to not trust him despite his constant reassurance and because of that, I'm not being myself as much (i.e. sending pictures and videos of myself). So yesterday I stepped out of my comfort zone despite how traumatic that is for me and sent him a selfie and a video of me playing the ukulele and singing. Thinking back on it, I'm absolutely cringing. But I don't regret it. I'm trying to show him that I am trying to fix this part of our friendship. I'm trying to show him that I want this to be two-sided, not one-sided where he's the only one sending me things and actively making the effort. But I'll be perfectly honest, every single time I do, (I feel) I run the risk of losing him all over again. Yet, he compliments me and reassures me he's not going anywhere. I don't want to admit this, but I have to get this off my chest. He complimented my selfie and said he liked my freckles. I don't have freckles, they were part of the Snapchat filter. All I said was thank you, I didn't even correct him. I've never sent him a photo of myself without a Snapchat filter and the guilt is eating me alive. I'm scared that if I showed him my true, authentic self without any filters, he'll be turned off and much worse, he won't trust me anymore. This whole thing has spiraled into chaos and thinking about it gives me so much anxiety. What breaks my heart the most is that I feel I keep much more secrets from him and that he's always telling me the truth. It's unfair, it's so unfair that I'm being this selfish and cowardly. That I'm not telling him the whole truth even when he is being honest with me. I truly appreciate his honesty, every single time, but it makes me feel bad that I can't reciprocate fully. He tells me these really difficult things to say because it ""didn't feel right keeping it from me"". I cried a lot yesterday and the day before. Both to him and my mom. I don't believe them when they call me beautiful. It breaks my heart every single time they do. One because I don't believe them and two because it makes me feel like I don't trust them which is the exact opposite of what I want to do. It makes me feel like I'm a bad friend/daughter if I can't even be myself to the closest people in my life. I'm trying. I'm trying to get better. But I'm scared that if I don't soon enough, he'll move on and find someone else. Trying to fix problems in a relationship/friendship feel easy when it's the other person's fault, I'm easily able to forgive them and give them the benefit of the doubt. But this time, I'm the one at fault. And even with all of the strength I have, I feel like I'm not brave enough to be myself. Not in the way he wants me to be. And that's not fair to him. Which is probably why I had that dream this morning. He found someone who could be themselves and were effortlessly beautiful both inside and out. I reason with myself sometimes. Sometimes I prepare myself for the worst and imagine scenarios in my head where he leaves me for someone else, and I try with all that's in me to be happy for him. Because isn't that what I truly want? Right now, I'm just really scared I'll be replaced. Because I don't feel worthy enough to be his best friend. I feel like he could easily find someone better. Why me? Is he even telling the truth? Is he just saying all these things to get me to send nudes? These questions are intrusive, and I feel guilty even typing them down because I don't want to ask them. Even though I know deep down he isn't just using me. And it says something about me. It says I don't fully trust him. And that, that is what hurts me the most."

I know Im addicted, I know its ruining my life and I cant bring myself to stop myself or to ask someone for help because Im afraid of disappointing the people I love. Im pretty sure I checked out on life around November last year. Since then I pretty much stopped going to my classes (Im a sophomore in college) and Ive been failing and completely unbothered by it. I feel as though I am dangerously apathetic to my life and future plans crumbling around me because of my own reckless actions and still nothing. I think Ive disassociated. Im pretty sure I have a number of undiagnosed mental illnesses and the only reason Ive never seen a psychiatrist is because Im not a citizen so I cant afford it without insurance (which I dont have) and i cant ask my family to help because theyre not exactly people who ever believed in mental illness let alone therapy. My whole life has been one tragedy after the other I started wondering from a very young age if god hated me (very religious family). Im an only child and my parents got divorced when I was 10, after around 6 years of witnessing my dad physically and verbally abuse my mom and dealt with his version of discipline which was a fancy way of calling his cruel and unusual punishments for doing things like playing on his phone (he was cheating on my mom and didnt want me to see), for that he put me in the dog kennel with our police trained Rottweilers. I was 6. After they got divorced and she got custody he would stalk my grandparents house and we wouldnt be able to go home so we were homeless for a while. We moved cities after a while and he forgot about me and remarried and started a new life. Just as life was looking up my grandad passed away. He became like a surrogate father and I loved him more than anything. A year later my mother passed away and shortly after my nana fell terminally ill. That was the second time in my life when I disassociated I think. I dont remember much from then. At that time I also happened to be in an abusive relationship with someone who I had basically attached too much importance too (on account of losing so many people close to me) and he used that vulnerability to manipulate me to the furthest extent, knowing that I wouldnt end things because I didnt want to be alone. I was only 18. I finally got into college and I moved out of the country and started a new life. And for the first year, it was perfect but I dont know where it all went wrong in the second year. Im in a loving and healthy relationship with the greatest person Ive ever met and hes an angel to me and Im doing what Ive always wanted to do in college and with my life but for some reason my life feels completely empty. Once I started using it was such a fast fall into addiction and I stopped caring about everything. I stopped working out, I stopped caring about school, I stopped hanging out with most of my friends and I barely call my family back home. Everyone in my life thinks Im so strong and such a success story, that I made it through life despite everything that was thrown at me and I just feel like Id be letting so many people down if they knew my reality. This is long but I really needed to express myself. Quarantine and isolation has really made me come to terms with my current mental state.

Every time I am sad, you make me feel ashamed for my feelings and say I am always complaining. I know youre not the type to multi task but I ask you to spend more time with me and youd rather sleep because youve spent all day running errands or working with your dad. Every night I wait for your phone call, but you are too tired to dial me and in the morning when I ask, you say you fell asleep or you were tired and needed rest. I try not to get upset and understand and not talk much about it because it already happened and I cant change last night but in the beginning, you gave me so much of your time. I know things change because were getting older but your life style is still the same. You use to called me even when you were tired. You would call me at the time you said you would. You didnt want to sleep without me, you would share music with me, tell me you miss me during the day without me telling you first. We would eat together, watch movies, make jokes and dance, agrue but you knew how to make things right instead of pushing me to the side, say hurtful things enough to make me cry. but I feel like this is all fading. Weve been together for 5 years and you think what youre doing is fine but this routine has come to a point where I feel like you are getting too comfortable with the way youre handling our relationship now, you forget I still need and want those things because you are not physically here with me even if you dont need them or feel like doing it or because you cant make time. you tell me youre not perfect but you make mistakes but You use to want to know eveything about me, and now that you think you know everhing about me, you use my weaknesses against me even if you dont realize it. you think you are right when you yell at me and Im quiet but its only because I know you dont take rejection well or criticism so I sit there feeling sorry for myself and asking why did I even start this? Now he hates me. I blame myself... and every time I cry, you watch me and listen until my tears are dry. Doesnt it hurt you too at all to see me have nothing to say anymore but break down because I just cant take it anymore? I asked you what does it mean to put me first? And you said it means you call me after youre tired, truth is. after you get into bed and sleep for a couple of hours you then call me but sometime tell me you fell asleep. And I do believe it all. I feel your sadness You get when I dont want to have phone sex with you because you give me this look on face making me feel like I can never satisfy you because I said no and when you leave to do whatever after we have phone sex, I feel used and abandoned. When I open myself up to you vulnerably, and send you paragraphs after each, you reply small and make me feel worst that I ever said those things to you but only out of fear of losing you because of the way I feel... and you never try to make me feel better or compromise with me how to make things better for me. I know I should take care of myself when youre not around but I cant help it if you said youll do this for us and not follow through. You use to tell me to stay with you, and you use to say things will be alright. Now you tell me to leave you alone, fuck off or to leave your side if I hate it so much and this happens so much, I started to believe this is just who you are and if I love you, I should learn to live with it. but I dont want to live knowing you dont see how you treat me. You think I am overthinking things but you are a different person now and I dont think you see how hard it is for me to adjust to who youve become. and I still love you but Im more aware of who you are. now You know how to wrap me around your fingers and make me feel sorry for feeling all of this inside me. The worst thing is, I cant even tell you all of this because I fear you will explode, say I doubt you, make me feel bad about myself. Tell me to leave you. Instead you dont take the time to understand, wow this is what my girlfriend is going through. if this is how I make her feel, what can I do to let her know I care about what shes going through. But you dont. You reply with oh, or you dont reply at all. you dont ask me, what can I do to make you feel better. What is it that you need from me? What can I improve on? Im sorry you feel this way, Things will get better. I wish you would ask me these things, because these were the things you use to say to me when you dad would force us apart, when your family threaten me, when everyone didnt want us together. now that no one is involved in our relationship, you have really shown me who you are and how you handle my vulnerability. Of course there are times where I am happy, we talk about our future, family and kids and places and its only because you have talked me out of it all and made me believe you and say that I am only overthinking things. At times I know when I am overthinking things but other times I know I have a soft spot for you. Things werent always this way. You say I lack trust and understanding but god knows I have trusted you and understood you more than I ever have these 5 years. I love you but I know you wont change."

A lot of people have a misunderstanding of what it is. Im not some egotistical apathetic robot. Yes I do lack empathy, but I have some and I do have an inflated sense of self but that doesnt mean I dont have insecurities. I see people have genuine connections with people, and I wish I had that. I truly do. I have friends, but I tend to put on an act, when in reality I have distain for them and use them at my disposal. I have a paranoia, distrust and extreme vulnerability issues. I lie, I cheat, I manipulate. I will leave the party if I dont have at least one persons attention at all times or if I havent been complemented. People will talk to me and I put on a face like Im interested and listening, but thats only so theyll be interested in me. I dont want to be this person, but I am. Most the time I feel dead inside. When I found out that narcissism can be linked back to insensitive parents and a hostile childhood that clicked immediately. My therapist said I have vulnerability issues bc I could never be vulnerable with my parents. I tell people Im bipolar bc it explains the mood swings and rage issues and if I were to tell them Im a narcissist, chances are theyd run away screaming. I have felt love before. I know its possible for me. But its how quickly I fall out of love that is scary. I dont want any one to think Im fishing for anything, bc believe or not, Im not. I just wanted to get this...off my chest... its been bothering me a lot lately and its something I realize now I want to work on but I havent had the money for a therapist in a while."

I miss your laughter. Even the laughs you have when you bust my chops. I miss your teachings; about this company, our careers, life, and the world. I even miss wondering if you were truly listening to my stories, since you interrupt them so often with your excitement and zeal. But deep down, I know that you were. Especially since you started taking my advice, following in my example. You have no idea how happy it made me to know that I had an impact on your life beyond the walls of those hotel rooms. I miss our musings, our talks. I miss those the most. Switching constantly between the deep and the philosophical to the stupid and the mundane. But there was never a moment between us that was stupid or mundane, was there? At least for me, it never happened. I miss your passion, and seeing how mine affected you so. I miss your touch. On the outside you like to show toughness, an untamed nature. Tough, aloof, untamed, a closed book. You are all of these things. But your touch, it shows an entire different side of you. With me, you are also tender, open, sensitive, and most of all, vulnerable. And I am with you too. You reached a deep level of vulnerability in me, peeled away at layers and walls most aren't even aware of. And I let you. I let you in such a short amount of time, in so few instances. That's one of the things that amazes me the most. How were you able to get in so quickly? I felt a connection to you almost instantly. We shared a bond that was beyond the physical and obvious. There are very few instances in my life where I've fallen asleep being held or holding someone, prior to you. Cuddling, I hate it. I enjoy my space, and knowing that I can move easily and freely as I please. Literally and figuratively. Yet how many nights have we fallen asleep without holding one another? Right now, I can think of none. And in this restless night that I write this, I cannot stop thinking of that one night in New York City. I was restless, and riddle with anxiety. You put my head on your chest and held me in your arms. I couldn't sleep and kept you up, as I have in times before. Yet you held me. I was stjbbong and wanted to push you away so I can lay squirming in my anxious restlessness, deep in my negativity. But you held me there, and I felt safe with you. I've always felt safe with you, and I miss that. I miss all of these things. Every single moment of the handful of fleeting nights we shared. It was clear from the beginning that this was to be temporary. And I never could have imagined from our first night that I would end up feeling this way. I'm not even sure what it is I feel. I've told myself that I can't fall in love, we can't allow that. I'm not certain if this IS love. The only thing I know for certain is that I have to feel all of this from afar. Be whatever I am to you from afar. I know that this will pass and all of it will end, just as every splendid night that we shared. But for now, I miss you."

Grew up in a pretty unstable household and developed a numerous amount of issues as it progressed. Low self-esteem, a temper, abandonment issues, etc. Ive noticed that emotionally immature authority figures like to act like my father. Hear me outIm not just saying Im some rebel who likes to disobey men as a result of some deep-rooted daddy issues. The daddy issues are there for sure, but its not that. In fact, its one man in particular. My coach. He took advantage of me when I was really going through a hard time processing the terrible things I went through as a kid. He wanted to be a father figure to me, and I let him. He got me to open up about abuse and then invalidated me for it. I know it sounds like hes just trying to help me out, but I hate that he wanted to get so close to me. He went on motivational speeches, long paragraph texts about how strong I am, lots of sentimental shit that makes me truly uncomfortable now. I finally realized I was putting him on a pedestal, as if he could replace my real father. And he was trying to make me be the daughter he never had, somebody he could fix to make himself feel better. I took him off of his pedestal and now, he sends me texts like, I miss you. Well, I miss the old you. dude what a shitty thing to say to a teenager? Anyways, just wanted to get that off my chest. I dont need you to act as a father figure because it will make you feel like you saved some troubled daughter you never had. (By the way, Im a good student. Not trouble in that sense.) I know some of you wont agree with me, and thats alright, but I just had to let it out."
88,vulnerability,offmychest,Abuse after an abusive relationship,1,fygd8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/fygd8h/abuse_after_an_abusive_relationship/,2020-04-11 00:04:08,"Sorry this is going to be a long one but advice and perspectives are much appreciated. A year ago I was in an abusive relationship during which I was subjected to a serious sexual offence. It has been a long road to recovery, part of which has been to try to pursuing justice. I have found the hard way that justice for these kinds of offence is sadly elusive and the processes that should bring about justice and safeguard others serve on to re-traumatise and re-victimise. As a result Im about ready to give up on it as I find it so distressing. Recovery has been slow as very few are able to understand. It's a mercy I don't begrudge people, but it does isolate me. The best way I can describe to people who dont understand what Ive been through is that its like Ive been murdered and Im still alive. I cant get away from this body. Its like being trapped and I feel like a ghost. I want to get away from my body as it disgusts me now. It's like my abuser has not only got away with what he has done, free to do it again, but I feel condemned to harrowing way of living. Therapy has yielded little results for me so far, so I have been trying to cope by throwing myself into work to distract myself from the trauma. Its helped but its not been healthy. But I can only do what I can do. As I have busied myself, I thought I would try to move forwards by meeting new people. Just over a month I met someone on a dating app. We had an instant connection, and for the first time, I went a day without thinking of my abuser. I thought Id never feel anything for another man again. Im not going to lie, there were flags but I put them down to being paranoid and needing to relax as I am such a ball of anxiety these days. The red flags included the instant connection, the constant stream of gushing about how beautiful/hot/intelligent he thought I was. It was always about how much he wanted me to the point that he said that he didnt care about his own gratification. After hating my body so much I can't begin to describe what a draw this was. Worst of all was that he is a 'comedy writer' Early on he began making rape jokes, even his tag on WhatsApp is wondering if he seems a bit rapey. I said that I understood nothing was off-limits for comedians but asked him not to make those jokes with me. He stopped, and I contextualised it a bit and he was absolutely outraged on my behalf. He then went on to tell me that he was once accused (falsely) of sexual harassment and that women like that made justice more elusive for people like me. It was like he understood which in my experience was rare. Worse still is that he had this huge story about his circumstances: he told me that he broke up with his ex six months ago. They'd bought a house together and were trying to sell it. In the meantime, he had bought his own place and allowed her to stay there rent free. I did't think this was too unusual as I know people who live with an ex for financial reasons. Plus they have a dog together which is a hearing dog. He went on to say that practically he found things difficult as she was still in love with him, and he was wanting her to move on first. I asked about why this was and he said he was the one to break it off with her because she wanted marriage and children when he didn't. He reassured me further and said that although he didn't want to hurt her by telling her about me just yet, they had not slept with each other since June - which I guessed was three months before the relationship ended. He said he never wanted to repeat that experience again and although he loved her, he didn't want her. He kept saying he owed her a lot as she and the dog had saved his life. I started to question a bit but it led to a falling out so I decided that it was his mess to deal with and that I would not get involved with it and didnt like to pry too much. There were broken dates but all with seemingly legitimate excuses (he'd broken his leg so couldn't drive etc). I began giving up on him which was upsetting as he seemed so right in other ways, and then he surprised me by visiting me. I was nervous, and he kept commenting about how ill-at-ease I seemed. Well yeah because he took me by surprise by going straight in for a full on kiss when it was the first time Id met him. He apologised and said that he couldnt help it as I was so hot. I was on my own in the house, and I made some tea so we could sit and chat. He'd barely touched his tea before he said he was keen to see the house. I shouldnt have done it because it was becoming clear what he wanted. However, hed also given me this story about how he couldnt get 'hard' and that I was the only one who could do it for him in a long time but not to expect he could perform when the time came (wed been very flirty in text - putting it mildly). I thought perhaps I could be ready as he made me feel comfortable with my body and kept saying that there was no pressure if I didn't feel like it. He was all over me, kissing me and gushing at me. On a couple of occasions I had to pull my tights back on because I wasnt comfortable with what he wanted to do. It was stop/start as he tried to get me comfortable. Im not going to say it was non-consensual but it was pressured. I tried to warm up and managed to enjoy it a bit but not fully. I could not let myself go. The worst thing is part way through, he took off the condom and I froze. I couldnt believe it and he kept going. It was like I wasn't really there. Afterwards I said that I was shocked. I was confused by what had happened. He knew from the start that I was desperate to avoid a pump and dump and he reassured me constantly telling me that there was no way it was a one time thing. He was making plans with me, but a week later I felt him go cold. He told me his girlfriend had declared her love again and felt guilty so perhaps we should be friends. Fear gripped me and I flipped out. He kept saying that his ex couldn't find out about us as she would be hurt and he couldn't do that to her. He placed her feelings higher than mine even though he knew how vulnerable I was. I felt exploited but he said he hoped I was ok. I wasn't. I took an early pregnancy test and found out I was pregnant. I asked him to come to me and to watch me take the test (very specific reason why I asked this) but he refused. He started blocking me and I panicked so I went with my housemate to visit him at his house. Surely an ex wouldn't mind that. I got there and found out the ex was actually his girlfriend (although not anymore he said) and there were kids (although Im not certain they are his). Naturally, hes furious with me as I exposed him and now he wont speak to me at all about any of it. He had initially said he would speak to me about the pregnancy and agree on how to support me so he unblocked me and said he'd be in touch. The next day he was in touch but only to tell me he'd called the police and was done. I don't know what happened in those few hours to change things so dramatically. I don't know if she kicked him out or not. The girlfriend, although not a fan of me, said she believed me and told me to leave. He told her he'd signed up to check his 'bits and bobs' worked and that he'd used me. I was devastated. I said nasty things to him because I essentially told him I couldnt handle being used from the start and he said it was the furthest thing from his mind and hed always be there for me whatever. I dont know if he was waiting to be free of her or not. He said I would ruin his life if she found out. He couldnt hurt her as she saved his life after attempting suicide. I dont know whats real anymore and Im devastated, back to square one. Im so hurt and confused. Im furious he took advantage of my vulnerability and then I think it's my fault for pushing him away when he had a complex situation at home that he might have resolved so he could be with me. He said he loved her and that we weren't and never would be in a relationship now. The worst thing was he said he used me in front of me and his girlfriend. I feel violated and cheated. She said she believed me but wont pick up my message about how to move forward with the pregnancy and neither will he. I messaged to say sorry and to throw myself on their mercy. Im catapulted back to square one and I cannot think. I cant make any informed decisions about what to do now he wont talk to me. I don't know what I'd be bringing an innocent into. If he's gone I need reassurance he won't resurface to destroy me further at some point in the future. I called the police to explain my side and they said they supported me and felt I was reasonably trying to get in touch given the circumstances. I feel sexually dysfunctional as I was desperate to please him and played up how much I enjoyed it even though I felt under pressure. The police want to pursue it as they said it was stealthing but they wont understand because my messages are equally gushing and needy as I wanted to be with him. Im lost."
89,vulnerability,offmychest,My FWB just texted me about his depression,1,fykait,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/fykait/my_fwb_just_texted_me_about_his_depression/,2020-04-11 03:28:41," My FWB (25M) and I (21F) have been seeing each other for around three years now. We have really great sexual chemistry and always have a good time together. Even though weve stopped seeing each other for now due to current events, weve continued to exchange sexual texts. That has still been lots of fun. He usually initiates it, but I also do sometimes. About a week ago, he suddenly stopped responding to my messages mid-conversation (this was super out of character for him). Today, I finally sent another text just check in to make sure everything is alright. He responded about twelve hours later saying that hes been having some depressive swings to the point that hes been barely awake all day. This really struck me. Weve always been careful to separate our personal lives from our strictly sexual relationship and hes never showed this kind of vulnerability in the past. Im not quite sure how to respond. As someone whos also experienced significant struggles with depression, I want to convey my empathy and let him know Im here for him. However, I also dont want to overstep the boundaries of our friends with benefits arrangement... I dont have any romantic feelings for him, but I do truly care about his well-being. Im unsure how communicate this to him in sympathetic yet effective way given the situation"
90,vulnerability,offmychest,Afraid with you and without.,1,fz2l15,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/fz2l15/afraid_with_you_and_without/,2020-04-11 20:57:02,"I'm afraid of my life without you. I'm afraid of the hurt i will cause you and that I will ruin you forever. I know I will miss your arms around me, the smell and feel of you, the way you smile when you have forgotten the past hurts and we have a small moment where we are connected and reminded of our love between us, our unique bond, that factor that we only felt between us that momentarily isn't tainted by the damage done, that completely peaceful moment that we are gunning for and always chasing to feel between us that cannot be forced and makes us feel like we are Kings and Queens within each other's arms as we breathe in the scent and brush each other's skin, needing the other person to melt into ourselves physically, emotionally, every touch and sound and invisible feeling that is so clear without being spoken, the rush of feeling invincible and protected and fitting into each other like two perfectly cut puzzle pieces, that contentment we found so alluring and frequently when we were new, unlike the wasted years and minutes now where we long to have those moments between us and fail, breaking each other with sharp words, leaving the other alone and avoiding the truths while burning resentment and defeat, instead of leaning into our love like we did so long ago. Refusing to give any parts of ourselves to intimacy and withholding forgiveness out of spite, attacking instead of relenting, solitude and silence instead of passion and letting us rot away, greiving the love that we long for, casting aside reason and holding out in hardened hearts long overdue to consent to the vulnerability of us, in fear of the wounds reopened and mistrust that is never forgotten and warranted, waiting for a glimpse of reassurance that the future is going to change, but unwillingness with broken hearts to dive in wholly, retreating to our corners of hopelessness and lack of self worth, abusing the hearts we longed to give and share with each other and ever growing into a painful tangle of fear together, retreating in defences where we once gathered. Biting back and shutting down ourselves because of the previous disappointments and rejections of love that we had snapped in anger and destroyed our trust and broke our relationship and broke us completely, so much that we hardened ourselves to deal with the pain of losing each other as we stood and laid side by side. Holding off the tears and swallowing it down until we exploded all of our insecurities and worries and worthlessness and disapproval like a never ending heartache swallowing us whole. All of the dreams we had crushing us in blows, hopelessness and weighing down our value in ourselves, our ways driving us apart and momentarily clinging to each moment that we had the high of each other. Revisiting us that we lost and falling so deeply down when we could not keep it. My darling, I miss you. I miss us that was alive. That conquered. I miss the love in your eyes and how I made you feel too. It should have been different for us. I don't want to sit up alone. I don't want to go to counseling. I don't want to tell you things that will hurt or destroy you, or us. I'm so tired of the things left unsaid. I'm so tired of us denying each other. I don't like the person I've become. I don't like the person I hurt you into being. I cannot live like this anymore, I will always regret the changes I was afraid to make for you. I cannot live as I'm dying inside. I cannot watch you die next to me in sadness. I have everything because of you. I will be nothing after. I will always regret not giving you the love you wanted before we got here. I will always regret the words I have spat out of anger at you. I will miss you every day, in this life and after. Let the pieces fall. Let us love each other enough to call it what it is. Let us know that it is better to recognize that hurting beside each other and silently breaking is not good for us. Let us go, let us admit that we are too far gone without fear. Break from our fears temporarily and face fears. See if we can find a place that doesn't keep us running for miles Agree to truths, speak things out of your heart and mind that you don't say. Stop holding back out of fear. Be afraid and say it anyway. We are too far gone. We are both hurting and deeply scarred We cannot fix broken hearts. We cannot continue down this path. We need to let go of hope and let things be Let them be complicated, or be nothing. But not this. Not this emptiness. Not this heartache. We wanted more than the mediocre love. Oh honey, we had it. We always will. It's time to take different paths. If we come together after, it will be true. Not desperately. Not out of ownership and resentment. Not out of commitment and dues paid and patch work over words and holding back out of insecurities and fear for saying too much or too little. Not like this. Not guilt over actions or wrongdoings, not wondering if we are adequate to measure up or be measured or qualify for intimacy, desire, kindness. Holding us too tight is breaking us. Caging an animal that needs to breathe. Please love yourself enough to be willing to breathe and heal. Please love what we have had enough to consider that we both need to regroup and figure out who we are and what we may need apart from each other not just physically. Please don't feel you are not enough. Please know that I adore you in every way, and I want to be able to fix us both, I want us both to be secure I want you to come back to me if you ever want to, but I cannot continue to live beside you and die inside and know that I am killing you too. I'm so afraid without you. I'm so afraid next to you when we are not one. I'm terrified of who we are becoming and what will be as our hurt builds after all of the years I let you down. You were so perfect for me and I was too insecure to admit my faults and afraid of finding out I was as worthless as I felt. I can only offer you peace. I can only ask you to take time to open how i need you to .. and if you cannot during this time, accept that we may be too far gone..and deal with questions and deal with your hurt without blame or fault and find yourself again and making yourself strong and confident and come to terms with our hurt and fix yourself in any positive way. Remember that I do nothing without knowing that you deserve better. I am not good. I am no longer someone I am proud of. And I need to find her before I can return to you I cannot live under your shadow forever. We have to be more grounded, faithful in us. We have to be each other's root of happiness and comfort and be back to a place where we felt like we could take on the world even with two pennies and each other's arms. I may not deserve you ever, but I do deserve to be able to live with myself. I'm afraid of the hurt for all of us. I'm scared of everything. Being alone, being left behind once your hurt fades and anger starts. Fucking us up. Hurt I will see and regret in your eyes and how you might break. Everyone. All of it. Missing you and regretting it. Wanting you back the second I say it. Wishing we were never here Dying every night knowing I didn't make you feel loved and wanted and needed and broke us all. The guilt, the hurt I caused and will. Worrying and wanting you so many ways as soon as you know and hating myself for all of it. Being scared I love you too much to really go through with it. Being afraid that I'm going to be a monster if I don't break away. Being afraid of without you at all. Of you without me Of you never wanting me back again Of the hurt I will feel knowing I will never win you back and will stray if I feel too defeated just to feel someone or be someone who I don't want to be. Of wondering when I'm going to break and ruin us out of desperation for intimacy. Of wondering if I will always be beneath you. Of wondering if I could ever be good to you, or ever measure up to your wants and needs. Wanting to be wanted and wishing I could come home to be desired and liked and not crushed and giving up on us or not putting forth effort out of sadness or insecurities Dreaming that I will be okay alone over crying every day Afraid I'm going to snap and say things to hurt you Resenting you for ignoring me and hurting so much that I can't bring myself to lay next to you without sobbing or screaming So letting you spend the night alone in bed while I miss you and knowing you will punish me for it later and being angry for feeling like I'm never going to be trusted or talked to like I'm not a garbage human or how long I will have to be refused and cut off this time. How many defeats I have to pay. How long Knowing you hurt too but I am too hurt to keep going and angry that you shut me out. Cold and closed off. We're both alone It's not changed. You never will open up and talk and I always am cut off or refused contact and have to pay whatever debt to you. I can't. I can be a fuck up and wrong and a cheater and whatever else you call me or think, but I can't live without love or forgiveness or affection and be constantly left alone to guess and read minds and knowing that you're all I have and that you can control me with mostly everything you continue to push me Away and wonder why I don't want to be close to you. You cannot be perfect and are allowed to have faults and mistakes and have moods and everything else. But I open up to you. You won't to me. You won't give me that one thing and maybe I need to be better and earn it back, but I'm lonely and you are too and you won't give me your thoughts, not even in anger. And that's probably what I need the most I'm not blaming you. I'm guessing you're mad about the one thing in the mailbox but I don't know WHY besides that you didn't know. Am I not allowed to spend money? Am I not allowed to do anything without permission? Why do I have to be controlled and you won't give It's everything on your terms. Yes, I owe you some accountability for the past to build trust But you make me constantly belittled and not your equal. I can't make decisions without you or your opinion and disagreements are always ruled over mine. I gave essentially zero say on all matters large and small, your say goes, and if it doesn't you make sure that I'm made to feel like I'm shit or you shut off and have rude comments and tense moods so that I am forced to either tiptoe or start an argument or isolate myself to avoid whatever aftermath following. I'm always supposed to let you rule over me. And if I don't you make me so upset rhat I either can't approach or I'm so mad that I have to be the shit under your shoe that I snap back. Maybe once you could ask me. Not make me do things. Not force me to do something you think will make me happy so that you can benefit or make your night easy..maybe not make me have to carry everything and then have nothing to make me feel like a person and then fawn all over you as your lowly servant and never be rewarded or anything even remotely worthy of what I ask you for. Affection. Not making me feel like I'm being appeased by a skin touch or sex or anything at home. Maybe letting me in. Maybe telling me something nice or something sweet or even a compliment like complete strangers give me that you've never noticed Maybe doing or saying something that is not on a list that I need , or making me feel like you arent romantic when you use that as a reason to avoid it when you really don't want to put effort in when I'm disappointing you. Or maybe, just maybe, trying to move forward and listening. Hearing me out Not always trying to fix me and be proud of me for the things that I might actually be good at Maybe making me feel desired in one way turns on the other for you. Maybe it's not always about right and wrong and who's done what. I'm tired of needing to apologize for how you feel. I'm tired of being the one who cares enough to vent and getting basically nothing in return. I'm tired of feeling like a loser, inadequate, worthless, bad guy, untrustworthy or disgusting or unappealing whether it's physical or emotionally unappealing. At least with other people, they'd tell me I knew where I stood. I deserve some of it and you deserve to feel and react andake mistakes and no guilt for some of it too. But also, when are we going to meet in the middle How long do I have to be patted on the head or only held because it's you trying to make it noted that you made effort while I touch you every day. I try to touch you with meaning and at least all the time it's with love Sometimes I just want to see you relax when I do. Sometimes I do it only because you need it. Sometimes I wish I had the same touch to rely on every day. Whether it feels passionate or not. You've given me a lot. You've made sacrifices. But I have too. Maybe yours are better in score. Or rank higher. Or hold more value. But I love you for all of those things you have done out of love and taken hurt for and from me and then. And I honestly don't feel you love me that way back. Maybe it's my own fault. I want to have someone that likes something about me That loves me being silly That gets me, that connects with me no matter how our day went. That feels that I have value, that opens up to me. That is willing to hear and be heard. That I feel like I am liked, not loved because of a commitment or promise, because they just do. And you do. But the love is not the same. You aren't proud and I get it. But when will you be? Ever? I actually like you. You're fun, you have qualities that I admire and love you for, you have a huge heart despite being hurt growing up, you work hard, you give to the kids and Anytime you know they're hurting you drop and do anything they need in any way. You want then to not have the hurt you did. You want to have the family you didn't. You want to have the love and whatever you saw in me that you wanted then.. that I will never know. You're kind to people, random acts of kindness you have done to and for even strangers, shows me again and again the man that you are that makes my heart swell. The Dad that you didn't have. The family that betrayed your love and you allowed them to breeze back in to benefit others, not really telling me everything, because you know I wouldn't have allowed it if I had known the last story. The hurt you took in and held back, they didn't deserve that chance. You have been wronged out of the love that you needed and yes- wanted, but also the love that you have desired and longed for is also what you have chased and questioned if you are good enough for? I get it. I'm more messed up than I thought. I stayed, every time because the hurt in you hurt me more than anything. But I am scared. Of anger, of facing my feelings, of everything. And I am afraid for you Even in anger I am afraid that we will never recover. I don't see the hope that you do. Yes I stayed this last time knowing I was going to be different and regret it if I lost you. Truth is, I don't trust you like I did. As soon as you think there's something happening you shut off, or close your self. Right or wrong doesn't matter. I Am Alone Accused. Nowhere to turn but away from you. Nothing to hear but how I hurt you and broke trust before Starting over again and again You deserve to feel that way. You are allowed to feel and doubt and have your insecurities. But we don't go forward..I'm alone and sad or angry Or I'm angry that I have to dread that at the end of the day.. I know I'm going to go home to be a disappointment or be disappointed or something along those lines. Or you're going to come home and I'm going to be angry that I can't ever seem to be getting any closer to regaining my worth to any degree where you are willing to give to me intimately. Not thoughts, surely not affection. When am I going to get it too. What do I have to do or let you do to be your fantasy again? To have you want JUST me To have us back where I felt like I knew you wanted me, I knew your touch meant more than one thing. I felt we connected and had intimacy on many levels. Not where I could predict every touch or wish that strangers I don't know made me feel like I was more worthwhile or my opinion mattered. I wish I didn't come home knowing I won't have someone that likes me, wants to talk or joke or enjoys my company. Knowing that I'm not going to make you laugh and that is it. Hoping if I ask the right thing maybe you will tell me this time. Knowing I might snap and tell you this time Or you might snap Hating myself for not being better. For thinking that I would just let it go til you were done for so many years. So I didn't have to hurt you more and year after year looking for something to keep me going. Lost myself and losing you. Trying to find any little bit of anything. Wishing I could sum up the courage to cheat and have someone to make me feel less alone. Coming home for years dreading coming home Knowing I'm going to be alone or sad or mad or you would be Wishing I hadn't fucked you up and had stayed alone. Lying to you because I only had people on my phone to talk to Because I felt like nothing. Because I knew you were something. I knew I had ruined it. I wanted you back and didn't know how I could and I knew a lot of it was you hurting I was afraid that if I failed that you would tell me what I already knew about myself. I honestly did feel like I tried sometimes really hard. It wasn't enough. And I am not angry or upset that you were hurt I'm upset that I wasted it. That I wanted this with you and let myself get this far. That I broke the only person that made my life good and that I continued. I gave you the hurt instead. At times I hoped that if you didn't love me the same you might at least love me as a mother. But I never felt that either. It is my fault. I did want you to change things but mostly I should have changed. I don't want to think about you with someone else., It makes me sick. I don't want to be with someone else But I have lost myself You have too I'm not saying we should with others. I'm not sure how much longer I can wake up and not like mySelf Or know you don't like me either. You don't trust me. When will you? You don't know. Which is fine. I get. I have to stay up and away My frustrations are so long. You crush me I want to come to bed, but I know it will be alone with you, or The reaction where I have to apologize for something I don't feel I should. I deserve to be crushed maybe. I'm beyond over not being able to come to you Or always being in debt daily, you Lord over me on every discussion. On every decision. If I win or prove my point it's a punishment. I can't talk to you about anything you don't want to hear, but you want to be heard. In every aspect, I am beneath you. Maybe I don't want to be without you, but I want the relief. Consequences for my actions, sure. What Are they? Can't out a time limit on it which is ok. Healing has no time limit. Hurt doesn't I don't want you to give up But I am quickly approaching it like I never have before. Not lack of love for you Not because I want someone else. You are enough. I cannot find enough words to convey that. My heart is in a very dark place. I can't even think of someone after you, besides me. I can't even sum up the energy to clean the house, get out of bed, even shower or cook dinner anymore. I am lost. I don't know who I am or how I got this bad. I want to be a better person. A happy person..a good person even. I'm ashamed of the things I've said and done and who I turned out to be today. I don't feel like a good mother anymore. I don't look forward to hardly anything. The hope I once had for life I no longer feel is going to come back. I made a mess of myself and besides that, us too."
91,vulnerability,offmychest,Ghosting a former friend and feel awful about it,1,g3ffnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/g3ffnq/ghosting_a_former_friend_and_feel_awful_about_it/,2020-04-18 11:59:29,"TLDR: Things got weird with a former friend who had feelings for me. Ive been putting off replying to him and cutting things off for an embarrassingly long time (months), not sure how to make myself do it So, I knew this guy for a bit more than a year when the shit hit the fan in fall. Hed asked me about a couple times previously. Both times hed had a lot of lead up- and Id sort of frozen, not sure what I should do and scared that I was misinterpreting him or that Id be an asshole if I cut him off. I dont consider myself attractive so I was flattered and very surprised the first time. I was also surprised the second time because hed had a relationship since then and Id thought/hoped hed gotten over me. And hed just broken up with her. I cut him off *eventually*during the 2ndconfession but I also let him go on for a good while first and I feel pretty bad about that. I told him both times that if he needed some time to not be around me, I understood, but he didnt take me up on it. Anyway in the fall we saw we each after a couple weeks of being busy. I was happy to see him and pretty lonely. He was high and he tends to get a little exaggeratedly touchy with me when high. Which stresses me out sometimes as I certainly dont enable it but Im not assertive enough to shut it down outright. Anyway that day was different. He leaned his head on my shoulder while we were watching a movie. At first I was super tense about it but I ended up going with it and I was really touch-starved and depression-lonely and curious at that time so I started to think, hey maybe I should give this a try. We stayed that way for a good portion of the movie and the vibe was definitely coupley. In the coming days I started to feel really anxious about things. I thought a lot about what it would like to date him and it just became apparent that the idea made me anxious in bad way, like I was trying to force something that wasnt meant to be. Although I was uncertain about this, since Ive never been in a relationship and Ive only really been infatuated with one person and it felt a lot different from this. I was avoiding his calls. I felt incredibly awful about leading him on like this. Eventually I finally responded saying that I was sorry and that I wasnt in a place for the kind of emotional vulnerability involved in a relationship and I needed left alone for a while (I thought that was 100% true at the time but I think maybe I would be ok-er with emotional vulnerability with the right person.) He said alright and that he was sorry for letting his feelings take over, I said it wasnt his fault, etc. I had this conversation entirely over text because I was too much of a coward to call, another fun detail to haunt me at night! He ended up coming over again eventually. It was fairly awkward, though I tried to act normal because I wanted things to go back to normal. I caught him looking at me too long and too intensely. At the end he went for the farewell hug and said that he loved me-wait what? I didnt know what to say. I just said Dude. He was trying to play like he just got overwhelmed and didnt mean to say it or whatever but it was definitely intentional. After that I realized it really stressed me out how I kinda felt like he was stealing moments with the social acceptability to back him up. Like if I said no to a hug or acknowledged that whatever joke was just made was Not funny enough to lean on me for support or asked him to stop looking at me I would be the asshole. If I gave a reason for not wanting to hang out more, like if I said I was tired or gave an excuse for needing introvert time, he would argue with my reasons/say theyre not valid and Id have to give reason after reason. The same would happen when I said I didnt want to drink or smoke because I wasnt comfortable with it (and for a number of other reasons, all of which I had to list!) for a while. There was one time he wanted to listen to music since Id set up my kinda nice stereo. He said we should dance, I said I dont dance because it makes me self-conscious. He kept being like Cmon and literally tried to pull me up and I said I was going to roll up like an armadillo because I didnt want to and you bet he kept trying and I sure as hell did armadillo. Anyway what Im trying to say is that I really had some boundary issues throughout the friendship, and I figured he was a persistent person and also this is maybe just how dude friendships go (I was raised as a girl for reasons I dont want to go into). So I laughed it off at times, but it really made me uncomfortable especially in the light of realizing he hed been holding onto these feelings- not because I thought he was an intentionally manipulative person or anything, but because it was jarring for me to realize that maybe he didnt view what we had as a friendship and was trying to shift things that way without realizing it and it just got to me. I stopped responding to his calls. I didnt plan it that way but I got really anxious when I saw him calling and I knew I owed him an explanation, but I didnt know how to do it. (At that point I was really confused about really who was in the wrong here and if I was in any place to criticize his behavior when Id obviously been so bad.) I ran into him again. I learned hed been hospitalized for anxiety problems. I continued not responding. I ran into him again on the way of class. He acted like things were normal between us and I did too. He said to call back, because he was starting to feel like he wasnt my priority. I decided to, even though I didnt know why he would reasonably want me to at that point. I thought more about it. I realized Id been a shitty friend, hadnt communicated boundaries in a functional way, had led him on and not been there for him when he was doing really poorly. It pained me but I felt it would be better for us not to be friends anymore. I honestly felt like if he didnt idealize me for some reason it would be obvious that I was shitty and it was an oversight for him to want anything to do with me at this point. But I didnt want to call things off. I wrote a letter in early December explaining my viewpoint on things. A phone call was too intimidating. I was scared I wouldnt be able to say all this and would be talked out of it. I felt bad that this wasnt his fault and wondered if hed blame himself for it. And honestly I was afraid to see the damage Id done. He tended to get really emotional when anxious (like kicking over furniture and saying cryptic stuff) and I knew it would be emotional and my awful self didnt want to deal with emotion. I decided to send it before the next semester. I never sent that letter. I just kept putting it off. It filled me with anxiety and guilt to think about and somehow I couldnt translate that into doing something about it. Anyway its been 4 months since then. Ive thought about it every day and Im doing pretty bad mental health wise, in good part as a result. I think about our friendship and my mistakes a lot, even though its been so long I dont super feel attached to the person anymore. He still tries to contact me sometimes. I know I owe him some sort of response and logically Im going to need to send one because we go to the same college and if I dont, Im going to run into him unprepared on my way to class sometime and freeze up without a word to say for myself and cement myself as the biggest asshole this guys ever met. I dont know how to make myself respond."
92,vulnerability,offmychest,I never learned how to want,1,g4ju8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/g4ju8l/i_never_learned_how_to_want/,2020-04-20 11:39:20,"I think every person needs to be a little bit egoistic in order to live. For example, if you want a career you need to stand out of the competition and you need to fight a little to get what you want, whatever that might be (a raise, promotion, free time), but for me it's impossible. It's like I never learned to want something. I have no ambitions because that would require actual hope and willpower and I don't have those. I never dared to want anything, it never even occurred to me as a possibility. When someone tells me I can't have something I accept it. It's the same thing with hopeful thoughts. I see how people around me build these walls around very negative thoughts, it helps them keep a positive outlook on the future. They say things like: ""It will get better."" Or ""I'll try harder next time."" And I understand why they do it. It's a useful tool, it's basically lifeblood, without it there's only despair. But instead I think: ""Why should it get better. Maybe it will be worse. It's a possibility."" Or ""Even if you try hard enough, success isn't guaranteed, other forces are at play."" I've always been like this. It's like I'm born without a filter, without protection, always exposed to something dark looming behind me. I can't get a moment of respite, can't have something nice, can't get close to people because that would mean trusting someone, putting your own vulnerability in someone else's hands and I don't know how to want something or someone hard enough to fight for them. And so I let them all go, or rather, I disappear. But I want to want. I want to want something so badly it hurts if I can't have it."
93,vulnerability,offmychest,I often think about if I would be able to fix people by being in a relationship with them,2,g5mq2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/g5mq2x/i_often_think_about_if_i_would_be_able_to_fix/,2020-04-22 06:14:40,"Whenever I hear about terrible people doing terrible things (to an extent), often my first thought is I wonder if Id be able to get to them if we were dating. Rationally, I know its unlikely. But another part of me feels like vulnerability in a relationship is the quickest path to change, and I want to help them change. For example, when I first heard of the Onision allegations, my first thought was What if I made a fake account to get close to him and figure out whats going on inside his head? Im absolutely repulsed by Onision, so Im not sure why I thought this, and I know its fucked up. But this happens with local people as well, when I hear that an acquaintance has a problem (addiction, anger issues, etc), my first thought is, what if I started to talk to them and he fell for me  could I fix him? I know its not my job or place to fix people, but these thoughts pop up all the time and Im not sure how to make them go away. I dont actively follow through on these thoughts, but I do have a pattern of dating men who need help. idk edit: I guess I should clarify, it isnt just bad things, but also if someone is sad, I have no idea how to comfort without seeming loving (in a relationship way)."
94,vulnerability,offmychest,I have a fart fetish and hate myself for it,4,g5ql8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/g5ql8r/i_have_a_fart_fetish_and_hate_myself_for_it/,2020-04-22 09:50:29,"Throwaway account for anonymity. So a little backstory. I'm 14 years old and male, and for a very long time have had a deep attraction to farts. I like the smell, I like the sound, and it's something I tend to be generally ashamed of. I have never told a single person about this, so you lucky redditors are the first to get to hear me vent about this. Now, don't get me wrong, I do have standards. If someone I'm related to farts, I react in a perfectly normal way, as well as people who aren't close to my age. I usually will be more aroused by people who are pretty, or who I find to be superior to me, but gender doesn't matter. I just wish I didn't have it. It's a lot harder to be friends with teenage boys (who fart a lot) when you get turned on every time one of them rips one. Other people laugh, and I just sit there uncomfortable while I try to act normal while I hide the erection I'll soon get. Maybe the arousal comes from the idea that someone is dominating me, (the most arousing thing I can think of is someone farting directly on me) or maybe it's a vulnerability thing, but either way I'm stuck with it now. I've struggled with depression, now and in the past, and it's something that will nag at me from the back of my head. ""Why can't you be like john, they're smart, successful, and they don't get turned on by people expelling Writing stuff like this is very therapeutic, and I'm glad I did it.

Just need to vent I (F36) feel like there little to no hope my husband (M39) to have a happy, heck civil or decent marriage (together for 7yrs, married 2yrs)Thoughts and/or advice We started seeing a marriage counselor, only had one session so far, and this week we will be having our own individual sessionsbut I after tonight I feel its almost rather pointless and wastes of time and money to continue therapy. Despite such reservations were still going to do itat least for this week. So if you review some of my other post youll see that things have not been super greatsince we had our twins. I know that the first year after baby, esp post multiples, is savage on a marriagebut 8 months on Im starting to believe that he just really is like this and boys have nothing to do with itSo starting this the latest incident this evening Luckily, during plague 2020 Im lucky enough to still have job that grants me a lot of flexibility (TY JESUS!!!). Unfortunately, he is not so lucky. So I asked to me to please watch the boys so I concentrate to get a few things done for workand this turned into a thing. He told me that I was being confrontational and making crazy accusations. Like bc I asked him to go sit with the boys I was saying he has not been spending time with them all, even after I told him that was mot my intentionbut it just seems like every time I speak to him he tells me Im being confrontational, creating a scene, etcmind a majority of our fights begin with me asking him to please just be in the same room the boys. RESENTMENT: I honestly think that due to his ego he holds so much resentment and hatred towards me for my profession. Hell constantly comment on what he perceives as my lack of work ethicAgain luckily my job grants a lot freedom in regards so just because he doesnt see me working at 3am or 4am after I put the boys down which means Ill sleep in that day he assume that I do nothing...its just offensive &amp; insulting especially since Ive put in a over a decade of work in my industry and been with the same company for the better part 10 yearswhile he has found it impossible to keep a job longer than 13 months at most since weve been together. I think a lot of it stems from him coming from a rather well-to-do family which afforded him opportunities that a less privileged person would not have squandered. And then he see me someone who did their fair share of partying in her younger dates (he says he always been straight-laced), was technically ward of state (but raised by grandparents), first one in my family to graduate high school, first to graduate college, and first one to not have to do menial labor to make a livingand he just cant reconcile how I coming from such a humble means can be more stable and successful than hecoming from such a good stock always finds himself such dire straits having to rely on the generosity of his parents. Maybe Im just being paranoid, idk. GASLIGHTING: He also tells his parents Im crazy/bi-polar. So previously I open up to that I was dealing with PPA (which I soon found out he told his parentssee prior posts for more info). So I decided to nip that in the bud and speak to his parents as address how the things they done/said affected me and even tho I doubt there was any malicious intent behind their actions I found it necessary to address my concerns and my PPA so they would be conscious of our future interactionsa conversation that I had to have ALONE (DH made himself not available)but now its come to my attention (via 1st therapy session) that he is using this as catalyst to portray me as crazy/bi-polar to his family. Which makes feel so betrayed to have your vulnerability weaponized is just horrible. DEAD BEDROOM: Hes just not that into me at allwe havent been intimate since the beginning of January and that seemed liked a chore for him. Its to the point where I feel like he got his kids so now theres no reason for him to have to sex with me. I know it sounds out there but a part me thinks that he got married and had kids to appease his parentsand now the boys are here Ive served my purpose for him and his family. DISRESPECT: He is always disrespecting my motherhood. If the house isnt spotless it because I want my children living in squalor. If I have to go to Target or the Grocery store it means Im running the streets because I want to get away from kidsI buy ANYTHING its Im wasting money that I should be giving himIf Im up all night with the boys and need a nap its all I do ALL DAY is sleep. If I ask him to just be in the same room with the boys beyond feedings and diaper changesits I dont want to take care of my children (mind you its usually when I need to get work stuff done). He obv knows that I suffered a miscarriage before the boys were conceived and if I ask him to watch them so I can do something he say something like IDK was had kids if you dont want to take care of themI think bc of the miscarriage that really stings. THREATS: He is always threathening me that he will leave me an make sure a never see the boys again. I just dont think he loves anymoreif he ever did at all. Ill admitted in the thick of PPA I was horrible, but after all Ive been thru with him stuck out I thought that would of afforded me some type of grace after being hospital bedrest, traumatic birth, nicu stays, &amp; all the other mind-fuckery that comes with being a FTM. But it appears I was horribly mistaken. If you made this far THANK YOUI just really needed to ventI mean I love him and I want our family to stay together but as each day passes so does my hope usGN"

Tragedy and death memes are getting pretty out of hand like 'lol funny 911 I must laugh', 'ooff lemme say something about Kobe', or 'harambe hilarious'. Most of the time when people replied like 'dude that's toooo far' they ended up getting told to kill themselves and when the savages actually get in trouble they just claim they have dark humor that's all. This one 'swag' guy at my school is the perfect example: always force him self to laugh at trends especially one like harambe even though he makes super unnatural face when he does it. One day in a free time class, still in the phase, the news of the caretaker? I'm not sure but the guy asked people to at least tone down the memes. The swag guy saw it and decided to gather attention and was like 'this (N word) (the guy was white tho) is saying that the memes are too much lol, is he one drugs or something? Just fckinng die bit.ch'. (yes he uses the n word a lot even though he's asian) To my surprise, almost everyone laugh and went along with him especially the boys, some of them didn't even know what harambe is. Another guy said to him 'dude you're overdoing it' and got a reply of 'kill yourself stupid ass (N word)'. The teacher was there, he tried to scold the swag dude with a very toned down sentence so that it doesn't look like he's offended and the dude said 'oh it's nothing I just have dark humor'. Bruh dark humor my arse. If you have dark humor and secretly crack up to dead people that's totally fine, you can't really choose what type of humor you have, but to act like you have one just to gain a place in the savage social hierarchy where you can't show any vulnerability like middle and high school is seriously messed up. Sometimes I even actually consider the possibility that those people got predator extracts injected into them or something since a lot of people are like this but a lot are also the complete opposite. Pretty lengthy but, thanks for the space."

Since then, theyve been rubbing it in my face that theyre getting laid and sex is the best thing ever.

I keep on telling them that I dont want sex, and I could care less about being virgin. But somehow they always chalk it up to youre just jealous because were having sex, and youre not.

Ive let her go, but just because people have rights to do things, doesnt make it the right thing to do, and if she wants to try to snuff out her feelings for me for someone else she has that right; but it doesnt make any of what she did to me okay in the slightest. So of course Im hurt. Of course Id prefer things were different. But I love her and its my duty to say something to someone that because its her right and her choice, the guilt shes feeling is the consequences of her own actions, and her own feelings, not ones Im pushing on to her or manipulating, and if nobody is watching out for her since I cant be for multiple reasons, then shes going to keep doing this to herself. Thats why its my duty to say something, I cant physically be there right now and wont be able to handle seeing her with someone else right now. Its a core value of mine to always try and find a way to help people I care about if I believe they are in need, and I had the self-respect to do that. I guess its just possible she believes that the people who dont get divorced, are the people who never have problems in the first place. That would be a legitimate compatibility issue, and probably the lies she was referring to feeling is the source of her guilt. Which worries me not just because I obviously want our relationship to succeed, but for her own mental health. I mean, if you dont ever have problems in a relationship, its more likely than not, that its because youre both just content and dont care about each other enough to be invested in losing each other. Sure, healthy partnerships have less significant issues, less frequently, but I got to know her underneath those issues and I know shes worth it to me. Unless someone helps her, shell keep jumping ship from relationship to relationship for the rest of her life searching for happiness in others, feeling rejection, and believing something is wrong with her all over again because shes chasing the high of the honeymoon phase and the lack of guilt she feels for feeling jealousy creep in. She has this deep rooted insecurity with jealousy cause of her moms jealous rages. She doesnt believe shes supposed to feel ANY jealousy at all, or shes a maniac. So then she bottles it up til it explodes. So Im pretty sure she wants to find a new relationship so she stops feeling guilty about how much jealousy she feels for me because she doesnt want to let herself feel like she deserves to own me. Im not gonna lie. I really dont want that to happen, but I cant do anything about it. Shes gone, for now at least, and I hope at most. I just have to believe shell come back one day because she is very invested in us; the guilt, the jealousy, these are natural signs of investment in and a longing for a relationship. She has unhealthy coping mechanisms, and like I said, doesnt have a healthy view on jealousy, probably partly reinforced by her shitty relationship with her ex right before me, and it makes her very controlling, as learned from her fucking nightmare of a mom. Shes been working on it, but when she broke up with me last year, it touched a sensitive spot and I didnt realize that it started to bring out my controlling side too. We became toxic for each other for a short bit there, 3-4 months there, and because of it she believes its just a compatibility issue. I figured my shit out though, Ive done it before, but because it caught me off guard it looked like we were just toxic. As time goes on well heal, perspective will come to her and I. A 2 year relationship that wasnt toxic, just a person being toxic because of her pain, is not a toxic relationship. Not when I did everything to support her that I could, including push for her to get professional help and build her up after being kicked down her entire life by nearly everyone who she should have been able to trust. Which is why just cause shes probably pursuing someone else, doesnt mean I cant stay loyal and keep loving her just in case. Thats my decision and I own the consequences of it. Shes still growing and she still wants what anyone else wants, someone who truly loves her, and to feel truly loved. One day shell realize what that is and understand that she has that with me. She just has to learn that true love of herself comes from within. She said she has no feelings for me, but cant bear to talk about the proof that she still does quite just yet because it would shatter her with guilt, her jealousy. I know Im setting myself up to be a doormat, but love takes courage, something shes struggled to maintain with us and I dont fault her for faltering. Im well prepared now for her to take advantage of me though, for her codependency to come out when the next relationship ends and she realizes she has me on the back burner. I was once like her and we all deserve forgiveness for our mistakes. When she does return to me, for real, Ill be ready. Shell be afraid of feeling rejected by me though, because shes capable of no greater betrayal. She might even be overcompensating to not have me on the back burner by trying to shut down my feelings the way she is. Which is why I can only prove my acceptance of her and all her flaws by staying with her. I love you Noodle Legs, my Dick Turner. One day shell have to come to accept that me waiting for her is my choice too. I can handle my mental health just fine. I know what my limits are and in the event that I am taken off guard, I know I have friends and family who I can turn to to help me get my mind off of things. Ill heal, because I already and always respected myself with her, and Ill know when she truly isnt worth it if she ever isnt. Because thats what we discussed commitment was. Just because shes not capable of it right now, doesnt mean she never will be, because she wants to be. When I see that shes stopped caring about me and there truly is no helping her because she no longer wants to be in a committed relationship one day, itll hurt, and Ill have lost some time, but Ill be okay with that because I know what I want and made a gamble and lost. I will be able to recover from it and accept being just friends with her. I could just be in denial, but Ive made peace with that and it will only be revealed by time. I could be vicariously trying to forgive myself for my past sins, but Ive explored that possibility already and I forgave myself when I had the self-respect to stop punishing myself and walk away from my exs abuse. There are no rewards without risk. Theres no love without vulnerability. I have core values that I believe in and am standing up for. Core values she expressed she shared and theres evidence that she still does. Thats what guilt is, its understanding that youve betrayed something you hold dear. A value, or a person. If she no longer felt any possessive feelings left for me, like it seems she does, well then Ill know soon enough. She does deserve me if she decides she wants to be with me, as unpopular of an opinion as Im sure that is. So even though she reserves the right to see other people and pursue other desires, I deserve to choose to pursue my desire."

Last meaningful conversation happened a few days ago when I finally opened up about my extremely toxic ex: I did this for several reasons, but mostly because A) I want her to understand me better, where many of my insecurities come from B) I wish practicing vulnerability like this would deepen our bond C) I know she's got at least one particularly nasty ex-case that still seems to impact her; I wish me opening up about a sensitive matter might encourage her to do the same. She was understanding about my experiences and I told her I'd like her to tell about her own experiences in return so I could understand her better. She replied with ""Yeah, maybe that would be fair, maybe I could do that sometime"". ""Maybe."" ""Sometime."" Never any concrete deeds or even actual promises, just these vague half-promises.

I never talked to you, I never followed you. We never interacted. I believe the only thing we had in common was that we had both decided to put our respective ages in our bio.

Or to bond with people my age over things we like. In the end, it doesn't matter. What does is that before following people, one must have read their bio (to see someone's interests, what their blog is about). Mine said I was 13. It was one of the few bits of personal information about me, which I know now was already too much. The internet is scary! I think my Tumblr bio used to say something like ""Hi my name is *first name* I'm 13, French and a giant nerd, I love x-tv-show.""

A simple ""Hey,"" if I recall. At the top of the screen, a text showed that you followed me. I answered ""Hey"" back. I didn't know why you texted me. I went to see your blog. We didn't have much interests in common, and I was confused. But what really made me feel a bit puzzled was your age. 26. By the time I came back to our conversation, you had sent me another message. A very graphic, detailed, text about what you would do to me. Along with lots of fetish stuff. About how I would be your perfect wife, and you would do super fetish stuff to me. I didn't even understand all the English words. I couldn't believe my eyes. I thought, ""no, they must have sent it to the wrong person, I'm clearly a minor."" Thinking of a misunderstanding, I wrote ""What?"" I didn't dare think that it could be anything but a misunderstanding. Because, come on, I was 13. People aren't dumb enough to willingly text suggestive and pornographic content to 13 years old. The next text had even more details about me. You knew exactly who you were talking about. You didn't ask to have sex with me; you commanded it. I almost threw up. I felt so sick. So, people like that did exist? I instantly blocked you. I reported the text exchange to Tumblr, which deleted the conversation. (I don't know if they ever did anything about you.) You made me feel afraid, for the first time. An uncomfortable, crawling feeling of unease. That something is very wrong, that I am in danger. You sick fucking bastard. You disgusting, perverted asshole. I must not have been the only one. The only child which whom you laid your lustful eyes upon. I saw a picture of you. It was your profile icon. And you looked... So normal. I started to forget it over the years. I only saw it once, after all. Words cannot describe how much I hate you. I hate you because you decided to text 13 year-old me graphic pornographic content involving me. I hate you because you put a fear in my heart, a vulnerability and a lack of trust of adults. What if I was more naive, more innocent? I'm lucky that it was only text messages. That it only happened in your mind. That you didn't live on the same continent, that I blocked you soon enough. That I didn't share more information. But no one will ever be truly safe as long as the likes of you are alive. Breathing. Thinking. I hate you because every time I hear about child trafficking and paedophilia, about teenagers being kidnapped and raped, it's your face I see. Or what's left of it. You don't have a face, anymore. You could be anyone. I would never recognize you if you were standing in front of me."

What do girls not do to make men fall for them? They are crazy about love and being wanted and desired. They take pride in how they present themselves and have a ""me"" aspect that I never had. I disregarded my needs, I didn't care about how I looked and made myself to be okay with anything, because I didn't matter. I could never be like them. I didn't realize life can change, you don't have to stick to your version of story. And here it is me, who just never paid effort. Sure, men ignored me generally. I put on no make up, always had my hair tied up. Dressed bad. Didn't smell pleasant. But I know I could look nice with some make up. I rejected all men who showed even a bit of interest in my pursuit for perfection, although deep down I didn't care about that either. I was lost in my own world, escaping. Intimacy, attention and vulnerability makes me uncomfortable. All this time, I knew I was going something wrong, but couldn't figure out what. Now I do. I wish I was crazy about love, wedding, men, pretty things, you know all the girly things. I got it really really wrong ."

107,vulnerability,offmychest,Three months,1,fdzheb,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/fdzheb/three_months/,2020-03-06 05:19:55,"Thats all the time it took for my ex to say yes to marrying a dude after she left. So, either medication fucked her up, or she was cheating on me the whole time. In either case, we were supposed to marry. We stuck together five years; now she's gonna marry some dipshit who's about to wander into a shredder face first. However, it's not my problem any more. The kicker here is that she also abandoned her cat she had for eight years. Since he was a kitten. It's only now upon reflection that I really understand the nature of what happened; she wasn't a whole person. As I deduced and rightly so, it was an inevitable collapse. See, she was seven years my junior, but the first person I really ever loved. Yet I myself was not whole. I hadn't undergone actualization and at that time I had just began to understand what Jungian Theory of the Self was. The thing was is that though I had started the process, i had started late. Poverty and a mother that browbeat the confidence out of one will delay growth for a long time. Once free of my mom, I was able to finally get to a person who introduced me to Zizek. From there I learned of Ideology and Carl Jung. It was these two theories that gave me insight and finally allowed me to perceive my shadow. Though here was the issue; anima was something I desperately sought. Love. That was my vulnerability. I was too green and wanted to love and be loved so bad that I ignored the red flags that were waving in my face; she had already gone through a lot of partners. Now im not unfamiliar myself to a high count (10 women in my life) but surely this should've been a warning. I fell for her, but it was just supposed to be a fling. I did not have the emotional fortitude to insulate myself from feelings and so I fell into her. Though I will never forget the first time I said I loved her. She cried, overcome with emotion. It was mutual. Fast foward, and now I understand that it was more that she herself didn't understand the concept of merging persona and shadow; rather, she suppresses and tries to ignore it, focusing on persona alone, or how she appears to the world. I am not the most stable person. Painfully average with two exceptions; too smart for my own good and a good penis. But I am poor, and frankly I have no idea what im doing in life. So, even though she may have had feelings for me, the combination of her ignorance of the shadow of self and medication ensured that we were doomed. That's the way she deals with her own self-perceived inadequacy; she attaches over and over to other personas to boost her own persona, yet the shadow is screaming at her. The killer blow was the drug paxil. It allowed her to further isolate her shadow. For now. The shadow will at some point emerge like an angry bloodthirster demon. The longer one boxes it away, the stronger and more swole it becomes. Ignore it too long and that's how I believe suicide happens; the shadow self simply becomes too strong and takes control. Emotional beast that it is. I know she is not who I fell in love with, but that doesn't matter. Who she is now was able to dump a cat she cared and nurtured for eight years. I personally witnessed her rush him to an animal ER after he was bit on the face by a snake. Dry bite, he's fine. But now he is with me, and I don't believe she will ever come back for him. Not that id ever surrender him; whoever she is now clearly isn't good for him and frankly I would merk her if she tried to take him in any form or fashion outside of a court battle, but I'm confident I will win in a legal battle. Basically she may not realize it or might not care, but she has lost him forever, all because she chose self image over me who loved her more than anyone else in my life and left in such a hasty and dramatic fashion. And three months later, some dumb ass who also probably isn't a whole ass person has fallen into the same trap, only he being so desperate to have property (in my weaker moments at the beginning of my trauma I witnessed that he had already started posting pictures of himself with her on his facebook; indicative as hell that he views her as his in a possessive way, though i have since blocked every form of contact I have with her) that he like myself doesnt care to see the doom headed his way. BTW, she left me for more money; simple as that. I cant be certain of whatever outcome may occur, but I am confident that she will turn him inside out and frankly it will not end well for either of them. Fuck if they have kids it's gonna be a clusterfuck. She'll just become her mother. Her mom divorced her dad after a lengthy marriage. I knew her mother since high school; she was my math teacher. She always appeared deeply unhappy even in my youth. Three months. Either she lied or she's legit crazy now. It comes in waves, but less and less do I feel anything. Even my hatred is fading because id rather not give her anything at all and hatred is still something. I have this cat now. Im sure he misses her, but I can tell that he is taking on my characteristics and so he too may find her repugnant after all this time and the betrayal. As for you, I know you'll recognize the user handle. If you happen across this for whatever reason and honestly I dont believe you will, just know that everyone can tell you're fake. It's instinctive. You may have fooled one fat idiot, but you aint fooling his friends, just like you didnt fool my friends. They all warned me and I chose to ignore it. He will do the same, but i warn you: he may not take separation as well as I did. He may very well kill you; i can recognize a piece of shit. I wish I didnt ignore my senses with you, you piece of shit. You belong there. And you will never, ever put this cat in harms way ever again. Try to take him, I will protect him. You know what that means. I will not hesitate in any way. Now burn, and get out of my head."

I do not where this is stemming from. Perhaps it is a subconscious notion drilled into me from as far back as I remember. Maybe its my own insecurities, my need for upmost privacy in my life. But, no matter how hard I think on it, I can not come to a conclusion to end my hypocrisy. Allow me to explain: Intellectually, I know that men and women are free to do what they want with their bodies. This is something I feel is only right. After all, if it isnt harming me, why should I stop it? I *can* judge people for sex work, but it wouldnt be *just.* Plus, sex work can often yield more money than I could ever hope to achieve. Truly, it is something to pay the bills with! Emotionally, however, I find myself disgusted by it. I do not know where this comes from. There is a special someone that I believe I have fallen for, and they have fallen for me. However. I cant help but be turned away from their past as a previous sex worker. This person is amazing, but their past is troubling me. I couldnt tell them that, could I? How would they react? Surely, they would be upset, for it is not their problem, but mine, correct? How very immature of me, I suppose. Perhaps, my value on sex causes me to dislike the idea so much. To me, sex is the highest form of vulnerability. I couldnt bring myself to even hookup with someone. It is something that all my life I knew I just couldnt do. To me, sex, or rather, any sexual act for that matter, is just too much intimacy to seemingly casually share. But the problem is that, yes, I enjoy things like porn and masturbating. Perhaps, it can be argued that fantasies and the real deal are two very different things? Does this make me a hypocrite? For enabling the very thing I (emotionally) dislike (albeit free porn)? I do not know what to make of any of this. A value of mine is being challenged. My head is spinning, and with each conclusion another question comes that throws me off. Im running in circles.

I just love the vulnerability that comes with all this; his strength and power makes me admire him so much. I constantly hug his strong arms and kiss his biceps. I constantly cuddle with him in a position that lets him know that I need and appreciate his protection  and he likes the feeling too.

It truly scares me to think that one slip up and twist of circumstance could so quickly destroy everything and undeniably this fate seems inevitable. Im also containing a lot of anger for the way my friends are dealing with their problems. The issues created are controllable and due to their own actions. But have stemmed an apparent alcohol dependency to the point of drinking during school. This has added to my worries but in a dark place in me is critiquing them for not being stronger. Not hiding everything like I make myself do and for that I hate this part of me. Im feeling the stresses of exams and havent been able to revise due to increased workload, lack of motivation and sad excuses. I also know that once I leave school none of these people will care about me even if I still care for them. It scares me that Im going to have to build new relationships and have no one to talk to. Which I know is a stupid worry as I still have no one to talk to now. And finally I just dont like being me. Im wasting my teenage years due to a lack of social skills and a fear of authority. I want nothing more than to feel alive but I cant seek help and be another broken child. Im just exhausted by everything and want to be loved. I want someone to see how Im not doing okay but too scared to show vulnerability in public.

On this morning, the Ninth of March, Two Thousand and Twenty, I let go of a girl named Jess, who I could have seen myself falling for over and over every single day for the rest of my life. After a semi-rocky first meeting, which when it was going good it was intensely great, she had lied to me saying she was going out with two friends who were a couple. She instead went out with a guy named Dominic, meth head. After kind of wondering why she had neglected to text me after a rather intense night before where she had been nude and wanting to have sex with me. I refused as I am a gentleman and not some dribbling dog fucking every ass in the air. I initiated a conversation, which is rather against my protocol as I would normally wait until she initiated one with me. A simple Hi, was returned in 7 minutes with a simple Hi. I waited 6.5 minutes and as I was about to reply, she began to, and we both replied How's it going at the same time, I just a bit first. Our conversation was light-hearted to where she asked if she could video chat me. She showed me her makeup, with rhinestones, something the night before with me she had stated she would not be wearing make-up (I didn't care, but I do note this) and changed into the shirt she wore. A bit cute to be hanging out with just friends, at their place or wherever, but I don't press. She abruptly ends the video dialogue after changing back into her hoodie and reverts to text. She states further in the conversation that it was I who ended it, which the return message stated that she had clearly. Our conversation edges south, I'm trying to pull back, she takes my building walls as an attack on herself and tries to turn the tables. She states her sister is in ICU going into crisis from an OD of a mixture of whatever, the same sister who doesn't talk to her anymore as she witnessed her older sister destroy her own self, I don't challenge. I don't trust it, but I don't call it out. She turns the tables again as she is enduring this sister event, from her room, stating she cut herself in a place that she already bandaged and can't show me as it's personal. She states I am knitpicking at these things and she can't deal with these petty things in leiu of the tragedy befallen her family. To which I respect, and fall asleep. I wake up at 7am to 15 messages from her, she is stating that she is hurt by me and that she wants to know where the person she is falling in love with is. I note that her profile picture has changed. It's of her and Dominic, and it's a video of them in a restaurant or such and him kissing her on the cheek. I calmly respond to her message of, ""I don't even know how that's the same person who called me self centered among other fucked up things,"" with ""Well according to your profile picture..."" and we began a textual tug of war between vulnerability, anger, and losing something we both at recent times were madly enjoying. She states we're not boyfriend and girlfriend and she's free to date whomsoever and she had already agreed to such an outing with this guy before I even entered the picture. Which I cannot do anything but comply with as she's completely right. But I do note that the happenings of the event that took place the night beforehand in my bedroom, and do note that this was a casual date that she probably ended with a kiss and a conversation on the phone afterwards, she's quite the charmer, and lovely in such regard. After this morning and our inevitable collapse with her my last message being ""bye"" to her response of, ""STOP."" I ceased communication. Intuition is sometimes worth it's weight in gold. But after a moment, I collapsed. Tears hit me, I just lost a beautiful cursed gift that would have changed my life. I liked her, but I'm glad it stopped with that now as I could've easily fallen in love with her. I'm glad I held back. But, I stated to myself in secret before these things were ever thought of to happen that if this one didn't somehow panned out I'd might as well Odin it and go out in my prime. I take a long brown extension cord and tied it around my neck and took the dive, my fingers grab the cord and slip, I'm going to die. I stop myself. I'm crying. Hard. I hit up my buddy and go to his house for a cigarette, we talk, and I have a spiritual awakening. I am literally an aspect of this reality, and because I exist, I belong. I immediately got over Jess. It's not going to work out. It wouldn't have anyways. Thanks for this. Sorry wall. TLDR; talking to girl for month, kinda tragic dealing with post addiction and such but is beautiful soul. She dates another dude, which is her right, I'm over it and hurt, this is me venting it and how I got over her immediately (as I'm allowed hard limits too). Note: As I'm reading this, I come off as a creep in some instances, when she text STOP, that was her getting the last word in, I literally had been responding bye to her for the last few messages. Just bear with me, I'm not the most rounded edged of sensitive individuals and I ask for your patience if anyone does even bother with this."
114,vulnerability,offmychest,I wish I were stereotypically feminine,1,fghv3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/fghv3s/i_wish_i_were_stereotypically_feminine/,2020-03-11 04:51:20,"I've never been particularly girly. As soon as I was old enough to decide what I was wearing skirts, flowers and frilly things did not feature in it. But I didn't exactly play with lego or trucks, in fact I did dress my bear in my old baby clothes (though he was my friend not my child), had some Barbie dolls that I sometimes played with (all wearing pants and boots or sneakers) and even watched Sailor Moon though was also big into TMNT and had a dinosaur collection. In elementary school I had female friends, and even played with dolls over at their house and was invited to some girl only birthday parties; my bff was always my male cousin though. Around age 11-12 I chopped off my hair following a female friend's fashion sense and begun my love affair with flannel shirts, both followed for many years. As early as I can remember I disliked any sort of gender stereotype expectations thrown in my direction by any adults. Some examples, being told sometimes that I should be learning to cook or do laundry and iron because I was a girl, or getting told to brush my hair and look nice when I was going outside; I remember flipping out around age eleven when my grandma gave me a two piece swimsuit because it was too girly for me (it was highlighting my non existent breasts to come). Basically I didn't like being reminded I was a girl, treated different from my male cousins and in general used to think boys had more fun, and wished I was a boy (not in any body dysphoria sort of way though). When puberty came, it wasn't great, it never really is, but mine was complicated by getting a new citizenship, learning a new language and all the extra fitting in issues that came with that. There was also a year of 3 different high schools, 2 of which offered bullying as an extra curricular, all perpetrated by girls (the 2 months at an all girls school were particularly hellish, the forced uniform dress alone made me feel naked) . Suffice to say I never really fit in in high school. I don't think I had body dysphoria, but I had issues with my body, for a year I think I avoided the bathroom mirror and hated taking showers. I didn't really accept the chest growths until my 20s and even then it's never been a loving accepting relationship. Body awkwardness aside, in high school I picked up some more interests like playing guitar, various new genres of music like metal/prog, and physics, which begun a slow gender shift of my friend group though I still had female school friends back then. In college I studied, philosophy, mathematics, and computer science (though my journey there was convoluted, at one point I wanted to do animation but didn't get into the school). I had a female friend in first year from a screen writing class and later a female acquaintance in com sci, but as the years went on, neither stuck. I did pick up a more female dominated athletic hobby (aerial silks) at the time but from that point on all my friends I actually could really talk to, and had deep and serious conversations with were/are male. I remember while in college I saw my family doctor a few times, and at some point in passing she had told my mother that I was intelligent, more mature than most young women my age, but that because of that I'd have a very hard time finding a husband. At the time the feminist in me thought that was ridiculous, but now being a lot more read in psychology I know what she was getting at. Personality wise I'm not very agreeable, high in openness but also moderately neurotic and an introvert. If you've heard of the entertaining but not very scientifically precise Myers-Briggs tests, I'm an INTP, and though the Jungian approach to personality is highly incomplete, it is not wrong in the conclusion that my extroverted feeling is my weakest point (it's all about emotions and needs of others). In that respect I am like a 'guy' I'm interested in ideas, things, how they work, abstract models, not in feelings and people gossip, not unless I'm analysing these data sets to come up with an explanatory theory. All this bites me on the ass. I have tried making female friends a few times but it never goes anywhere, because I feel I cannot relate much. Last year I befriended a girl at my gym, we shared an interest but there wasn't enough, and once the dating talk (she got a bf) dried up there wasn't much overlap or at least I couldn't find it. She was a nice person though. Had another potential female friend, she had more random interests in reading popular science books and liked learning random things but her main obsession was makeup and fashion. I've been to a few dinner type gatherings with her and her female friends but often conversation turned into make up or fashion or how some food tastes like or travel and spas. I know it sounds like I'm stereotyping women, I think perhaps those topics may just be relaxing for some people or fun but they are dull for me. I'd rather hear your strong opinion about quantitative easing or ontic vs ontological interpretation of the wave function or something. Part of me also wishes I had better female relationships and had learned how to 'girl'. Admittedly when I was younger I rebelled against the idea and rejected girly things outright, and didn't have a high opinion of women who obsessed over those things. I had in the last few years taken a curiosity deep dive into say beauty and female fitness youtube just to see what it was like, and readjusted my judgemental opinion a bit, learned people are often more complex, at least some were, there was often some vulnerability in it I could somewhat relate to though so many things some girls obsessed over were on a whole other level. Unfortunately none of it made me cultivate an interest though admittedly I'd like to learn to do some makeup and hair to honestly improve my mating value. Which brings me to my final point in this epic essay - men. My relationships have been more or less a disaster. I do take responsibility though, I was often not relationship mature, unhappy for other reason and making poor mate choices. Truth is though, better choices for non stereotypically feminine women like me seem sparse, smart attractive and successful men, do for the most part want the feminine woman, and she better not be in the same field as him or it gets competitive - at least it has felt like it. I guess I am just frustrated, I feel things would easier if I were more of a status quo. I don't know how to make myself care about these external things, I do want to improve them because it is a strong signal. Plus it's irrational to expect different results while doing the same thing over and over. I do identify it as a problem. It would be nice to have female friends but I think that may be an even harder thing to achieve than learning cat eyes. Anyway, thanks if you read this far, I just needed to get this off my chest."

Well thats not my problem Im grateful for the life that I was given and the live I lead and have, but I dont think you should compare peoples happiness to other peoples misfortunes (even though I just did) Im rambling I just want to feel like my friends love me and care about me. And sometimes I do, dont get me wrong, this isnt one of those things where Im like my friends dont like me but I like them theyre terrible people I love my friends, and Im sure they love me, but I wish they would show it a little more, lately it just feels like they dont want anything to do with me. Im not going to say any names because I just dont like being so troublesome. But I dont really care? Thats a lie, I do care, very deeply actually, I feel like my whole life Ive been bending over backwards behind the scenes with these astronomically high hopes and happy and glossy expectations that theyll call me or text me with a how are you? Or a how was your day? But it never happens. I gleam at my phone with excitement everyday waiting for someone to tell me how their day went or how cool of a journey they went on, or just a funny little moment from their day that I probably wont get but Im just happy to hear from them. It never happens. Its depressing really. I live this life with expectations about being loved by my friends. Not just one specific group of people, my friends over the years have hurt me in so many ways and Im very tired of it. Emotionally I mean, but what is there to do? Not have friends? I cant do that, I WONT do that I should say. I need my friends, not only to live my everyday, but to hang out with and to do everything with, maybe not one specific person, but a bunch of people I can rely on in a pinch, who I trust with my life kind of people you know? I used to think life was all about the friends you made, and that was it, it was all about friends and connections and other people, I dont mind the person I am, actually I like me, I dont hate me and I dont think Im a bad person. (More on this later) I think the people I surround myself with disappoint me very often, and its awful, because I want to forgive them so bad, but I cant, because they keep letting me down, sometimes they dont treat me the best, and sometimes I dont want to see them at all as a result. It sounds like theyre bad people right? Im partly to blame Im irritable and irresponsible, hot headed and I push a lot of people away, but they still stick around, so maybe Im the bad person? Im not sure what kind of person I am, if I even am a kind at all, I think a lot, about what life would be like if I had friends who were close to me and loved me dearly, I just came down for spring break and honestly, I thought to myself that it would be a great break because I came back to the town where all my friends still are, but actually its really depressing. Almost none of them make any effort to see me Its heartbreaking I dont usually cry anymore, not really anyway, but if I could cry I would, its so terrifying that all these people I hit up to see were all either busy or just genuinely dont want to see me, and thats ok, but at least say it to my face instead of leaving me hanging with my hopes of seeing you. This isnt a script, you could have guessed that, I know, but i really need to talk, to me, to myself, because I dont know what kind of person I am, I dont know if Im a good person, I dont think I can be a good person, and thats ok, if Im a shitty person then thats who I am. But I dont want to be My friends dont like me. Its faint but I can tell, I very often have these hunches and I can pick up on moods and contextual clues very quickly when it comes to stuff like this, I feel like they all think Im some thing theyre stuck with and we arent actually friends you know? Itll gnaw at me until something cracks or until we arent friends anymore, it always happens. I dont want it to happen though. I cant stop it Its too much I can tell that if they get a chance to cut and run, theyre running They dont answer me when I talk to them unless its directly I dont know anything about anything man Im spiraling? Nah thats not it, I understand whats going on, I just dont like accepting it, its awful really. By the way, Im not sure this will ever be published. Its not about bravery or vulnerability, its about an image, sure some people know Im kind of messy when it comes to this stuff, but I cant have everyone think that, because, honestly. Who wants to hang out with this loser with abandonment and trust issues? I wouldnt."
116,vulnerability,offmychest,Im an 18 year old going through relationship problems.,1,finz2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/finz2j/im_an_18_year_old_going_through_relationship/,2020-03-15 06:28:48,"Im not sure where to begin. For anyone that is reading this, thanks for checking this out. As the title suggests, Im 18 years old and going through relationship problems with my girlfriend of two years. I feel like Im 1 in a 1,000,000 other people going through the same thing - yet as Im sure everyone reading can agree, problems in a romantic relationship suck really, really hard which makes it hard not to seek support as an individual despite being amongst a sea of other cases. When I look back at all the problems Ive had, I think - yeah theres no way this relationship is working at all, time to haul ass. Yet I just dont have the balls or courage to end things. This is my first relationship, making everything really raw and scary to go through. I know myself that I have such little experience in handling the problems that are on my doorstep right now, which makes me pretty afraid of everything negative in the relationship. The one thing I want to get off my chest is how fearful I am in an argument with my girlfriend. I hope someone out there relates to this, but there is just something within my brain that makes me freeze up when Im being argued with about anything really. It compels me to run away, not literally but mentally, from the issue. When an argument starts, its the avoiding of her that I get the most out of in terms of feeling at ease. I find myself tired of the same arguments, always begun by her in complaint of myself. Im tired of the lack of emotional security/consistency, where a day can go amazing only to be turned on its head by the slightest of errors. If theres a way for the CIA or those types to replicate the same pain that comes from emotional insecurity, then theyd have unlocked a hell of an effective torture method. What bothers me most is how much she makes up my time, and how that time would be if she werent there. Friends wise Im pretty deprived, Ive always really been. I have one or two close friends but hanging out isnt a thing since they live far off. This probably puts me in a position of vulnerability to her where the fear of loss keeps me in the relationship despite being unhappy. All of these problems come with stress, and with stress comes all of the horrible physical affects such as a lack of appetite, concentration etcetera. Thats worrying for me since Im in my first year at University which Im in the middle of. She is too. I dont want to sound like I despise her or do not at the very least want to love her in the truest way. Ive felt real feelings for this girl and never have I felt coldness for her. But having argued constantly with each argument ending with concessions I make in order to try and keep her happy, of which I hardly agree with, Im reaching the tipping point. Here comes the big question, of which I ask of you kind readers of the internet. In your first relationship did you feel at all in the same way as I do right now? In reality, this is a half-arsed cry for help by a stranger in a moment of crisis with barely any details. But even if nothing constructive comes out from this, at least Ill have gotten something off of my chest. Thanks!"
117,vulnerability,offmychest,I don't understand people my own age,1,fndx9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/fndx9r/i_dont_understand_people_my_own_age/,2020-03-23 15:29:15,"**TL;DR I feel like a total alien a 23 year-old's body because I share little to no interests, values, or hobbies with people my own age.** People my own age weird me the fuck out. I've always been introverted, including suffering from some moderate chronic depression. As a child I was standoffish with other kids, often preferring to play alone with my imagination, or just to read or write. I'm not incapable of forming friendships, romantic relationships, or just being social, but I always limited my circle to a very very small handful of people, many of whom were older than me (my best friend when I was 7-8 was a middle schooler who eventually moved away). Despite being raised in a loving family, I felt it was a very lonely childhood. But my parents, teachers, and therapists chalked this up to me being mature for my own age, and reassured that one day the other kids would catch up and things would feel less isolating. Since then I have ""grown up""; I went to college, had my fair share of crazy impulsive ""young"" experiences, and now I'm graduated, just turned 23, moved halfway across the country, and am working a full-time job. Yet now I find it even **more** difficult to relate to my peers. For example: **- Everyone is extremely self-oriented and consumerist.** We seem to live in a culture of vanity, materialism, and shattered self-esteems. Everyone is all about the latest tech gadgets, video games, clothes, makeup, cars, blah blah fucking blah. Open up Snapchat or YouTube and it's exploding with videos for HOW TO GET JACKED FAST or soulless, poorly-veiled product advertisements masquerading as self-help pep-talks posted by rich influencers (I really really hate influencers). Pop culture is bursting with casual celebrity worship and creatively bankrupt media, including faux-nostalgic Top 40 music and awful throwaway Netflix shows churned out by corporations seeking to maximize their market share. And you're obligated to ""binge"" them (yay, normalizing excessive TV consumption!) It goes beyond pop culture. People are so ungrateful for how amazing the standard of living is in modern America. I have young co-workers at my white-collar engineering job who complain incessantly about their salaries and perceived slights by management; meanwhile they go skiing in the mountains every weekend and live in luxury apartments in gentrified urban ""tech"" areas. Not to mention with all this COVID shit, they're lucky to be employed at all. Acts of service or giving back are rare for my age group, too. And if they do give back, they usually post it all the fuck over social media to let everyone know how altruistic they are. I volunteer a lot with outdoor stewardship groups (95% of whom, btw, are over the age of 35), but I only bring it up in conversation when asked, and never in a way that says ""Look how much better I am than you"". It feels like this whole society is just living in an all-expenses paid trip to Disneyland. It's all about their experiences, their beefs, their accomplishments, with no concept of service or humility or sacrifice. **- Everyone is so wired into their little machines.** It's corrosive. Go out in public and everyone is bent over like an ostrich craning to get their digital dopamine hit. Go to a concert and everyone is filming it. Go hang out with friends and everyone is staring at their phones, not giving their full attention to either activity. And there's so much content, all the time. They all have a Twitter, a Snapchat, a Reddit, an Insta, a Finsta, a TikTok(?!!). Endless, cascading waterfalls of bullshit streaming over their brains and blowing straight out their asses like a bad plate of Taco Bell. None of them even form their own opinions on the content! They just regurgitate the most recent witty or emotionally convicted tweet that popped up on their timeline (because it feeeeeeels good!) and lick the boots of whatever Internet authority figures they relate to the most. And anytime they go somewhere or do something, it's gotta be posted about on Snapchat or Instagram; it's like they're incapable of internalizing experiences without external validation. I know that old people do this too (often worse) but I just wish people my age were smarter and could turn off their phones, experience the present, and maybe, just maybe, talk to each other. **- Everyone is nasty, irreverent, and reactionary.** People can't think for themselves. They have to be told by others exactly what the ""correct"" opinion to have is, and if someone's behavior doesn't meet the hair-breadth width of what's acceptable, they explode. Especially online. Instead of educating those who make regrettable choices, people choose to put others ""on blast"" or ""cancel"" them by drowning their mentions with horrible comments and death threats. And they laugh about it! The really hilarious thing is, most of these people can't even defend those convictions themselves. This goes for both liberals and conservatives. Furthermore, the amount of irony and irreverence you see in our generation is just toxic to having a genuine or sincere discussion of feelings. I understand humor can help people cope, but when every single tragedy, life struggle, or discussion deeper than a puddle of piss gets subjected to a battery of ironic memes and contrarian hot takes, it makes for an extremely alienating experience. Humans are meant to share those deep emotions and thoughts with each other, not wallow in irony to feel superior than the crowd. **- Everyone drinks. Constantly.** I don't know if this is a thing where I live (Denver) but every social activity revolves around alcohol. Wanna have a chill night of just sitting around talking, maybe watch a movie or play some Guitar Hero? Fuck that, let's play beer bong or drinking games. Wanna go out around town and explore? Let's just do a bar crawl. Wanna catch up and just talk about life? Let's go to a brewery, where's there's zero food selection but hundreds of overpriced and equally shitty craft beers you can pretend to enjoy. Why can't we just exist and talk without alcohol being involved? **- Everyone seems to fear responsibility, vulnerability, and commitment.** Nobody wants to grow up. It's parties and bar crawls every weekend. No planning for the future, no long-term goals or commitments, or thoughts of where they might be in 5 years. I'm not saying people need to settle down and transmogrify into Gregory Peck in a grey flannel suit, but Jesus. You can plan ahead a little! Romantically it's even worse. People on dating apps (which I have since abandoned) are either using them as validation games or as hookup roulette. The few who do actually engage (beyond dull, minimal replies) usually bail after the first date. Even if the dates are pleasant, people have this idea that lacking a wild ""spark"" or instant connection implies that it's time to give up. And when they do, a lot of people lack even the courtesy to say ""Hey, sorry this isn't working out!"" and instead toss people wordlessly aside like a half-eaten cookie. On top of that, nobody seems to value committed relationships, putting in work, or the idea of having family. My last long-term relationship petered out because (among other issues, several my fault) my partner wanted to just drop out and start over instead of communicating and working on our issues. And I see that elsewhere; people can't communicate feelings, resolve conflict productively, or compromise. I think that's why polyamory is so popular nowawadys. You get multiple needs filled from multiple partners instead of working on bettering yourself and your relationship like a fucking adult. Not to mention, I don't know how many people I've talked to who have openly expressed naked fear or disgust(!!!) at the idea of having kids, which deeply saddens me. Kids are work, and stress, and money, but they are also one of nature's greatest gifts. All being said, people can choose their own lifestyles, but the increasing prevalence of these attitudes among my age group has me worried that I'll never meet someone like-minded. &amp;#x200B; Digressing here. I get that a lot of this comes off as judgmental and high-strung. I know not everyone my age is like what I described. And for those who are, I try to be as open-minded as I can, to go with the crowd sometimes and to just chill the fuck out. I recognize not everyone has the same interests or priorities as me. But this is /r/offmychest, not /r/nuancedobservations. Sometimes I feel pretty fucking depressed about this stuff, and all I want is a few friends or a partner who just *get it*, who understand what it feels like to be this adrift and disconnected from the people you are supposed to relate to the most. /rant"

I hope that I was able to give him 1/10th of the love and care he gave me in my life during his last days. Having to change my dads diaper, watching him lose his mind, watching him lose his ability to communicate, to hug, and to simply control his breathing literally killed me. All I could do in the end was wipe his tears. I felt so guilty for having to help my mom change his diaper. I always wanted to respect my dad and accidentally seeing his genitals when turning him made me feel horrible and like I violated one of the last spaces of vulnerability that he had.

And when she admitted to cheating on me and left me, you stepped up and were more there for me than anyone else and I had to step back. I actually took time to try to make things work in counseling between me and my wife. I wanted it to work out, but when she left me for him for good, you still had my back.

I like our shared, but still varied interests. I also knew that I was not and am not emotionally ready for a relationship, and I know that youre not either, not to mention that youre just not interested in me (like I keep reminding myself).

So to start, a little bit about the company -- the company is run by a man who's real name I will not mention for fear of legal repercussions, and even posting this story on here is a risk. However, if you google the company, you'll be able to find out his name. For this story, we will call him John. And I *will* say this: the company was founded in 2012 and has anywhere between 4 to 10 employees. The number changes a lot because it has such a high turnover rate. He expected us to work from 9 to 7 with very low pay. John hired me to work there in July 2019. At first I was excited because it was a new job. I had a weird feeling about John based on my interaction with him over email, phone, and during the in-person interview, but I ignored my intuition because I have a bad habit of doing that. In his initial email to me, he mainly talked about the universities his current employees attended; they were all top-tier universities. I would later find out that he had a very weird and toxic fixation on university pedigree. So when I start there, he has 10 employees. They were all around my age (recent college grads, all of whom were probably no older than 25). So it's my second day on the job and some of my coworkers invited me out to lunch with them. As we're eating, they start trash talking John. They were basically like, ""Yeah, he's been pretty pleasant with you so far, but give it 2 weeks and that'll change."" So I thought, ""Sure, whatever."" I kinda blew it off because I didn't really want to think about that on my second day on the job; I had just left another bad job and didn't want to confront the fact that I had gone from one bad job to another. Honestly, the baby monitor that he watched us through in the office should've been a major red flag. On top of that, we had very old iPhones and my coworkers' phone broke. She didn't break it; it was just super old. He said that it would come out of her paycheck. That should've been red flag #2. Over the next month or so, employees leave/quit. We went from ten people to three people (and an intern) in the span of 6 weeks. About a month into the job, John calls me into his office and tells me I'm doing terrible at my job because I hadn't ""made any placements"" (Recruiting jargon for placing people in job roles). I was absolutely dumbfounded because it wasn't my job to make placements; I was the Recruiting Coordinator, and it was my job to handle all of the emailing, scheduling, logistical stuff, etc. My job was not to make placements. I felt frustrated because he was expecting me to do things above my pay-grade and one month in, I had barely received any training. See, John was almost never in the office. We never knew where he went during the day, but he usually came into the office any time between 2pm and 5pm. He was not interested in training me and basically asked his other employees to train me. His other employees weren't exactly the nicest of people, turns out. They couldn't really be bothered to train me in full, either. I had no financial background so I began to felt like maybe I was in over my head. But the fact that nobody really wanted to sit down with me and explain anything to me exacerbated the situation. I had to teach myself a lot. Anyways, when John calls me into his office to scold me and express his disappointment in me, I began to cry because I'm a generally very sensitive and anxious person (with a history of Depression, Anxiety, and C-PTSD) and so I think he affected me a lot more than he affected other people. Granted, that doesn't make his actions any less objectionably sickening. He begins to tell me that ""even the intern is doing better than you. Why can't you be more like the intern?"" In hindsight, I shouldn't have cried in front of him because I think he prayed even harder on that vulnerability. As I'm crying, John was visibly annoyed and uncomfortable. Over the next month, I just try to SURVIVE the job. Going to work was emotionally difficult. I just tried to do what was asked of me, even though I hated my boss and didn't care for my coworkers. Then comes September. John calls me into his office again and it also happened to be my birthday (but I don't think he knew that; it just sucked that it happened on my birthday). He puts a brand new contract in front of me. He wants to move me from a W2 employee (full-time, perm) to a 10-99 employee (contracted). He said he wanted me to sign this new contracted because I wasn't ""bringing in enough money for the company"" and in fact, I apparently ""cost the company money"", which is just factually untrue. I was extremely upset because the contract would've drastically reduced my pay (I'd have to pay more in taxes -- self-employment payroll taxes, thus reducing my already tiny income), even though he claimed it wouldn't. By signing this new contract, it would make my original (W2) one null and void. I ask him if I can read it over before signing. He gives me one day. At this point I'm freaking out because I don't know if I should just sign or quit my job. That night, I go home and research and during my research, I actually end up finding out that John has been sued by a number of former employees for a number of different reasons, mainly because he either randomly cut people's paychecks when he felt like it (a lot of court documents are available online). I decide to contact the attorney who represented these (15 or so) people. He advises that I don't sign the contract, stating that it's better just to quit. John had a habit of making people's lives more miserable and difficult and that quitting would just put an end to all of this. The attorney goes on to tell me that John actually name-dropped said attorney's kids in an email because he was pissed off that this attorney was helping people sue him. Apparently, John said in an email that he ""masturbated to the thought of his (the attorney's) kids going to second-tier universities"". Again, his super weird obsession with school pedigree. I also learned that two defense attorneys quit on John because they thought he was too ""mentally unstable"" to represent. You know that if not even one, BUT TWO defense attorneys quit on you, you're probably very screwy in the head. Ultimately, I end up signing the contract (against the Attorney's advice) the next day because John gave me three options: sign the contract, willingly resign, or get fired. I signed because I decided that a small income was better than zero income; I was desperate and in a financial bind. I was also scared of John at this point. He hadn't done anything to physically hurt me, but he had berated me in front of other employees in the past (over our Slack and email) and there was just something very creepy and sinister about him. He was unpredictable and I honestly wouldn't have put it past him to physically hurt me. Despite the fact that I signed it, I started job hunting on the side. I knew I needed to get out of there ASAP. One Friday afternoon, I had a call with a recruiter for a potential job opportunity. So I take the call during my lunch break out in our lobby. About five minutes into our convo, my old boss appears from around the corner, more furious than ever before. Later on, I found out according to our lobby receptionist, who I had befriended, that he was actually eavesdropping on my call from around the corner. So he comes around the corner, stands there, and tells me to hang up the call. I don't really have a choice at that point so I politely tell the recruiter that something came up and I have to go. When I hang up, he points to the ground in front of him and says ""if you don't come here in the count of 3, you're fired."" In my head I'm like, ""What are you? My father?"" But I was also horribly frightened so I complied. I walk over to him and he tells me to follow him to the elevator. I was terrified. As soon as the elevators close, he just starts screaming at me. He starts yelling about how I'm ""the worst employee ever"" and that he hates me and that everyone in the office hates me too and how they all want me gone. He then tells me that my past employers probably hated me and that my future employers will hate me and that I'll fail at life. I'm shaking and crying at this point because I just don't cope well with situations like this. He leads me outside the building and just continues to hurl insults at me. He berates me for taking a personal call/job call on company time. I point out that it was my LUNCH time -- I wasn't on the clock. I wasn't even in his office. I was in the lobby. He didn't even have a rebuttal. He was like ""Well, I just don't like it!"" At this point, I can't take it anymore. I snap. I start to hurl insults back at him. I retort with how all the employees hate HIM, not ME (which is absolutely true; they complained about him everyday and practically thought he was the devil incarnate). I called him out about the high turnover rate and this MF had the gaul to respond with ""well, that's their prerogative!"" At this point, I'm so livid that I yell, ""THEY QUIT BECAUSE OF YOU! THEY QUIT BECAUSE YOU'RE AN AWFUL BOSS AND A BULLY!"" At this point, we're just two people loudly yelling at each other in public as strangers begin to stare. After we exchange a few more insults, he fires me. But it wasn't over yet. I had to give my key back to the receptionist, but he said that I wasn't allowed back in the building (even though it wasn't even his building, nor was the office really his office -- he was renting it and according to the receptionist, he was behind on his rent and they wanted to evict him soon) and that if I ever came back, he would ""call the cops and have you arrested"". At that point, I didn't give a hoot. I went back into the building with the intention of going upstairs to return my key to the receptionist. As I head towards the elevator bank, he tries to physically block me by putting his body in front of me. I quickly ran around him (luckily he didn't try very hard to physically stop me) and made it into the elevator. A few days later, I receive an email from him threatening to sue me if I don't take his company off my LinkedIn profile. I go on my LinkedIn with the intention of taking it off when I see everything on my LinkedIn erased -- my profile pic, connections, job history, bio section, etc. All that's left is a ;( in the ""about me"" section. I knew immediately it was John who erased it. He had access to my LinkedIn because I was still logged in on my work computer. He just went in and erased it all. Luckily, I've put everything back now, but I still haven't recovered my connections. He didn't even want me to keep my connections from the company. He was so paranoid about bad word getting out about his company and wanted to erase all traces of former employees for that reason. He even had bad reviews on Glassdoor deleted. Anyways, that's my story. Please read, spread, whatever you can do. I want everyone on the New York area to know about it. I am being the whistle blower on this company. I can't afford to sue right now, but I want this information to spread. He cannot keep getting away with this. I'm lucky I'm in a much better place now, but there's a piece of me I will NEVER get back after that. If you read this far, thank you so so much for your time."
122,vulnerability,offmychest,Stop lying when you say you want men to be vulnerable in relationships,2,frsq69,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/frsq69/stop_lying_when_you_say_you_want_men_to_be/,2020-03-31 02:21:55,"This is a pretty complicated thing. No offense to women, but sometimes they just don't know the amount of emotional labor they generate. To put it bluntly, male emotional expression (especially in relationships), is largely not for the benefit of the man but for the woman. I know this sounds men's-rightsy but bear with me here because I think it's an important point that people don't consider. As men we are told by society constantly that we have to act a certain way and meet all these standards to be lovable people. In relationships, all those expectations are turned up to 11. We have to be caring, but not smothering. Get angry at the right times and for the right reasons - anything else is toxic. Be someone's rock, but show that you're a person too. If you don't open up enough, you're emotionally stunted. Open up too much, and you're a basketcase. Show just the right level of affection - too much means you're insecure and too little means you're not invested. Expressing *unwanted* emotions to women gets you shamed. That's likely a lot of it. We're not only told but pressured by everyone to not let our anxiety until things have gone so wrong we can't take it anymore. For a lot of women it seems like a big shock when their husband or partner who they've been with for a while breaks down and has the same insecurities they do. They aren't assertive, they don't have all the answers or a plan, they aren't a rock, they're just as clueless as the rest of us. That confident, assertive, happy-go-lucky person you once fell in love with is gone. Many people say they want vulnerability with men but sometimes it happens so violently or so unexpectedly that it comes as a shock and *the woman ends up feeling unsupported*. That's more than enough to cause someone to back out of a relationship. It's only compounded when you take into account how males have been socialized for the provider role, so anything that threatens that ability to provide is often met with that feeling of lack of support. Another reason I think is important is that men and women tend to argue differently. This is anecdotal but in my life I've *never* seen a man try to emotionally hurt someone the way I've seen women. Whenever my ex gets angry, she's absolutely brutal. There's no limit, no sensible place to stop to keep the friendship. She'll go right on past ""fuck you"" to ""I hate you"" to ""I wish I'd never met you"". A lot of people when they get to that point let off really terrible stuff like saying someone never pleased them in bed, they can't believe their partner is such a loser to still live with their parents, or their partner is the ugliest person they've ever met and couldn't possibly get anything better than them. I feel like a lot of the time women go for the fucking jugular in an argument and try to cause as much emotional pain as possible, while men often substitute with anger and violence. Words hurt though, and once stuff like that has been said there's only so much you can do to backtrack it. Most men have been through this situation or have seen someone who has. And frankly, there's a lot of women out there that openly express their proclivities towards tall, rich, or handsome men. I was in a bar recently and there was a group of women giggling as guys came out of the bathroom. They were rating them (in very poor whispers) and you could just sense the air of entitlement they felt. It didn't matter if you were a person with feelings to them - you were their entertainment. It only takes a handful of these experiences to make someone feel like women are only after them for superficial reasons, and not because someone wants to love them in return."

And then we stumbled again and again til it had been 6 months of this limbo. And no one could know because the sanctity of our closely knit group was much too important. So instead it was fun. I said it was just fun I chose the words that damned me forever. Because of course I started noticing things. Of course I saw the way his eyes crinkle when he laughs. Of course I looked to him when the punchline hit just to glimpse his joy too. Of course I desperately wanted to be the reason he smiled like that. And of course the late nights led to soft revelations. Of course we talked of loss and heartache, of fear and failure, and each step into vulnerability cracked my easy heart open a little more. Of course I kissed away his tears, the taste of them salty on my lips. Of course he soaked up mine his arms strong and unconditional even as I broke apart. Of course I now notice the set in his jaw when he is pulled away by grief from his past. And of course I have become accustomed to his touch. Of course I crave it now, feel the ghosts of his fingers tracing over me while I try to lock away my traitor heart. Of course I bask in the shudder in his breath when I touch him, the familiarity of the dark and the jagged way we fit. Of course I read into the exhale of contentment he allows himself as we sleep, limbs entangled in the covers and each other. Of course I read into it all of course my blind heart takes it and stores it and lets these feelings grow. My heart craves closeness. The wonderful pain of being known. The ache and the ecstasy of being seen. I want him to know me. He says things that make the feeling in my chest so wonderful that its indistinguishable from pain. The way he sees me is a concept so foreign to myself but a person I so desperately want to be. And I love to hear how I am that person in his eyes. The one night I came closest to confessing looms over me. How quickly my words faltered when I looked in his eyes and he asked me what was making me look quite so sad in that moment. My true thoughts choked me, caught in my throat with my courage. I diverted. I denied melancholy I proclaimed all I was thinking was that I liked this. Whats this, he asked. Us, I said. I meant I wanted him wrapped around me like he was last night. I meant, stay with your head on my chest laughing at my unfunny jokes. I meant let me feel your heartbeat slow, let us drift off to sleep together more times than just tonight. I meant it felt so right in that moment. I meant all that and more. But I couldnt say it. Am I just an idiot? Am I just going to get so fucking hurt? I didnt realize he was who I wanted. And now I cant imagine what it was like without this longing. I just dont know what to do. I want to know how he feels but my own thoughts cloud my interpretation of his actions and I fear that if I ask, if I say how I feel I could ruin it all. Id rather drown silently in unrequited feelings than lose him. So I guess my question is, what should I do? What would you do?"

He is a man who had never accepted himself fully and his past, he has hardly ever forgiven people who have hurt him. He is a man I swore to myself to not become, yet why does it bite at me so hard? Forgiving him for all the pain he has caused throughout my life while I want to establish my own life outside of his purview and validation has been the difficult path to take. My impatient self will always want things to end or go away sooner, but I ain't even accepting nor even acknowledging my past experiences with him that caused wounds inside. Isn't it the most complicated relationship to have with parents who don't see themselves in the mirror as they are with acceptance and forgiveness? No matter how hard you've tried to help them see it, they are still the same deep down. I could hate them, and I would end up hurt myself for longer. These are some simpler reasons why I have to come up with stories after stories on my whereabouts and living condition. Honestly, I hate where I am now, having to lie to them, out of my own nature. I won't lie if any sentiments from my childhood make me say eww because that's how my depression is speaking. I wish I could let all these pain bleed out of my chest and feel okay again, but I know that's just wishful thinking, a fantasy world. I haven't fully lived a real life lately. I'm still not over just how enormous the impact is your parents are on you, especially when they weren't there emotionally and being supportive and wanting to connect with me. Maybe it's just me, with my trust issues, vulnerability issues. I don't know. I'm just aching so much now it weighs my chest down and hunching my back typing this out after crying and screaming in the bathroom listening to him talk. How do I even let go of all these? Help?"

These past few weeks have been challenging. For many of us, the continuous exponential growth of the Covid 19 meant that we are subjected to the quarantine - and rightfully so. We place people in quarantine to reduce social contact and limit the transmission of the virus. The goal here is to avoid a huge spike in infected cases that would ultimately overwhelm health services. Sounds simple really. Understandably, extended isolation puts a lot of people on edge. I get it. I really do. We are all bored at best and struggling at worst. But even if we are at the pinnacle of health and are likely to recover from the virus, we can still be carriers that infect the vulnerable. And when it comes to vulnerability, it has been proven that older adults are more susceptible to fatal complications of the disease. I live with my parents who are both seniors over 60. All my siblings have moved out some time ago with their families while I stayed so that there can be someone who can look after my parents. Two weeks ago, our government announced that we will be on extended quarantine as the virus continue to ravish the nation. Senators, doctors, and the absurdly rich are dying. It goes without saying that the less fortunate have even less of a chance due to a lack of accessibility and, dare I say it, priority. Now my mother has always been relatively active. She wakes up early and goes out to buy food and do her daily routine. Of course, quarantine doesn't agree with her. ""Don't worry"", ""I'm taking precautions"", ""Better me than you"" is being thrown out a lot recently. What really sucks is that when I volunteer to do all the errands (and I should be as I'm the one with the quarantine pass - yes, we get one per household), she ALWAYS has a reason why it should be her. ""Seniors get discounts!"", ""We have shorter lines!"", ""You don't know what to get!"". SIGH. Today, she was adamant to go out again tomorrow. I should add that what she wants to do is TOTALLY NON-ESSENTIAL. I get it she wants to go out. Quarantine sucks. Her daily routine is suffering. But she's not the only one suffering. I, too, want to go out. I , too, want to visit my girlfriend. I, too, want to hang out with my friends. I just hate that I seem to care about this more than her and now I'm the bad guy who's not letting her do what she wants to do. Now she's giving me the cold shoulder like I've done something unforgivable. I don't know what I'm expecting from posting here. Just frustrated that's all. Thanks for hearing a stranger out."

My stereotyping of young mums with a child to another man burned brightly in the front of my mind as if holding my palm above a candle knowing that it would take all but a second to burn. Yet out of boredom, shallow attraction and my need to find love I chased you and here we were. I couldn't speak, words evaded me. My ego and confidence as a young man able to talk to women deserted me. I stood in awe of your long dark curls, piercing eyes and as the confidence drained from my skin and the Caterpillars metamorphosed into butterflies in a heart beat. I fell so utterly in love. I had been here once before. I knew the mindset as a man that was expected of me with the ""baggage"" you carry. You needed stability and to feel safe that I did not judge or hold against you your past. That I loved your daughter like my own. I had never so much as held a child before let alone parented one. You saw my damage and you vowed to help me connect again. You teased my vulnerability from me with gentle tendrils and soft spoken words. You held me as I cried and spoke of things I'd kept locked away since I was a boy. We became best friends, I was convinced you were my soulmate. That I would face the world with you. You sang lullabies of the future that danced above my head at night as our bodies entwined with perfect symmetry. My arms enveloped your shoulders as we slept and dreamed of growing old. When we fought you resorted to the dirtiest of tactics. Often telling me to leave you as a form of defence, unable to take any criticism as gentle reminders that being rude is just not fair. That nasty comments delivered with a hammer and blown down a barrel leave holes in a person that words of ""I didnt mean it"" just dont fill. My patience waved and my frustration grew and telling me to leave??? Those holes they just grew. We sat in court about to give witness reports on your abusive ex baby daddy. You sided with him, you venomously told me how much you regretted this. I felt like an outsider. Only to find out he plead guilty before we were required and your venom and anger turned to a short lived apology and an excuse of stress. Still my loyalty remained. I after all had promised myself to you in my head for life. I had told myself that I needed to be the dad your daughter didnt have. I was not perfect, I had no training. My only qualification was my determination to keep trying. Your defenses of telling me to leave, they never fell. I kept us together even when you were not sure. I made sure I was an anchor for you and I promised you I would not leave. You threw things at my head, you forced me to leave, I sat in my car for hours waiting for you to calm down. I did everything I could to show you I was serious about us, to show you my loyalty and that I truly believed you were my future. Because when we were not arguing, you were/are an angel. You saved me from so much. And then you left. You had filled my head with engagement rings and marraige proposals and future events with your daughter, with our future children. You sold me a life and then once I had paid in full. You took it away from me. I feel lost, I feel abandoned. I feel like a child was taken from me that I never knew I wanted. I feel like a life has been taken from me, a grounding and an understanding of where I fit into this world. You gave me importance and you gave me a purpose. And now your friends taunt me with the knowledge you are off at a party 24 hours later, being introduced to other men with intentions that bring me to tears. Whilst I sit here wondering how I put this all away and look for a new future."
128,vulnerability,offmychest,"Losing my sister to mental illness and addiction, I wrote a letter to my (ex) brother-in-law... (very long letter).",1,f0wloq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/f0wloq/losing_my_sister_to_mental_illness_and_addiction/,2020-02-09 06:45:27,"........LETTER TO ROGER...... (Disclaimer: This is not an attack on you, but a concise cumulation of my thoughts and feelings as I feel I am allowed in response to my sisters life and death as well as the other issue. I originally did not want Heather and Brandon to see this, but there are things I would like them to know here. Plus, I know you will share it with them.) Roger, I would like to start with an earlier time of Sonjas life. Sonja and I were very close. We shared a bedroom and a bed throughout our entire childhood and that was very close quarters. Sisters have a special bond because, 1) We are genetically linked, and, 2) We are both female. You cant get much closer than that besides a mother and child. We fought a lot because she was mean and stubborn and I had a bad temper. Much of the time we were like oil and water. That being said, we still loved each other. She always had my back. Whenever I needed her, she was there. I was always there for her too, but she usually wouldnt share what was going on with her so I wouldnt know. Growing up, Sonja had a lot of bad treatment. She was made fun of by other kids about such things as her glasses and looks. I wouldnt drink after her because I thought she was gross. Donna wouldnt touch her because she thought Sonja had old woman skin. Children can be very cruel and mean (and I am including myself as an immature child). I regret making her feel so bad about herself. I have apologized to her for all the times I hurt her. That time was the onset of her low self esteem which she never got over. We carry such things with us for the rest of our lives. I carry many things still from my past. All Sonja has ever wanted was to be liked and loved! Thats why she has always gone overboard to please people. Our father was mean and cruel to us. I know this impacted her self esteem as well. She always took up for him anyway despite how she was treated. You will see this as the beginning of a pattern with men that took place through out the rest of Sonjas life. Im sorry, but when my father was wrong, he was wrong. I have had many arguments with my father and he has said and done things to me that are unforgivable. Just because he was my dad didnt mean he got a pass. I have to keep reminding myself that he is mentally ill, take a deep breath and walk away...but it is hard. Mama has stuck with him even though he has been very nasty to her over the years. She recognizes his mental illness. Mama had a very hard time dealing with Sonja as she grew up. She didnt know what to do with her and didnt understand what she needed. To this day (especially since her passing) mama has guilt and regret that she didnt understand her or never knew how to help her. Sonja has always displayed mental illness. Never diagnosed or treated which is more common than it should be. Now, this is a place to switch to a history of family mental illness and addiction. Sonja and I were predisposed to both. Genetically, we were ingrained with both. Both sides of our family have a long history of alcohol abuse. My fathers side has a long history of mental illness. On that side, a few cases of alcohol abuse were a result of mental illness. It is not a mentally ill persons fault that they turn to alcohol (or any other drug). They are trying to self medicate. The reason Sonja and I drank was to escape our minds...our thoughts...our feelings. Plus, we have to take in account the genetic link to addiction. ADDICTION IS A DISEASE OF THE MIND AND WE DIDNT CHOOSE IT! There are many factors that play a part in the make up of Sonjas mind. All things needed to be considered. These types need understanding, unconditional love and support. They should NEVER be abandoned! Even though mama had a hard time with her, she never and would have never abandoned her (that goes for the rest of us too). Now, I need to bring up one of Sonjas mental incapacities. The word is Codependency. I need to place a definition here so that you will understand better and for me to reference as I explain how Sonja was codependent. I will underline the parts that apply to Sonja because not all codependents have all of these symptoms. Codependency: Codependency is characterized by a person belonging to a dysfunctional, one-sided relationship where one person relies on the other for meeting nearly all of their emotional and self-esteem needs. It also describes a relationship that enables another person to maintain their irresponsible, addictive, or underachieving behavior. Do you expend all of your energy in meeting your partners needs? Do you feel trapped in your relationship? Are you the one that is constantly making sacrifices in your relationship? Then you may be in a codependent relationship. The term codependency has been around for decades. Although it originally applied to spouses of alcoholics (first called co-alcoholics), researchers revealed that the characteristics of codependents were much more prevalent in the general population than had previously imagined. In fact, they found that if you were raised in a dysfunctional family or had an ill parent, you could also be codependent. Researchers also found that codependent symptoms got worse if left untreated. The good news is that theyre reversible. Symptoms of Codependency The following is a list of symptoms of codependency and being in a codependent relationship. You dont need to have them all to qualify as codependent. * Low self-esteem.Feeling that youre not good enough or comparing yourself to others are signs of low self-esteem. The tricky thing about self-esteem is that some people think highly of themselves, but its only a disguise  they actually feel unlovable or inadequate. Underneath, usually hidden from consciousness, are feelings of shame.Guilt and perfectionism often go along with low self-esteem. If everything is perfect, you dont feel bad about yourself. * People-pleasing.Its fine to want to please someone you care about, but codependents usually dont think they have a choice. Saying No causes them anxiety. Some codependents have a hard time saying No to anyone. They go out of their way and sacrifice their own needs to accommodate other people. * Poor boundaries.Boundaries are sort of an imaginary line between you and others. It divides up whats yours and somebody elses, and that applies not only to your body, money, and belongings, but also to your feelings, thoughts and needs. Thats especially where codependents get into trouble. They have blurry or weak boundaries. They feel responsible for other peoples feelings and problems or blame their own on someone else.Some codependents have rigid boundaries. They are closed off and withdrawn, making it hard for other people to get close to them. Sometimes, people flip back and forth between having weak boundaries and having rigid ones. * Reactivity.A consequence of poor boundaries is that you react to everyones thoughts and feelings. If someone says something you disagree with, you either believe it or become defensive. You absorb their words, because theres no boundary. With a boundary, youd realize it was just their opinion and not a reflection of you and not feel threatened by disagreements. * Caretaking.Another effect of poor boundaries is that if someone else has a problem, you want to help them to the point that you give up yourself. Its natural to feel empathy and sympathy for someone, but codependents start putting other people ahead of themselves. In fact, they need to help and might feel rejected if another person doesnt want help. Moreover, they keep trying to help and fix the other person, even when that person clearly isnt taking their advice. * Control.Control helps codependents feel safe and secure. Everyone needs some control over events in their life. You wouldnt want to live in constant uncertainty and chaos, but for codependents, control limits their ability to take risks and share their feelings. Sometimes they have an addiction that either helps them loosen up, like alcoholism, or helps them hold their feelings down, like workaholism, so that they dont feel out of control.Codependents also need to control those close to them, because they need other people to behave in a certain way to feel okay. In fact, people-pleasing and care-taking can be used to control and manipulate people. Alternatively, codependents are bossy and tell you what you should or shouldnt do. This is a violation of someone elses boundary. * Dysfunctional communication.Codependents have trouble when it comes to communicating their thoughts, feelings and needs. Of course, if you dont know what you think, feel or need, this becomes a problem. Other times, you know, but you wont own up to your truth. Youre afraid to be truthful, because you dont want to upset someone else. Instead of saying, I dont like that, you might pretend that its okay or tell someone what to do. Communication becomes dishonest and confusing when you try to manipulate the other person out of fear. * Obsessions.Codependents have a tendency to spend their time thinking about other people or relationships. This is caused by their dependency and anxieties and fears. They can also become obsessed when they think theyve made or might make a mistake.Sometimes you can lapse into fantasy about how youd like things to be or about someone you love as a way to avoid the pain of the present. This is one way to stay in denial, discussed below, but it keeps you from living your life. * Dependency.Codependents need other people to like them to feel okay about themselves. Theyre afraid of being rejected or abandoned, even if they can function on their own. Others need always to be in a relationship, because they feel depressed or lonely when theyre by themselves for too long. This trait makes it hard for them to end a relationship, even when the relationship is painful or abusive. They end up feeling trapped. * Denial. One of the problems people face in getting help for codependency is that theyre in denial about it, meaning that they dont face their problem. Usually they think the problem is someone else or the situation. They either keep complaining or trying to fix the other person, or go from one relationship or job to another and never own up the fact that they have a problem.Codependents also deny their feelings and needs. Often, they dont knhow what theyre feeling and are instead focused on what others are feeling. The same thing goes for their needs. They pay attention to other peoples needs and not their own. They might be in denial of their need for space and autonomy. Although some codependents seem needy, others act like theyre self-sufficient when it comes to needing help. They wont reach out and have trouble receiving. They are in denial of their vulnerability and need for love and intimacy. * Problems with intimacy.By this Im not referring to sex, although sexual dysfunction often is a reflection of an intimacy problem. Im talking about being open and close with someone in an intimate relationship. Because of the shame and weak boundaries, you might fear that youll be judged, rejected, or left. On the other hand, you may fear being smothered in a relationship and losing your autonomy. You might deny your need for closeness and feel that your partner wants too much of your time; your partner complains that youre unavailable, but he or she is denying his or her need for separateness. * Painful emotions.Codependency creates stress and leads to painful emotions. Shame and low self-esteem create anxiety and fear about being judged, rejected or abandoned; making mistakes; being a failure; feeling trapped by being close or being alone. The other symptoms lead to feelings of anger and resentment, depression, hopelessness, and despair. When the feelings are too much, you can feel numb. THIS IS WHAT WAS NOT DONE FOR SONJA THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE. [There is help for recovery and change for people who are codependent. The first step is getting guidance and support. These symptoms are deeply ingrained habits and difficult to identify and change on your own. Join a 12-Step program, such as Codependents Anonymous or seek counseling. Work on becoming more assertive and building your self-esteem.] She was resistant to any help, this I know!........ Only you had the legal authority to force Sonja into a treatment center even if she went kicking and screaming. Money should not have been an issue, not for her life. All of her mental issues should have been examined to combat the alcohol abuse. In case Heather and Brandon ever find themselves facing anything like this, they need to know.... Gather as much information/education on the subject as you can (in this case, mental illness and addiction). This will equip you with the sympathy, understanding and resources needed to help the person. Codependents usually strongly deny that they are codependent, and I know Sonja would have denied it. Sonja definitely had low self esteem. She felt bad about herself. She had no self identity. All of the men she ever had a relationship with, she adopted his identity. She defined herself as HIS mate. She took on HIS interests and dropped her own. An example is with you, Roger. You liked racing, so she got into it. You liked football, so she got into it. I said something to her about that and told her I knew she didnt REALLY have an interest in those things and told her to get back to some of her own interests like music. She was desperate to please you and show the rest of the world that she was ROGERS WIFE! That is who she thought of herself as, not Sonja Marie, an individual with her own self identity and interests. She put you on a pedestal and thought of you as god-like. She wanted all of us to think you were perfect. Her love for you was sooo unhealthy. She constantly praised you on Facebook. She was obsessed. This is why she was so very devastated that you left her. She was already going through so much, too much for any one person to endure. Then, when you left, she felt her life was over. Control. Sonja has always felt like she had to be in control of everything. Like when I would stay at your house to be with the kids when you both went out of town. She had to feel like she was in as much control of her kids as possible. So, she placed what seemed like a whole pack of post-it notes all over the house to give me directions for what to do in many instances. Yes, I needed to know their doctors info and such, but some of the other stuff was ridiculous. There are too many examples of Sonjas control needs to list here. Daddy does stuff like that, a part of his mental illness. When she was at our house, I told her she needed to go and sign the divorce papers, because she had been putting it off in hopes you would change your mind. I went with her because I didnt know what state of mind she would be in. Before we left she said, I feel like I am being forced to do something. That was her saying that she felt like she had lost control, and that devastated her. I told her that she WAS being forced. Forced out of her job, marriage and home. Before she died, she lost all control of her life which put her in a very bad (and dangerous) place. She lost her job, her marriage and her home...all at once!!! That would be too much for a sane/healthy person to deal with. That on top of all she was already dealing with was a recipe for disaster. The one thing Sonja took back control of was drinking. She was actively trying to drink herself to death and no one was going to stop her. Thats why she barricaded herself in the house and yall had to keep taking the door off to get inside. Mama and daddy went down to check on her and she wouldnt let them in. They waited for an hour. She didnt want them to see her drunk and she didnt want them to stop her. She wasnt going to let anyone take that control away from her. Mama said she knows Sonja was not herself because she would have never not let them in. Denial. Sonja has always been one to deny her truths. Im ok! .... No I am not!......Whatever!...on and on she would go. I have a lot of regret and guilt that I didnt reach out to help her. I tried to stay out of her business and I knew she was being resistant to any help. She was so secretive. I think there are a lot of things we dont know that went on in Sonjas life. Some things that you DO know. I should have interjected myself on her behalf anyway. I dont know that I would have been successful, but I still should have tried. I should have been telling you all this before so that you would understand that leaving her would end her life. (I dont know, you might not have cared). You might have understood Sonjas history with mental illness and maybe, just maybe, have some sympathy for her that she deserved. The definition of codependency stated obsession as with people, and she WAS obsessed with you! She was obsessed with a lot of things and was OCD. When she would do something, she would develop and obsession over it. When she crocheted, she did crazily. She over did most everything. She put too much laundry detergent in the wash, thats why it smelled so strong. Yet again, there are too many examples to list here. With everything that was devastating her before she died, she obsessed over all of it. Thats part of why she couldnt cope with any of it, especially the divorce. The constant thoughts of it was literally driving her insane and suicidal. She was diagnosed as bipolar and I can see that...she was definitely manic and the other extreme was depression. She needed understanding and sympathy of that condition. She had a thyroid condition which has serious symptoms. A friend of mine had a thyroid condition and before it was discovered , she was placed into a mental institution because the symptoms mimic that of a mental illness. Again, some understanding was needed. This may upset Heather and Brandon. That is not my goal. I do not want them to hate me. They love and support you because you are their father and the only parent they have left. They feel obligated to stand by you no matter what. I feel a deep obligation to stand up and speak up for my sister no matter what. I feel I have to do that. I realize it is too late for her now, but I am still obligated. She was my 100%! I must say that I should be allowed to express my honest feelings about my sister who I loved tremendously. I am coming from a place of love for her and how everything has made me and my family feel. The big question that is a risk to ask and answer is... Do I think you had a role in Sonjas death? Yes, I do. Sonja sent a couple of suicide threats over text message. She sent me a picture of a knife in her hand and wrote underneath it, Tell him it is all because of him!. I still have it in my phone. That was Sonja holding you responsible for her wanting to die......NOT ME! Mama has owned up to how she felt she failed Sonja. I have owned up to how I failed Sonja. Can you own up to your part in failing Sonja in the ultimate way? The first and many times you threatened to leave her really pissed me off. She always needed your unconditional love and support, no matter how hard it was. When you spoke your marriage vows, there was...In sickness and in health! My sister was sick!!! It would have been no different had she been struggling with terminal cancer. Would you have left her if she had terminal cancer? I will give you this...I know that it was very hard for you to watch her destroy herself with alcohol. The other part I have had a problem with is you giving her chances! When a person has mental illness and severe depression, is not an option to give that person chances! They have it, they cant help it and it will never go away. She was made to feel like she had the responsibility to get rid of her mental illness and depression when there was no way for her to change that. It wasnt her fault and she shouldnt have been made to feel like it is some kind of button to be switched off. This in itself can put a person in a very, very bad place as I know it did Sonja. She was being blamed for everything and so she blamed herself which was horrible. Another thing I have a problem with is you continuing to use alcohol around her when she was struggling to not use herself. She said that you told her that, Im not the one with the problem! Her problem was mental illness and depression and she used alcohol to escape all of that. Self medicating. Yes, alcohol was A problem, but it wasnt the root of her problems. Did you even know or consider the real root of her problems or did you really think it was all alcohol (which was not her fault)? Did you care? Remember, addiction is a disease of the mind and not an addicts fault. You should have been supporting her by NOT drinking around her. That was 100% CRUELTY! You call yourself giving Sonja chances to change, then you continued to drink around her. Do you see how horribly wrong and cruel that was? That was so wrong of you! I know why Sonja drank, because I drank for the same reason, to escape my mind. We were alike in many ways. I knew her better than anyone knew her. When she came to us between the weeks she was packing her things, she cried a lot. One of the times, she went to Donnas. She was drinking there. She was acting crazy. Donna called mama and mama rushed over. Donna called me, but I was on my way to an NA meeting. I came directly afterwards. When I got there she was desperately trying to open a bottle of Donnas wine. She cut her hand with the knife she was using to dig the cork out. Donna had hid the rest of her beer and mama grabbed the one she had in her hand and threw it in the yard. Sonja went to the yard to get what was left of that beer. Things were very bad for her to openly drink in front of mama...something she never did. I took the wine bottle from her and told her to stop. She started crying and collapsed in my arms. Then she started saying over and over, If he dont love me, I dont love me! Those were the words of someone who is suicidal. She should have NEVER gone back to that house alone. The two of you should have stayed together to pack up so she wouldnt have been alone. She was too fragile to be alone. It was dangerous! Sonja had many years struggling with the use of alcohol, but this last time she was on a mission. She was determined to drink more and faster than she ever had in the hope that it would take her life, and she succeeded! I told her a couple of years ago that if anything ever happened to you, that she wouldnt survive it. I was thinking of your death, not divorce because I never thought you would actually leave her. But I was right, she couldnt survive it. She was determined not to leave that house, only in a body bag. It was told to me that on the night she was found that you stated that you couldnt believe she had done that to you. Really?????To you??? You left her and that destroyed her! She did it to herself because you left her! I dont think Sonja thought of what she was doing as suicide, so she felt ok with God about it. She didnt think drinking was a form of suicide, but she knew what she was ultimately doing. Ok, now I need to address your decision to start a relationship with one of our other family members, Ashley. We know from phone records that you had been engaging with Ashley for quite some time...well before you leaving Sonja. I remember seeing you flirt with her during some of our family gatherings. You do realize that was adultery and you were cheating on Sonja, right? Same thing with Ashley/Cale. Even if all you were doing was talking/texting, it was an emotional investment which is also adultery. You went on that cruise and came back and you told Sonja that it was the best vacation you ever had. As if to say, the best vacation because Sonja wasnt there and Ashley was. I know that hurt her. You have had many vacations with your family.... Sonja, Heather, Brandon and the girls. You mean to say that the cruise you went on outranked any vacation you ever spent with your family? What about that trip to California with Sonja, Heather, Marvin and the girls? That seemed like a pretty amazing trip. Was Ashley that great that she overshadowed time spent with your granddaughters and your daughter...and wife? How cruel of you to say that to Sonja! That was specifically pointed at Sonja to hurt her. It was very cruel of you. Another thing to make her feel even smaller. Others in my family feel the same way about that. It is bad enough that you cheated, but with a damn family member? Cales wife? Your nephew? That is some fucked up, redneck, disgusting, Jerry Springer shit! What Ashley said was wrong and hurtful...that you werent REALLY Cales uncle and you werent blood related. Cale has always been with our family since the age of 2. A couple of family members have told us that Sonja confided in them that you had cheated on her before. How many times did you cheat on her? It was understood by those family members that Sonja kept quiet about your affairs and let you get by with it because she was so afraid you would leave her. That was a codependent trait....fear of abandonment. That shows Sonja as having no self-worth. It is very sad that she would allow herself to be disrespected in such a way just to keep you from leaving her. When you decided on the divorce, she offered you benefits and an allowance to have another woman. Sonja was so sadly desperate to keep you. If all of that is true, you have been deceiving our family for years having us believing you were a faithful husband, and Sonja, in her sickness, hid that from us as well. I believe she took many secrets with her to the grave. What added to Sonjas despair was that you were in such a hurry to be rid of her, selling the house and getting the divorce over so you could rush to be with Ashley. She knew about Ashley. What makes me sick is while you were doing all of that, Sonja was in the depths of devastation and wanting to die and you could care less! You knew about her suicide threats, but it didnt seem to concern you. Our family has always loved and respected you as Sonjas husband, your kids father and your granddaughters papa. All of these years we have thought so highly of you. Mama said she didnt only lose a daughter, but she also lost a son...meaning you. She has cried over this. Yours and Ashleys choice to be with each other has shown nothing but complete disrespect for our entire family including your kids! Both of you disrespected Cale and Sonja. Did you even think about how it would effect Heather and Brandon? It has really put them in a horrible position between all of us and you. They love you and want to support you, but I know that they know what you have done is wrong. They also love us, theirs and their mothers surviving family. They know our family is very upset with you and that puts them at odds. Poor Heather came to our birthday celebration for Sonja and told mama that she thought we hated her....because of what YOU did! That should make you feel ashamed! They have absolutely nothing to do with your poor choices. We love them and need them to stay close to us. They are my sisters children and I have loved them just as if they were my own. That is the most special thing I shared with Sonja...our love for her children and grandchildren. You havent been fair to anyone. All you were thinking about was yourself and Ashley. Not caring who you left in your wake. Cale shouldnt have jumped you, but for his own sake. I understand how he felt. It needs to be understood how our family feels after all of this. We are hurt and angry. We really didnt need that on top of losing Sonja (in such a tragic way). Heather and Brandon didnt need that after losing their mother. So unfair to them! Selfish! You told Donna that you didnt care what any of us thought except grandmother and papa. That is what you think of us after all these years? You are not the person I always thought you were. Well, I can tell you that my parents are not happy. Mama is more upset with Ashley (I think your equally to blame). I have never seen my mother so angry with someone as she is with Ashley. She said she has never hated anyone until now. She believes that it was Ashleys responsibility to reject you. I disagree with her...it was both of your responsibility to reject each other. We didnt know about you and her when we had the visitation at our house for Sonja. So, after the fact, I can not believe Ashley a to had the audacity to come to our home knowing what she had been up to with you. Smiling and acting like nothing was going on. Had I known, I would have asked her to leave. No, I would have demanded that she leave... I would have wanted you to leave too but I would not have done that in respect for Heather and Brandon. DISRESPECT FOR MY SISTER AND OUR FAMILY!!!! Unforgivable!!! All of this has played out in my mind since and before Sonjas death, almost driving me insane....I HAD to get it out. I have talked about all of this in my NA meetings and to family, but I desperately needed to let you know how I feel so that I can move on from here. Sonjas death has devastated our family, including your kids. Mama said she has never been so depressed and grief stricken as she is over Sonja. Her doctor offered her medication for depression but she is afraid of becoming dependent. Mama said she knows that Sonja abused herself and was headed for something very bad to happen, but that she knows what ended up killing her was a broken heart. I have never experienced anything like this with the loss of a loved one. The circumstances surrounding her death and how she died...alone and broken, haunts me every day. She was there for two days before she was found and that also haunts me. Denise is having a very hard time after finding Sonja that night. My family shares my same feelings for the most part about everything. I have no desire to see you again and I do not want to see Ashleys face either. I do not wish to do physical harm to anyone. Karma will rear its head one day and perhaps more than once. Since I know Ashley will be reading this, I will address her directly.... You disrespected my sister and all while she was going through complete hell. You helped push her further into hell. I have never really liked you. You are fake! I have never trusted fake people. You have shown your true colors to us all. You have been very spiteful and conniving to Cale. I worry about what you are saying and doing around Luke. He is way too young to be in the middle of this shit. You may think that Luke is none of my business. When it comes to children, I will ALWAYS have my say...they are innocent. I dont put anything past you, you gargantuan cow! The thoughts of my sisters grandchildren being anywhere near you makes me cringe! Attached here are a few videos that you should all watch that explains the issues that Sonja had and supports what I have shared about Sonja. In the video, Addiction is a disease Part 2, it is explained that there is an addiction gene. I know Sonja and I had/have that gene passed on to us from family. In some people, the gene lays dormant until something triggers it later in life. Neither Sonja or I had a problem with addiction until we had the gastric bypass surgery. I truly believe that the surgery triggered that gene and we became addicted. Very interesting. The first video is specifically meant for you, Roger. It is a husband of a woman who suffered with mental illness and suicidal ideation. He struggled very hard with her but his steadfast love for her saw her through her devastating illnesses. 1.

You told me you'd felt that, that you understand now, and that you're sorry. &amp;#x200B; Someone you were interested in getting to know more, who seemed interested in you just drops off the face of the planet and you're left wondering what you did wrong. It's not the end of the world. It's probably more harmful after sex, and definitely more harmful after an emotional connection, but *absolutely* not the end of the world. Now imagine you're getting to know someone and it gets really emotional very quick. You're not scared of the emotions, instead you embrace them. This person is in a lot of pain, and in a way you are too so you find it very easy to open up, and feel safe and cared about. This person seems to trust you with how they feel and that makes you feel great, and you just want to be there for them. &amp;#x200B; Then it becomes clear it's not a normal connection. Something about this is clearly different. You have exes, and you've dated about maybe too much but you've never met someone that you get so close to in such a short period of time. You've never felt so wanted or needed. And on top of that, you've never been so into somebody as a person. All the traits, quirks, the way they look and the dumb shit they say are pretty much all you ever thought you wanted. You're both broken people, and that's beautiful. You figure they feel the same way about you. You see it in the way they look at you. That piercing glare of affection after sex. When you hold them, they hold you closer. Those nerve-wracking vague conversations about the future and where you're headed together. The things you'll do. You don't care about the things that might hold you back. You spend New Year's Eve together with all these ideas. \--- But this person is still in pain and needs more. They're trying so hard to get over an ex and haven't had the chance to ever feel sexually free. It starts to seem like what you're offering isn't enough. They want to keep dating non-exclusively because they're scared of missing out on sexual experiences. You try to understand this, given the context, and while you really wish you were enough, their position makes sense to you. After all, she's so innocent and inexperienced. You know, if you're being honest, she deserves that chance to take some time to figure out what they really want and who they are. But you know what she's like sexually. You know the things she does for you and how much she craves it. And every time you see her, you can't help but visualise filthy degrading sex occurring maybe just hours before coming to see you - or maybe just hours after. It's so hard to take your mind off of and you feel like you're losing control of the emotional connection you had. Maybe she looks at them after sex with the same piercing glare of affection. Maybe it was all in your head, and what you had didn't feel special to her at all. &amp;#x200B; But every time she's there again, you're reassured that she wants you. That you're headed in the right direction, and she's just figuring herself out. You feel it in the things she trusts you with. The amount of time she spends with you, and again, how close she holds you. And that glare. But you've become helplessly possessive. The intrusive thoughts fill you with more and more pain. You want things to speed up. You need her to want you and only you. Realising she doesn't, feels like everything has been taken from you from those initial conversations about the future and you're terrified. You put too much pressure on, and try to cautiously articulate how you feel about this, but it only pushes her away further. But once more, she's there again. Laughing and blushing. Talking about the future and caring about you. She wakes up next to you in the morning. She goes to wash her hair in your shower. She kisses you goodbye and leaves for work. &amp;#x200B; Then nothing. You send messages and nothing comes back. &amp;#x200B; You honest to god believe it's more likely that she died or got into some trouble than that she would ghost you, so you're concerned for her. You leave voicemails. And more messages. Before, you'd been texting every day without fail, and seeing each other about 3-4 times a week. And now it's been seven days. Her hair is still in your shower drain and on your pillows. Her hand-prints are still on your mirror. Knowing the mental pain she was in, you seriously consider filing a missing persons report. She could have hurt herself. Then a message. Scolding me for leaving voicemails and spamming her. That it was way too intense and she needed to get away. That I just reminded her of the mental place her ex left her in. \--- It's over. I have closure. And I can move on. I'm not obsessive. I can take being let down. But I fixate. I date some more, but I start to realise I'll never find someone just like her, someone who makes me feel that way. A few months later I send a few messages and she just tries to sell me dirty pictures, as if I'm a desperate clown who just wants to see her naked again. It hurts but I just carry on with life. I felt pathetic that I only knew her for a few weeks, but she keeps showing up in the back of my mind. It starts to stop. But then at the worst times in life it happens again. It was just something I couldn't let go of, and I felt like an idiot for that. I've never been that person. I used songwriting to try and take control of how I felt, and because I'm incapable of writing fiction, and convincingly singing fiction. I don't know if it helped anything but every time I sing it, it's cathartic. Of course, it makes me feel more pathetic to be the guy who wrote a song about a girl he knew for 3 weeks. I figured she would just be 'the one who got away' and I was starting to get so okay with that. But when I'm down and out and my head feels all fucked up I remember the only person who seemed to 'get me' like that and made me feel like a human who didn't have to show off or pretend to be something I'm not. I wondered if she even thinks about it. If she has regrets, wishes, or ever thinks about what would happen if we tried again. Or if she just wants to keep me as far away as possible, and thinks it was nothing more than a three-week fling. &amp;#x200B; I'm there at a low after seeing somebody else I didn't wanna see in a club approach me trying to apologise for ghosting me then immediately getting as far away from me as possible. Then in the same night, a girl I'd just been on a date with once, and got along with well sends me a text saying no matter how lovely it was, it wouldn't work and we shouldn't see each other again. I start to feel repulsive. I drink too much and throw back some codeine. And for fear of missing out, and fear of never finding out what she thought, I messaged her. \--- It'd been over a year. &amp;#x200B; She replied instantly. She's still struggling and I can't help but care again. She seems happy to talk to me. I figure it's worth exploring why. We open up a little again. I discover that she did have those regrets and wishes, and she admits it was just a bad time in her life. She opens up about how it would have probably been good for her if she'd stuck with me. She apologises, wholeheartedly, for ghosting me and pushing me away. She told me she'd felt that, that she understands now, and that she's sorry. I discover she's getting involved with her ex again, now of all times. This all starts seeming like a terrible idea again. There's no way I could dance the way we did before, and I tell her we should avoid meeting up. But she keeps coming back to message me daily and it gets emotional again. She trusts me for emotional support, and seems to care about me too. She says she appreciates my vulnerability and honesty in the things I say. She wants to meet me and questions why I don't want to. I figure she's well aware why I don't want to. It's been great having someone to properly talk to again, asides from my family 'checking in with me' at the surface level. But it's that we wouldn't work *platonically.* &amp;#x200B; And I don't think it was ambitious that I thought she was thinking the same thing I was. That we should just say 'fuck platonically' and explore trying again, no matter how much shit she has fucking with her head and how much she has to work through. I didn't want to meet her until she understood that's where we were, because it wouldn't be fair on anyone for me to pretend to be her friend with the false intention of getting closer to her. That's a sucker's game. I'm better than that, and she deserves better than that as well. She said we should call at some point. Tugging on my nostalgia by suggesting it would be like the very first time we spoke on discord. I figured we could clear a lot of things up way better than sending paragraphs to each other and I could make it clear to her that while texting, and calling is relatively harmless, I just wouldn't be able to have that in-person relationship platonically. And so I'm just waiting there waiting for a good time to get that call in. \--- I'm at work. The last 2 weeks have been a mental roller-coaster, let alone the last few months. I burned out the week before last, the week before I messaged her, and had started having mild anxiety attacks at work. Constant pit-like feelings in my stomach, inability to eat. Heavy heart palpitations. Insomnia. It's Friday. The week is over. There is nothing I'd rather do than go out and get some drinks in with my colleagues to decompress. We go to the pub across from work like we always do. Couple drinks. I start to consider leaving. I get bought more drinks. There's this colleague I have who for some reason I always tell the truth to. Like, the deepest truths. Way overboard truths. I caught him outside for a cigarette and he asked how I was doing. I joked that I always tell him too much and he said he wouldn't have it any other way. So I told him pretty much this whole story. Why it was back on my mind again, what I thought she was thinking and what I was gonna do next. He told me no matter my hang-ups, all the flags look green and I should go for it. &amp;#x200B; After going back in, it's not even 10 minutes before I want to go out for another smoke again, by myself. I stand there wondering if that call would happen tonight. I don't really want to wait, while it's still on mind. Too many fucking words to say, and too much to clear up, I knew no matter the outcome it would just feel better. Maybe she really just wants to be friends. And it really is good to have somebody just to talk to on that level. If that was the case I wouldn't be able to meet her, and I'd want her to be well aware how I felt, but just someone to check in with would be more than appreciated. But I also wonder if this is going somewhere else, as I stare off into space dragging on my cigarette, leaned against a post with one hand on my beer. Maybe I should just get drunk and have a good time tonight. I clearly care way too much and I should stop overthinking it. It's sad really. My eyes drift around the beer garden and they settle on something. It's a beige hat that I know from somewhere, worn by a girl in the far opposite corner. I see her chin and her slouched frame. This is just one week to the day after I saw that girl in the club who I didn't want to see, approach me and give me some half-assed awkward apology for ghosting me before disappearing. I thought about that for a second. How it was one of the things that led me to send that message out of the blue in the first place. &amp;#x200B; And now I'm just staring at your hat, in disbelief and unsure if I'd fallen asleep or if someone had spiked my drink with some powerful hallucinogen. I carefully re-position myself to another corner to prove myself right. You're there with your e-girl circle frame glasses and a cigarette. You saw me in public, April last year, and messaged me. I never saw you. I haven't seen you in over a year. At one point I figured you probably didn't even live in this town anymore. I remember you said, back then, that you wanted to get out of this town as soon as possible. But there you fucking are. Here. Now. I freeze as you stand up, and walk past me to go back inside with him. I still, today, don't know if you saw me. If you did, you'd have probably thought I was stalking you, standing there outside alone, and just staring at the two of you together. But now of all times. Why are you there? &amp;#x200B; I stay outside for way longer than the length of my cigarette wondering if I should just leave. I stayed there until my colleague was out again for another smoke. I pulled him aside and told him he wouldn't fucking believe it. And at first he didn't. Then he kept bringing up the idea it's some kind of sign, and I had to go and talk to you. I didn't. And now that I know who the guy you were with was, I'm glad I didn't. That wouldn't have made it any easier for him, whatever it was exactly that you did to him. I figured he must have been your ex. I knew you told me you were involved with your ex again, but I always thought your ex was probably hotter than that. I couldn't see this guy as a heart-breaker. At least not yours. That line of thought seems really funny now. &amp;#x200B; On my way to the bar I pass you. At first, I thought you'd grown 7 inches or so, but it was just him wearing your hat. He looks cute in it. You're getting closer. I figure it's a first date or something. I was pretty much forced to pass you twice, each time I wanted to get to the bar and back to my table. We never made eye contact, but I guess you saw me, or at least recognised my jacket from behind. I go home, sort of fleeing. I message you. I tell you about this superstitious feeling that the universe is just putting things in front of me and I don't know how to interpret them. I told you that I saw you there, just earlier that night and that I didn't understand why. I do crave superstition. I do believe in symbols, and signs, but I hate to make rushed decisions and conclusions based off of them. And they confuse the shit out of me. I try to entertain horoscopes, nowadays. It told me that yesterday I'd have an unexpected visit from someone who needs support, and that I shouldn't turn my friend away. It told me a lot of other dumb shit too, but that's besides the point. Maybe I should listen to it. \--- But it wasn't really my business to know who he was. You told me he was in the same position as me. That after I messaged you, you had reached out to everyone you've ever done this to, with the intention to make amends, and patch things up. How even if it never makes up for it, they deserve it as closure. You feel like you're redeeming yourself, at least somewhat. I guess he took the first opportunity you offered to meet up with him. And you told me he didn't want to be your friend either. I hope he didn't make you uncomfortable, getting closer to you there in the pub, holding on to the window of opportunity he believes he has been given, I guess just like I was. But for his sake I also hope you didn't tell him just how bad it was. I really hope you didn't make him aware that he was just a checkbox on your 'to-do list' of boys you've hurt, to reconcilliate with. Apparently it's a long list. Your lines must be well rehearsed at this point. I guess what we had never was that special. I guess you're just really easy to fall for. Imagine being ghosted. You know what it's like to get ghosted right? You told me you'd felt that, that you understand now, and that you're sorry. Imagine still thinking about it a year later. Now that's really not *your* fault, but just imagine it. Imagine getting a heartfelt apology. An expression of regret, things they wish had happened, and an explanation. Imagine hearing that they thought about what could have happened, and how much better it might have been. Imagine getting their emotions and trust again. Imagine hearing that they want to meet you again. Then imagine finding out that you're just a fucking *statistic.* \---"
130,vulnerability,offmychest,My husband and I are both trauma survivors and both afraid of intimacy. I'm worried we're doomed.,1,f111bs,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/f111bs/my_husband_and_i_are_both_trauma_survivors_and/,2020-02-09 12:05:18,"My husband and I have been together for five years now. We both have experienced a lot of childhood trauma. When we first became romantically involved we both felt ready to finally heal, love, and be present in a relationship despite our baggage. Everything was really lovely! We moved in together, got engaged, I went back to school and he got his dream job as a sous chef. Then, I got sexually assaulted. We drifted apart, he started drinking, we alienated our friends, and he lost his job. The fact that he couldn't ""protect"" me brought up a lot of pre-existing issues for him, and he didn't know how to deal with it, so he emotionally checked out of the relationship for a year. I feel like we never recovered from that. We have remained on egg shells. I feel like my emotional needs scare him, and we are in a cycle where I am afraid to reach out, and he is afraid of being reached out to. We can have a good relationship, but now there are a lot of silences and not a lot of vulnerability or meaningful closeness anymore. We have a child and a good life now, but that trauma in the beginning of our relationship feels like it is still affects us. All of the emotional defenses we agreed to put away when we met, have become seemingly permanent fixtures. I fear we are getting further and further apart now. We don't have insurance so I make the best out of DBT handbooks and self help resources for trauma survivors. I get discouraged though by how much it feels like my husband avoids doing that kind of work. I don't want to push him, but I can't help but feel like this isn't going to work out unless we both try to address our issues together. We have very different ideas about how to ""cope"" with trauma...I tend to want to examine and come to terms with it, and he tends to want to just move forward and move on. He doesn't understand why I can't just appreciate how much he has worked and how good our life is and move forward, but I don't understand why we can't just talk about the past so I can understand it, feel closer, and have closure. I am worried I am unreasonable in that. It still hurts that we have never really talked about my assault, we just tried to ""move on"". That still hurts me. I end up feeling like I have to swallow my feelings instead of feeling safe with my partner. I know it isn't because he doesn't care, he is just scared of feeling overwhelmed. I don't know what to do though, and the longer this goes on, the further away from him I feel, and the more he worries I don't love him. I am terrified that we are too messed up to have any happy ending together. I just needed somewhere to get this out because I don't have a lot of friends or supports to talk to."
131,vulnerability,offmychest,I'm not strong enough to help my father overcome his drug addiction.,1,f11u8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/f11u8y/im_not_strong_enough_to_help_my_father_overcome/,2020-02-09 13:07:10,"I love my father profoundly, or at least, I love him as much as someone can love a parent hat was pretty absent from their childhood. My mother was abusive (also a drug addict), so my father was the only source of affection I had from my parents, even if it was extremely sporadic. Despite his problem, he is a noble man. He even made a deal with their divorce attorney where he turned down $3,000,000 (plus monthly payments of $3000 per month FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE) just so he could see me occasionally and was promised my education and neeeds were provided for until I was 18. I have no doubts about his morals, despite his abscence. I love him. I'm 24 now. But he's still an addict. He locks himself in his room and I don't see him for days. Sometimes, in his drugged states, he unintentionally triggers my panic disorder and causes me a great amount of stress. He can be very cruel and hurtful when high, often unintentionally. I don't know how to help him. I can't force him into a clinic and he doesn't want to. He complains that I'm not affectionate enough to him, but I legitimately don't know how to. I had a lonely childhood with absent parents and no parental figures. I was not raised in an affectionate envoirnment, and emotional vulnerability terrifies me because it often ends up triggering deeper issues within me (PTSD, Panic Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, OCD, and ADHD - all diagnosed) I want to get closer to him, but a lot of interactions with him end up really hurting me. I'm generally not a sensitive person, but my father is my achilles heel, and I just don't know how to help him without crumbling in the process. I'm scared that he overdoses and it's my fault, because I don't know how to be more affectionate. I'm so lost."
132,vulnerability,offmychest,Imagine.,1,f18oau,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/f18oau/imagine/,2020-02-10 00:33:23,"Imagine being ghosted. You know what it's like to get ghosted right? You told me you'd felt that, that you understand now, and that you're sorry. Someone you were interested in getting to know more, who seemed interested in you just drops off the face of the planet and you're left wondering what you did wrong. It's not the end of the world. It's probably more harmful after sex, and definitely more harmful after an emotional connection, but *absolutely* not the end of the world. Now imagine you're getting to know someone and it gets really emotional very quick. You're not scared of the emotions, instead you embrace them. This person is in a lot of pain, and in a way you are too so you find it very easy to open up, and feel safe and cared about. This person seems to trust you with how they feel and that makes you feel great, and you just want to be there for them. &amp;#x200B; Then it becomes clear it's not a normal connection. Something about this is clearly different. You have exes, and you've dated about maybe too much but you've never met someone that you get so close to in such a short period of time. You've never felt so wanted or needed. And on top of that, you've never been so into somebody as a person. All the traits, quirks, the way they look and the dumb shit they say are pretty much all you ever thought you wanted. You're both broken people, and that's beautiful. You figure they feel the same way about you. You see it in the way they look at you. That piercing glare of affection after sex. When you hold them, they hold you closer. Those nerve-wracking vague conversations about the future and where you're headed together. The things you'll do. You don't care about the things that might hold you back. You spend New Year's Eve together with all these ideas. \--- But this person is still in pain and needs more. They're trying so hard to get over an ex and haven't had the chance to ever feel sexually free. It starts to seem like what you're offering isn't enough. They want to keep dating non-exclusively because they're scared of missing out on sexual experiences. You try to understand this, given the context, and while you really wish you were enough, their position makes sense to you. After all, she's so innocent and inexperienced. You know, if you're being honest, she deserves that chance to take some time to figure out what they really want and who they are. But you know what she's like sexually. You know the things she does for you and how much she craves it. And every time you see her, you can't help but visualise filthy degrading sex occurring maybe just hours before coming to see you - or maybe just hours after. It's so hard to take your mind off of and you feel like you're losing control of the emotional connection you had. Maybe she looks at them after sex with the same piercing glare of affection. Maybe it was all in your head, and what you had didn't feel special to her at all. &amp;#x200B; But every time she's there again, you're reassured that she wants you. That you're headed in the right direction, and she's just figuring herself out. You feel it in the things she trusts you with. The amount of time she spends with you, and again, how close she holds you. And that glare. But you've become helplessly possessive. The intrusive thoughts fill you with more and more pain. You want things to speed up. You need her to want you and only you. Realising she doesn't, feels like everything has been taken from you from those initial conversations about the future and you're terrified. You put too much pressure on her, and try to cautiously articulate how you feel about this, but it only pushes her away further. &amp;#x200B; But once more, she's there again. Laughing and blushing. Talking about the future and caring about you. She wakes up next to you in the morning. She goes to wash her hair in your shower. She kisses you goodbye and leaves for work. &amp;#x200B; Then nothing. You send messages and nothing comes back. &amp;#x200B; You honest to god believe it's more likely that she died or got into some trouble than that she would ghost you, so you're concerned for her. You leave voicemails. And more messages. Before, you'd been texting every day without fail, and seeing each other about 3-4 times a week. And now it's been seven days. Her hair is still in your shower drain and on your pillows. Her hand-prints are still on your mirror. Knowing the mental pain she was in, you seriously consider filing a missing person report. She could have hurt herself. &amp;#x200B; Then a message. Scolding me for leaving voicemails and spamming her. That it was way too intense and she needed to get away. That I just reminded her of the mental place her ex left her in. \--- It's over. I have closure. And I can move on. I'm not obsessive. I can take being let down. But I fixate. I date some more, but I start to realise I'll never find someone just like her, someone who makes me feel that way. A few months later I send a few messages and she just tries to sell me dirty pictures, as if I'm a desperate clown who just wants to see her naked again. It hurts but I just carry on with life. I felt pathetic that I only knew her for a few weeks, but she keeps showing up in the back of my mind. It starts to stop. But then at the worst times in life it happens again. It was just something I couldn't let go of, and I felt like an idiot for that. I've never been that person. I used songwriting to try and take control of how I felt, and because I'm incapable of writing fiction, and convincingly singing fiction. I don't know if it helped anything but every time I sing it, it's cathartic. Of course, it makes me feel more pathetic to be the guy who wrote a song about a girl he knew for 3 weeks. I figured she would just be 'the one who got away' and I was starting to get so okay with that. &amp;#x200B; But when I'm down and out and my head feels all fucked up I remember the only person who seemed to 'get me' like that and made me feel like a human who didn't have to show off or pretend to be something I'm not. I wondered if she even thinks about it. If she has regrets, wishes, or ever thinks about what would happen if we tried again. Or if she just wants to keep me as far away as possible, and thinks it was nothing more than a three-week fling. &amp;#x200B; I'm there at a low after seeing somebody else I didn't wanna see in a club approach me trying to apologise for ghosting me then immediately getting as far away from me as possible. Then in the same night, a girl I'd just been on a date with once, and got along with well sends me a text saying no matter how lovely it was, it wouldn't work and we shouldn't see each other again.

133,vulnerability,offmychest,I (45f) cheated on my husband (48m) of 20 years with a much younger man,1,f1ccco,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/f1ccco/i_45f_cheated_on_my_husband_48m_of_20_years_with/,2020-02-10 05:03:12,"This is the first time I ever cheated on my husband, or anyone, and all of my friends know him and our kids so I didnt know where else to share it. Last weekend, I went to a corporate retreat at DisneyWorld. It was the usual boring stuff at a hotel during the day and then we get special access to the park. I spent a lot of time laying by the pool relaxing, sunning, etc. I got in to water to cool off and realized Id left my towel on my chair, so I asked a guy walking past to hand it to me. He said sure and was handing it to me when a little boy ran past him too close, bumped the back of his legs and he ended up falling in. We both laughed about it and I complimented his athleticism for not landing on me. He said hed done gymnastics and I was feeling a little bold I guess maybe the heat affected me, but I told him it showed and drubbed his bicep. Its really out of character for me and I felt so awkward afterwards. I guessed he couldnt have been more than 20, but he was really fit with lean muscle and abs and a nice smile, and he didnt look at all bad in the pool! Thankfully he wasnt at all self conscious about what I said and actually said I looked like I worked out a lot too (I do, religiously). I said here and there when I have the time. He offered to get us more towels and I watched his back muscles as he pushed himself out of the pool, and His swim trunks clung yo his body, it wasnt a bad view and I thought theres no harm in looking. He asked if he could sit next to me to dry off and I said sure. We talked about the pool and the weather. Nothing deep. He had taken a few days off school and was there with his family but didnt want to go to the park again so theyd let him stay at the hotel while his parents took his younger siblings. I told him I was there for work. Again nothing deep. There was some gentle flirting too. He commented on a tattoo I have on my wrist and asked if I have any others. I said none that he could see, and he laughed (I have a pair of lips on one of my butt cheeks that I got when I was 18 and have regretted since). I asked if he had any and he said maybe Id find out. I thought he was a little forward but clearly intelligent for his age and handsome of course. And I liked the attention I suppose. My husband is a good man and father, but he also uses the toilet while Im in the shower and picks his teeth in bed and other less than romantic things that just sort of develop over time. After an hour or so I said it had been nice to meet him but I had to go back to my room and get cleaned up for dinner. He said he should too and we walked to the elevator together. When the door closed it was just me and him and he said so, can I see bow? My tattoo? I asked. Yeah, its just us. Again this is so out of character for me but I figured what the hell and I turned around and mooned him. He laughed and said he couldnt believe I did that. And I was laughing too and said me neither. And then he kissed me and I was in shock. But I kissed back. And before I know it Im making out with this boy in the hotel elevator. My heart hasnt raced like that in years. When the doors opened on my floor I got off and asked if he was coming. I felt like I wasnt in control anymore, like someone else had taken over my body. He smiled and I could see him getting erect under his trunks. We went to my room and didnt take long before we were both naked and kissing. Ive always loved the feeling of being naked with another person for the first time. When I was younger before I met my husband I wasnt a slut but I had sex with different men and that was always my favorite part. The mutual excitement and vulnerability. It was amazing to feel that again. We fucked. It wasnt making love or sex. It was fucking. I distinctly remember thinking as his penis slid into me the first time that Ill forever be a woman who cheated on her husband. The sex was athletic and intense. He didnt have amazing technique but he had stamina and great recovery time. I missed my dinner that night. We spent hours naked, screwing and resting and snacking and showering and watching tv. It wasnt just fucking it was intimacy and having fun. And having a guy who closes the door to pee. His mom texted at 8 to say they were done at the park and coming home. He said he had to go and could he have my number. I stupidly gave it to him and got his. After he left I got onto Facebook and looked him up. Much to my shock he was in high school, not college! He was a senior and 18, thank god, but I had fucked a high school student! I was in shock for a moment and then just facepalmed and laughed. I should feel guilty; but I dont. I felt exhilarating and sexy. I live my husband and dont plan on ever seeing this boy again or cheating again. But Im glad I did it."

I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship prior and had been sexually assaulted by my ex partner a month prior to meeting this guy. He used this vulnerability against me, he knew my response to trauma was to freeze. He knew this because when I called police for help when my last partner abused me I was the one arrested. So I learned to just not react and let whatever happen happen because no one would help me anyways. This man kept pressuring me into sexual acts, the only time I found the strength to say I did not want to have sexual intercourse with him. It still happened, he kept asking me and pressuring me. Shaking me violently demanding it. I was scared, I couldnt do anything to defend myself. I know what happened to me, if it wasnt sexual assault I wouldnt have been struggling with PTSD. I wouldnt be so affected by his actions. On Tuesday the 11th of February, I had to go to his trial and take the stands. I was questioned non stop with a few breaks in between from 10:30am to 4:00pm. I was forced to recount the event in explicit detail with my assailant less than 10 feet away from me I could see him at the corner of my eye. I cried so much that day the skin on my face was raw and inflamed. Today at around 9:30am, I get a call. He was acquitted of all charges. The numerous hours I spent with police and sexual assault nurses. The medications I had to go on to prevent HIV, the blood tests, the shots and the painful period that plan B causes. Hours of counselling, the countless hours Ive suffered from the flash backs and the countless hours of sleep Ive lost because of his actions. The hours I spent in that courtroom fighting for myself. For what? I know the police have record of everything and if he does it again they will have a stronger case against him. It would have been nice to have my suffering validated though. To be told yeah, he will pay for what hes done to you. If he was completely innocent, the police wouldnt have charged him to begin with. He wouldnt have been summoned to court or have a trial. I know he was wrong and he did in fact sexually assault me. I read that the statistics for a conviction for sexual assault are less that 1% more like every 7 in 1000 get convicted and only a fraction of those serve time in jail. So I know that me getting justice wasnt a matter of how credible I was. But more about going against the 99.5% chance he was going to get away and the 0.5% he was going to get convicted. Its scary to know how many rapists walk free because of how lenient the sexual assault laws are. The process is so awful and discouraging for the victims and it doesnt look like there will be a reform of that anytime soon. Thanks for taking the time to read my story. Happy Valentines Day all. x"

Its certainly not the day I live for, but I like that it brings out the soft side of people. The vulnerability shows a tiny bit more to their SO and its nice. Im in a relationship now but I know Im going to be spending it by myself again this year. I went in to work, did my thing, and now Im home for the rest of the day. I go on social media and completely noped out of there with all these special posts everywhere because thats honestly too much right now. All my friends are with their SO and I dont know whats going on with mine exactly so Im alone. And now I scramble for something to say about what Im doing today so I can avoid the dreaded well, why not? Conversation. I didnt even receive a happy Valentines Day back. I wanted to surprise my gf with plans today but whatever is going on is beyond my control and Im stuck in this sucky day. Past Valentines days have been no better because I was either single or with somebody who didnt care about the day at all. I was cool with not doing anything back then but now I feel like the experience got robbed away from me. Im not saying I want to go out, get flowers, chocolate, card and a giant teddy bear or go on an extravagant getaway. Just some acknowledgement of the relationship we have. But every year, I look forward to the day for some recognition of our relationship and get let down or if Im single, waste the day without any contact. I just get hit with sadness on this day and going out or even social media just amplified that feeling for me seeing everybody so happy because I wish I can have that feeling on this day just once. I really had no one to tell this to but had to write this down and see if anybody else would rather skip this day every year."

Today it just feels worse and I want to get some of this out. All of the friends I made at college have moved on, I go to a community college and they've all transferred/graduated already. The only person I still get to talk to is a girl I've been into for a long time now, but she rejected me. She's both my biggest source of happiness, and my biggest source of pain. Every time we talk it's kind of bittersweet. Every time we hang out it's like ripping open a wound, but I don't want it to close. I'm not under the impression that some day she'll magically change her mind, that's not why I still talk to her. It's because she's a genuinely good friend, and also the only one I have left. I go to school and enjoy my time there. I've started going to the gym to lose weight because I'm about 100 pounds heavier than I was when I graduated high school, and it's more time where I don't have to be lonely at home. I feel like everything I do is to distract me from this empty feeling I have when I'm alone and when I get home it all rushes back to me at once. The things I used to enjoy like browsing reddit, playing videogames, watching movies etc have become something I need to put in an effort to do. I want to do them to distract myself from this feeling, but I'm just not interested. I have 51 games installed on my Xbox right now. A year ago I would have been excited to play any one of them. Now I don't know how to express the way I feel except ""meh"". I get no enjoyment out of them. I get no enjoyment watching movies/TV on Netflix, I get no enjoyment from almost anything I do when I get home. The only thing that makes me really happy at this point is when I'm at school and I'm around people and I make them laugh. I work at the school as well, and my favorite part of every day is cracking jokes with my coworkers and making them laugh. Or buying presents for them and seeing their smiles. I also feel like there's nobody to talk to about this. I don't feel like I can talk about this to my family, I definitely cant talk about this to my only friend left, and I'm left with nothing but holding it in. I also don't really want to talk about it. I don't want to feel that vulnerability, hence the throwaway account."

I am currently going through grad school and it is pretty tough for me personally mentally, physically, etc. I am a certain race and as such my friends at school used to predominantly be from that same race (lets call these friends friend group x), just because people flock to that which seems familiar. Over the years I tried many times to organize with them Friendsgiving, dinners, trips to theme parks, going to sporting events, and just hanging out in general. Over the years- consistently these friends would not respond to my messages on the group chat to these invitations. And many times I would try to individually text them as well and they would often just give generic responses that just showed me they were not interested. One that really hurt was that one of our local small colleges in our city got into the main bracket in march madness- I tried to get a watch party going because I knew people wanted to watch. I did my dance and tried inviting people- no one responded. Ok, no problem. I randomly ended up on one of their Snapchat on the day of the game- I don't really use social media that much and one of the guys I had invited and I found out that he had gone to a public watch party of the game. Ok, no bigs, for kicks I check the other friends SCs and I see a number of the people I invited to watch the game together at this public watch party. This hurt me at that time because- I was like #1 I asked if anyone wanted to do this thing and #2 I would have understood if it were at someones' house or something like that but it was literally at a watch party with thousands of other people that was free. I do not think they are inherently bad people, truly I do not, I just concluded that although they consider me an acquaintance they do not really want to be my friend. I have no ill will- but we are superficial friends and that is it. Duly noted, no problem moving on. This was not an isolated occurrence that was just one of the many instances that this happened. So anyway I am this crumbling human being trudging through the weight of school and I am blessed to find two friends that treat me well and are not part of that initial friend group. They study with me. Laugh and eat with me and keep me overall sane. And I am truly thankful I found such great friends when I was feeling so lonely. I later that year wanted to plan a snowboarding/skiing trip- I love skiing but since we don't have snow all year we can only go once a year during winter if we go up north for 2 hours. So me being me and loving people I ask friend group x if they would like to come to this ski trip. It would be great and I could teach them if they did not know how. Out of 20+ people, 0 responded. Ok, I then invited my two new friends and their two friends and out of those 4 friends that I asked- all four of them said they wanted to come. I felt so excited and did not feel like a reject. There was one person though from group X that would be on campus a lot and I really wanted to be friends with people of my race too because I am a minority and I usually studied on campus anyway so I would see him in passing many times. Lets call him friend x. So I asked him in person if he wanted to come. He said he would think about it but it seemed like he was not interested. I told him, I really would want him to be there but again- some generic response. I got the hint, let him be and said well if you change your mind then let me know. That year I had a great time with 4 new friends and I loved it. Then last year we as a cohort of classmates had to take a BIGG licensing exam. This is the single most important test of our collective lives. Its arguably the hardest test being administered today and literally determines to a large degree if your salary is x or 5x- if you have to live in rural nebraska or in san diego. Suffice to say it is stressful. Again, I was so blessed to have these two new friends that were there with me and studied with me and went through it with me. I still saw this guy though off and on throughout the year because again he studied on campus as well. And I REPEATEDLY invited him to my now friend group- saying itd be awesome to study together. He said that he already had a study spot and since my friend group studied somewhere else he did not want to come. So thats fine- no bigs. I study with my friends peacefully for 6 months without a hitch until 2-3 months before the exam- arguably the most stressful time of my life. This guy recently went through a breakup (that was totally his fault because he strung along a naive girl who was not that pretty but would listen to him and be there as his emotional crutch)- I saw some pretty not great snaps about him drinking and stories from other mutual friends about how his drinking was a too much. So next time I see him- again because I want my minority to thrive- and I am genuinely concerned and I tell him that if he needs anyone to talk to I am there for him. He seems genuinely moved that day but other than that never really reached out. Its hard for men to talk to other men about vulnerability sometimes so I was like ok that's fine I do not want to intrude too much. A couple weeks later he starts coming more and more to where I usually study with my friends but he doesn't sit next to me or really try to be friends with me. His own friends he used to study with also abandoned him. He just more and more starts talking to one of my friends who is a girl and who although not naive is oblivious to her surroundings. This rubs me the wrong way because I asked him so many times to be part of my friend group but he just wants the emotional crutch of a girl who will listen to him. FINE. The GODDAMN straw that broke the camel's back was that this guy would talk out loud in a quiet study area 2 months before the biggest exam of my life. FOR hours and hours and again this friend of mine who is great ( who let's be honest I also had a crush on- although the kind of crush you know you would ever act on b/c you know it would never work out and being friends is awesome) although not naive she just is that kind of way where she is someone who just allows that to happen. She is a very go with the flow type. Over the course of the month, many people who study there would give them subvert signs that they wanted him to stop talking out loud. But nope. I started giving them signs. No avail. I then told everyone - hey guys lets try to be quiet I am getting really stressed and I want to focus on the exam- if you want to talk please go outside to the cafeteria outside. It worked for all of one day. 2 days more of talking I confront them again and say could we please not be loud. 5 MINUTES LATER he is playing music out loud on the computer. I snap. leave the room. Call a friend and vent. The next day as much as it pains me I feel like I have to leave the two friends that I actually am close to and study by myself for the last month. Because they are not really backing me up with this and they are friends with him too. I leave but then a big drama happens because I left. I apologize but I need to focus on my test. A week later this very guy I am trying to get away from sits right in front of me in my new spot and after an hour I am at this point so concerned about him talking. I think he said he wanted to find a place that was quieter where he could focus...... Cool story bro. I straight up just tell him- look this is not on you and this is on me but I really can't study when you are around me- would it be cool if you studied in any other area that is not here? (in a nicer way) saying sorry and I love you and etc. He tells my other friends and I lose one of my two friends because of that. At least for the rest of the month, he complies and does not study near me and I can study in peace. Over the course of 6 months (where I am VERY VERY busy), I mend my relationship with the friend that felt like they were abandoned. And finally, I feel like I am somewhat close to them again. And now finally the background is over and we are at the current juncture. Where I have been super busy and I just wanted to relax and go to the mountain with some friends. I ask my two friends and they more or less say yeah. And I am so pumped. Then apparently they mention this friend x. Again no ill will- I truly love him and wish for him the best. But apparently it got awkward because they brought it up and I did not invite him. After dismissing me so many times I did not really feel like inviting him and I just wanted some time for myself to relax and have fun. As much as I shouldn't be- I also feel like he stole my friends from me. I should just let it go and invite him but- I still am kind of upset with him. I do not want to mention it to my two friends because- then undoubtedly it becomes this big drama and I hate drama. Essentially one of the two friends texts me about this and now more or less I have to invite him unless I want drama. AND I HATE DRAMA so I am probably going to invite him. I really do think he is an ok guy who has done some mistakes and we have become a little closer over the last couple of months - I did invite him to do something and it was just me and him. But after all that I kinda just wanted to be friendly and not friends. I just wanted this to be like a day for me. It is not like he has ever invited me to anything. AITA for not wanting to be close to him? Advice is also appreciated Thanks for reading. &amp;#x200B; TLDR Kid I try to befriend multiple times turns me down. 6 months later he interferes with the most important test of my life by being disruptive and he ""steals"" my friends (although obviously, they can be friends with whoever they want and I have no ownership of them) and I do not want to invite him to a trip I was planning but now I kind of have to."

My anxiety about everything has been so bad lately, and it's absolutely my fault. I stopped all my meds put in place to prevent things getting so bad and have been confused as to why I've been so bad lately. My bipolar is fucking me up, my anxiety is the worst it's ever been, and eating disorder behaviors are akin to what they were at my sickest. I even self harmed the other week for the first time in several years. I've been actively suicidal for the first time in 3. I feel like I'm loosing my mind, these past few weeks. I threw up at work. On purpose. So I could get out of a busy day and working a closing/opening shift. I said it was anxiety, because it's true. Just not in the way I framed it. And of course it bites me in the ass, because I just had of the worst panics attacks in years. 10 minutes before I had to leave for work. You know how attacks snowball, and everything making you feel upset hits you at once and you can't come up with a specific reason as to why you're choking on your own spit and screaming. I'm calling my boyfriend, my mom, my therapist and they're all busy and can't deal with me at the moment and it suddenly hits me I should... Call my boss, maybe. And I did and he understood completely. He didn't question or accuse me of anything. I put myself out there for someone who is brand new at his job and replacing someone I adored as my manager. We were both vulnerable and it was ok. And I don't believe it's happening but somehow I'm ok. 5 minutes ago I sat in my car pulling out my hair and hyperventilating and somehow I'm ok. God anxiety is fucking wild"
144,vulnerability,offmychest,Finally putting into words the abuse I have experienced,1,f7bb7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/f7bb7j/finally_putting_into_words_the_abuse_i_have/,2020-02-22 00:47:09,"I finally made a throw away account to express into words the trauma I have experienced because Im tired of the PTSD. Its time I face what I am feeling. There are two instances in my life that I experienced sexual trauma from my brother. For background, I am the only girl of 3. Family is pretty close. Have two older brothers. When I was about 12, I was asked by my brother to give him a kiss in exchange to be able to play his playstation. It was extremely uncomfortable and I said no and left. I immediately told my parents afterward. They were shocked, and felt shame. They forced my brother to apologize to me. After that I was no longer allowed in my other brothers room with the door closed (Never experienced anything like that with him) or alone with either of them. That memory eventually faded away deep into my psyche. Nothing like that happened after. Fast forward 15 years. Brother is now married with a kid and I think one on the way at this point. Went out to dinner with him, the sister in law and a few mutual friends. Ended up getting pretty tipsy then we all went out minus the wife. I'm not proud of this but I got trashed. This was a point in my life where i lived alone, about 2.5 hours away from my family and was extremely lonely. I drank a lot at my apartment and was depressed (was medicated). I completely blacked out. Also at this time, there was some speculation that the friend we were with had feelings for me and I was in the middle of understanding if I did too or not. Anyway, we all were completely trashed at this bar, went back to my brothers, then woke up the next day. Was feeling fine, hungover, but fine. No memory. The next day my brother asked me if I remembered anything that happened. I was already back at my apartment. I said no after a certain point. I was getting a little concerned that he kept asking because of the past memories I had. He eventually said in the uber home I made out with him and he was so drunk as well. I was so disgusted. I wanted to tear the insides of my body out. How could something like that happen and I have no memory of it? He was clearly troubled as well. I told him I never want to speak of this ever again, and no one in the family can know. I cried for days. Hated myself. Felt disgusting. The worst part is, since I have no memory of it, I cant say if it was true or not and I have no traumatic memory to relive. I relive the shame it gave me to learn it, and the uneasy feeling i had from my brother after. I would always delete texts from him because just seeing his name in my inbox triggered me. I avoided all eye contact when I saw him. I still dont feel comfortable in any setting alone with him. I dont believe he would ever intentionally hurt me or seek that from me again. But that feeling of safety never came back and the vulnerability I feel around him always comes back. Sometimes I feel completely ok and know it was in the past. Sometimes it still causes panic attacks, usually at night when I am trying to sleep. Waiting for my new insurance to kick in so I can finally talk to a professional about this and try to start the process of truly healing myself. But like I said, this is the first time I am ever putting into words what happened to me. Only two people in my life know, I can barely even talk about it, let alone think about it. Im sorry this post is so long. I guess the TLDR is I was to an extent sexually abused by my brother 3 years ago and as a child and its a major source of panic and anxiety for me. Thank you for listening."
145,vulnerability,offmychest,finding the courage to be vulnerable,1,f921eq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/f921eq/finding_the_courage_to_be_vulnerable/,2020-02-25 12:21:01,"we met 10 months ago. what was originally just me taking a chance soon became having a rather nicely knit friendship with you. never in this life have i been able to connect with someone over so many things, understand the ways i view about the world while providing your refreshing perspectives. you are able to verbalise the thoughts that have been sitting in my head, yet find no ability to articulate it properly. more importantly, you give me the room to be myself, and just have the capacity to understand who i am. i was largely in denial, but 4 months in and i knew i liked you. a lot. we went out for a good 4 times, and each goodbye with you soon became harder and harder. the laughter, the teasing, agreeing to disagree on certain things, understanding how we think... we are so similar, yet so different, but in a good way. we met on saturday night and that night is now forever etched in my mind. whatever we talked about has since left me with this shaking vulnerability whenever i think about it - we poured our hearts out, and tore our walls down. its as though someone now knows me fully, and i feel exposed, and somewhat ashamed about it. its an invasive feeling that is uncomfortable, but i know how much i need to fight against this shame and discomfort. i didnt find the courage to tell you how i really felt about you that night, but i have since found the courage to be more vulnerable with myself, and to people like you. the rawness of our emotions that night made me see you in a more realistic light. to love someone requires a sheer ton of courage to be able to withstand being vulnerable, and also to accept the fact that we are human precisely because we dont always have it all together. for now, i just hope to muster that courage to tell you how i feel, and trust that at the end of the day, even at my most vulnerable state, im still worthy of love."
146,vulnerability,offmychest,I've never been able to tell anyone I was abused as a child and it's made me numb and lonely and dry inside.,1,f92z32,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/f92z32/ive_never_been_able_to_tell_anyone_i_was_abused/,2020-02-25 13:27:43,"Probably nothing new here sadly but I (36M) was abused by the girl that was helping me with math after school when I was 13. She was 22-ish, she was hot in my eyes, I was dumb, full of hormones and in love, and she made me believe that what she was doing to me was normal. It was not, it was horrible, it was pure mindfuck and sadistic cruelty and to this day I've never been able to talk about it, even to the girl I've been with for 15 years. I've always struggled in my social relationships, I am friendly and social on the surface but distant really and protect myself way too much. I'm anxious, socially avoidant when challenged and although I'm good at keeping my mask on, I feel like I'm on a whole different continent than other people. I lost most my friends for being unable to keep in touch, I'm uneasy around guys and now I feel fucking alone, numb and dry. There is this constant thought in my head that I'm just a fuckup and I can't get rid of it and I feel it's obvious to anyone. I've never been able to feel safe with a girl, being vulnerable terrifies me although I crave it. My current gf is a bit shy and vanilla, I'm her first, she lacks confidence herself and I will never be able to tell her about that, I fear she would be scared and devastated and angry I didn't tell her before. It would ruin the image she has of me which is fundamental to our relationship. So I'm stuck with my secret, my unspoken, untold shames and wounds, my needs and itches and i'm eaten alive by the desperate need to let myself cry in the arms of a woman that I could talk to to unburden myself. And I can't resort to doing that with a professional sex worker. I'm craving for authenticity, for vulnerability, absence of judgment, benevolence, and that's just not something you can ask, pay for or put in a Tinder bio. This is not a attempt to beg for sex or attention btw. Just, how do you get rid of such a haunting? How do you rebuild yourself, so much later? How do you reclaim your sexuality, become ok with your sensuality, with letting go? I've missed my teenagehood because of that, how do I get that back? How do I deal with the kinks I inherited from that? Things I'm drawed to and I couldn't justify to my gf? Feels like I've been abandoned on a deserted island and no way to signal the ships I see all around. And to those who wonder : I have no idea where this person is now. She went study abroad at some point, and that was the end of it. She's not on Facebook and have a very common name. She must be in her late 40s, she probably have kids, a career,... No relief would be found in looking for her and exposing her at this point. I just needed that shit off my chest. Thanks for reading."
147,vulnerability,offmychest,I [26f] am an over-sharer who keeps attracting partners (all genders) who are (subjectively) terrible at expressing their feelings. Is it me?,1,f9xonp,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/f9xonp/i_26f_am_an_oversharer_who_keeps_attracting/,2020-02-27 05:27:19,"I tend to be an emotionally intense person. If youre into astrology at all my tropical sun, moon, rising, and mercury are all in cancer. I often say to my friends and loved ones that I feel everything all of the time. My outward personality is a little quirky &amp; unpredictable and unabashed. I say things that people are afraid to or think they shouldnt and Im very direct with my language when I want to be understood. I speak in affirmative I statements and I dont leave people to guess or assume what I mean. My friends often comment and appreciate that I can verbalize their feelings better than they can. I had alot of practice mediating as a child between two parents who couldnt stop shouting over each other so I developed my voice by advocating for people who struggled to understand each other. Both my willingness to share how something makes me feel and my understanding of things sometimes left unsaid can be intimidating at best and completely repulsive at worst to more passive and reserved people. Ive learned over the years of adulthood how appropriate or inappropriate varying levels of honesty and emotional intimacy and communication can be within different types of relationships and varying levels of closenessstrangers on social media for examplebut for a while I would yearn to be somewhat emotionally vulnerable with everyone that I bonded with and enjoyed outside of professional relationships. I thought that knowing what really moves someone was the only way to truly know and understand them. Ive always been somewhat obsessed and paranoid about other peoples behavior and what it means. Now, I put much less pressure on my relationships to maintain any markers of vulnerability, but I do pay attention to what is shared with me and what that means to the person who is sharing. With all that said, I keep finding myself in relationships with people who struggle a great deal to express themselves emotionally. Sometimes its specific to me and my aggression/effortlessness in expression, other times related to traumatic experiences from the past. Parents silencing them or someone authoritative telling them to shut up and that their feelings dont matter, or gaslighting and manipulating them to believe that their feelings dont matter. Although I understand pretty well how hard vulnerability can be (there are things I have a very hard time talking about too) I forget how often the simplest interactions remind people of their trauma and trigger old responsive habits. *insert studies on adverse childhood experiences, neuroplasticity, &amp; how trauma affects the brain* Nevertheless, it frustrates me to no end to not be able to have what I consider very simple conversations. Asking why you changed your mind on plans we made together, or how you felt after having a weird dream make for challenging and then combative/defensive conversations? And then it feels like Im reinforcing the behavior, the hesitancy and reservedness when I get frustrated. What I dont understand most of all is that I *feel* like how I communicate is the simplest way/method between people who often misunderstand each other. I make clear, concise statements: When you did this I perceived it this way, it made me feel this way, and then I behaved this way as a result of my feelings. I admit when Ive made an assumption or misunderstood intent. I attempt to validate my partners feelings by telling them why I understand how they feel. And when I need something specific from my partner I give context and ask plainly for what I need, to avoid complaining when a need isnt met. Hey honey, Im kinda having a hard day. If youve got some free time and the energy, I could use a few encouraging words. Because Ive experienced talking to a loved one about having a hard time and them thinking that you want them to solve your problems, or them applying extra pressure on you to solve the problems that have got you down. So I ask for what I want. What am I missing when it comes to communicating with people who struggle to express themselves and say what they mean? And how can I be less intimidating? (and more patient ) TLDR: Im a chronic over-sharer who swims in a sea of emotional expression. I say what I mean and mean what I say. Im constantly in intimate relationships with people who are the opposite and struggle to express themselves, they either shut down or lash out. What do I do?"

Logically, shes gone, shes taken, shes not interested. As those thoughts swirl through my mind, a feeling of calmness comes over me. Acceptance of my reality sets in, and mentally i move on to the next task. Without any ability to communicate or observe her, Im assuming that all is well and that makes me genuinely happy for her. When logic fails, and my i allow myself to be overcome with emotion, i fall down. Its so hard for me negate, ignore or forget what we shared. The vulnerability, the investment, the bond, it fueled me. When it ended, it felt and still feels like something that I truly loved with every ounce of my being, died. Those feelings make me tear up every time. When i pair those two head spaces together, they dont reconcile. Unfortunately, Im left with a vicious and unsustainable cycle of pain and my harsh reality. My internal mental dialog: - Get over it - She doesnt want you - Focus on something else - Its time to move on What my heart feels: - Never give up - I love her - I would do anything for her - Your bond is indomitable My logical side hates my emotional being and my emotional being ignores all of my logical thoughts. Everyday is a struggle."
149,vulnerability,offmychest,A letter to him,1,fb7i3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/fb7i3w/a_letter_to_him/,2020-02-29 15:47:13,"Disclaimer: I am writing this to release my feelings. I am not asking for advice or what I should or shouldve done so please do not give it. Also not looking for sympathy. I just want to release this. Keep the negativity away  When we first met on Tinder, you superliked me. I felt smug and confident. You liked it. We flirted and I liked it. But then we realized that we were 20 miles apart with no car. We decided that we might as well go our separate ways. I was okay with it of course. But then a week later you came back and said So youre just gonna make me keep coming back here?  and we ended up exchanging snaps. We FaceTime. We messaged each other on snap. You begged to call me. I gave you my Instagram about about two weeks later because you wanted to know if I was real. I reassured you that I was because we did Facetime. You told me that I was beautiful and was surprised as how a man hasnt taken me. You vented to me about your ex and I understood because at the time, I still wanted my ex. I didnt care. I had other guys. We can both do whatever we wanted. Its just a vibe. I spent the night at your house and I remember thinking how comfortable I was. I hung out with your OG. We smoked, listened to music, we all talked, I even put them on to my music, but above all I just wanted the night to you and myself. And then they finally left. You and I were all alone. I remember how slow we were and even though we didnt have sex and never did at all, for once I actually felt wanted at the time. I could feel myself slipping into the feelings and I was like no, no, no. But it happened anyway. You told me why you and your last ex broke up and I was stunned at how someone could you do you so dirty. At how anybody could be THAT grimy. But I kept thinking of you that day. And the day after that. And every day after that. But I was confused because I thought I wanted my ex back? And he and I were still friends and Id feel bad for cutting him off because we just became friends again...I even bawled myself to sleep because I thought what if he and i get back together? and i pictured him hurting me the same way. A fews day later, he screwed up badly. I was over him instantly. I blocked him on everything the very next day. And now I could finally be able to be with you without feeling guilty about cutting off my ex. Even though my ex did the same thing, I knew I couldnt do it back. I wanted you to catch feelings for me and confess that wanted to be with me. Until then, we both do what we want. I keep it all to myself. Even though it was hard for me to hear you talk about your ex, I still listened. I still sympathized. Even though I was frustrated about how you wouldnt block her despite how badly she treated you. Even though when I tried to do the same, you wouldnt listen or just give one word answers. Even though I would always go see you but you wouldnt see me. Even though you said youd try to but never did. Even though practically everything we did was what you wanted. Even though you shared so much, I feel like I grew up with you. And Ill give you this, you did ask...but I shared so little. You told me about your parents, your sister, your nephew, even showed me pictures. Lets face it, you wore your feelings on your sleeve. I kept everything inside. Even though I would text you and you would be inconsistent. And you told me to call you because youre a shitty texter. And I swallowed my pride called you on Snapchat and your number on different days and you didnt pick up. I felt embarrassed. I thought it was over. Until you reached out and explained. And you were scared that I left. And while I understood because it wasnt exactly your fault, I was also internally furious... And then it just kept like that. Wed call almost every day, text all the time, I come over once a month... One time you said something and I got upset at you. And you kept nagging me to communicate and I did. And then I cut you off. We end off at a bad note. I let you have the last word. When all I wanted to do was talk it out but you just said that you didnt care and to just cut you off. What more is there to say? And then you come back two months later. But this time I was different. This time I took away most of my energy. This time I texted back when I felt like it. This time I was dry one minute and flirtatious/teasing the next. This time if you wanted me around you at all, you had to earn it. And you hated it. You hated having me without having me. You even complained. Yet you were still double texting, triple texting, chasing me. And its not like you couldnt have me...you just had to earn it. And even though you didnt earn it, I came over. I thought it was because you were patient enough. But now I know it was because I was weak. I came over. I looked different. I acted different. And instead of spending the night like I used to, I only stayed for 2 hours. And you werent really feeling my affection. Which hurt but I understood. You werent down for it. You were sick, after all. And then again, you went AWOL. This time for almost a month. And part of me thought it was like last time: your bipolar disorder was messing up your mental health really badly. But I also thought, I didnt have sex with him when I came over. Is he done with me? And then you came back...you said you missed me and my affection...you explained that it was your bipolar...you didnt want me to hate you. And I did but I didnt. I finally opened up and said I missed you too. And then we were right back to square one. You still refused to come see me or take me out. It was still your way or the high way. You didnt even tell me happy birthday. And then I cut you off again. Because I put my foot down. And you spazzed out, accusing me of trying to trap you into a relationship. And yes I admit I wanted to be with you but asking for reciprocation =/= asking for a relationship. And then I finally confess that I need a relationship. I told you if thats not what you want, we can just go our separate ways. You said you didnt want one. I let you have the last word. What more is there to say? And then a month later. You find me on Instagram. You send me an apology. You follow me on my public Instagram. You watch my story. You find my snapchat in my bio and add me there. I added you back. You message me oh so quickly and you apologize again. I tell you I need space because I feel ambushed. And you tell me that if I wanna talk, youre here. And a few hours later, I finally tell you how I felt: how I felt humiliated, worthless, how you would measure my value according to how much I let you get away with, how I feel like you have an ulterior motive, how hurt I felt. I wanted to express myself...because I never did that with you...but I also wanted to do it in a way that wasnt accusatory. Holding you accountable in a way that you could handle. And in the end...we argued. You invalidated my feelings. I block you and I let you have the last word because what more is there to say? But I finally want to say... You may not have been an ex, but Im still not over you. I loved you because of your passion, you vulnerability, I felt safe with you, comfortable, you creativity, the way you smile, the way you could talk for hours, your intelligence. But I can no longer appreciate any of that anymore. I have no more to give you. Hell, today I even asked my friend to sign into my Facebook to block you. And she ended up blocking the wrong guy at first and I even thought that was a sign! Its as if everything is pointing at us being together. You always come back. You even found me this time. You coming back is our whole dynamic. Its never me reaching out, it is always you. Were on and off. And it confuses me. Because I have never been on and off with a guy at all. I was always either on OR off, never AND. And for crying out loud, I liked you the first day we met. That has and would never happen to me. And maybe I haunt your mind. Maybe you think of me still. Maybe youre scared that Im too good for you, which I am, and thats why you always do me dirty. Maybe I haunt your dreams. But just because I haunt you doesnt mean I want you. Its not our season. I feel like we are meant together but that doesnt mean we have to be. So from this day forward, you no longer invade my mind. I stop thinking about you. I stop wondering if youll ever try to come back. I mean, youre blocked everywhere so youre only option is coming to my school to see me  but thatll never happen. I stop expecting anything out of you. I release you. I never want you to love me. You could never love me. I never want you to commit to me. You could never commit to me. I never want you to think of me. I never want you to miss me. I never want you to try to reach out to me in any way possible. I never want you to act right for me. Im done. Thanks for the trial."

I dont believe that you guys meant to hurt me like you have, but you Have... To one of you: I understand that you need to move away to live where youll be happier. Ill just really, really, Really miss you. And Ive put you first your entire life, as it should be. And I told you many times over the years, to always strive to be better than me. To grow and learn and be the best you can be for yourself. My daughter, youre all grown up now and I cant tell you how proud that I am of who youve become. So just go. Live your life, and dont worry about me. Im just going to miss working with you every day. Ill miss our drives, our morning coffee and even our mother-daughter squabbles... And you- Im so hurt and angry with you both as well. But also with myself. However, I had to experience the relationships just in case. Because I was so stupid to think that maybe either of you could have been the one. No. No you werent. Im finally genuinely struggling to hold myself together. Its been several years, and now my insides are finding their ways out of me. Im ambivalent at this point, about keeping my pride and my composure. Im caring less about showing vulnerability, and simultaneously relieved for shedding these tears. Dammit."
151,vulnerability,offmychest,An open letter to my abusive ex,1,fdgnuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/fdgnuf/an_open_letter_to_my_abusive_ex/,2020-03-05 04:45:06,"I feel like this is long overdue. I'm finally taking a moment to sit down and tell you what should've been said all those years ago. When we first met back in 2012, I had no idea what the next 5 years would bring. If only I had known. I would've ran like hell and never looked back. We became a couple about a year after we met. My first relationship ever at just 12 years old. It was this sweet, cute puppy love at first. But it wasn't real love. It was attraction that born out of vulnerability and desperation. Unfortunately being so young, I didn't notice the signs. The signs that this relationship was going to destroy my life. I had no point of reference. It started small, you just casually mentioned how you didn't like me hanging out with certain people. Of course it was for my own protection according to you. You were a couple years older than I was. You knew better. Then you didn't like how I looked in shorts, then skirts, then dresses, or anything that showed my developing figure. But of course it was out of my protection. To keep eyes off me. You wanted to keep me safe. In the mission of keeping me safe, you cut me off from everyone except you. You became my only friend and family. I became dependent on you for everything. Where I would go, what I would do, what I would wear. Every aspect of my life, you had almost all the say. You knew best. A year into our relationship. I was 13 and you were 15. You told me that you had cheated on me with a girl at your high school. I was crushed. I should've ran. But I didnt. At this point I was so attached and so dependent that I stayed. This was one of the worst mistakes I have ever made. This is when it got bad. You were so afraid that I'd try to take revenge that your possessiveness went into overdrive. I couldn't walk around school ever relaxed out of fear that you were constantly watching me. And sometimes you were. I was so scared that someone would come up to me, maybe just to ask where a certain class was, and you would see it. You would see it and think I was trying to cheat. You would dig your nails into my skin and ask who that was and why I was talking to them. I was so scared all the time. But it felt normal being scared. I grew up with you and it just seemed like this was how relationships worked. I remember how when anyone even dared to look at me, you wouldn't stare them down. Instead you'd scream at me later about how I need to stop people from looking my way. And I tried. I tried so hard to keep people away. My first year of high school, I think I can count on my hands and feet the number of times I spoke besides answering questions in class. I was a recluse who dressed in baggy clothes and cardigans and I had no friends. I tried to do everything right. At least what seemed right to you. I tried to be the ""obedient girlfriend"" who listened and was at the beck and call of her boyfriend. I tried to cook, but you always hated my food. I tried to cook with you so I could learn, but you always yelled that I was in your way or how I never did it right. I tried to clean, but you always said I was too slow. I tried to speak Spanish, but you always said I would never learn. I tried to be everything you wanted in a girl, but it was never enough for you. I was always falling short. You made sure I knew it too. As the years went by and we got older, you constantly compared me to the other girls around us. Saying how this girl had a better chest or how your moms coworkers daughter knew how to clean and spoke spanish. I was constantly being belittled and made to feel inferior. My self esteem was non existent at this point. I felt unworthy, hopeless, and I was disgusted with myself. Intitially I fought with you when you would say those awful things, but eventually I began to agree. And I would apologize to you. I apologized for my wrongs and I promised I would try to be better. I think not only did I say this because I knew if I tried to fight it would only make things worse, but I also began to believe it myself. I thought, how can he deal with someone as awful as me. He's the best I can ever have if he has managed to still love me after all these years. I need to stay. No one else will be able to deal with me like he has. It was that kind of thinking that made me stay. You manipulated this little girl so badly that when abuse looked her right in the face she was blind to it. Not only did it look her in the face, but hit her too. I remember the first time you hit me. I was in 8th grade. We were fighting about god knows what and you slammed your fists on my thigh so hard I cried. The bruise was an insane array of blue, purple, and black. It throbbed and was painful to the touch. When I was in the locker room changing for dance class someone asked me what happend. I said I fell off my bike and landed on it. They believed it and so did I. I couldn't come to terms with the fact that you had hit me. I can remember only one or two more times that you had hit me after that. But you would often dig your nails and twist my arm when you felt it was necessary. Remember at the Christmas party at my moms friends house? She was like a grandma to you and I. She liked you a lot. Remember how you grabbed my arm so hard that it left a huge red mark. You didnt want anyone to see so you massaged it till it went away. You said you were sorry. I forgave you. But I think what hurt even more than physical actions, was when you would yell at me. You yelled at me constantly. Sometimes you would scream. You'd scream so loud that the frames on your walls would rattle. Every time you yelled I would wince and cry. Begging you to stop yelling at me. You yelled even more. You hated that I cried so easily, but at the same time you said you liked seeing me cry. I used to never be so affected when someone would yell at me. But now I can barely take it when someone remotely raises their voice. I think that's also why I can't yell. I can't raise my voice or yell at anyone for anything. It's something I simply can't do because it brings me back. And I like to be as far away from it as possible. I wanted to be so far from it that my mind hid a lot of memories from me after it was all over. It did it to protect me from the trauma. Only when something triggers it do I remember. The last time it happend was back in September. I don't know what I saw or heard, but it came rushing back. I had absolutely no idea this had happend till that day. But when it came back I remembered every single detail. I could remember the feeling of you tearing my clothes off, the smell of your sheets as my face was shoved into them. I can remember hearing my pleas for you to stop and I can feel every tear that went down my face. You were silent. The entire time. And even after you finished, you were silent. Except for when you said that I clearly liked it. You said that and then we never spoke of it again. It was a buried memory for years. I was what maybe 15 or 16? I didn't remember for another 2-3 years. The mind is powerful isn't it. My mind buried so many of these memories that I actually still defended you even after I left. My friends talked trash about you and I defended you. I asked them to not say those things and that you were a good person. You just had some anger issues. I actually still cared about you. Maybe it was Stockholm Syndrome. It wasn't until I came face to face with what really happened that I realized what a true monster you are. You took away everything from me. My childhood, my self esteem, opportunities, and my ability to love. Long after I finally left you, I didnt have the capability to love someone. I would reach a plateau everytime. My feelings couldn't progress and I was frustrated because these were good guys. But you took it away. You made me so scared to be in a relationship again out of fear that I would get another you. It was this fear that cost me so much. And when I finally did love someone again, this fear caused me to hesitate. And this is part of why I lost them. After I lost them, for the first time ever I hated you. I hated you so much. You were off getting married with a child on the way and here I was heartbroken years later. I thought what did I do to deserve this. Why does he get to be happy and I don't. Why does he get to have the perfect family when I can barely express to someone that I have feelings for them. I hated you so much and I don't hate anyone. But I hate you. I forgave you though. For everything. For those 4 and half years of terror. I didn't forgive you to make you feel better. I forgave you so I could finally let go of you and the hold you had on my life. Even after you were gone you still had so much control. I couldn't let you control me anymore. If I continue I will loose everyone I will ever love. So I let go. The only thing I hope for you is that you've miraculously changed and you're a new man. You have a wife now and soon a child. I can only hope that she will never have to go through what I did. She doesnt deserve that. No one does. I never truly told you how much of a monster you were. At the time I was too blindsided and afraid. But now over two years later, I'm finally saying it. It's liberating to finally acknowledge that I was a victim of you. That I was emotionally and physically abused by you. I can finally say that I survived you and I crawled of that hell that you made my life. I still see the effects of you in my day to day life, those experiences will forever shape who I am, but I will not ever let them hurt me again. You have hurt me for way too long. I will accept my damage and never let myself or anyone else use it against me. I always wanted to be the bigger person and say that I wish you the best and I hope you have a great life. But this entire time I've been the more mature one who tries to keep a level head. So for once I want to just say what I've been dying to say all these years. Fuck you. TL;DR. This is an open letter to my ex of 4 and a half years. We broke up a little over 2 years ago. I never truly told him how I felt about our relationship out of fear for my own safety. Here it is."
152,vulnerability,offmychest,Blog medicine exploits vulnerable people and fucks them up. I'm sick of it.,1,em4so5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/em4so5/blog_medicine_exploits_vulnerable_people_and/,2020-01-09 15:47:01,"You google something you're concerned about, and what pops up? Blog medicine. Facebook medicine. Bullshit medicine. I recently had a lady ask me to check into a blog post she found that told her her picky eater of a toddler was both her fault and an indication that the toddler was to suffer anxiety and depression at their tender age. It was on a popular parenting website. This isn't new. This happens all the time. People turn to google. It might be to inform themselves before going to the doctor. It might be because medical costs are high enough that people seek out the cheaper option of Dr Google. It might be because someone has fed them the misinformation that real doctors are not to be believed. It might simply be because they're scared and can't help themselves. Or it might be because they're not getting the important answers to their suffering they're seeking the conventional way, and they don't know where else to turn. Most people do not know how to identify a bunk or severely skewed article when they see one, and these blog medicine bullshitters profit from this. If there are people in the world I hate on sight, it's those that prey on people's vulnerability - and what makes a person more acutely vulnerable than concerns about their health or the health of their children? This blog post I looked into... The hallmarks were there: * Blame. Fear mongering. It's the anxious mother's fault - insinuated, of course, as that's more effective. The consequences are dire - never what you'd want for your child. * A ""study"" that looked into ""over 900 children"". Sure, that may be... So why didn't the author link the study, like they did all these other people's ""how to deal with your picky eater"" projects? No link to the study. No name of the study. No names of the, as referenced, ""researchers"". Not even a date on the blog post that would help you search up this study. Makes it nice and hard to fact check the blog post. * And a byline. A good ol' byline from the author of the blog post that promotes their online learning service - complete with a link. A byline that provides another link to their book you can buy. Fuck you author. F.U.C.K Y.O.U. On sight, I don't trust you. But the average person will fall into your trap: you've spun it so well. You sell scared people on fear mongering bullshit and profit from it. If these sorts of blog medicine posts are based on something that actually exists, you can bet your arse they're writing their article from the point of view of someone who, at the very least, wants to confirm their own bias. I did manage to find this study. Yes, there were parents of over 900 children in the initial consultation of this retrospective analysis. By the follow up - on which they based their deductions on developing mental health concerns among children under school age - there were only 188 children. They also focused on to two types of children: the child with sensory sensitivity to the world, not just food, and the child who was facing some other detriment of their picky eating. Their concern was not on the picky eating toddler who was otherwise fine - as the blog post liked to suggest they were. The article about the study also made a *point* of indicating causal relationships had more to do with family dysfunction as a result of concern over the child - that *that* was where the child was getting their anxiety from. Not, as this blog post wanted to proclaim, that the mother with anxiety troubles was somehow causing all of this just by existing. That their child was, just because they were a picky eater, going to end up anxious and depressed. It angers me to no end that people put this shit up on the internet, leading scared people to think one thing, when they've depicted it for the benefit of no one but themselves. It angers me that my initial response to people who bring my attention to these things can't be: ""well that sounds like a load of cock."" It angers me that when pregnant mothers search up some food they just ate because it was the only thing their body was telling them they could keep down, find in the results that fucking rice is going to abort their child. Where is the part in those articles that getting food poisoning from freshly cooked rice in the western world is really not much more likely to make you extremely sick than every other goddamn time you've eaten rice? Not there. Nope. Because it's better to make mothers feel like every goddamn thing they can do is wrong - at least, for the people who sell books on this crap. People who are concerned about the rare negative effects of vaccinating their children find this shit. People who wonder why they have a sudden headache they've never had before get told they're about to die - and what ""natural remedies"" can save them - no mention of the fact that fucking cocaine and opiates are about as ""natural goddamn remedies"" as those ones they sell you on (though, PSA: cocaine is not generally all the beneficial for anything, and don't take opiods for a migraine). People who have been suffering for a long time something that isn't easily diagnosed get pulled into bullshit scams that tell them getting the toxins out of their bodies is going to fix it. Babies get essential oils squirted up their noses and into their eyes because some stupid fucking blog wanker sold parents on the idea that that was going to help. Why? BECAUSE THEY GET MONEY FOR IT! Because they get to pretend they're smarter than doctors! Because they get an ego boost! Because they can pretend they're better parents than you! Because they fucking can for the sake of their own self gratification."

I have a friend of approximately two years. This friend, I have done everything for. I have put myself in difficult situations. Dropped everything and anything to be there for her when she needed me. Spent hours and days being sick with worry due to her alcoholism. Seen her at her worse. Supported her in her journey to get help and start on her journey to recovery. I am currently in the depths of a severe depressive episode. Through this I still do everything I can for her - emotionally, monetarily, physically. I have now on a few occasions told her I need her, which is not something I do easily. I find it very hard to show that level of vulnerability. And she hasn't been there for me. One occasion she was relatively supportive via text. The others I have been ignored. I am so hurt. I feel so idiotic. So desperately alone. Her help and support would have prevented me doing something I should not have done a few nights ago. But I'll never tell her that, that would be cruel. I feel so desperately sad and lonely now.

Ive been hurt in romantic and friend relationships before and been destroyed by the loss of my father... all different kinds of love but picking up from each one of those is a struggle in and of itself. And once you get to a place where you feel like its all being put back together again your self doubt kicks in... your worry and fear that this could all end up in a heap worse than where you started fills your mind. Trusting yourself again to love. Believing in love again. Accepting the vulnerability that comes with it Its hard. But its life. Your heart will get broken. Whether it be by a friend, lover or by death - it is going to happen. And there is no other option but to heal, become stronger and love again Love and caring makes this all worth it... so be fearful but embrace it. Because what else can you do."

It's nothing new to me that you always distance yourself after emotional intimacy. Since the beginning of our friendship you'd confide things to me that you said you never told anyone. I was there to listen and help you become more comfortable with vulnerability without ever pushing you or expecting anything. I have always had a little crush on you, but it wasn't unhealthy or obsessive, since I saw other people. I was just happy being your friend. But our relationship wasn't merely platonic. At one point, my crush grew bigger and I asked you out a year ago but you turned me down. It stung at the time but I got over it quickly, since everything was the same yet I gave it a shot to maybe grow into something more. I was worried that our relationship wouldn't be the same, but we moved on like nothing ever happened. Still, despite rejecting me you gave off mixed signals. Little flirting here and there, how you confessed you felt jealous when I matched on tinder with a mutual friend. I don't like using the word teased, because it sounds like I feel entitled to your attention/feelings, which I don't. But your hot and cold flirty nature feels like a deliberate tease. The pride weekend that we spent together in SF and we held hands walking the street. On the train back home you'd offer up your lap or shoulder for me to lay on, and play with my hair and caress my neck with your fingertips, while i did the same to your thigh. What was that, and why did you pull away so hard when we arrived home? What about that time we cuddled on the couch, holding hands, me giving you a massage or tracing your back and neck, playing with each other's hair? In the moment, you seem to enjoy that and sometimes even initiate, although with a bit of hesitation. And the next day after such intimacy you retrieve and flinch from even accidental physical touch from me? I remember when we were sitting on a bench downtown, drunk, and made a long eye contact, you said: ""tell me"", and i looked away and that was it. what did you think I was going to say? did you want me to say that i liked you? You always say that I truly see you, and I'm the only one that's real with you and can call you out. That you're not used to being seen like that. I get it, vulnerability is hard. The past 3 months you have been too far away from me emotionally, saying you're busy yet building new ""superficial"" friendships. That's what you yourself call them, because they are not based on intimacy, but surface-level class friends. I finally asked you about why you're so distanced lately and you say that you just can't handle our intimacy. That being seen like that is too intense for you and that I deserve better. Yeah, that feels crappy, but I'd never push for anything. If it's not a genuine intent, then it's worth nothing to me. Be real with me, and if you think I deserve better, then be better. Communicate with me without waiting for me to bring it up instead of many weeks of you saying that you were just busy. I want to be angry but I can't. If you're telling me the truth, it's due to what's going on inside your head. And that stuff is hard to unlearn. But fuck if I don't feel sad as fuck. We're hanging out tomorrow for the first time since early december, but I don't feel excited. I guess I'm dreading to see you being fake friendly to me because I called you out. And that would mean it's over. Anyways, it sucks that you are too scared of what we could be. And I recently started learning how to love myself to know that I deserve better than being led on like that. I still want to be friends, but you will have to do show me that you're willing to work on your intimacy issues rather then softly cutting me off. Stop playing with me."
158,vulnerability,offmychest,What it means to be strong,1,epjeky,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/epjeky/what_it_means_to_be_strong/,2020-01-17 00:35:27,"I feel so alone in this world on some days, although, I'm really not anymore. I sure did four years ago and as a child. Home life was full of violence and sorrow. Slaps, chokes, belt whippings, punches, burns, the whole damn circus. I have zero positive memories of my childhood. Emotionally i was battered, sexually i was violated, and as a coping mechanism I compartmentalized the pain and the anger. It eventually almost killed me. Nearly. But I've healed a lot in the last four years out here on my own, being no contact. My extended family took me in as a young teenager. Battered and scarred i was, and my cousin did her damn best in nurturing me. But they're also insane. Not as batshit insane as my mother, but still crazy and religious. They kept trying to reconcile with that witch. Four years ago, i was twenty-one years old, estranged from my parents, and just graduated from University. Then the ""reconciliation"" began. My mother claimed to want to reconcile, but what happened was three months of hell with her. From blackmailing me with my personal identity documents, to daily abuse and put-downs about my achievements or my lover who had chronic illness, to eventually threatening my life with arson. One day, while stuck on the second floor of that house, I envisioned my life playing out in the near future - i was ready to load up on a bunch of drugs, be a toxic human waste to others, before ecstatically crashing a car in suicide. That was the moment i knew that i needed to get the hell out of this, no more pandering to crazy old batshit insane people in this god forsaken family. These were folks that flaunted their wealth with branded bags, regular high tea and yum-cha outings, two-storey houses, etc. If you did not listen to them, they would taunt you. I hear the words ringing in my head again, ""Watch her crawl back to us. Just watch."" These were homophobic, racist, drama-ridden folks who revolved their life around one-upping each other. I was a broke 21 year old with lots of scars that no one could really see, who had three thousand dollars, a PC, and two suitcases to my name. I said fuck it and bought a one-way ticket to the city where my friends were. It was a very painful process but ... I have grew in confidence around my principles, with a strong sense of what is right and what is wrong. I have also accumulated some money and cultivated skills that matter to me. But most of all, I've gotten back in touch with warmth and openness. I am now my own mother, the woman I never had as a child. I am also in touch with my inner child, the child who laughed and is full of curiosity. My cousin hasn't been so lucky in that regard. She had been indoctrinated into religion, into never questioning her elders, into yielding to the pressure and invalidation so that she would get married. Last weekend, she rang me up and told me about it all. The hurt that she had tried to ignore. That was killing her. Imagine hearing the woman who cared for you as a child, as a teenager, tell you that she was sitting on the balcony ready to jump the other week. That she had grabbed a knife and was ready to slit her throat last night; The worst part was that Aunt told her to kill herself, that her body won't let her die, to do it. They're insane, the whole lot of them. Why can't she just leave? She is stuck in a messed up marriage with a child, while the inter-generational trauma that runs in my family continues. She was pressured and invalidated when refusing this marriage. Appearances are all that matter to them, and she had enough of it. She deserves to be heard, for her needs and feelings to matter. To do what she feels like, which is far from the materialistic lifestyle that was indoctrinated upon her. But it's not up to me. All I can do is let her know that i am here for her. This is why I know there is no ""home"" to go back to back there. It is an illusion. I can still hear them taunting me, ""Watch her crawl back to us. You are nothing without us. You should listen to us!"", and it fires me up. It really does fire me up, it makes me want to continue succeeding until they are nothing but a distant memory. They think they know what it means to be strong. They are wrong. I am my own home now, and I know what is right and what is wrong. I will live by my own principles. I will continue to be \*strong\* -- and fuck anybody who tries to belittle me. They're wrong. To be strong... it doesn't mean to crush those who are weak. ""Crush them like they crushed me."" makes the world a terrible place. To be strong... it doesn't mean vulnerability equates to weakness. True strength of character has much to do with remembering what is important -- Being compassionate, open, sensitive, resilient, and productive."

Socially awkward, homeschooled since kindergarten, loved Alex Harris' book 'I Kissed Dating Goodbye', never been on a date, never been kissed. I met a girl at church, Emma\*. A bit younger than me, short, good-looking. I friended her on Facebook, and got her number. We started talking. I liked her. On the way back from a church event, I sat next to her on the bus, and my arm found its way around her, and one of the youth leaders said something about it. I decided to ask her out. I friended her mom, Linda\*, on Facebook, and messaged her asking if I could take Emma out on a date. She happily agreed, and we discussed a location: dinner, an action movie. \*Names changed for privacy's sake I asked Emma out, in person, at church. She agreed. I got home, and she messaged me, saying she'd like to call off the date, and just be friends. No worries, I was fine with being friends. I messaged Linda again afterwards, and told her what had happened. She told me that Emma liked me, and that I should keep pursuing her. I believed Linda. Emma and I kept talking. So did Linda and I. Emma and I chatted most days - in person at church, or via Facebook or text. We'd cuddle when alone at church, and I'd usually hug her at the end of every time I saw her. One day, she passed me a folded note, handwritten on lined paper. A letter. I wrote one back. Over that school year, I accrued a small book's worth of handwritten lined paper letters. We'd argue, too. I think I started most of the fights. We'd talk, she'd share a personal vulnerability - transitioning schools or self-harm or personal issues, I'd tell her she needed to talk to someone about it, she'd unfriend me or stop talking to me, I'd apologize, we'd keep talking. All the while, I'd be chatting with Linda - sharing screenshots of Emma's messages and discussions of her actions at church, asking for advice on what to do next. I wasn't a good listener for Emma, but I was good at listening to Linda. I continued pursuing Emma, romantically - Linda has said Emma liked me, and Linda was Emma's mom, so she'd know. Linda was listed as my 'mother-in-law' on Facebook, and even posted a video on my Facebook wall of a groom lip-syncing Justin Bieber to his bride at his wedding, stating that I should do the same. My relationship with Emma got more and more volatile - we'd argue more, chat less, more rude comments about her past, less friendly discussions. Around March, Linda and I started arguing too. Around April, Emma and I had a fight, and she unfriended me. I messaged Linda and told her that I wanted to end my relationship with Emma, and asked her how I should do it. Linda told me that Emma had moved on, and no action was necessary. Linda implied that I had been physically involved with Emma without Emma's consent, I vehemently denied it, we exchanged insults; Linda unfriended me. I never talked with Linda again. My friendship(?)/relationship(?) with Emma had lasted about nine months. I had messaged Linda about Emma on a library computer, in the afternoon. After our conversation ended. I messaged my mom and told her I needed a break. My mom saw the messages, went into my Facebook account, and learned for the first time about my conversations with Linda. I ran away from my hometown, walked four hours to a neighboring one that I didn't come back from until around 3AM, sat in a ditch, and cried. I haven't cried over a girl since then. I tore up all of the handwritten lined paper letters I'd gotten from Emma and threw them in the trash. Over the next two and a half years, I got a series of requests for reconciliation, that may or may not have been from Emma; her sister messaged me repeatedly and told me that Emma said to text her, and told me that Linda said it was fine, and I got friend requests: from Emma's sister, then from Emma - and, finally and bizarrely, from Emma's best friend, with whom I had no mutual friends besides Emma and had never particularly liked. I messaged Emma's best friend to ask her if there was a reason that she'd friended me, and she said there wasn't, so I unfriended her. I saw Emma at church most weeks, from a distance. At one point, I made eye contact with her - she looked scared. I tried to avoid being near her, or making eye contact with her, and I mostly succeeded. I didn't talk to Emma, and I didn't talk about Emma with anyone else, unless they brought her up - at which point I'd change the subject. Four years after our last conversation, I sent Emma a short apology: apologizing for what I did, short, vaguely worded, no specific actions listed. She accepted the apology. I never talked with Emma again. I had a series of dating relationships through high school, college and beyond: drama-free, emotionally shallow, largely devoid of sexual interest, inevitably ruined by my plans to start a new job or move to a new city or adopt a new religion, and always ending amicably and without crying on my part. I kept relationships with the parents of potential S.O.s amicable but minimally intimate. One girl told me that I was the most interesting thing in her life, another said over the course of a particularly intimate Snapchat conversation that she didn't even talk to her mother the way she talked to me. None of the relationships ever lasted longer than six months. I don't understand why I haven't forgotten about Emma, and I still can't tell what to think of it all. Was I abusive? Was I abused? Should I have tried to still stay friends with Emma? Did Emma like me? How would things have turned out if I had never listened to Linda at all? Am I overthinking this whole thing? Am I a bad person? I'm starting therapy sometime within the next month or so, to have someone to talk to. It'd be nice to have someone to talk to again, or to cry with. I want to cry over a girl again, but I've forgotten how."

I have my share of troubles when it comes to him, but I think I was very lucky compared to some other kids. My father has undiagnosed Asperger's syndrome though. I, my family, and the other people are all sure that he has it, but it's never been something that was needed to investigate. He excels perfectly at his job and making friends, but nonetheless he has pretty extreme Asperger's. This is was a problem for us as kids because his emotions were never displayed. He never expressed vulnerability or was someone we could emotionally open up. Even though we had a present father, he was emotionally absent due to his Asperger's which made appear apathetic. It is only recently that my mother shared with me how sensitive my dad is, and that he really does feel bad sometimes about how we talk about him or exclude him. With that in mind, I had a dream with a different father last night. My father was played by the villian from the 2019 film ""The Nightingale."" This man was playing the role of a father I had never met before in my life in this dream. Immediately we hit it off. We had the same interests, sense of humor, etc. I started to open up about my personal vices like how I feel apathetic often and a myriad of my other problematic personality traits that I wouldn't normally open up to around other people. He had the same problems, and it was so good to relate to someone. And then my alarm rang. I wanted to go back into the dream so bad. I just wanted to spend more time with him. I have my real father who I haven't seen in 2 years, but I missed this one more in that moment. I feel guilty about that."

Life has a funny way of showing you the things that at the time you werent able to see. As a child you were so wound up with anxiety, eager to please, solitary and never really knowing how important you were to the world. You were constantly compared to others by your father. Never feeling good enough because you didnt look like them so therefore you were unworthy. Though you loved him so much because you were his daughter. Even through all the times when he was meant to pick you up for your weekends but instead disappeared for months on end with no contact.You were still there waiting for him. He didnt mean this in malice. He was battling his own demons. He had such a skewered view of the world and how it works that he felt like it was helping you be the best you could be. But being a good kind person didnt come into it. It was all about looks, money, status. He did love you. You know that now but didnt back then. You spent most of your childhood, teenage years and early adulthood trying to either fit in, trying to please everyone but never really liking who you were or what you looked like. Being overweight was like a protective cloak around you. Made you accept the shit that people gave you because all you ever wanted was to be loved and accepted and being told you were good enough. You needed to have friends, you needed to be needed because that was your comfort. You chose to be with men who needed you to love them without them being able to love themselves. They were emotionally unavailable, cruel and used your kindness because it made them feel good but would discard you like a piece of used tissue on a side walk. And you accepted that. You accepted it because thats all you have known. To give and give and give and put your heart out on a platter to someone who doesnt deserve it. To feel abandoned when they leave because you didnt think you were ever good enough or tried hard enough to get them to love you back. Countless tears, heartbreak, emotions- all for you to blame it on yourself because you werent thin enough, smart enough or funny enough to make them stay. But you were good at putting on a facade. Shrug it all off and trying again all the while you were constantly comparing yourself to others knowing that if you just had a better job, a smaller waistline or a better life you would finally be enough for someone to love you like you loved them. Why am I not enough. Why am I in this world. Why should I even be here when nothing about me is deserving. Feeling lonely in a crowd full of people, them not knowing what constant destructive thoughts were going through your head- every second, every minute, every hour. To current self, You are 29 now- almost 30. Life whilst a whirlwind has really started opening your eyes. You know that real happiness doesnt come from being thin, good job, good social network. You know that because you have it. You have gone through such a transformation physically with weight loss and ultimately plastic surgery. You have the body you have always wanted. You can wear the clothes you have always wanted to wear. Constantly being told how much you have changed and how pretty you are. You have a great job, and you are good at it. You have supportive friends and family- people who you choose to be around you because you no longer associate with venomous people who are only friends with you to maybe add one more like to their Facebook profile photo. You have done the hard work emotionally, physically and spiritually but it has been bloody hard to have to go through this journey. You forgive your dad, he is so proud of you of what you have become. You love him even though he is still so lost. But you will always still be there. But your heart hasnt changed. The outside may have have transformed but inside you are still the same person. You are still caring, funny, empathetic, intelligent, emotional, anxious, wise and you attract people with your bubbly nature. You have had 3 relationships in the last 2.5 years. All 3 whilst initially were devoted and kind and loving showed that they too were emotionally unavailable. You still put yourself last. You always put them and their needs first. They loved your spirit and your confidence. But as soon as they saw the vulnerability in you, they changed. They couldnt be there for you like you were there for them. You were sidelined and felt like that lost little girl again waiting for just some form of validation or something to show you were important to them. You were never the priority for them though for once in your life you just wanted to be loved like you loved them. But Im proud of you. You walked away from all of them. That takes a strength that you never used to have. You walk away knowing you are good enough, they just cant see it and dont deserve to. You dont need to be someones permanent counsellor or caretaker. Your feelings are valid and important as well. What you want and need from a relationship should be heard. You dont need to beg to get them to see your worth. To those men I gave my heart away to. I dont hate you or wish you ill. I want to thankyou for opening my eyes up to what I needed to see. For teaching me the lessons I needed to learn. I needed to learn I keep choosing the wrong people to give my heart to. Showing me what I do and do not want in a future partner. So today, you are writing this as a cathartic exercise- fresh from recent heartbreak where again you started doubting yourself and your worth. You are reclaiming your strength. This year, you are going to work on the most important person there is. You. You are going to work on loving yourself again. Be alone-be vulnerable but be kind to yourself. Its ok to not feel amazing every day. Sometimes you will feel beautiful, strong and confident with the world at your feet. Sometimes you will feel sad, lonely, unattractive and again questioning your place in this world. Its going to be ok. Be with the people that make you happy, educate yourself, read more books, travel to more places, have some amazing experiences. Be open to the universe and all the amazing gifts it has to offer you. It has a plan. Loving yourself sounds easy but it is actually really hard. This is now the journey to find you again. Just take it hour by hour, day by day, month by month, year by year. Dear future self- I hope you are happy. Not happy with material things but happy in life. I hope you are still working on loving yourself and you are either happy being alone or happy in the partnership/ marriage that you have always wanted be in. They prioritise you, make you feel important and give you back what you give them. They make you laugh, they look after you when you are sick, the calls you beautiful everyday and really mean it. Because they love the person you are and they choose to be with you. Maybe with children, maybe not. Its ok what you choose. I hope you have found something you are passionate about either in a job or a hobby. I hope you still have an amazing supportive network of people around you. I hope you have travelled more and experienced things this world has to offer. I hope you continue to grow to become an even better version of yourself. I hope you get to laugh everyday and feel grateful for the things you have. Ill keep this letter as a reminder because you have come so far and the beautiful thing about life is that there is always more things it needs to show you. Not only to grow and to learn from but it also shows you happiness in the smallest of places. You will always have a place in this world. Keep sharing your kindness, empathy, compassion. You are loved. Most importantly, its you who loves you. Just for who you are and nothing else. Just take it day by day, month by month, year by year. Love always. Me."

Except my life is in an OK spot for once. Sort of. Living for myself (for the sake of control) is making me exhausted. Not literally socially isolated, but at home I'm over my family and even though one of my goals is to move out once I've saved enough, I now have doubt it'll fix me instantly. I haven't gone through any breakups, by the way, nor have I been heartbroken in another form. But the walls &amp; guard I naturally have, why isn't it working? It's a rinse &amp; repeat of me feeling OK for a few weeks then felt awful &amp; feel like breaking down in a week. It's more of a home thing as I'm alone at home, but I'm not as bad when I'm at work for example. But I hate being vulnerable, yet I naturally keep a close grip on most things I do - not just emotions. My energy has slowly declined to, despite getting a decent amount of sleep and any caffeine I might be getting. At least in the last few days - and it ties with the fear of the unknown - is a fear of vulnerability. Or a lack of desire to be vulnerable or climb the walls, and wondering why this isn't working. That, in addition to how to deal with relationships (all kinds) when they don't agree with you, from your insignificant ideas to your hopes &amp; dreams. Other than a session with a Kinesiologist booked next week, where to from here? "

166,vulnerability,offmychest,another wave. feeling a little tender. sad. unwilling,1,eu9p4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/eu9p4d/another_wave_feeling_a_little_tender_sad_unwilling/,2020-01-27 04:29:49,"Hey. This is my first Reddit post and I think, the first online exchange I've ever went for in regards to vulnerability. I guess...I just really needed someone to talk to. I guess...I just wanted some release. Writing has always been a medium of catharsis to me so I thought, *Here's Reddit and people always seem to have some genuinely good things to say. Let's go for it.* And when there's no face to put to the names I run into here, maybe it's better. I cannot talk to my mom over tea. I cannot always go to friends. Sometimes, I feel like I'm this burden. I don't know why the drive to come here suddenly flared up, then. I suppose I just *can't* just say ""Life is bueno!!"" and move on at times. I suppose I need to practice saying ""yeah, shit actually sometimes does hit the fan here."" And seek some kind of consolation. Or a reminder that I am not alone. It's morning time here. 8:40 am, to be exact. I woke up and almost immediately after, I ran to the living room to cry. I don't know. I've been intermittently crying these past few days. The tears felt so familiar. I remember those tears. It's easy to not let that side come out of me, not when I'm on campus. I don't know why I'm so...sad. I guess I can understand the contributing factors. Still. The thing is...there is always that encouraging message I loved hearing--how a broken arm is something we may pay attention to because it's physical...and in your face...but how it does not mean that we ignore the things that are invisible on the outside like mental health...but truth be told? I can't help sometimes thinking that I'm dramatic. That I'm not being intelligent about discerning my feelings between something else. What if they're hormones? What if they're just me being overly sensitive? After all, I know myself...but I'm also not an objective viewpoint. But I suppose that I'm free to feel my emotions as they come while it's one's prerogative to take them and run or something. When you don't consistently feel *dreadful,* though, it's quite hard to ask for help. Don't get me wrong--it just IS difficult to ask for help at times. For me, though, if I don't feel shitty consistently, I just take each day as I go. I never think I'm healing--I think I'm just a clump of events and things...bad days and good days. I take each day as I go because I must. I am a student at college because I have to be. I, truthfully, don't know what else I'd do because I genuinely...am lost. I try fulfilling my role as a student--getting to classes on time every time, reading the syllabus and doing my shit. Taking lecture notes, attending discussion like my life depended on it. And there are these sparks of interest I feel. But also, I'm doing things mechanically. I don't think I try engaging with my text outside of classes. I want to be more engaged...but I also can't. My eyes read articles and text and oftentimes, I have to backtrack, retrace my steps again, and try finding the last word. Because I lost my place and I lost my ability to focus. My mind is so foggy. It's hard to grasp my thoughts; they're like slippery eel. Maybe my motivation is my fear of failure. That's why I will get shit done even if it kills me. There are the dreadful instances then....and I'm not sure if they're the culmination of shitty things or if they're triggered. But then, negative emotions run into me and crash inside of my head. And I can't escape the tide. My head is bobbing. I feel worthless. I feel like such a gross little presence. A burden. A ""but it's always okay if you don't want to!!"" or ""no pressure, though. I know you're busy!""I can't remember things or have this desire to be bubbly me (which also helps me cope). And that adds to my feelings of ....self-hate. And I can't escape it. Oddly enough, it helps me cope. By expecting lowly of myself, I cannot get hurt...like that. Because I've already hurt myself before you can!! I'm taking Spanish this quarter and it awakened something...in me. Something I feared. Being in college has allowed me to find different avenues. High school was more closed in...stifling. But college let me see the different vibrancy I could display. I wasn't JUST this overly nervous, anxious kid. I was able to interact with my suitemates well and talk to individuals who represented clubs...go to the market by myself and attend events or meetings. I felt...brave. And then my Spanish classes reminded me of who I was...and always seemed to be. That individual who cared about what others thought. The one who did not **not** bash on her own ass. The classes are smaller and more engaging. And the fear....so immense. When I get nervous, I close in and begin scrutinizing myself. *Your cheeks are cherry red. Oh my goodness--he's gonna call on your stupid ass. Why did you say that stupid thing to your partner? Participate--Jesus! Just participate. Say something--anything!! You're a buffoon.* I'm socially anxious and sometimes it builds up to the point that I feel this incredible desire to escape so that no one has to see me the way I see myself. Not a chance! You might not like me if you really got to know me. So, yeah. I'm not feeling like shit in a perpetual way. I do the things I must though I'm not sure if that constitutes bravery. But maybe that helps me just seek survival. My head is bobbing and sometimes I see shore. And then the waves come and I'm not sure how to take them. But I take the waves. I always do. To anyone who read this, can I just...send you a hug? I see you, you saw me. Thank you."
167,vulnerability,offmychest,"I(27M) think I was in an psychologically abusive relationship and I don't know how to be vulnerable about it to people, I need help to figure out what it even was.",1,eubxer,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/eubxer/i27m_think_i_was_in_an_psychologically_abusive/,2020-01-27 07:02:56,"Before anyone says it, I have been doing therapy for the past 4 or 5 months, and am 10 months removed from the relationship. I am living a good life as a single person, work is going well, I'm starting to make friends again and developing hobbies, I'm in better shape than ever, basically life is going good, and I know that I am on a good path. But I keep hitting the wall of not being good at showing vulnerability since a really bad relationship. I haven't told anyone about this before in such detail, so sorry if its really rambly or doesn't make sense at points, it's been difficult to type up. I have a strong fear of how to approach the fact that I was in a truly toxic relationship (my first real one too) for 3 years when talking to anyone. I don't know how to show vulnerability towards anyone in this sense, because the relationship fucked with me so much that I'm scared of people judging me for it. I'm scared of calling it ""emotionally abusive"" because I don't even know if that's what it is even if it felt like it. I feel this really strong fear of showing that vulnerability to someone by talking about this, then getting told ""you call that abuse?"" and them telling me the story of their own or someone else's brutal abuse that dwarfs whatever it was I went through. I don't want to have my life experiences invalidated, but I don't know what it was that I went through, if it was that different to what most people go through in life, what I can even label it as. &amp;#x200B; Some things from the relationship that to me made it feel it might be emotionally abusive for me were: * She constantly threatened me with breaking up (bi-weekly, if not weekly) for me not providing her whatever it was she was needing emotionally, usually because I was not as communicative when I was working 9-6 while she wasn't working. * When I did just let her go, she would keep talking to me and the ""breakup"" fizzled out and it was as if it never happened * Stonewalling and guilt tripping me constantly for not loving her enough or talking to her enough (I was texting hyper regularly through the day, like once every 2-7 minutes) * Being upset about me talking to other people instead of talking to her * Once asked me if I had cheated on her but wouldn't say why she asked for a good 20/30 minutes, just stonewalled me * Would regularly question any good intentions I showed towards her, in a cynical manner * We were long distance for 2 years, in this time I had to text her constantly with full attention, like if I was going to the gym she would be pissed off and stonewall me, because i wouldn't be able to text her every 2/3 minutes, therefore it wasn't worth it * She moved in with me in my apartment abroad after 2 years, but ended up spending 5 months here never finding a job and being very apathetic about getting one while creating a log of drama between us. She got two interviews when she applied for two jobs one day. One of them she didn't even show up to, the other she showed up late to the practical part of it. Very often the reason for it was that I hadn't helped her enough to find one, despite me doing my best including helping her fix up her CV, cover letters, encouraging her, etc. * When I broke up with her it was in a hospital with two police nearby. She had threatened to commit suicide multiple times in the prior 48 hours with insulin pens and a knife. &amp;#x200B; As I typed those up I just keep thinking everyone will ask me why I stayed, and I don't know how to explain it. I feel like people will see me as pathetic. I wasn't in a good situation when we first met though. When we first met I'd had post viral fatigue that had lasted me for 10 months. I had stopped being able to do the sports that I made my friends in, I was depressed and isolated but sincerely trying to get out of it. So I likely at the start looked over some of the red flags because I was just so surprised someone would be into me. When she had threatened suicide, I knew it wasn't that she was fully serious about doing it, I knew it was a way of proving how inadequate I was. I was so scared or in denial (I don't know which) that I called an ambulance to help her instead of police to help me, because I still was so scared of her judgement of me. I truly was not able to imagine a world in which I wasn't being judged, therefore I never broke up with her. After that breakup, I've had 2 dates in 10 months since then (both bad because I was too scared to show interest) and as a result no sex, while I found out she'd gotten a new boyfriend within 6 weeks. I know that was very rambly, but I needed to type this out. I don't know what this is, or what that was. I don't know what to even categorise it as, I don't know what I went through but I know it felt so unbelievably bad compared to where I am now emotionally. I don't know how to communicate this to anyone and it scares the shit out of me having to do so. I feel like I might have to spend more months and months working through in therapy this before I could ever consider dating or even having sex with someone, is this right? I really want to put myself out there again, but this feels like such a hurdle talk about that affects how I let myself relate to people I'm attracted to."

He didn't seem too confident, do you just like taking advantage of shy guys"" Jesus fuck. I only talked to him. Constant unpredictable thoughts that I may have done a terrible harm to someone.

I, of course, tried to show my interest while not snubbing the other people around me and I thought I did it well. Apparently not. I realized my disconnect when I was talking to my friend (who had been there with me) about the guys wed met. Yeah, that one guy was all over you she said, in a tone that made it seem as if she was sympathizing with my struggle. I said I know I was so happy, which is honestly as vulnerable as I could get and even that was a stretch because vulnerability is my biggest fear. She was very surprised, even though I myself thought Id made my crush very obvious. Fast forward, I went on a date with him yesterday. He was very sweet and lovely and he touched me all the time and we talked a lot and I liked that, I thought that was nice. But every time he even got close to my face or my mouth I was pulling away, unconsciously almost. Still, even though he never kissed me, I thought it was still clear to him that I liked him. Apparently not, again, as he actually later on asked if I wanted to see him again. And it sort of hit me now, as Im thinking back, that I rarely did do much to show him I liked him back. Yes, I leaned on his shoulder when he put his arm around me and I let him hold my hand and all that, but I rarely initiated it and while he had plenty of nice things to say to me, I only echoed his compliments to me back at him, I didnt make the effort to actually be vulnerable and tell him I think youre a wonderfully kind person or just a simple youre so nice. In theory, it seems so simple, but for me its so difficult. And it also makes it difficult for the romantic feelings I have for him to continue because I keep nitpicking on little things about him or not allowing myself to think he actually likes me even though its so very obvious that he does. Ive seen this pattern in all the previous dates Ive had and thats the reason theyve never progressed into anything further. I go on a few dates, find something wrong or everything is amazing and I lose interest anyway. But I dont want to do this with him. But its just. So. Hard. If you read all this, I love you. And, you better imprint this into your memory if you thought it was at all interesting because Im probably deleting this soon. (Because of course)."

171,vulnerability,offmychest,My first time being the first one to say 'I love you' was a disaster,1,ew9adl,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ew9adl/my_first_time_being_the_first_one_to_say_i_love/,2020-01-31 04:49:41,"Last night was the first time Id ever pondered the question: what is the purpose of saying I love you? Id spent a lot of time trying to answer a related question: what does I love you really mean? Perhaps because of this uncertainty, I use the phrase more sparingly than other English-speakers. Even though I consider most of my extended family delightful, I'm not one to bandy the phrase around with cousins, aunts, and the like. Furthermore, I don't have any friendships of the sort that would exchange these words casually. My predominant experience with saying it is as a closing to phone calls with my mom and siblings, but in that case the phrase is so taken for granted that its merged with the farewell following it to create loveyoubye. As if there werent enough meaning in the three words separately to merit a pause for breath. When I was 18, I repeated it when my boyfriend of three months said it to me. It was my first real romance, and I was so elated at the time that it never occurred to me to wonder if what I'd said was ""true"". About a year later, he told me that he had spoken too soon, because what he felt for me now was so much deeper and more intense than what he had felt then. My feelings had evolved similarly over that time, but I would never have thought to myself, much less intimated, that what we whispered to each other back then, in the midst of a stolen afternoon alone in my childhood home, was a mistake. The precise composition of emotions I was naming changed dramatically over the course of our five years together, but I love you always felt right. I think what I intended to express is somewhere close to you are wonderful and I offer you all I can give. And as we grew and learned one anothers intricacies, I simply had more to offer, more to give. Lately and for only the second time in my life, the phrase has been asserting itself in my mind. It happens when I think about the man Ive been seeing on a less-than-semiweekly basis since October. Some of the intervening infatuations, crushes, lovers, and boyfriends that followed my first love have enthralled me for longer stretches than this, but what I felt for those people was more transactional: ""you might be wonderful; I offer you anything that will make you like me more."" With this one though, the impulse is just to give--without calculation, expectation, or hesitation--the natural runoff from the joy his existence engenders in me. Confining this fact to my private thoughts and tawdry poetry sufficed, for a time. Then I began to notice that my usual gestures of affection seemed wrong, like I was trying to cram kisses, embraces, and near-synonyms like ""adore"" into a hole in the universe that was shaped like ""I love you"". But I held back, thinking of all the reasons to hesitate: it was too soon, I couldn't be sure of my own feelings, I doubted he felt the same, and I couldn't guess how he'd react. But last night, as I was falling asleep with his arms around me, those reasons to hesitate didn't seem so dire. I didn't consider the opposite, my reasons for wanting to tell him, until it was too late. After I said it, I paused for a moment, intending to follow up with something to the effect of ""you don't have to say it back, and it doesn't change anything between us."" But before I could get the words out, I already sensed him responding. Normally my nocturnal murmurings are met with a settling, almost melting, of his body into the hollows of mine, sometimes accompanied by a light squeeze or peck on the shoulder. This time, he felt mechanically rigid as he whispered back ""I love you too."" ""You don't have to say that,"" my words came out more accusing than I meant them to; in trying to fill the hole in the universe, I felt like I'd tumbled through it myself. ""Okay"" was all he said. I wish I had just left it there. But I mistook my feeling of disappointment for a sign that my mission was left unfinished. That there was any ambiguity in his reply. ""...What I meant was, you don't have to say that unless you mean it."" In the darkness, he probably couldn't tell that even the tips of my ears had flushed pink. ""I knew what you meant. And I loved that you understood."" If he melted into me then, I was too numb to feel it. Simultaneously numb and exposed, like some glob of organic matter that had flopped out of its petri dish and splatted on the lab bench. I don't think he meant to sound mocking. Pretending to sleep provided me ample time to conduct a postmortem. Clearly, I'd failed to prepare for a disappointing outcome because I thought I was meeting a demand external to myself, decreed by the perfection of the moment. I didn't acknowledge that some internal desire had driven me to it. So what had I wanted? What is the purpose of saying ""I love you""? I wasn't entirely truthful before; there is one friend with whom I exchange ""I love you""s, though only on special occasions. Actually, he and I started off dating, but after six months I began to feel restless and uncertain that we could be compatible longterm. Shortly after our amicable breakup, he left me a gift bag of my favorite snacks and a note expressing his desire to remain friends. I was touched by the gesture, but frustrated by the ""I love you""--his first directed at me--buried in an embedded clause towards the end of the note. Like a corpse peeking out from a receding glacier, it emerged too late to change anything. After reading it, I paced around for the span of a packet of fruit snacks, wondering why he had expressed it in this indirect way. Perhaps he'd already re-filed me among his considerable ranks of intimate platonic friends, and hadn't given the phrase a moment's thought. Perhaps he wanted it to be ambiguous. It was that furtive, guerilla ""I love you"" that forced me to reassess this man. Ambiguous or otherwise, he exposed vulnerability to someone who had just hurt him. And though his personal definition of love might not perfectly overlap with my own, the greater context of the gesture reminded me of his innate generosity. When I told him I loved him some weeks later, it was because I knew it was true and I wanted to reciprocate his vulnerability. I was only worried he wouldn't believe me. But he accepted it as confirmation of what he'd already suspected, and understood without me having to explain that I wasn't attempting to get back together. This morning proceeded as if last night's confession hadn't occurred. This at least attenuated my fear that I had scared him off for good. Still, I found myself sighing with relief when he left for work, and wondering how much longer all my interactions with him would have to pass through a ""could this be construed as overly-attached girlfriend?"" filter. I had wanted to open myself, and to invite openness. Instead, we had both retreated ever so slightly back into the ice."

173,vulnerability,offmychest,I love with someone I shouldnt. (30s f with 40s m),1,exrkc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/exrkc1/i_love_with_someone_i_shouldnt_30s_f_with_40s_m/,2020-02-03 04:15:56,"TL; DR: We formed a connection when both of our marriages were on the rocks. We may be able to start a relationship soon, but everything will be an uphill battle. I had zero desire to start something with him when I met him two years ago. My first impression was due solely to his job title- think surgeon with God-complex stereotype. (Plus he is handsome, so I thought for sure hed be full of himself.) However, we were forced to spend time together. Turns out thats not even the job he wanted but it pays well and hes good at it, and he will be changing jobs in the next couple years due to our employer structure. My first impression was so wrong; he is the kindest and most emotionally intelligent man Ive ever met. Over several months I realized I had feelings for him. We were both located halfway around the world from our spouses, but both married. My marriage was on the outs and I already had definitive plans to ask for a divorce. He knew I was ending my marriage. I had no idea he wanted to end his too. He has kids, and despite having a toxic marriage, he wanted to stick it out for them. Our chemistry was pretty obvious, but in our friend group we were the rule-followers, and kept in our own lanes. Until... one night we ended up alone for an hour. He tried to kiss me. I turned him down- despite wanting to kiss him so badly. He was drunk, I was sober, and I didnt want to be a home-wrecker. (Note: In the past, my attempts to decline advances had gone very poorly. The men previously would put more pressure on me, blow up in anger, ice me out, or use physical force.) He took the rejection in stride. He hugged me and said, Okay. (It seemed like our friends would continue to try and push us together, not realizing we had already entered that space. They liked us together, which was odd because they were very critical of another close pair involving a married man and unmarried woman with a similar age difference.) We stayed super close. We had long conversations, and he opened up to me about his troubles at home and why he didnt feel like he could leave. He looked at me and said, Where were you ten years ago? We both wished we could be together. For a couple months more, we provided each other the quiet emotional support we both craved. He told me about the scars from his past, and I told him about mine. It is sad that neither of our spouses allowed us the emotional vulnerability to share these things with them. My assignment was done. I came home. I divorced my husband. His assignment was longer. We emailed back and forth. He came home, but to a different city than mine. About six months after his return he reached out to me to let me know he was ending his marriage. He reached his breaking point. I hadnt expected him to make a move to divorce so soon. I had already lined up my next job location- several thousand miles away from him, a position I must take for a minimum number of years. I havent seen him or heard his voice in over a year. My feelings toward him are nearly as strong as when I saw him last. But nothing about pursuing a relationship with him would be easy. He is still married, and the divorce will likely be long and expensive. He has children, I have none. If we start something, it would start as long distance. We dont even know if we are actually compatible because it was a non-starter when we were geographically near each other. We may finally have a reunion in a few weeks when I travel his way for a conference. Im nervous. I expect that he will want a listening ear to support him through the turmoil of divorce. I dont expect that we should rush into any form of romantic relationship, but it will be very hard to resist if our chemistry picks up where we left off. I know that emotional affairs are sometimes more devastating than sexual ones. I know that they provide a different emotional high than a conventional relationship. I regret that he and I didnt start things the right way. But I cant help but wonder if it would be worth the fight to try to be together. All I know is that we both miss each other and through each other, we found a level of unrivaled emotional connection. Even if I can never have him as mine I know I will love him forever."

I followed that up by going on a two year drug binge that resulted in me impulsively accruing $38000 in debt (while high out of my mind) and a long term struggle with addiction. I'm now in a new city with a shit paying job that doesn't meet my basic expenses (much worse because of debt) and I'm struggling to get into a new better paying field to make my money situation better. On top of all this I struggle with the vulnerability necessary to share all these details with those close to me and bear the shame of the decisions regularly and painfully. Honestly, I don't even care if I get positive responses to this. I'd rather just someone said anything. Thanks."

My boyfriend and I have been together almost a year. we originally did long distance, however after a few months he asked if I would consider moving to his city to which I said yes. Weve been living happily together for 6 months now. We get along, are best friends, and for the most part have a kind, gentle and compassionate attitude toward each other. He is the most loving, thoughtful, emotionally and physically affectionate person Ive ever met. However, last night we had a huge argument and I dont know what this means for us. We argue, but its always resolved with love and kindness and hes always very available emotionally and empathetic. Not this time. I go through waves of feeling vulnerable here in this new city, its been hard to make friends and when we are in town together (we both work in aviation that have us out of town a few nights a week) we like to spend our time together. We are both introverted and love watching movies, reading and just hanging out, so the opportunity to create my own identity is restricted a little bit by my prioritising that quality time. My insecurities stem mostly from having a bit of an identity crisis here- sometimes i feel lonely and miss my family, friends and who I am in the context of my own environment, sometimes I get a little needy and want reassurance that things are all good when he gets distant and distracted (which is often). We usually do whatever he wants to do, and our life together is largely influenced by his goals and direction (potentially moving countries for his career which Im 100% supportive of) plus he spends a lot of time on extra curricular work stuff, which I collaborate with and support him. Anyway, thats the context of our relationship and my insecurities (which piss him off from time to time) But....our fight happened because his parents are buying him a house- and we will be living there together but its going to be his solely. We were talking about furniture and he said he didnt want to have any TVs in the house- this immediately triggered some vulnerability that was lingering under the surface. Essentially, I saw it as me needing to fit into his life however he wants it. From potentially moving countries to how we co habitat. And that his home will never feel like my home, and ultimately I wont have a nurturing home base that feels somewhat like mine here in this new city. Watching movies is something that we really enjoy together and it hurt to think hed be happy to remove that quality time. I got really annoyed and said some things like I dont want to just fit into your life, I wanna feel like im here in my own right too and my attitude was kinda bratty, which Im not proud of and profusely apologised for. Then he got really annoyed at me. I came into the room and he was crying and then said IM buying a house for ME and something along the lines of so he will do what he wants. I said when you share a life with someone, you need to take them into consideration sometimes to which he replied we arent sharing a life together, we are two individuals in a relationship (literally that morning he was talking about how he wants to spend the rest of his life with me and cant wait for our future farm and kids together) I apologised but I was really upset. He went to dinner with his parents and headed to my work xmas party. Before I left, I left him a couple of cute notes (puns left on objects around our room that essentially were another apology). Later in the night I got passive aggressive texts saying jumping into bed have a good night and then goes alone to work xmas party after fight with boyfriend, comes home after midnight *facepalm* and then when I replied saying that he said he wanted space, he was going to bed , its only 11pm and that Id be home soon he replied with I thought youd be home hours ago I cant sleep because Im wondering what youre doing and if youre safe, Ive left my phone on loud incase you got your keys so just come home soon because I cant sleep until I know youre home safe ( I was having a fantastic time with friends and wasnt planning on coming home that early until I saw his text) when I got home, he was starting at the ceiling stewing in anger. He then told me hes not responsible for my happiness and wont stand for a codependent relationship. I dont think we are co dependant, and I certainly dont feel like my well-being hinges on him or his input. This isnt the first time hes freaked out over potential co dependency. This is the only adult, serious relationship hes had, that isnt just surface level fun. Hes broken up with girls in the past when theyve become too much effort or too crazy or too needy and I fear this is how hes beginning to see me. He left for a work trip this morning angry, didnt say I love you or give me the usual sweet goodbye, which has never happened before. Ever. He says he needs to process whats happened and it was a lot for him. I cant help but feel like he has selfish ways and is trying to manipulate it so that IM in the wrong. Yes, I reacted poorly, but Im human and Im allowed to make mistakes and learn from them. Am I wrong for wanting to feel at home in his new house that he has said he wants to share? Is it fair for him to pull the co dependant card when Im just starting to get my life together here? Is he wrong for saying we dont share a life together? Usually we are great at communication, but this is on a level weve never been on before and Im really worried hes about to break up with me. But what can I do? Its out of my control and Im not going to grovel or beg someone to be with me because I had a human moment. I feel like Im being gas lit. Or manipulated or twisted into thinking that his self centred ways are okay but my reactions to them are unforgivable, deal breakers. Not to mention he tells his parents everything about our conflict and they try to get in his ear and tell him im wrong and validate his side and his existence on every level. If you made it here, thanks for reading. Needed to get that off my chest."

I really felt the need to post something right now because Im worried for my safety lately. I have previously posted about my extremely hard time trying to get my life together in simple terms. But right now, Im physically hurting. My heart and throat feel so heavy right now. I feel like Im going to have another meltdown and I have to wake up in a few hours. In October of last year I started dating the one who turned out to be the love of my life. He was the most intelligent person Ive ever met, yet I filled in those sections of knowledge he didnt have at the time. I felt whole with him. And I did everything for him, and I communicated as best as I could and he did as well. He cared so much for me that it hurts to know the outcome over a year later. Im not giving a whole recap of our relationship because its too hard for me. It repeats in my mind over and over and over and our memories are so sacred to me. Weve stuck together through so much. I made sure to never take him for granted and always reminded him how I felt about him and our future. I finally told him I was in love with him. He knew for quite sometime and I didnt expect him to get to that point of vulnerability at the same time as I did, but it didnt feel right for me to keep those feelings to myself. After a while, something changed. He felt like shit because he wasnt reciprocating all the love I gave him all the time. I understood that I needed to have patience in our relationship considering how much he would think himself in and out of things. He was brilliant, maybe too much for his own good. He loved me, and I know he did without him telling me. He treated me like he loved me. But he would try to predict too far into the future with all different outcomes and felt like he wasnt ready for our relationship and that it didnt mean he didnt care about me. That he felt like he wasnt doing enough and was tired of trying to match how I felt. I did the wrong thing and begged him to stay because I knew he was the one I wanted to spend my life with and I knew he makes most decisions with his head without thinking about what will happen his emotions, he was always more logical than me. After a while of me begging he just blurts out hes moved on and sincerely hopes I do too. This is all over text message. The love of my life left me there, fucking torn apart. Never speaking to me again. Its been almost 5 months since then and Im still fucking distraught and have come to the realization that Ill always love him, and will always want to be with him again. Im laying here thinking about the ideas Ive had to talk to him again about us and our lives. I seriously dont believe he will answer. Hes the type of guy that can suppress everything if he thinks what hes doing is the right thing. I keep thinking about why I wish I could be with him still. And he taught me how to be more logical in my actions. So probably 10+ times a day I think if it would be the right choice to talk to him. I seriously was happy with him, and we were a team and had so much potential together. But he left me. He was the one that got away and I dont think I want to share that feeling again with anyone else. Im grieving over him everyday and it makes me sick. I lost the love of my life. And he doesnt want me does he. What if he found another girl and is already happy again in a relationship after he said he thinks he would be better off alone without knowing hes hurting me. When I was with him, I loved myself before but he just completed any part of me that was missing. That feeling I had with him was something no one could ever fabricate. And theres no way I was making it up. I seriously loved him and would have done anything for him. I loved who I was with him. I was the most confident knowing how I cared about him. I admired him more than anyone. And will always know him as the best person Ive met. Im fucking broken into pieces but I feel like Ive gotten to the point of logic and I seriously know I still want to be in his life, I want to love him for the rest of mine and I dont know what to do. I cant force him to have feelings for me. But what if he does, but doesnt want to express them to me. What if hes thinking about the same things I am... Im sorry this is so long and unorganized, my suicidal thoughts and logical thoughts are being intertwined. I wish everyone in the world could experience the love I had when I was with him. Pure happiness. And now I feel like my future was taken away and no matter what I do in my life Ill always be missing the pieces he filled. I love you p, more than anything, and I hope we can be together again someday.. but in the meantime, Im destroyed. Please god help me."

I have always had people with minimal to zero empathy in my life. Since I was a kid. I am drawn to them, because they are exciting, adventurous, charismatic, unconventional, and independent. I also think I want to win their approval as they tend to be stoic and emotionally distant. I feel little self worth and I feel like if they value me I must be worth something. Even though I am attracted, they are the ones who pursue me. Perhaps they smell my sheeplike scent. My vulnerability. My ex is such a bastard. The more I reflect the more I realize how manipulative and conniving he was. I always made excuses for him. He hits me up for sex randomly and I have rejected him due to lingering feelings. He doesnt want a relationship, only sex with me. I wont do that. I tell him and that Im getting off Lithium which will worsen my already very low mood and Im worried about suicide. A very really concern. I know my mental health fairly well. He kept pushing. He said, Dont make me go to your house and pick you up. I said, No. I pleaded. Eventually, he fucked off. I feel like a moron. Why do I do this to myself. Let fucked up people hurt me. Let people who only see me as someone they can use. In his case, for a nut. I mean, he pisses me off and Im genuinely angry at this second, because he has like..so many girls chasing him. But he hits up my tree and fucks up my shit. Leave me alone, you psychopath."

Nor did I go to the last class. I havent returned since I took my lab quiz. I drank 900mg of caffeine yesterday when I rarely consume caffeine. A couple of weeks ago I tried to kill myself. Everyone knows now. Not really everyone, but a couple of people. My roommates are dating. I told them I needed to talk to someone, but then they said they dont know what I need. They walked away. I repeated it to my other roommate. They walked away into my other roommates room. I havent seen my therapists in a couple of weeks. I havent been up to much. My best friend is doing great things. I am so proud of him. My other friends are depressed. Life is hard. &amp;#x200B; I want to kill myself, but the worst part of that feeling is I know I wont. Im not feeling anything. I oddly have spoken to everyone I have felt, but I think everyone has given up. Nobody knows how to help me. I can say what I want for help and it will be ignored. I want to get a job. Work extremely excruciating hours but make a lot of money. Eventually, I save up. I leave for maybe 8 days. Long enough to see if anyone notices. I will come back to life as it always has been. As it always was. See if anyone would say anything. If they dont that will be the 2nd time I disappeared for a week with no contact and nobody was concerned. &amp;#x200B; I need to know someone to listen to the things I say. I want people to listen to me with the intent to understand me. I dont want people to listen with the intent to just care. Usually, if you ask me what is wrong I will tell you. It was naive and conceited of me to think that people listened to me the same way I do. I dont listen to people because I care about them. I listen to them because I want to better understand. &amp;#x200B; My roommate said, I thought we were closer. I understand why they said that and I immediately began to feel bad and my brain spiraled. Now I am sitting here thinking what they said was humorous. &amp;#x200B; I will tell anyone anything. I am not afraid of vulnerability. We are not close because I tell you the things I tell everyone whether they ask or if its unprompted. Everyone thinks that they are close to me because as much as I am known for my endless babble. However, I love to listen as much as I love to talk. I listen with the intent to learn more about you. It has nothing to do with how much I care about you. &amp;#x200B; Anyone who thinks Im as close to them as they are to me is fooled. Nobody will ever be close to me until they take the time to understand why I am the way I am and why I do the things I do. I can sit down and tell anyone anything they want to hear from me if Im not pissed off. I dont form close relationships. If you listened to me you would not only know that but you would understand why. The closest relationships I have ever formed are with my best friends. I talk to them about my life less than anyone I know. People who think they are close to me would be shocked by the amount I dont tell my friends about my life. I dont need to tell them anything because when they listen to understand. They know that my life is just subconscious routined chaos. Conversations are more meaningful and less needed when you are trying to understand where the person you are talking about is coming from."

I float from one hedonistic experience to the next, drugged and sexed to general contentment, but when the sharp pain of loneliness strikes spontaneously like some terrible toothache, I realize there is no one for me to turn to, that I am alone and miserable. I do this to myself. Im a charming man, easy to fall for but just barely, fleetingly. It becomes clear to women that I am a terrible choice. I am too critical of everything and everyone, myself included. The future will only bring pain, my compulsions slowly wearing down your insecurities. My friendships are as shallow as my sexual interests. My social life is a collection of cobbled together advertisements, a consumerist experiences that end in 30 seconds. Every plan I make is dashed, each summer full of cancelled reunions. I dont know if Ive ever had a meaningful conversation. I have certainly never loved. I have simply admired certain beauty within fabricated moments: fingers through the conditioned hair, the soft kiss of painted lips, the staged selfies and the momentary connection of post-coital bliss. I am obsessed with the same storybook life and love we all dream of, and I will bulldoze through everything to dream it. Like sand, these conjured images fall through my fingers, my fragile life falling out from under me. Im sinking. Yes, Im delusional enough to ignore the pain. I know how to inflate my ego. Quite so: I think I am the best, a king among men, gods gift to this world. All of it. In fact, nobody is good enough for me. And for this, I want pity. The nerve I have. When I meet someone new, as I often do, I fall immediately for the qualities they want me to see. But soon enough I notice their flaws, and these littlest things repel me. I am an awful man who demands more from the world than I am willing to give. Because I truly believe that I deserve it. Sure, I can be nice, but I would never describe myself as such. I am kind when it suits me. I am sweet when theres no cost to it. Most daily interactions are so benign that being nice is no problem whatsoever. But in deeper interactions, kindness feels like effort. Im more interested in bluntness, in devastation, in cutting through the fluff to what I think of as the truth. My world is so subjective its ridiculous. And of course I take it all as fact. I think I know everything. At the slightest opportunity, I will explain any subject to you. I love hearing myself talk. Maybe youll be impressed by my knowledge, by my confidence, and maybe even my carefully displayed vulnerability. I will get close, put my arm around you, or near your knee. Maybe you will even trust me. But make no mistake: I am evil. Spoiled. Poisoned. I am scorned by exes, have lost all of my friends. Im not invited to things, not invested, kept far from children and sharp objects. I dont know what Im capable of. Not lasting love, not commitment. Definitely of ruin. And it hurts me in the end, especially. Im a danger to myself and you and everyone else. I want to rip my own face off. I want to bleach my eyes out, to scratch myself clean until Im bloody with the scars of emotional catharsis. I want to unlearn everything thats made me this despicable human, the faulty wiring, my whole operating system. And I want to do this to you, too. I want to take all the affirmations we tell ourselves, all the little lies and hopes and false optimism and I want to deconstruct it until were left with just our own pathetically sensitive souls, our damaged egos left out in the cold. I am a black hole. I suck the life out of the world and I am always hungry, always wanting to consume people, to leave them dry and empty, feeding on what seems to me like a normal life, until they become a similar monster. I will crawl into a corner, cry for desires so damn insatiable, cry myself to sleep. I would, rather, if I had any feelings. I wish I could be different. I wish I were sweet, loving, accepting of the imperfect world around me. I wish I could be nice to myself. I want deep love and empathy and understanding in my life. It sounds so fucking pleasant: to share my thoughts and feelings and time with another breathing, thinking person. I want a hug but I dont deserve it. I have problems. I cant do it; I cannot be close to anyone. I am an island devoid of life in a tumultuous sea, made of stone. This is what it feels like to be truly and utterly alone. "

It must be fun to not only have someone at home waiting for you(or not) and all the amazing and different sex you can think of, with different people, feeling free, without boundaries, feeling unstoppable, feeling young and vigorous. What is freedom for you world? Is it something YOU define? Is it something YOU only feel? Or, is it something you've changed century to century at your own convenience? The thing is, you have a lot of people that you love and desire but not enough love or desire in your heart TO or NOT TO. I should argue that if you are willing sometimes to take others as cars and lamps then there is a problem. Swapping to find your next body. JT needs to be robotic. IT needs to take the pleasure(or lack thereof) but nothing else. No string attached. You have someone else at home. Sitting down at this dinner table with IT talking. Asking yourself why talking at all, when you can lay your hand on another fruit and bite without the whole talking and feeling thing. Just the fun. You love IT body, hair, clothes and IT seems cool and all but you don't care. It needs to be good. It needs to be worthy of your time. Emotional bond? None or minimal. When there is one, it's suppose to feel painful, it is suppose to not feel easy, it is suppose to be challenging because people are just animals and jealousy is just a social construct. Something IT choose to feel. Something rooting in IT deepest insecurities. Something IT should fight with all it might. Something IT should replace with willingness and compersion. Something IT should discuss with you days and night relentlessly to help IT feels better. Everything...you want Everything. You define the relationship. You define the dynamic. It's new. Fresh. Keeps you afloat sexually. You want the cheese, the cake, the money of the cheese and the cake. Why wouldn't you? But I'm asking myself...Is it suppose to be that hard? To always struggle in a relationship with you? Is it suppose to be so hard for you? To struggle with your own desire to seek for something else? Something new? Is it suppose to be that hard for you to feel fulfilled sexually and emotionally with us? For you to have a great intimacy without feeling the need to have someone else enter your relationship willingly or not? Without having you cheating, lying or demanding? Without you saying this oh sweet and crashing phrase ""you are not enough""? Is it suppose to be so unrealistic? Is it not possible to be in a relationship that is so great and awesome that other individual becomes not sexual beings anymore to you or potential partners but really just that...individual? Is it ok to describe a thing so intimate like sex as sport? Or to take fo example to justify your points : friendship, elementary playground or toys? Are those even comparable to romantic relationship? The next thrill, the next it factor, the next shiny thing, the next first kiss, the next first time...the next cool person that comes your way...it is never enough for you. You've become slave to your senses. I should argue that even you can feel freedom in a relationship with us. You will not feel like you are missing out. You will not feel trapped or feel like there is something missing. I think your deserve the best of the best. You deserve someone who will bring the best in you. Someone that can make you feel like you are the coolest person alive. Someone you can feel is the coolest person you will ever be with. Someone you can feel the most sexually satisfied with. Someone making you limitless. Someone that can make you going crazy sexually. Laugh like crazy. Cry like crazy. Think. Forgive. Repent. See differently. Someone making you feel whole. With us the boring days are fun and interesting. The rainy days are cozy. You go out more. Dress like yourself more. See your friends more. Go to new adventure. Accept gigs you wouldn't have accepted otherwise. You are going crazy in bed with us. Every single time it is a discovery. Your body and ours are not only connected but also our heart and more importantly our soul. Our love is becoming spiritual. We are everything and enough. As years pass the deal become greater and greater. Asking yourself how you can be so lucky. We are the most beautiful gem in your sphere. We can be ourselves in front of you. Without any barrier nor shame with vulnerability and a purpose. We are apart but the distance don't mean anything. There is no fear or doubt. There is no maybes. Is it much to think that you can find us and be mind blown by us? Is it much to want to be with us and only us? Is it much for you to think that the freedom that you had to be with others is not even comparable for your love for us? I'm sorry world but we are not furniture and more importantly not ROBOTS. We matter. We are not your next convenience thing until finding something better. We are not robots where some of our feeling should sometimes be ashamed off. We are not sex toys. Great for our expertise but thrown away when the deal is done and pick up again when it feels convenient or fun. We are not good at home, waiting for you while you have your next fling and orgasm. We are not cereals, milk, cars and nice meals. We are soul, spirit, body and more importantly spiritual being. We feel, cry sometimes, experience jealousy and insecurity, love you, act tough, love cozy days, love the rain and hate it. Planning our next tattoos, hate tattoos, love flowers(or not), hate perfume(or not), love big cities and countryside, love dogs/cats/iguanas, we don't love animals but are willing to have one just for you, we are introvert, talk loud, we always have our poker face on and people think we are cold, we love to stay home with you, go out...We love you. We really do. We love you. We love you. We love you with all out might and in our heart and bed there is no place anymore because you are already there."

I have social anxiety and honestly Im not very good at making friends because Im kind of particular about who I spend my time with. I do have two very close best friends who Ive known for 11 years but they both have significant others and other friends who they can also spend their time with. Every time I try to make plans with a friend from work I chicken out because after 20 minutes of being with them I feel like they think Im annoying, ugly and stupid &amp; theyre sick of being around me. Im currently exploring the dating world but when I talk to someone I find interest in I fear they feel the same as well. Or if things go well between us I just think of the worst. My parents divorced when I was about 10 and I have a rough relationship with one of my parents. Im naturally a pessimist when it comes to love. I want it so bad but I just dont think it exists. I see love as a flood of chemicals that our ancestors evolved to pursued us to mate and as soon as the offspring has been brought to life the intense feelings of love an passion that people had reveals itself as temporary lust that made you infatuated with someone, once you spend so much time with someone you get to see what theyre really like. I hate trying to start a relationship because I think its not gonna work out in the end anyway. Well have a couple nice months or years and then inevitably one of us will get bored or hurt and then its on to the next one. But I cant just beg my friends to spend time with me every single day once they start their lives and have families. Im going to end up alone because I fear vulnerability. I feel like everyone either hates me or theyre out to hurt me (which I completely understand is irrational because i personally have no intent on hurting people I bring into my life &amp; I cant be the only one). Im in a constant tug or war between fucking hating people, not wanting to be around them, not wanting to be vulnerable to the pain that people cause, and having so much love to give &amp; wanting to be there for someone. I dont know what to do anymore, Im tired of this."

To start off, Im a guy and i became a Christian about 4 years ago. It was great, my life became a lot better (because my life before it was mainly bullies and toxic friendships). Those experiences essentially ruined me for any future relationships, some day I had already deduced humans were not to be trusted, and that I should never EVER show any weakness to anyone. I served a lot in the church, led a group in my school even to pray. But the church youth weren't the best community. Yes, we're Christian and we're called to a higher standard of expressing love. Your enemy slaps you? People say slap them back, the Bible says turn the other cheek. But these youths in my church didn't act like it. They were there for the friends, not God. But that was till I met him, we shall call him Marcus. He was different, never cared about what people thought of him, only ever did care about seeking God and being a good Christian. Perhaps the only reason I wanted to know him better was because I was intrigued by him; All the norms I've been led to believe were true he was the opposite of them. We had a great friendship, part of me of course still would not show any vulnerability but still it was great. He helped me when I was down and he's in general, the best friend I ever had. Around last year I suspect, I developed depression. Several months ago did I finally leave the church because I had lost all hope in its people that they were capable of changing for the better. Through the months, only he bothered to meet me for dinner. I was lonely, my only contacts were the people in my church and that was gone. I was only left with him. And for once I knew 100% he could actually be trusted. Side track a little, I feel as if I am incapable of love. You can ask me to care for someone but do I feel strongly to it? No. Will I cry at anyone's funeral? I don't think so either. I blamed myself for it but I've already resigned to it. There existed absolutely no one, not friends and not family, that I could say I don't want them ever leaving my life. No one, except him. I prayed I wouldn't have to ever part with him. But see here's the thing, here's where things get complicated: I was born homosexual, and I am hopelessly in love with him. Homosexuality as most people know is not according to God's way. By that law, I could never be with him. And for that matter I just might never find a girl I can actually say I love. It. Fucking. Hurts. When I have to always meet him, knowing we can't go any further, knowing he has no intention of it either, but the thoughts don't go away. I think I'll be stuck my whole life wanting something I know I can never ever get. Next Monday I'm meeting him, and I'll tell this to him. I definitely won't be happy without him, but I'm not happy with him either. He was always so convinced there was no part of me that could scare him away. Well this is a part that scares me too. And I just might have to deal with it my whole life."

I'm writing this at sixteen years old. Still living with you and your boyfriend. I'm writing this in my bedroom, alone, crying myself to the point of hyperventilation and the lowest level you can kick a person down to. Right at this moment, this is my sanctuary. This is my place where I can express the fragile position of my mental statemy raw emotion. The funny thing is that you were never that place *once* in my entire life. No, really. You never were. You were never my mother. You were never my parent or my safe-zone. You know what you were? Damage control. That's possibly the *best* thing I'm willing to call you. Anything else would be absurdly offensive, and with confidence, I can say that I'll never be dragged down to your level to say such things. I'm not you. And I don't want to be a part of you anymore. Throughout my childhood, up until age eleven or twelve, you lied to me. Better yet, I lied to myself as well. You and I were able to convince me that you *were* my safe-zone. And maybe... maybe you were. But it was in all the wrong ways. You never taught me how to do anything for myself, yet you were the same person to turn right around like a monster underneath the mask of a mother to abuse that. Belittle me. Leave me feeling like a shell without you at the end of the day because I didn't know how to clean up my own messes, fold my own clothes, or just make my own choices to learn and grow without you at my side to make them for me instead. And whenever I made an accomplishment on my own, from the rarity that was my own choice, you were so quick to take the credit for yourself. All of this sounds very vague. There's so much to unpack, and that's why I'm doing this right now rather than later, because I can only hope and pray that at the time you receive this letter, I'm at a better place in my life and I've forgotten all of this like it was just a bad dream. Maybe I'm eighteen, nineteen, twenty... hell, even thirty. Hopefully I'm with the man (or woman, but you'd never accept that) of my dreams, in an apartment or house of my own, working the job I fantasized about since I was a little girl, going to sleep every night peacefully and waking up without the embedded fear in me anymore. I won't be waking up with a startle, a pounding heart, going through this instinctual checklist of all the things I could have done the day before that may make you hate me a little more than usual today. My point is, when you receive this letter, I *need* to be in a stable place. I need to comfortably and confidently tell myself that I don't need you anymore. That I made it. That I'm worth it. That nothing you said or did all those years before matters now. I don't know if it's humbling or depressing that the only thing I ever wanted in this world was to answer with a certain, unbroken attitude when someone asks me, ""Hey, are you doing okay?"" You wanted to be the most important role in my life. And that's understandable, of course. But what made it an issue for the both of us was when you abused that power. Going back to the point that I made earlierfor just a minuscule exampleyou never taught me how to perform basic needs, and you took it as a surprise when I'd be this thirteen-year-old girl who didn't do anything for herself and still depended on you. You did all of it for me then verbally abused me if I asked for something or didn't do something on my own. You called me every name or insult in the book, dissolved me down to a sobbing mess, and took your role as damage control to coddle me until I shut up. Those constant apologies were nothing more than a prime example of you wanting to keep me on that tightrope of vulnerability, slipping between the two voids on either side of the tightrope that were ""I'm alright"" and ""I'm not alright"". You wanted me to forgive you as to not become astray to your abuse, but you wanted me to be angry just enough to use it against me and make me feel horribly guilty for your flaws that you have never, not even once, have made an effort towards addressing or fixing. You know why? Because you're a narcissist through-and-through. Those apologies were absolute bullshit. The excuses you gave me were absolute bullshit. If you're sorry for making a mistake, you try your damned hardest to never do it again. You were careless with the words you used, the choices *you* made, and how all of it would affect me. I cannot bring myself to list out all of the things you've done to hurt me and damage me on an emotional level that despite me acknowledging perfectly, I still give in to it because in the exact moment that you're abusing me, I believe you. I recall one morning in particular when I was fourteen. The night before, you blamed me for my sister not wanting to talk to you anymore; something that wasn't even my fault. She didn't want to talk to you anymore because she, too, was raised like me. And if she was able to break free from your abuse and develop a life of her own, then I know I can do it too. She could see what you were doing to me, went off on you for it, and that was somehow *my* fault. Ties were cut. You screamed in my face for a good twenty or thirty minutes until I was reduced to that very familiar state where I'm shaking, sobbing, hyperventilating, and pleading with you very quietly to *just stop and leave me be so I can calm down.* You understand that I physically can't talk when I'm upset because my brain gets to such a traumatized state that all functions shut down and my face gets tingly. You caused that to happen. You, my alcoholic father that you failed to protect me from, and my heroin-addicted, low-life brother who used me for drug runs and his own sexual gratification when he was high (including my sisters) whom you hold on this pedestal along with the rest of our bat-shit fucking crazy family. He's stolen, lied, hurt your own daughters, and he somehow can do no fucking wrong? Honestly, fuck you. But I digress. After telling me that night to kill myself, calling me names, bringing up other incidents to shame me for, making fun of my appearance, etc., I had a good twelve hours to let all of that sit with me. And in the morning, before you were leaving for ""work"", I decided to listen to you like I always have. I believed that at fourteen fucking years old, I was nothing but a mistake and that I had no purpose for being in this world. That wasn't the first times I've had a suicide attempt, but that was the first time it truly put in perspective how little of a fuck you give about me. The last thing I remember going through my head was the time you told me my father was right for choosing alcohol over me, and how you agree with him when he says you two should have aborted me. That's when I swallowed a bunch of sleeping pills. I don't know how much I took. It was more than a handful. I remember salivating on the floor, barely conscious, and in a lot of pain. You woke up and found me on that bathroom floor. And guess what you did? You kicked me in the head and dragged me back to my bedroom. Threw me on my bedroom floor instead and proceeded to yell at me. You said I was *worse* than my brother. I was messed up for a couple of days. But I still believed you when you hugged me and pet my hair and love-bombed me with these promises of spending time together, which was really all I ever wanted from you growing up. That never happened. It never happens. I think I've been asking you since I was eight years old to just sit down and watch a movie with me. It's always an angry response, a half-assed excuse, or purely you not wanting to be around me. You tell me you have no time for me, but I've watched you my whole life, sitting on the couch, smoking cigarette after cigarette and making me feel like a ghost in the room. Fuck you for being this emotionally unavailable asshole my whole life. Fuck you for telling me at every chance you got that I wasn't good enough, that I will never be good enough. Fuck you for keeping me from opportunities I would have loved to take. Fuck you for never being there and being the same person to pin me against the wall when I made a mistake. Fuck you for never loving me and being surprised when I went to complete strangers online at thirteen years old because even if they all were using me, it still felt a lot better to have one person say ""I love you"" and pretend to mean it than hearing it from someone who can't say it without sounding and feeling so utterly, bullshittingly fake. Fuck you and my dad for fucking up all of my past, current, and future relationships with romantic partners, friends, and family because I'm too drained and terrified to let another person inside. On top of that, fuck you for immediately jumping into a relationship with another man who treated me no differently than my father when I was still repairing from that whole ordeal and trying to force me into calling him ""dad"". Fuck you for replacing me with him altogether. Fuck you for fucking me over. And on that topic, *fuck you* for hurting my boyfriend. As of me writing this, I've been with him for over two years and he is the sweetest, most loving guy I have ever met, and I still flinch when he reaches to hug me because I have that reflex of expecting someone to hurt me. It's still foreign to me, two and a half years later, that he's there to hug me and tell me that he's there and that everything will be okay when I have night terrors or PTSD attacks from everything you've put me through. It's foreign to me that someone can and will genuinely love me for who I am. Not what I can give, not what role I can play to make them look better. I've said this before. But all I have ever wanted from you was to be there for me. To love me unconditionally. To accept me until the very end through my accomplishments, through my personal beliefs, through my mistakes and my highs and lows. I wanted to spend time with you. I wanted to feel like your daughter and not your emotional support animal. I wanted to feel like you were my rock when I was crying over something and needed that motherly support. I wanted to feel like I could go to you about anything and everything, but instead I spent all of my teenage years being mature beyond my age out of force. I never liked it when someone said I was wise beyond my years. It wasn't fair. I just wanted the chance to be a fucking kid and you absolutely, one-hundred-percent yanked that from me. I just wanted you to love me and understand my pain. If you're receiving this letter, you'll know that I've accepted that is something that I'll never have. You'll know that I can close my eyes and not wish death or ill meaning on myself for not having a mother who cared. If you're receiving this letter, you'll know that I've finally made it without you. And that I'm okay. I hope with every fiber of my being that I can get to that point someday."
189,vulnerability,offmychest,my past continues to haunt me,1,eg9kfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/eg9kfy/my_past_continues_to_haunt_me/,2019-12-27 21:23:40,"I am a 21 y/o female. I have been through pretty much everything. I thought I was coping well for a while but the last few weeks have brought on some serious emotions and I needed to put these thoughts somewhere. For the past 7 or so years I've been severely depressed and have dealt with anxiety as well. While I have never been in a better place mentally this past year, I am in a new relationship of \\\~5 months and the vulnerability of this is difficult. My life story, as short as I can possibly make it. I was born to a 17 yo mom and an abusive dad. Dad went to jail multiple times when I was a kid, for hitting me and my mom and selling drugs. He was in and out my whole life. Haven't spoken to him in almost 10 years. I was sexually abused by my uncle when I was \\\~2-3 years old and still have vivid memories of what happened. I grew up around drugs, alcohol, and have had guns pointed at my head when my dad couldn't pay his suppliers. My mom divorced him and remarried my step-dad when I was 7. He was great, until he lost his job in 2008. Both parents were alcoholics and my step-dad (whom I call dad to this day) became verbally abusive, calling me name, saying i was a hooker when I was 14 and tried makeup for the first time or would wear a dress. He would scratch my back sometimes and would touch me where I wasn't comfortable, but I would pretend I was asleep. I'm not sure if that actually happened to this day actually. My mom and him divorced when I was in high school, and I moved 7 different places from when I was a freshman to end of sophomore year after cutting off contact with my step-dad. Me (F15 at the time) and my siblings (M13) and (F8) shared 2 blow up mattresses in the attic. My mom wanted me to transfer schools, so I decided to move in with my friend and her mom. I was with her for two years and it was great, safe, and stable. I got a boyfriend, who was also emotionally abusive and gaslighted me and treated me like shit for 5 years, displaying every addiction problem in the book, lying to me constantly, and making me feel like the crazy one. My mom is now divorced for the third time in June and spent Christmas with a new boyfriend. We don't speak. I was in therapy and on anti-depressants/anxiety medications for a while to cope with all of these things. Around a year ago, I stopped these things and found that I was able to handle it on my own. I learned to come to peace with my past, my absent parents, and lack of stability in my life. However, with a new relationship in my life where I need to be vulnerable and my past being a crucial part of who I am, I am reliving all of these things as it's important my boyfriend understands why I am the way I am. I find myself slipping back into feeling bad about all of these things again. I just want to be normal and mentally healthy. 2 months ago I had an interaction with a woman in a bar where she forced me to feel her fake breasts to see if they felt natural, and it triggered all of the abuse in my past. My boyfriend knows about most of these things but I feel pathetic for not being able to cope again. I was doing so good and feel like everything is slipping out of reach. I love my boyfriend dearly but fear that I'm too much baggage for anyone to handle. I almost want to end things simply so I don't have to continue to be weak in front of someone else. I just want to feel normal. I wish these things wouldn't have happened to me. I feel so lonely and like no one will ever get me."

191,vulnerability,offmychest,I'm a bad daughter,1,ehavk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ehavk6/im_a_bad_daughter/,2019-12-30 07:18:33,"And the worst part is I didn't realize it until today. On the contrary, I thought that I was the perfect daughter to the extent that I wouldn't mind having a daughter that has the exact set of qualities that I have. Yep, the arrogance was (or lol IS because I'd still love to have myself as my daughter, considering the pros and cons) in THAT level. I used to joke that people can't blame me for feeling entitled (*spoiler alert* yep, that's the main problem here, eNtiTLeMent) because I had thought that my siblings set the bar pretty low that it isn't that hard to be the best. You see, my sister took 10 years to finish college; and it wasn't because she was stupid or irresponsible (okay, maybe she was a little irresponsible) but because she had a couple of turns in her life before she got her degree. First turn, she fell in love with the wrong guy-- and when I say wrong, I don't mean those sexy but good-for-nothing douchebags that we see on rom-coms. When I say wrong, I mean those sickos that gaslight and (emotionally AND physically) hurt women. Yep, the kind that almost always ends up dead on psychological thriller films. Second turn, she married the said wrong guy. Third turn, she got pregnant by the same wrong guy. Fourth turn, she finally hit her head and realized that she had enough, so she brought her baby with her and left the wrong guy. Last turn, she got pregnant AGAIN, and this time, by a different wrong guy, who thankfully didn't stay that long in her life. My brother, on the other hand, was 1/2 a stereotypical middle child. I'm guessing that he wasn't able to become a full fledged middle child poster boy because he's an unico hijo or the only son; so my theory is that the attention he got from being the only son kind of offset his middle child syndrome tendency. Like my sister, my brother's journey to finishing school was also far from conventional. He's a good man and he treats everyone with the same kindness and respect. This means that he didn't choose his friends, and he had his own turns in life with those friends. In fact, he had so many turns that I cannot summarize them in the same way that I summarized my sister's. Let's just say that he had so much angst that he could very well fit in as a character in Skins. Also, did I mention that he has 5 children with different people? And he hasn't even reached his 30s. Yep, he's not a rockstar, but he's living the dream. My siblings have colorful lives, to say the least. Their lives are the kind the becomes immortalized in movies or, at least, in a 3-episode tv special, whereas mine is what people usually perceive as ""normal."" I'm a smart kid-- not the kind that gets awards or medals, but smart enough to get into top universities and make it out alive, i.e., smart enough to not be disowned by asian parents. So, yep, I finished school ""on time,"" and I'm now pursuing my postgrad degree. It's also worth mentioning that I still don't have kids, I've never done drugs, I rarely drink, and I rather stay home and waste my youth than go out. So, yep, I'm pretty much living the dream of every asian parent out there-- or so I thought. I've watched my parents deal with the craziness (believe me, it was so crazy that one time my parents thought my sister gone insane that they almost had her confined in a mental asylum) of my siblings' lives since I was a kid. In this situation where everyone in the family has issues to deal with, what would a true good child do? Be the ray of sunshine, right? I mean that's what the good girls in movies always do, right? And yet I did the exact opposite. Since I was ""normal"" and my parents put up with the craziness of my siblings, I felt that I am entitled to the patience that my parents have in handling my siblings more than anyone. This idea made sense to me and I even did the math. I am less crazy than my siblings, so this means I am entitled to be subjected to a higher threshold than them. I love being the ""normal"" kid, so I didn't do anything too crazy and I maintained the ""basics"" of being normal: I studied well enough, I didn't do drugs, and I didn't get pregnant. So what made me a bad daughter? The little things. First, I'm lazy and I only help around the house if I'll gain a direct benefit from it. This is shameful considering that I'm a jobless girl living with and depending on her parents, and yet I felt entitled to be lazy because aT lEaST I'M iN scHOOl aNd NOt doInG DRuGs. Second, treating my parents with respect was a conscious effort on my part. I've witnessed my sister repeatedly abused my parents' love, so I thought the I could do the same; and I was right. I am indeed capable of abusing that love, and I did. Our parents love us so much and they made it clear that they will love us no matter what. Instead of being grateful and reciprocating that love, I took advantage of my parents vulnerability and exploited it whenever I needed to. Thirdly, I intentionally did crazy things. I had this thinking, which in hindsight is pretty dumb, that since my parents are used to my siblings' acting out, my parents will only listen to me if I express myself with the same level of intensity as my siblings' crazy outburst; and that became my language whenever I wanted my parents to understand certain things about me. Initially, it was just a method of making my parents listen (or getting what I want), but it eventually became a part of me, it became me. Lastly, I thought that I know better than my parents, and it didn't matter to me if being right or ""winning"" means hurting my parents' feelings. My mom often tells me that I'm self-righteous-- she's not wrong. I can get opinionated especially when it comes to matters involving my family. Since I turned out to be the ""normal"" one among us three, I felt that my opinion matters more; and I wasn't afraid to express what I feel and think even if it's already hurting the people I love. Yep, I acted entitled for a quarter of my life just because I am ""normal."" Wow. Now, that I've put that into text, it sounds more stupid that I originally thought. I also realized just now-- as in just I was typing the last 2 sentences-- that I didn't realize that I suck at being a daughter ""today."" I've always known that what I'm doing is not right, but I was in denial. I'd always justify my shortcomings by comparing myself to how ""worse"" others are and by thinking that my ""achievements"" or ""normality"" compensated for my ""little"" mistakes. Little did I know that those little mistakes accumulated over time and became a part of me. Those mistakes occurred too often that I can no longer distance myself from them by pretending that ""oh, that wasn't me, I was just overwhelmed."" I didn't plan this. Yes, I thought I was entitled to the higher threshold, but I never wanted to exceed that threshold and be this entitled brat who can't properly love the people who matter the most."

Sending it still seemed like a bad idea though. So getting it off my chest here! \---------------------------------- Hey X, Long time no speak! First things first: I hope that you're happy and living the life you'd always wanted. I really mean that. That said, I'm not going to pretend that this an email I've written to convey greetings and well wishes. But I think you already knew that. I guess with the passing of years, I've become keenly aware that the old platitude ""time heals all wounds"" isn't necessarily true. These past few years have tried and tested me in ways I could never have envisaged. But that was just the catalyst that led me to accept that I've had a far more difficult life and endured more trauma than I really ever allowed myself to admit, mainly from my childhood. I've grown aware of the emotions that I'd been sweeping under the carpet. Now, with insight that I wish I'd had when I was 19, I understand that that's where that torrent of intensity came from when it came to... er, whatever you wanna call what happened between us. I chuckle to myself in disbelief and genuinely feel terrible for forcing 18-year-old X to confront that. I was completely unaware of where it came from and how to handle it. I'm so sorry I put you in such a position. It was too much to deal with. My mother and brother told me, ""S, you're too much. You scared him away."" I think they were right. After we established a level of mutuality of sentiment, I starting pinning all of the hope I'd been carrying around for years on you. Way to put pressure on you... Apologies. In my heart of hearts, I believed I could have had the life and relationship I'd only dreamed of with you. And despite the many guys who'd shown interest in me, I've never felt that before (nor ever since, sadly). In defence of my naivety, though, I was sincere in my intentions to make your happiness my personal responsibility. I have always been extremely guarded when it comes to my deepest emotions; it's not something many, if any, get to learn. Unfortunately, I chose to be completely vulnerable when it came to you because I thought I could trust you to treat me with care. And while in those earlier days when we had an open dialogue, you really did, it didn't stay that way. I know I have vaguely alluded to how much you hurt me in some previous message, but I never properly expressed what I felt because you never let me. And here is where I request your help because there is a legitimate purpose to this email: you completely stonewalled me after I'd spent so long being in love with you. I would love to hear your side of events, your thoughts, conclusions, etc. Because sometimes (admittedly, more frequently since I live alone in a foreign country where English isn't commonly spoken) I find myself stewing over the searing resentment I feel towards you. I fell in love with you because of your outstanding qualities, which is why I'm always so puzzled as to how you left things the way you did. You sought and accepted my attention after I'd made clear that I was in love with you. You'd left things open-ended, clearly stating that the problem was that you weren't in the position to be in a relationship. In fact, it's branded in my mind when you said that if the situation was different, all lights would be green. That you regretted things coming to the fore when they did because you felt that excluded you from the right to ask for another chance, which you said was so hard because I ""could be the one."" Ouch. How on earth was I supposed to safeguard my heart from a line like that? Then to go from such soaring heights, to be passed on the message that you 'moved on'? With no explanation. No tying of loose ends. No letting me ask questions or try and understand it. No telling me personally. The fact you finally decided you didn't want me was hugely disappointing, yes, but still digestible. The rest of it was the worst part. Before you write me off as being crazy, take a moment to really consider how cruel that was. A couple of years back, I was being pushed into a marketing role I didn't want. When the team thought I was going for the orientation, it was actually the first opportunity I had to personally state that I wasn't able to accept the position. I was so nervous I could have passed out. But saying it in person just seemed like the professional and 'right' thing to do; out of respect for the opportunity and the people presenting it to me. From when the idea was first proposed to when I personally declined was one and a half weeks. And I gave clear reasons, explaining how the position was not the career move I was seeking. I honestly cannot understand how two years of having me on a string didn't afford me any of the same courtesies. It's so hurtful because you're this outstanding example of a human - and yet I clearly was not worth your time or consideration at all. All that trust and vulnerability - which felt like 'me' - I'd given to you meant nothing. I tried to make sense of it. Maybe it was because I was nothing more than a pretty face that you grew tired of having to treat as a human. Other times, it makes me so mad that you got to be so reckless and get off scot-free. That it's ridiculous that you're preaching about love when you heartlessly snubbed me. Or perhaps it's that you judged me to be a waste of time and not good enough. It's an irrational and painful vacillation between burning anger and the deepest feelings of inadequacy. Which is correct? All? None? This is what I struggle with. I feel horrible for harbouring resentment. I hate not knowing what the truth of it was from your perspective. Were you too scared to confront me? Why? Was it too overwhelming? Did you happen to forget that I might warrant a little more consideration? Were you too exhausted by it? I have so many questions. Do you remember things differently and disagree with me? Tell me. I really want to understand your mind, because there must be reasons to justify your actions. I want to forgive you. In fact, I have already. Many times. But since you sorta obliterated most of my self-confidence, it's a wound that cut deep. It amazes even me how many times it splits back open. I'm hoping having a little more details will allow for proper closure. Don't feel too bad, though. It was a perfect storm of our mutual lack of experience. I was extremely foolish in my approach and was embarrassingly wide-eyed. It's the sad truth that my excitement and loyalty enabled your actions to hurt me. My psyche ultimately isn't your problem, though. I know that. You don't even have to reply to this if you don't want to. It's a lot to process. I've ummed and ahhed for so long on whether or not I should even send this. My guilty conscience is the primary motivator. So too is the knowledge that this happened all so long ago and our lives progress. If I'd heard you were dating, sending anything like this would feel improper. And it wouldn't surprise me if that wound up being sometime soon. I really don't get kicks out of bothering you, but I figured there's a 0% chance of you responding to an email I don't send and getting your version of events would really help. The good thing is that there really isn't anything I feel I have left to say (finally), so you won't have to hear from me again. And yet, despite everything, I still care for you very much and want the very best for you. Thanks for the wonderful memories of better times, S"

Don't get me wrong, I go out: I socialize at parties, I've burrowed into the social circle at work, and I thrive when conversing in person (until vulnerability becomes a thing: then I just try and steer the conversation away to stop the pressure in my chest from exploding into a dissociative episode): I just don't create lasting connections. I don't know what to say in the in-betweens, which, now that society lives most of its life online, leaves me with having *met* a lot of incredible people and perhaps even seeing them more than once, but *knowing* none of them.

It really doesn't help my goals or prospects, either: I've had a passion for both writing prose and music that has been begging for release for years, and yet as I create I no longer live in the present/enjoy the process of creation, but rather think ahead and fantasize about my art opening the door to finding some sort of community, only to succumb to self-doubt and lose interest in just about all of my projects within the week. In a way, I give too much of a fuck not just about what people think (I'll even hold off on rehearsing a part out of fear of my roommate hearing me fail), but about having someone there to begin with. The thought of creating something that will never be heard or seen by anyone is terrifying now, even though deep inside there's a voice that knows that if I somehow figure out how to base my creative process in the present again, I'll be able to share finished projects with the world somehow. The thought of being vulnerable about my failures, about my creations, about my goals, and, ultimately, about the person that I really am terrifies me, because with it comes the fear of giving others power over me. It's paradoxical, even, and yet I don't know what to do anymore. I can still smile, I still go to work, pay my bills, and create rough sketches of the things that I've always wanted to create, if not for myself, to inspire others... but frankly, I'm beginning to wonder if there's anything other than hopelessness on the road ahead. If anyone who reads this knows something that might help, or even relates to this experience somehow, from somewhere in the world, please feel free to comment. I've never told this to absolutely anyone, and, at this point, I can only hope that it somehow makes me or someone like me feel less alone."
199,vulnerability,offmychest,My best friend cant say no,1,duwf4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/duwf4t/my_best_friend_cant_say_no/,2019-11-12 05:20:41,"I love my best friend, I really do, but I have realised that she has a problem with saying no to things. Lets call her E. E recently brought up the fact that one of her friends is having a birthday party. We quickly find out that this friend has a history of being manipulative and generally toxic, so we tell her. We point out specifically that this friend has tried to convince her to stop being friends with us because they think theyre funny and they look disgusting among other things. E told us that shes only said it once and shes sure she didnt mean it. E also says that the party hosted by her friend will feature some other people, who we are pretty certain come from a bad crowd (though we dont know them personally). She says how they were talking about excessive drug use and drinking for the party, so we asked her if she was comfortable with being at a party with that kind thing around her. E said she wasnt comfortable with it and said she doesnt want to go to the party but shell feel bad about not going because her friend (the host) misses her. E said I cant just say no to her, to which we replied yes you absolutely can, then told her about how its always good to know when to say no, especially when dangerous things like drugs are involved. We said that she could get into a lot of trouble if she finds herself just going along with what other people are doing (with illegal stuff). E has also confided in me about a guy in her class who has a weird obsession with hugging her, or making any sort of platonic physical touch. Ive seen him pick her up by the waist and carry her out of a room once, and she told me that she hates when he does it and is clearly very uncomfortable about it. I told her that she absolutely has to tell him to stop and that it makes her uncomfortable, to which she replied Yeah but I feel bad...he doesnt even do it every day anymore. There are other occasions which I wont need to mention because they tell pretty much the same story. She lets a lot of people trample over her because she feels bad about standing up for herself and saying no. I, among the rest of our group, have repeatedly told her how she needs to stand up for herself and understand that its okay to say no to somebody, but she never seems to have the confidence to. Im actually really worried that shell end up getting into some serious trouble just because she didnt want to say no to something, but Im not her parent and I dont know what else I can do to help her. I really dont want anything bad to happen to her but I dont want to be controlling because she obviously has the right to make her own decisions. Is there anything I, or us as a group, can do to make sure she overcomes her vulnerability?"

I'm a 29 y/o guy, 6'1, big stocky build, but I'm usually shy, have the social knowledge of a late teenager, Autistic/Asperger's, confidence isn't great, have a love/hate relationship with myself. It takes so much courage to approach someone I like, but more times than not I hate the vulnerability I put myself in. A lot of times I wish I was shorter, softer looking, more lanky, anything to be less looking like I have ill intentions or an aura of weirdness. What I'm saying is I hate that I can't control the way I was born. I hate that I look so masculine looking. I've been in failed relationships before, and now I know what I really want, I want to fall in love with my best friend and sex is not fulfilling. I really wish I could get this across to someone that I really like, that what I really want is true love and not lust."

Nothing feels right. Nothing feels okay anymore. I haven't self-harmed in a few days, but I've been eating way too much and I can't get normal, good, restful sleep. I passed out on the phone at 8 PM, feeling the lowest I had in about a week. Then I woke up at 1:15. It's now almost 3 AM and I still can't sleep. It's not that it's never been this bad. I've never been able to sleep ""normally."" But right now it's been so much worse and I'm so tired of not being able to get a break. Sitting in bed and tossing and turning is my hell, lately. I am so fucking tired. I'm tired of not being able to sleep, I'm tired of feeling so shitty. I'm tired, my mental state is a ticking time bomb. One minute it's fine, then boom, I'm feeling so, so, incredibly low. Sometimes it's the smallest thing that triggers it, and sometimes nothing brings it on. I don't know which is worse. I keep beating myself up over so much shit. ""If you'd just change this..."" ""If you were different then this would be different"" ""You're unhappy and it's all your fault"" ""Your therapist is right, you're to blame, all of this is your choice"" I just need a break. It's exhausting. I want to cry. I just want to cry. But it feels like I have nobody to go to. It's not like I need someone for the attention or the validation, but everyone around me tries to give me solutions or doesn't take me seriously, or adds to all the shit and says it's my fault. Sometimes I just want to go to someone I care about, someone that cares about me, and just fucking vent about things and receive comfort. I don't think I can remember more than 2 occasions that my mom ever held me and comforted me when I was feeling like shit. My dad's never done it. My brother was there for me with that shit here and there but more often than not, he's one of those that's always trying to fix me. It's always followed by advice and options. Maybe I don't want options! Maybe I just want to fucking cry and hear that you're here for me. Sometimes I just want to complain and know that you can hear me. It's not a matter of feeling unloved, or unlovable. I feel like I'm not receiving what I need. Sure, everyone needs tough love, everyone needs advice, everyone needs options, everyone needs that here and there. But that's all I get. And the worst part is that while I type all this, part of me just feels that I'm being too whiny. That I'm just picky and choosy and can't make up my mind or settle for what I get. I feel like I'm just not capable of receiving love and I don't know why. It's an exhausting cycle. I don't feel loved because I don't receive it. I don't receive it because I don't know how to. I don't know how to because I have no experience with it. I have no experience with it because it scares me so I push it away. It's an exhausting cycle that I just don't know how to break. So I just isolate myself. No feelings, no emotions, nothing of the sort. Because that means vulnerability, and vulnerability means getting hurt. I can't get hurt more. I don't want to. So I don't even invite the opportunity for it to happen. I'd much rather feel alone with shallow relationships all around me than feel vulnerable with a few people close to me. I also just don't want to be annoying and chase someone off. Another thing I always think about is that other people have feelings, other people can say or do whatever they want. I tell myself ""It's not their fault if I overthink that. I can't be mad about it. Just because they said that they have nobody they want to hang out with doesn't mean that they hate you."" But it never seems to work, because although I know that, I don't feel that. I just feel like shit, but I'm trying to do better. I am. I'm tired and I feel alone and lost and I still feel like shit. I wish this would just end already. I feel like nobody is going to read this or care about any of it. I don't know why I decided to write it up. It's 3 in the morning and I'm talking to myself. I might delete it later, I might keep it up. Who knows, maybe it'll help someone else."
202,vulnerability,offmychest,Tired of being at war with myself,1,dwnycz,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dwnycz/tired_of_being_at_war_with_myself/,2019-11-15 19:38:56,"I have this compulsive need in me to be good, to deny my shortcomings and my potential for cruelty and malice. I refuse to admit it or look at it. I grew up with a sense that I had been rejected by the world - kids at school would bully me because Im quiet and that made me an easy target. My dad resented me and was always unhappy. Nothing I did seemed to please him or make him feel better. I wanted his friendship but he never offered it. This cauldron of feelings made me act in a way I deeply regret when I was 16. Its something my family found out about, and its been sitting on my heart ever since. It made me withdraw socially. I couldnt let people know what I did. Ive never been in a sexual relationship, just a few encounters. Intimacy and vulnerability scare the complete shit out of me. Its been choking me alive for 17 years. Its like I gave myself ptsd. I lost my innocence and Ive been trying to buy it back ever since. Ive only ever had my physical health and my career - something Ive wanted to do since I was little. Its my only achievement in life. It means nothing. I take all my anger and squeeze it into a little ball in the centre of my stomach. Ive been doing it for 17 years. Im done. My dad didnt hate me - he hated himself. He didnt meet his own standards because something haunted him as well. His father was killed when was very young. He didnt know how to be a dad. I did what I did because I was emotionally repressed and deeply resentful of a world I thought had rejected me. I let it turn me into a monster. I can be a true monster - the worst kind - if circumstances allow for it. I know I will turn into my dad if I let myself. I will become a resentful, angry monster who cant accept himself, and I will take it out on those around me. I need my special person - someone to live with, to forgive me, to listen to my side and accept it. To help me heal. I dont know who that person will be, but I hope shes out there. Ive been here before. It didnt work out with her and I ran away. I couldnt face it. It was too much. I ruined relationships over it. I hated myself for it. I couldnt be strong, for her or myself. I dont want to be weak. I want to be strong. But I cant do it alone. I have to brave the truth, and hope she forgives me. Hope that she accepts me. Hope that she has unconditional love for a monster like me. Do those people exist? Can I get everything I want out of life, guilt free? Do I deserve my happiness? Or do I need to pay more penance?"
203,vulnerability,offmychest,I dont talk about my trauma so everyone assumes I never experienced any.,1,dx2rki,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dx2rki/i_dont_talk_about_my_trauma_so_everyone_assumes_i/,2019-11-16 16:27:27,"So lately Ive been into a lot of mental health places. In all of them they obviously want to know what you do and why. I can talk about the whats but I always shit down on the explanations. I dont know why, its just easier for me to lie and pretend everything is fine than to have to deal with they crying and the flashbacks and the helplessness and vulnerability and feeling like the worlds crumbling around you and no where is safe. I mean whenever I talk about it or think about it or sometimes I just have to hear something that reminds me of it( which I dont want to talk about because it will send me into one of these) I feel like Im back in the moment when it all happened. Its a problem I mean I cant sleep, I go through a lot of different moods of depression and inexplicable anger. Now Ive been diagnosed with a bunch of things that arent true because the whole time I just lie. Or not really lie I just deny everything and try to make it seem like Im fine. So now they put me on medication for something I dont have and no one will believe me if I say anything now. Or maybe they would, but I dont want to have a fucking meltdown in the doctors office so I dont know what to do. And I could deal with all of this, but its mostly the people. I have to go to these groups and I was having problems with drugs which is what got me into this whole mess in the first place. I dont tell them all the problems with my family, I dont tell them what theyve done to me cause I dont need their pity. I can deal with it myself. But then theres always some asshole who likes to act like they know me and who talks about how Im hurting my fucking loving family. Right. Like Im some typical selfish teenager going through some rebellion thing and doing all this shit for kicks. Just because I dont whine about my life or how hard its been because its hirts too fucking much because Id rather just pretend it didnt happen at least in public so I dont have a breakdown. But K cant sleep I cant focus in school cuz it keeps looping in my mind and I cant get it out I just want to fucking kill myself to get it out of my fucking head. I wish there was a way I could rip it out somehow or just blow my brains out. Whenever it happens I just want to hurt myself enough to get it out and I dont know what to do. It doesnt help when people tell me I should be grateful or act like I have no reason for doing what I do or act like they know shit about me. This one girl basically said I hadnt been through anything and I didnt know what it was like. She was one of those annoying people who whine about all this stupid ass bullshit constantly and think it means no one can say anything mean to them cuz one time their mom hit them or something. It just made me so angry because she doesnt know me or what Ive been through but because Im not whining about it she, and the rest of the world I guess, dont think it happened. All these places have only made me feel worse. They just make me feel even more alone. I was better off by myself. Thats what I keep telling everybody and I guess thats part of the reason they think that too. Well if you wanna go home I guess your home lifes not so bad No I wanna go home because then I can fucking shoot up every time I get those flashbacks. And I can sneak out. And I can run away when I want. And Im lying my ass off anyway. Not to mention Ive dealt with it all these years and Ill deal with it now. I dont want help and I dont want to talk about it, but that doesnt mean I dont need help. Sorry if this was long I was just kind of ranting."
204,vulnerability,offmychest,Any self confidence I had is gone.. my sexual inadequacies led to my only real relationship ending,1,dxksas,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dxksas/any_self_confidence_i_had_is_gone_my_sexual/,2019-11-17 20:59:13,"(this has specifics about sex and self harm and stuff. Parts are pretty graphic/gross) Last time I cut was a suicide attempt. For some reason it's easy to stop cutting after a suicide attempt for a bit. Anyways. I rode that momentum and resisted for a year and 1 month now, but the urges were never this strong. I lost all the self esteem I've spent so long building up. This was my first real relationship. I thought I was unlovable for the longest time and now I am convinced of that again. I'm so embarrassed. The specifics of the breakup are gnawing at me. I try to ride out the emotions, let the thoughts pass. Tonight however my roommate and his girlfriend were fucking upstairs and I could hear them. I really didn't want to. I couldn't try to help but think about it. I was never able to satisfy her. She had a very high sex drive in the beginning of our relationship then it decreased markedly. See I was on Zoloft when I first met her. However it didn't help with my depression much, and after a myriad of other drugs, ECT, inpatient stays, and frequent therapy I'm now on a a completely different regiment. The problem is SSRIs are exceptional at treating one of the main reasons she found me inadequate. When I first met her I could last a long time. I can only last for a minute now, if that. There were times it was only 10 seconds. I don't know why I'm like this. I've tried pretty much everything but only SSRIs had a consistent effect, weed helped a lot too but I don't want to only be able to perform high it makes me paranoid. Alcohol helps a bit but not enough and again I want to be able to function in a relationship without drinking before sex. She doesn't like oral, but no matter how I used my fingers it was never a replacement for her. She would laugh every time when I came and say ""that's it? Already?"" Or ""so fast."" It wasn't just a giggle, it was deep uncontrollable laughter. I talked to her about the laughing and she said we need to be able to laugh about it (I see the logic behind that but the laughs still cut deep). I ended up continuing after I came without any breaks so she would think I lasted longer. I did this until I was completely soft and couldn't anymore. Sex was incredibly embarrassing for me and I resented myself more and more. I'm not a real man. It's incredibly pathetic. This wasn't the only way I was inadequate however. I was not very experienced before the relationship and she said I'm a bad kisser. I'm a skinny guy, and what she called ""pure."" I'm a considerate person. I think most people who hate themselves are. I'm not very manly. I like reading, drawing, cooking. I'm usually vegan because I wouldnt be able to hurt an animal, although I did eat traditional foods in her culture with her and her family regardless, and am not perfect with it and don't live up to my morals always. Anyways I bring masculinity up because she told me often to be more manly. A lot. I think about my friends, like my roommate, who are naturally like that. They don't show sadness or other vulnerability. They make fart jokes. Drink beer eat steaks. They are inconsiderate to their girlfriends (say rude things, don't listen to them as much, left framed pictures gf gave as a present in their car on the floor where they got cracked and dirty until the gf found them and brought them out). Maybe I'm being unfair to them, but I don't like all that stuff. I know it's not exactly what my gf meant when she said be more manly but it kinda is. I don't want to be more manly. I don't want to be macho. I don't know how I can be only the parts of masculinity she wanted and I don't want to force myself to anyway. I guess I'm getting a bit off topic but basically I want to be seen as sexually desirable by women but I'm a fairly submissive person. I'm bi although I prefer women. I feel so opposite to what is portrayed in movies and so on as attractive behavior for men (I know they are exaggerations but still). I thought I could still initiate sex and be enough of that role for my girlfriend but just like my kissing apparently I'm bad at that too. This leads me to the last of the main reasons I was inadequate for my girlfriend. The other inadequacies apply to any conceivable relationship to me, however this one I on some level think my girlfriend's preference wasn't as universal. She is a bit of a size queen. Mine is quite long, but the girth wasn't enough for her. I think it's about average girth but on the smaller side of the median. She told me she wanted thicker. Reading online apparently girth is more important than length, and some of my friends that are girls who talk about that type of stuff when I'm around (most don't) size was a desirable thing for them. Anyways I was made fun of once for having a pencil dick by other guys so I was already a bit sensitive to this topic. My gf also didn't love that I'm uncut. No matter how often I clean it, it does have smell bad after a few hours (I don't have a yeast infection anymore). Despite being from a country where it is uncommon (they do tend to have shorter foreskins there, mine is long, and leaving the glans covered when others can see is viewed as ugly, there is a word for it in her language still they don't circumcise regularly there) she would say how smelly I am even when we were in the shower. No matter how much soap and how hard I scrubbed apparently it still had ""my scent"" (different from when it smells bad after a few hours). I am American and was one of the only kids in my class growing up who was uncut (I didn't know everyone's status but it was really rare there and those that I saw were cut and everyone just acted like that was the only way to be). People used to make fun of it and girls said it was gross. I was extremely careful to hide it in the showers after swim unit in gym and was never outed but I saw others made fun of for it and girls talked about it being gross infront of me assuming I was normal. I've done research since then and I know Reddit actually has a leaning towards intactivism, and I am less insecure about this now but I included it so you can understand where I'm coming from. I have been ashamed of my body for a long time. Insecure. This was my first real relationship and everything is coming back. I'm early mid twenties. I didn't mention my age before so I guess I will now. My girlfriend cheated on me. Once that I know about with some Canadian when I was abroad, and once that technically wasn't cheating but well I'll explain. We were on vacation and she was horny but she didn't want to have sex with me. That really hurt to hear. She wanted to try an open relationship. I felt like I couldn't satisfy her, I'm not enough. I just wanted her to be happy. So I agreed. She chose a guy off tinder and we were going to have a threesome but she wanted me to wait on the balcony while they started. It started raining really hard so I came back inside to them making out and undressing. I offered to join in but she said no. I sat there while they fucked. She made noises for him she didn't make for me. I felt so ashamed. I didn't know what to do. I just sat there and looked at my phone while some random railed my girlfriend. I didn't have the self respect to break up with her after that. I still loved her. The next day she told me it was a mistake. I tried to kill myself about 6 months later, not completely because of that but it was a factor. A year since my attempt she broke up with me. We were mostly long distance and she just moved here. She says she just wants to take a break. She's not sure what she wants right now. She likes who I am but isn't sure if I'm who she wants to marry. She also said she doesn't love me anymore and isn't sure if she ever did(I know she did). She fell out of love. I think mostly because of me not being manly enough and being sexually incompetent. She also probably thinks I'm pathetic and can't respect me anymore... I am pathetic. How can I ever expect to be in a relationship and have someone love me?? I deserve to bleed. I deserve to starve and wither. I hate myself. I hate myself. I hate myself. I have no one I can confide in with this. I used to have a therapist I loved working with who I openly shared about other past traumas and everything openly. She was the only one I told about many things in my life. However she stopped working with me after my attempt. Said she felt like I needed someone with more training in a different area. Also she said she doesn't have the ability with everything in her life to handle this. I tried a few other therapists but I didn't like any of them. Honestly I don't think I can do therapy again. I feel betrayed, even though she is being reasonable and it's my fault. I will probably delete this when I wake up as I will be incredibly ashamed I wrote this. Right now it's just too much for me to keep inside without cutting, I need to let it out. If you read this far thank you so much, I'm sorry if I disgust you. I'm sorry for being selfish. Sorry."

The story below represents the first time in my life I have ever regretted my innate love and trust in the goodness of people. After five days of deep emotions, vulnerability, and retraumatization, I feel defeated. The story: This past week I was contacted by a friend I made a few years ago who currently lives in Canada. We had not spoken in a long time and I was suprised and honored to recieve a late night message on instragram asking for my help. She inquired if I had any history with sexual assualt, in which I disclosed my ongoing personal battle with it. After sharing mine and my family's personal struggle, she opened up to me about assault she was experiencing at the hands of a close family member living in her household. This friend identified her abuser as a family member who has moved into her home after the recent death of his mother. She spent the remainder of that night and the next four days, describing in detail the traumatic assaults she was experiencing. After empathetically listening, affirming my friend, and applauded her courage to share with and trust me, I put my heart, soul, and time into helping her in every way I could. I researched and was in contact with various organizations, the police force, and other professionals in Canada in efforts to establish a security network for her. This was particularly frustrating and draining for me given the timing (12am-6am) and ""emergent"" and emotional nature of this immediate danger. For days I supplied options, advice, and affirmation for her. I remained available and active in our conversation for 24/7 for five days straight, losing endless hours of sleep and concentration. I sought professional advice at work, reached out to family and friends, and truly invested all my energy into maintaining the greatest support for my dear friend who was suffering from my biggest nightmare. Hearing in detail, about how a friend was continuing to suffer from something so personal and traumatizing, was heartbreaking. Given the nature of our locations and the fact that I didn't even know where exactly my friend lived or any contact person in her life, it felt like I was watching a child drown while hand cuffed. After giving her all I could for days, I reached out to a friend of hers from social media in efforts to connect with someone who in close promximity to her and her dangerous abuser. This random friend I reached out by happen stance, affirmed the danger and urgency of her trauma. However, she also mentioned her oddly similar experience with my friend. She told me about how my friend dragged her along in a comparable traumatizing sorry, that led to an investigation with the police, that proved to be 100% made up. I was disoriented and discouraged to hear the similarities between the story that was being shared with me, and story that I was now a part of. At this point of course, never wanting to doubt the experience of my victimized friend, I continued to affirm, support, and communicate with her. In my heart however, I feared something was not adding up. With worry that I too was, being lied to, I asked for her friend to put me in contact with her family to gain clarity. In order to ensure her protection, I justified breaking her trust to not contact family. The brother that I connected with expressed immediate concern, but also, total confusion. He denied the accuracy of every part of her story. There was no recent death, or potential abuser living in their home. It was all a lie and the silence I received after confronting my ""friend"" affirmed this in a deep and painful way. Sexual assault is horrific, traumatizing, and affects millions of people across the country. Lying about this trauma dismisses the experiences of millions of survivors and ongoing victims of this hell."

This random friend I reached out by happenstance, affirmed the danger and urgency of her trauma. However, she also mentioned her oddly similar experience with my friend. She told me about how my friend dragged her along in a comparable traumatizing sorry, that led to an investigation with the police, that proved to be 100% made up. I was disoriented and discouraged to hear the similarities between the story that was being shared with me, and the story that I was now a part of. At this point, of course, never wanting to doubt the experience of my victimized friend, I continued to affirm, support, and communicate with her. In my heart however, I feared something was not adding up. With worry that I too was, being lied to, I asked for her friend to put me in contact with her family to gain clarity. In order to ensure her protection, I justified breaking her trust to not contact family. The brother that I connected with expressed immediate concern, but also, total confusion. He denied the accuracy of every part of her story. There was no recent death, or potential abuser living in their home. It was all a lie and the silence I received after confronting my ""friend"" affirmed this in a deep and painful way. Sexual assault is horrific, traumatizing, and affects millions of people across the country. Lying about this trauma dismisses the experiences of millions of survivors and ongoing victims of this hell."

Im moving soon, and were both getting busier in our lives, anyway. I dont know if I should be happy that someone I like just told me they like me back, or utterly terrified by my vulnerability and the fear of loss of what had potential to be a romantic relationship. Right now, Im happy. I know its wrong to rely on validation from others, but knowing that my feelings, our feelings, were mutual, makes me feel alive. I want to hold her and give her kisses and be that person for her so badly. But Ill settle for what we have now, because I would rather keep her close, even if we cant commit to the titles, than know I could lose her over my emotional immaturity. Maybe its too soon, but I really love you and hope you will still accept and love me, with all my flaws."

Aside from their toxic characteristics, I understand that I mean a lot to them. But I just wish they showed it. I've dreamt of the day that they would sit down and be personal with me. Where I could tell them how I feel and they would actually understand and listen. Every time my feelings are brushed off, so my whole life I've felt like I've been forced to keep my emotions in. I honestly think it's because I look ugly when I cry, I don't know. But my parents were emotionally supportive of my sister when she was having a hard time. I just don't know if it's just me or if they just don't have the same type of compassion for me. It hurts. I feel obligated to hide my vulnerability. Which is ironic because they get mad at me for not telling them everything before bad things happen. I really wish I could just see a therapist so that I could be... just... better. I've thought so many bad and negative thoughts for the longest time that I don't know how long I could go on like this. I just need a break."

Life feels like way too much right now. Although I am so excited and grateful for where Im at, I also feel like Im crumbling under stress, depression, and unresolved trauma. I am struggling to understand myself and the world around me. My life experience feels fractured, I feel fractured. Im struggling to understand who I am as a person, what I like and dislike, what I want in life, and how to connect with others. I remember significant portions of my life from the victim perspective. One of my first memories is being molested by two of my family members, who continued to periodically sexually assault me through my childhood. I remember being very young, and feeling angry, isolated, and shameful. I was a terror to my younger sibling, I was filled with rage - he was so innocent and I was a monster to him. In middle school, I was forced into a back brace for scoliosis. This made me feel like a deformed monstrosity, unheard, unimportant, unloveable, and even more isolated. I grew up in a very conservative and sexually repressed community. Exploring my sexuality was heavily shamed, and a class rumor that I was gay (the grossest thing someone could be, /s) made me feel even more isolated and unloveable at a vulnerable age. As many moody teenagers, I went through high school feeling misunderstood and alone, even though I was very high-achieving. In my first week of college, I lost my virginity to a campus rape. I was raped once more and sexually assaulted several times during college, but told no one. In my last year of college, I struggled financially, could barely eat and pay rent, and was severely depressed, drowning my feelings in alcohol and sleep. That year, a boy broke my heart, my parents divorced, and my grandmother (my role model, hero, and encourager with whom I was very close) passed away after battling cancer. I was mentally a mess. I got into a relationship that ended up lasting 5 years and was wrought with emotional abuse. He was outwardly charismatic and charming, but behind closed doors was gaslighting, demeaning, aggressive, narcissistic, and sometimes violent. My experience with him made me feel 2 inches tall and nearly meaningless while I attended law school. In our last year of dating, he had gotten very comfortable with treating me terribly and was particularly prone to violent outbursts. We broke up (thank gods) two weeks before I graduated. Because of finances, stability, and logistics, we had to live together for almost four months following the breakup while I studied for and took my licensing exam. I should note that my childhood was also filled with love, support, joy, and privilege. My parents have loved me infinitely all my life, supported my interests fully, encouraged me, and made me believe I could do literally anything. My family was loving, kind, and generous in spirit. I grew up with incredible role models and mentors. I made some amazing friends along lifes way. Growing up, I had a stable home life, always enough to eat, access to activities, entertainment, exploration, and play. Ive been high-achieving from a very young age due to all the encouragement that surrounded me and my wonderment at the world and its infinite possibilities. I very much love my life and live in absolute awe of this experience of being a human being in all its vastness. About four months have passed since the abusive ex moved out, and I feel like I am starting to finally process all of these experiences in a meaningful way for the first time. On one hand, I have never felt more free and more myself. I graduated with honors, passed my licensing exam, have my own place in a city that I love, great friends, an amazing community, am starting to date again, am engaged in my interests, and have a new job on the horizon. I am so so thankful and so excited to keep traveling my path. On the other hand, I am absolutely crippled by depression, anxiety, feeling isolated and alone. After my licensing exam, I spent about 2 months unemployed and unable to even get out of bed. I felt totally lost in the world, drowning in my consciousness. My abusive relationship made me almost completely forget who I am: my interests, my personality, goals, all almost entirely overshadowed and hidden so as not to catch the wrath of my partner. I walked in eggshells, I was a shell of myself. Leaving that relationship, I had to remember what it was like to feel like a worthwhile human being. It was like I had forgotten a basic skill like how to read or walk. I didnt know what or how to contribute when I hung out with friends or went on dates. I noticed myself always trying to blend in, to not cause a disturbance, to not assert any opinion or preference. I didnt only walk on eggshells around my abusive partner, I had learned to walk on eggshells everywhere with everyone. I realized what a boring person to hang out with Id become. I didnt display any personality, I barely knew what to contribute. I felt like, and still feel, like I have no idea how to connect with people, build relationships, build trust, rely on someone, trust someone to remember who I am (&amp; my profession is highly relationship-based). I feel immense shame so much of the time - oh I shouldnt bother to connect with X friend or colleague, if they only knew my past theyd realize what a fuck up I am. It was particularly heartbreaking when I started dating someone new, really liked them and felt really in-tune with them, but couldnt maintain eye contact with them for fear that they would see into my past and be disgusted by me. I feel this with most everyone. On top of the emotional struggle/recovery Ive been experiencing, Ive also been struggling financially and have only been able to eat one meal a day for the past three months. I recognize that I am privileged and lots of folks experience hunger on a much more dire level. However, my lack of nutrition has not been helpful to my energy levels and depression. Everything feels slightly more difficult when youre in a haze from lack of energy and hunger. I get exhausted very easily. I was seeing a trauma therapist before I lost my health insurance, and that was immensely helpful. It brought up a lot of painful memories, but also helped me rewrite some narratives to release some shame, fear, anger, sadness, and confusion Id been holding onto. I am working every day to identify thought patterns that are holding me back from being authentically myself. I am fumbling through learning to connect with people, and am opening myself to vulnerability in friendships and new relationships. Like Ive said, I am hugely grateful for where Im at in life and excited for the future. I finally feel free to be me and on a fulfilling path. However, what troubles me perhaps the most is this fractured-ness to my understanding of myself and the world. The negative and traumatic experiences Ive had have given me layers and layers of dysfunctional defense mechanisms - so many that I struggle to remember who I am underneath. It feels like so much of my behavior and thoughts are products of pain Ive experienced instead of products of who I am at my core. Im sure this is something that most everyone experiences on some level. But, in my experience, its been troubling to realize just how much of me feels like a scared child trying to shield herself from a world that seems to have betrayed her at every step. This all probably sounds melodramatic or self-pitying. For me, its just confusing. I am so ready to put myself out in the world and chase what I want most, but I keep stumbling and hitting dead ends in the maze because I struggle so much to understand what its like to interact with this world and the humans in it. My concept of self is so all over the place. It is a daily struggle to feel confident and worthwhile. Its strange to feel so excited about life and so heavily depressed at the same time. Furthermore, I feel like I live on another planet grappling with this all alone. I trust the journey and am reveling in this process of self-connection. I am grateful that every day I get the opportunity to discover and express more of my authentic self, which can basically be whatever I want and change any time. It just feels better to let some of this weight off my chest while I work through it. So, thanks internet. tl;dr: Im a human whos had bad experiences and good experiences and am struggling to understand my existence, and that can feel like a lot sometimes."

(Its so bad that sometimes I feel like Im making other people uncomfortable just by existing) I know that, on the few occasions I had made eye contact with a guy I couldnt ignore in passing they would nod or look me up and down and smile but I think I actually go into a state of shock and forget about it until I am writing something out like this and remember) - (I think thats what they call swooning?)

I know this is definitely not a healthy way to look at myself but I cant help feeling like I am and never will be enough. I love myself, sure. I just dont think I am able to be loved in return. I love my brain. I love my body sometimes, I love certain features of my face. I love my art, cooking and self expression. I hate my voice sometimes. Im really embarrassed of my voice.

We judged people who were themselves/going against the grain as 'losers'. Fast forward a few years. I'm 23 now. I have been sober from drugs and alcohol for a little over 11 months. Despite this progress my ability to be vulnerable and express myself/feelings has barely developed.

He asked why and I told him all the silly worries and asked him about his sexual history. He allowed me to. He answered me honestly. We connected. We had sex after both sharing. I've never had my feelings so beautifully validated in my life. Normally I wouldn't admit my insecurities and would be more of an attacker and try and find info through extraction to validate my fears. I really feel that taking accountability for my fears and worries is what made this morning different for me. I didnt do anything shady or lash out. And I didn't attack or belittle. Bf said it made him more comfortable sharing with me too. I made a huge breakthrough with emotional regulation and vulnerability today. I'm pretty proud of myself. And i feel safe and stable and calm for being honest with myself and him. Taking accountability for my emotions is going to change the health of my relationship and I'm thankful to have tried it this morning.

Therapy scares me. Acknowledging abuse scares me. Coming out of my shell, letting people in, or just vulnerability itself is scary. Recently, Ive been doing a lot of introspection and finally tuning into what needs to be done for me to better connections with people. Specifically, I just want to learn how to remain connected to myself. Ive always walked through life putting everyone in front of me because of my fear of rejection or abandonment. I lean into self deprecation so that I have final word about how awful I am before someone can say the same first. Its a weird area to tread in and I realize its very toxic and unhealthy. My therapist says I have C-PTSD and I still havent wrapped my head around what that means. Researching online says my emotions will be dysregulated, I will have moments of dissociation, have low self-worth or low self-esteem, or have a disorganized attachment style. Its scary because its true. When I am overwhelmed or stressed, I tend to shut down and float through each day. Ill have days where I cant even remember what I did earlier that same day. Ill have days where I forget to use the restroom or eat. I have moments of panic in everyday interactions even when its a *pleasant* interaction. This especially happens when I am being complimented for things I am doing great at. It makes me want to run away and hide because what if it all comes crashing down? What the fuck? Its so annoying that I think like this and its irrational. I now understand how my ex partner mightve felt towards me. He was often confused and didnt know where to stand with us. I remember self-sabotaging through push and pull unintentionally. My coping mechanism is always to hide away and shut down when good things are happening. I always jumped to conclusions or made assumptions on my own and acted out based on what was in my head. I shouldve communicated but the fear. Its crazy. Im crazy. The craziest part is underneath all of this, I know that my soul is so bright and pure. My heart is full of kindness and compassion for every living thing. I know I have strengths that can make me successful but the fear is so great that I cannot bypass it. I just remain stagnant. I hate this part of me even knowing I must accept it to heal. Im so scared to let someone in again because if I open up all of these parts of me they might still leave. It makes me feel unlovable. Relationships cannot thrive unless you are open and trusting. I cannot thrive unless I am trusting of myself. I just wanted to get this out. I feel really alone with all of this. I cant talk to my family because they are not safe to hold a space for my emotions. If I tell my mom this, she will make it about herself and how its her fault. She makes everything about herself and then I have to comfort her about my own problems. Thats how its always been. I am my mothers mother. I am my sisters mother. The only person who feels like a mother is my aunt and she always says that Ill get over it. Its not a big deal. I hate when people say this. If it wasnt a big deal why is it affecting all aspects of my life. No one ever listens. I just want someone to listen and to hold me. TLDR; I hate and am fearful of the person I am. C-PTSD and childhood abuse has made me question my relationship with love. Will I ever find someone who will listen and love me in the way I need to be loved? Stay tuned. More at 11."
218,vulnerability,offmychest,Summer of 2016,1,e4u7mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/e4u7mj/summer_of_2016/,2019-12-02 16:18:02,"Id like to tell a deeply personal story. I cant promise it is any good, I just know it was really painful. It is a long one that I havent told anyone before. It is as sensitive as one can possibly be and, as such, I am posting from a throwaway with aliases for all parties involved. There are a lot of strange occurrences that are pretty improbable, so I understand if an skeptical listener might disbelieve me, but I promise to be as objective as possible. I also welcome any questions for clarification. Lets get to it. In the Summer of 2016 I bordered closer to emotional breakdown than I thought possible. There are a lot of moving parts here, but I will focus on three specific side plots. I lived in large and extremely expensive city as a broke college student. I didnt have much money to my name and was trying to find some friends with whom to split my empty apartment. In summary, I had an empty apartment because I had invited my then girlfriend of 1+ years to move in, and I eventually realized that she had slept with a roommate, after which I kicked them both out (the lease was in my name). This is just a necessary preface as to my emotional vulnerability at the time. I was still licking my wounds and I tried my very best to sympathetically look through other peoples pain. A close friend, Bernie, was going through something of an personal crisis himself. I had known him for a couple years. In short, his parents were verging on bankruptcy because his opioid-addicted older brother had robbed the family-run convenience store outside the city. I later found out that mental illness runs in his family. We quickly bonded over our shared pains and, as he was looking for a new residence, I invited him in as roommate. He also requested that his friend, Ashley, who also needed a place to stay, be welcomed in as well. I had no problem with this. At the very same time as we were all moving in together, I began dating this girl named Alex. She was something of a dream. I cant really put her beauty to words, but Ill leave it there. Like I mentioned before, I was in a really bad place emotionally because of a pretty sour breakup, so this new thing was pretty wonderful at its start. Another necessary preface: I had got this really cool full time internship in the end of May. I had to commute about an hour each way, so I was really under-slept throughout the majority of this story. So at the beginning of June I had thought the summer was going to be wonderful. I had two great roommates, a blossoming relationship, and a sweet job. Then everything turned into a waking nightmare. I didnt know Ashley that well, but she disappeared for a little over a month without much notice. I later found out her older sister had committed suicide. I didnt know how to help or interact with this event, but, like I said before, I tried to be as sympathetic as I possibly could. Bernie, too, also was undergoing his own personal troubles. I still dont know what happened to him, but he started sinking all of his friendships with everyone. He became an extremely bitter SOB and an intolerable roommate for even levelheaded people, so the hurt he caused Ashley was, by any measure, beyond my sympathy. And then there was Alex. Dear lord this is where I started to fall apart. The second time we went out on a date, she had accidentally sent me a text meant for her friend saying how nervous and excited she was. I mean, it was perfect. She was so absolutely perfect. But Alex was from another country in which family and image come before anything else. Her family was worth many hundreds of millions and fiercely protected their reputation. As we started to become familiar and happy with one anothers company, she disclosed that she had been raped by a family member and was still trying to overcome her trauma. Though she didnt say it out loud, I got the impression that her family knew, but refused to acknowledge or talk about it out of shame. And like, other than listening and respecting her space, what can I do, right? Like fuck me. Fuck all of this. I was constantly meditating between Alex and Bernie in trying to create some sort of peace there. I was trying to spend quality time with Alex in just listening and giving her whatever she needed there. Of course, I was working 50+ hours each week myself, but every night Id stay up with Alex and/or Ashely. If I could go back I would have quit the job to actually be there for them. It is all stuff that should never happen to anyone. I fucking hate that this is just life. I feel bad that my worst pain is just seeing many people go through real shit, but also it caused so much hopelessness and pessimism. I always put on a bright face and gave any bit of emotional energy I could afford, but also like what the fuck does that do for others going through such real shit. This was the remainder of my summer. I kicked Bernie out after September when I had Ashleys approval. He lost all of scholarships and school credits. I dont know where he is now but I know he lost all of his old friends here. I became really close friends with Ashley. We were inseparable for the next year. I used a lot of my money from work to buy canvases and paint. Wed just listen to great music, watch bob ross and follow along on our own *happy little trees*. She eventually started dating someone who was also quite troubled, and they both started doing serious drugs (crack) that I was 100% against. I still think about Alex. I gave her the space I felt she needed, careful not to apply any sort of pressure on her in terms of our sexual and emotional relationship. Her parents wanted her to go into medicine at her school, an Ivy League, but I encouraged her to pursue her passion in performing arts/acting. One night we had stayed up all night, taking turns in reading a book aloud to one another. She said that she saw how I was trying to give her the space, time and peace she needed to feel comfortable with seeing, touching, and loving someone. During that October of 2016, my own abuser (story for another time) eventually died from an overdose. This really sent me into a really bad state, especially after that horrid summer. After that event I was in a really bad place and I became upset with Alex when I felt our relationship had become one sided. I think she felt both ashamed and angry, and there wasnt really any way to walk back my mistake. We broke up. I now realize that it wasnt fair to her given what she was dealing with, and I regret it immensely. I am happy to share that she eventually became an actual actress. She has guest starred on a couple of TV shows. I am kind of happy that I might have played a role in that. And that is about it. Drugs, mental illness, and absolute depravity."

Just need this off my chest You talk about not having cried in the better part of five years because its the only half interesting part of your life. But truth is your not strong enough to cry if you wanted. Suppressing emotions has become instinctive, probably crippling your emotional capacity for life. Because thats the person you are. You can try to justify it by saying I dont need to cry because other people have it worse. But thats bullshit. Who cares if other people have it worse, doesnt it feel good to be validated, to have your feelings acknowledged. Yeah it does, so what are you scared of, being vulnerable? Being scared of vulnerability is dumb. No one is out to get you, even if it feels like it. No one could care about your problems because theyve all got problems of their own. They dont have time for you. Theyll never have time you for apart to use you as cheap comic relief for all their friends so they can have a good laugh at your expense. So what. We just gonna stay in this same cycle of emotionally isolating yourself. Feeling bad about it then writing yourself notes as if thatll make it better or as if itll change how you act now? Yeah right."
220,vulnerability,offmychest,Everyone tells me to get therapy but I really just don't need to be alone.,1,e6ez6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/e6ez6n/everyone_tells_me_to_get_therapy_but_i_really/,2019-12-05 20:41:14,"I am a Data Scientist. I am an extrovert and I love being around people. However, a lot of my coworkers are suposed introverts. I say supposed since I question the whole ""introvert / extrovert"" model. What I strongly suspect is that many of us have emotional needs we get from somewhere. Many introverts I have known have family, freinds, or relationships available to them. So they get those needs met. Or at least I suspect. I don't know for sure and I could be wrong. Me though. I am super alone. I go days without talking to someone outside of work. And, even at work, my coworkers dont interact with me very friendly. They are kind but I clearly do not have much meaning to them personally. They just need me and I need them. And I have accepted that. However, my coworkers are ... introverts... At least they claim to be. And I dunno. Some seem happy but they think I am weird for always wanting to be around people. This is why I suspect they get their needs met. They claim to want to spend quality time by themselves. But I do wonder if they go for long periods without people. And many have family, friends, and relationships. I don't. They always tell me to *just go make friends....* And it isn't easy. I should explain. Meeting people with common interests is not that hard. Forming bonds is hard. I am feeling that more and more, no one gets me. And like ... I am not one of those ""I am wearing a mask."" kind of people. I do not really fear people learning about me or disclosing parts of my life. I want them to. I know this isn't exactl vulnerability but still...It isnt like I am hiding from people or at least I don't think. If anything I overshare. And that is what kills me. What I really want is for people to love me and be interested in me. I know that sounds self centered but I want people to want to be around me without me having to constantly remind them I exist. I want to exist in this world as the person i want to be and feel as if I belong. *And I have never felt this way.* It makes me feel so lonely. I am becoming numb to the world. It feels as if the words people speak pass through me and everything is fuzzy. But also it feels like people don't invite me. People don't yearn for me. People don't desire me. And it is weird since people *like* me. They think I am fun to be around. But I don't feel connected. A lot of people say I am weird, and they have always said it. And it changes connotation. I get weird as in kooky, goofy, funny, interesting, undesirable, and even dangerous. But I am constantly constantly reminded I am different. The interesting thing is that people are starting to see this as empowering. I got fed up about never being invited to do things with people so I just do them by myself. Concerts, theme parks, traveling, racing, parties, clubs, raves, restaurants. There is pretty much nothing I won't do alone. And it is actually making it hard to do things with people. I have come to hate watching movies with people. Even though I love being in the theatre with people in it (when they don't talk). I can't go snowboarding or to theme parks with others. And a lot of people just don't want to do those things anyway. I am sort of in this weird position where the thought of inviting others to do things with me seems weird and terrifying since I am not confident they would enjoy my company and I almost think they would ruin the experience for me. But, understand, I really want to do most things with others. What I really miss was when I was in clubs at college and they planned things. That worked super well since they were things I didn't care so much about. As an adult this doesn't happen. so I am alone most of the time. I often say *I have no friends* and a lot of people are surprised since I am sociable. They think because I gravitate towards social situations and on occasion have confidence I should be really popular. But they don't see the days and weeks I am alone. Almost anyone that is my *friend* knows that I dissapear for months at a time. Years sometimes. But like I dunno. The fact that I don't have bonds. That I never have anyone to talk to. The fact that when I do get a chance I talk everyone's ear off. The fact that I browse the internet endlessly searching for someone to make me less lonely. The fact that I don't feel like I belong on this bloody planet. The fact that I roll into a ball and cry and just want someone to hug me or hold my hand. *Makes me feel like I don't have any friends.* And then I tell people this. And I say I have all these negative thoughts and insecurities. I want to explain why I am so alone. And I come up with that I am ugly. Or I don't dress well. Or I am too old looking. Or it is because of my chipped tooth. Or maybe it is my weird voice. My stupid talkative and opinionated personality. Or that I am just fucking weird. My random dancing. OR my effeminate nature (I'm a guy). OR something I am just not aware of. And they say go to therapy. And like I don't know. i feel like this big social reject. and the solution is therapy? To pay someone to listen to me? Therapists are rare and expensive. So it isn't like this is something that is widely available or convenient too. And I worry about meeting a therapist but still being alone. What will I do then? Why can't people just accept that who I am is not a person they like. Who I am for real? Why do they want to *fix* me? Do I have to change for them? I am a pragmatist and don't mind doing this. But this whole therapy thing. It is a sign that the bond and connection I want from people is just not going to come. And I am just processing it. Gosh I wish I could explain this better. But it feels like, no matter what I do, I can't be the person I want to be and be loved by anyone but my parents. And like. I am just processing what that means for my place in the world. And I don't think therapy will change that."
221,vulnerability,offmychest,Breaking our pact,2,degnog,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/degnog/breaking_our_pact/,2019-10-07 19:36:31,"Its 3am and I lost the fight in resisting to text you. I didnt have much to say except to see if youre awake thousands of miles away from me. I couldnt sleep tonight, cause all I had been thinking about is if our marriage pact in 10 years will still stand. The chances are low that wed somehow find our way back to each other in the way I had always wanted since we met 9 years ago, but there are still chances. You were so certain that I was the only one feeling this wholesome love between us and that yours for me was different, and yet there you were: suggesting one of my wildest dreams to be possibly fulfilled in 10 years. How would I ever say no to you, when no one has ever compared to the amount of care, adoration, trust and love I have had and still have for you? You understand the things that I cant admit freely to, and in return I hold your trust when you struggle with vulnerability - in the darkest of nights and the brightest of days. You laugh with me at the most redundant of jokes, and ponder the meaning of the the most uninteresting things in life - I wonder if we should just start a guidebook of nothing and everything for ourselves. You taught me that I was always good enough for everyone, including you, even when the worst times have beaten me down - a struggle that you relate to as well, except you never really had anyone else to fall back to, but me. What you dont realize that I too, fall back to you because even with everyone else around me; there is no comfort like you. The problem with our marriage pact is that while we could possibly result in falling in love with each other when its in effect; Im already breaking the pact. You already know that I love you like all the analogies and quantities known to the world. But the problem is, I still love you in this other way that you dont seem to reciprocate: Im IN love WITH you. Right now. Have been. Still am. Probably still will be for a while."

Im no reddit expert lol. Also I apologize for any bad grammar. This is a dumb rant so prepare: I feel like for a long time ive had a very bland personality. I was never a great person, super shy, very anxious and not the funnest to be around. I have a friend group currently but I always feel like everyone has so much personality and I dont quite deserve to be friends with such amazing people like them. Im selfish because I always complain about my first world problems, acting like its the end of the world and everything. But other than some mental health stuff, my life id actually pretty good. Im healthy, middle class, I have a good family and things are going fine. But it just hurts me to know that my friends are such outgoing people yet they go through so much crap. I wish that they could take all their problems and give them to me so they could get rid of the weights on their shoulders. I dont care if im miserable, I dont care if im ghosted, I dont care if they forget about me. Just as long as I know theyre happy and living their best lives, I will be happy for them. I dont have much going on for me in life anyways. Im currently a senior in high school, and I have no future plans or motivations. Ive never dated anyone, I have a fear of intimacy, and im clearly not going to achieve anything big in my life time. So why is it that I was the one who got lucky? I just love my friends so much and Im not great with vulnerability so I dont say it much to them but the platonic love I feel for them is overwhelming and I wish they knew how much I appreciate them"

Even though it was yesterday... This is something Im VERY passionate about because I went through hell and back and no one should have to do that because of a stigma. Ive had mental illness since I was four. It stuck with me for my entire life and I tried to hide it. Concealing my vulnerability only made me lose touch of myself even more, which I would constantly deny. I tried reaching out for help in school, only to be shut down. Guidance counselor to guidance counselor. Until I met Mrs.K (for short, dont want to expose her name). For the first time ever someone listened to me. She got right to work trying to make things easier. She got me in touch with the school psychologist, she contacted my teachers and explained that I was having anxiety in class. She checks in on me all the time, helping me get though the year. Eventually, I found a private psychologist (who I love) and therapist (we didnt connect so Im in the process of finding a new one). I was diagnosed with OCD, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, ADHD, and depression. I dont know how I carried it all; fear can do so much to a person. I was prescribed Lexapro from the get go and Wellbutrin two months ago. I have consistently taken both since. They saved my life. If you wouldve asked me where I would be today a year ago, I would reply I either flunked out of school, or was lying dead in a ditch somewhere. I was so afraid to take medication because I was afraid it would change who I was. It didnt. I feel motivated to be who I am today because of it. I feel like I can achieve my passion and become a veterinarian and go to college, which is something I didnt even consider a year ago. I am happy now, and its deeper than a feeling. Its an emotion that touches and embraces my core. I still struggle, sometimes I relapse. Sometimes I have bad days, but thats okay!! Recovery isnt linear. I am so much better than I once was and thats the point. If you are struggling, reach out. Please. Getting help saved my life. I am thankful for the doctors who stuck with me even though I was stubborn and scared. I am thankful for my school for helping me get through this and supporting me every step of the way. I am thankful for my friends for being there for me always even when I was at rock bottom, and no fun to hang out with. I am thankful for my parents because they have been challenging there own stigmatization of mental illness, in support of me, in addition to paying for my therapy and medication. I am thankful for my youth pastor at church who helped me find an outlet through community service work and faith. And I am thankful for myself. Im thankful that I didnt give up no matter how much I wanted to. I am thankful for all the effort I put into recovery, and I am thankful for who I have become today. I am so thankful that you are existing on this planet at the same time I am. I am thankful you are alive and I wish you the best. You are never in any of this alone."

Im a piece of shit who constantly needs to feel pitied, and I hate myself for it. Originally this was going to be a post structured around getting you all to feel sympathy for me, but I realize that would just be feeding into my unhealthy craving, so instead Ill just talk about all the assholeish things I think and do because I really just need to find a way to cope with these things and this seems like the quickest solution for now. So without further ado, heres all the shit that makes me a piece of shit scumbag: A lot of the time, I feel unsatisfied if I hang out with my friends or family and the subject of my music, or writing, or some vulnerability I have that makes them pity me doesnt come up. Sometimes I purposely bring up personal stuff I pretend I dont want to talk about just so they can feel sympathy for meI really am the embodiment of a high school girl with a finsta, arent I? I cant feel happy unless people either really appreciate and look up to me, or they pity me, and its a lot easier to get people to pity you. I dont know why Im like this, and I dont know how to get these feelings to stop, all I know is that I hate myself for not being able to control, or even fucking understand why I think the way I do. Its gotten to the point where Ive considered lying to some of my friends about other people in our friend group being mean to me, all so they can feel bad for me. This thought in particular really got to me because it seemed so rational when it first came into mind. I thought: oh, wouldnt this be a easy way to snag some sympathy points from my friends and feel a little better about myself for a couple minutes. Seriously considering this action, and even thinking about it in the first place, makes me want to fucking torture myself for how much of an asshole I truly am. The fucked up thing is, people seem to really like me for some reason. People at my school tend to remember my name and are always nice to me, my coworkers seem to be really fond of me, and it makes me feel like even more of a fucking asshole. Im nice to them when we spend time together, and I do my best to make them happy, but theres always that presence in the back of my mind telling me that what would really make me happy is if I brought up just how much I hate myself so they could feel bad for me. And even having this problem in the first place and complaining about it makes me feel like a fucking asshole. Oh boo hoo, people are nice to me, how sad. Id like to shove a fucking shotgun down my throat and blow a hole in my neck so I could feel the pain my scumbag self deserves. Im sorry that this is a long ass rant with no cohesion or conciseness, but I really just needed to get this off my chest and this seems like the best place to do it. I dont know if theres anything yall could say in terms of advice, but maybe just tell me if its normal to need sympathy this badly, it might help me feel like less of an asshole if I knew that this is a common feeling. Anyways, thanks for bearing with my rambles, it feels good to have gotten it all out for the time being. I hope yall have a great night (or day, depending on when you read this)."

Either im asexual or just really scared of sex, because I just dont think I can or want to do any of that with a person I love. I just want to go on road trips and watch movies and stuff like that. Every time someone does admit to liking me, I instantly freak out and kind of just ghost them a little bit. Of course the people who have liked me in the past are major creeps anyways, but still. I dont think I can handle being loved and I dont believe im ever going to find anyone. Ive never dated anyone, and its normal for my age because im only 17, but with everybody my age dating and talking about sex, I just feel like I dont fit in.

I am so insecure and uncomfortable with initiating intimacy of any kind. Like I may want to, but I just can't. I am afraid of vulnerability; any time I try the words wont come out, and I get choked up to the point of feeling dizzy or sick. I like the idea of a relationship, but if it ever becomes a possibility with someone I either immediately lose interest or run away scared. I feel awkward, easily embarassed/bashful. I feel disgusted with myself for leading guys on. What's worse is I've definitely normalized it, and become comfortable with what my life has become. I tell myself that as an introvert this works. It's been going on so long now, that I would have no idea where to start in order to change. It's frustrating because I haven't experienced any major trauma in my life. All of my siblings are normal well-adjusted adults in happy relationships. I have amazing supportive parents.

Tell them you like them, that you want something more. Lay for hours awake at night, listening to each other's slow breath and steady heartbeats as they sinc together in harmony; no words, just the warmth of your hand holding theirs. I don't understand how you could sit outside on a cold autumn night, holding eachother close for both warmth and affection as you look up at the night sky and talk about escaping to a place where the stars are so much brighter. I don't understand how you could share the moments of physical and emotional vulnerability, intertwining your fingers with theirs as they tell you about their darkest moments and biggest regrets, you tell them your fears, your past, your hopes for the future. I don't understand how you could kiss them with such a passion as you slowly rock into their body and feel their breath down your neck. How you can get goosebumps just thinking about these moments. I don't understand how you could drive for miles just to see their face for a night before spending any amount of time apart thinking of them and when you'll meet again. How you could see a picture of them on social media and not help but to smile as it warms your heart just to see them on a screen. How you could be with them for days and still miss them when they're gone and ask for them to come back. ""Just one more night"" turns into more, and more, but you don't mind because their company helps you feel sane. I don't understand how you could talk for hours about nothing, just because you love the sound of their voice and the words that come out of their mouth. The days you spent learning about them, their hobbies and interests and the way they perceive the world around them, how happy they are that you are apart of it. I don't understand how all of these things could not translate into love; how you could so easily throw all of this away when you hear them tell you they love you for the first time. I don't see how you could so easily never talk to them again, how unaffected you could be by the tears rolling down their face and the shakiness in their voice as they ask you, why? What did they do wrong? Why don't you feel the same way they do after all of this... I just don't understand why I wasn't enough..."

Dream job that I spent my 20s working toward. Barely any friends - I never seem to keep them around. I learned when I was young to not trust or hold onto people and Im realising how awful that philosophy is later in life. I have a family that loves me, but I feel like the black sheep. Indifferent and cold father, a brother I dont relate to well, a nosy and manipulative mother. Lots of cousins I dont keep in touch with. Ive only had one true sexual relationship in my life with a woman that lasted maybe a month. It was a disaster. Im a good looking guy in good shape but I feel like kryptonite to women. I dont want to be involved. I feel like a monster when Im with them. I seem to hate the sexual side of myself. I have sex with men because its easy and convenient, and I have no deep feelings for them. This year I convinced myself I was bisexual when I was deeply missing a friend of mine - I dreamt about hugging and kissing him and realised that I loved him deeply, but I hadnt seen him in years. Im fairly convinced he thinks Im the biggest fucking idiot hes ever met, because I tried it on with him and there was absolutely nothing. But I really did feel that way for him. I think Im going insane. I dont know why I love him but I do. I want to be his, but I dont think I can be - not in he way he wants (hes gay). Sometimes I think I might be transgender. But I dont want to transition - the reality of that sounds awful. But I dont feel like a man. I envy and adore women in equal measure. Im balding - I miss my hair. Im fairly certain my posture has permanently destroyed my breathing - otherwise Im in good health. I dont like the expectation that men be who they are. Theres so much about the nature of being a man that I hate. The lack of vulnerability, the lack of emotion, the aggression. Im sick of being a fucking joke. But I am one. The universe turns us into that and we get so little say in it. Im starting to think about killing myself, but I dont actually want to do that. I just want to rewind everything and start again. I want the whole world to flip on its axis just for me. What the fuck is wrong with me?!"
231,vulnerability,offmychest,I think my cousin is a sociopath!,2,dkl7in,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dkl7in/i_think_my_cousin_is_a_sociopath/,2019-10-21 02:37:39,"So i've (F25) known my cousin (F36) since the day I was born, and always was very close to her. We lived in different continents so the time when we were together was always nice. Lately I had been visiting the country to see my family and friends including her. She is known in the town and among my family as doing shady things financially and romantically (stuff I can't really get into on here). I never really thought about those incidents because I saw her as a friend. I started noticing her odd quirks and behaviors once I really started visiting the country, and I live here now so this is now an ongoing issue. This is what I noticed and experienced: * She is incredibly manipulative: Whenever I couldn't/ can't hang out she would turn on me and send me mean texts saying I always hang out with other family members and not her. Meanwhile, I visit her work place everyday. Also, an incident happened the other day while we were having dinner out. We eat out once every week, and when we do, she's usually 70% of the time on her phone texting or calling people. I called her out on it (nicely as I despise confrontation) and she completely exploded saying she can do whatever she wants when she wants because no one bosses her around. She used my vulnerability to scream at me for something so miniscule. I told her that when going out and someone's on their phone the whole time, it means they don't like the company. She said such cruel things that are complete BS, things she actually does. * She also has a grandiose sense of self and narcissism. She always brags about how guys think she's cute (she's married). Once while we were having dinner she went through her entire camera roll telling me how pretty she looked in her photos. She also says she's the smartest person in her town and people who don't like her are beneath her. * She also has lack of empathy. In January, I came to visit her and she complained that I didn't see her enough. I saw her everyday. She began to berate me and say such mean things that made no sense. She was so angry I didn't want to visit her on my last day. She seemingly forgot that she treated me like trash prior. She then said she was so sick with the fever she could barely type and that I was so selfish not to visit her. Being the bigger person and not wanting to be in conflict, I visited her. When I got there she was perfectly fine laughing and smiling. Psycho...She was just playing with my feelings and didn't care I was hurt. I told her how I felt and she told me to drink a beer to feel better. * She has an inability to keep friendships. She gets mad at everyone and lost all her friends. She claims they are horrible people, but if she lost them all, it's because she's the problem. She likes to talk poorly about everyone she knows behind their backs. * She's also completely delusional. She likes to give me lessons of morality when she herself, has done horrible things to hurt people in the past. She fails to see the damage she has done and inflicts pain on others. She needs to be in power at all times, and once that is questioned, she completely flips out into a spiral of rage. I could go on and on with more examples, but this is already quite long. We haven't spoken since the incident with the phone usage. I refuse to be the one who opens conversation, as I'm tired of being her little puppet and her hurting my feelings constantly. I just can't believe she would yell at me for something that small. I know she could care less about that and doesn't value friendship, but I hope we can still be sort of friends in the future, since we are family. What do you guys suggest? Have you had an experience with a sociopath? &amp;#x200B; TL;DR: Cousin is a sociopath"

I crumbled. I screamed. I ask for help. I told them my story. I told them what I'm feeling. I told them my story. I did these while looking into their eyes. I showed them my vulnerability. But guess what? It's a trap. I never had the help they promised. I never had the hand to help me stand and the shoulder to cry on. All I got was confused gaze. Fear consumed them and the connection we had. They told me they don't understand me. They told me they don't know what to do or how to treat me after my confession. I thought I can be weak.

Initially I tried to hit on her, but backed off once she told me she was in unhappy 7 year relationship. We had a great time just talking. But after getting home, I , out of boredom, decided to exploit her vulnerability, attraction to me and excitement (it was her first time travleing alone) to cuddle with her, and I set up a meeting to do just that It went according plan. We cuddled and kissed. She definitely at times wanted to do it and even initiated it at times. I didn't force her, she wasn't drunk, but she *was* lonely and vulnerable and it was my job as human being being to stop her .Instead spent whole evening manipulating her to avoid reality of what she was doing and initiating further contact. Honestly, if it just *happened* (e.g. we were both drunk) then it wouldn't *that* big as we just cuddled + kissed 5 times. But I intentionally planned it. Yesterday I came clean about it, and she cut me off, for which I'm kind of happy. BTW, I'm not looking for absolution. Just felt that I needed to get this off my chest."

I wasn't expecting you - I told myself I'd take a year to focus on my goals and my wants for once. That was the smart thing to do, after all. It made logical sense. After four years of someone telling you that you're not logical and scolding you for being something they're not, logical sounded good. When I answered your post, I wasn't even really sure why I did it. All I knew is that it made me \*feel\* something. It had been so long since I truly felt \*something\*. You were honest and vulnerable. You were unapologetic. You seemed like an old soul, and I was immediately drawn to you. So I took a leap. Those first days were like a runaway train. We couldn't have stopped it if we tried. You told me you loved me. It was fast, but I knew I loved you too. You matched my hopes and dreams and desires one by one. You shared a tatter of your bruised soul, only a sliver, but I could tell how deep the wound went. You've lived a life - a big life. A big life that has both hurt you and grown you. I haven't lived a life that big at all. You amazed me and overwhelmed me in equal measure. The only thing that scared me was how much I wasn't scared - of our love, of you. Logically, I knew we were crazy, no one would understand! How could they? They weren't us and they didn't know what we shared. What we \*knew\*. Inside, I felt my clinical, jaded heart melt. I hadn't even realized that somewhere along the way I had started to view love as a transaction - a bill to be paid, a chore to check off the to-do list, a condition in a binding document. I let you sweep me away and cover me with your protection and adoration. Your insistence that we'd find a way despite the distance and the uncertainty of timelines and responsibilities we knew we couldn't change right now. And each sleepless night bled into the next hazy day - nothing but you on my mind. You surprised me again with flights. We had to see each other. To hold each other and kiss the lips we'd seen and thought about, but hadn't yet touched. The waiting nearly killed us! Seeing you approach in the airport was one of the sweetest memories I will ever hold. Your arms engulfed me perfectly. Our lips found each other effortlessly. I wasn't meeting you for the first time, I was meeting you \*again\*. Like I told you, this was just a continuation of a conversation we'd been having in another life. But somewhere in those few days we had together, something changed. I got scared. Suddenly you were real. Your vulnerability was real. We were real. This was real. And that meant that what we had could really go away. You could really go away. And take my softened heart with you. I started to curl up inside myself and the doubts crept in. About myself, my worthiness, my ability to care for your heart and past wounds. And I felt you curl up too, but I wasn't sure if it was because of me or because of your own demons. When you left, I felt your peace of mind leave too. You retreated into yourself - to solve a problem? To have a think? You couldn't share. You needed space. You need space, like I know I do too. But my fear got the better of me. I let the doubts run rampant. And I let you go. Because in a whiskey-soaked moment, retreating into myself - the only person who can't leave me - was more comforting than the comfort of your words, your arms, your heart. More comforting than waiting for you to open that beautiful mind of yours. And you let me. Because whiskey-soaked moments still count. Because words have significance and can't be unsaid. Because you've been through enough, and in that moment I became one more woman who let you down. There's no doubt in my mind that you are my soulmate. I felt it weeks ago, I feel it still. But I pushed you away. And there's no one I can blame for that except myself. Now I have a bruised soul too."
239,vulnerability,offmychest,"I have failed to make meaningful friendships with guys, despite trying for them.",2,dmutfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dmutfy/i_have_failed_to_make_meaningful_friendships_with/,2019-10-25 20:13:10,"This has been on my mind for a while, but it was a recent incident that really kinda jammed me in the belly. Basically, to introduce my essay, I am struggling and a bit saddened that I cant seem to form empathetic friendships with guys anymore, and part of me believes this is because I am percieved as a man, and men may have another way of having friendships... But part of me also feels I have failed to connect with them on my part as I have with women. Here is some background info about myself, which may seem too much to any readers, but it I feel its necessary to understand my honest confusion : I personally identify as a trans-masculine person. I was born a chick, in layman's terms, though I take Testosterone so I can be at peace with my mind and body. In public and with my average or not-really-gender-savvy friends, I simply call myself a guy and simplify it to female-to-Male if they ask to learn about myself and my past, because their understanding of the depths of my experience with gender isnt nearly as important as getting the bare minimum out of them. It doesnt bother me at all, not expanding on my experience of gender with them, but I will be honest that I dont really understand men on a social level, not nearly as much as I understand girls (for obvious reasons). I was raised as a gender neutral kid who happened to be a girl, gender-norms were never really a thing in my house. This isnt because they were new-age or anything, quite the opposite. I was raised by my grandparents who immigrated from communist Hungary and Romania. Gender norms are not the same over there, for systematic classic communist-reasons, but I suffered from dysphoria at an early age on a physical level. My longing for the same body as a male has very little to do with my social identification with them. Regardless, I have always craved a social relationship with men, as friends. When I was young It wasnt an issue, but I figure that this might have been because they perceived me as a girl, and while it was always platonic, they were more vulnerable around me then than they are now. Ever since my transition, it seems like a lot of guys just keep it shallow with me and wont open up with me, not even if I open up first. What really kinda got me straight confuzzled though was that recently I had my top surgery. I was memeing away about it on my social media and getting a real kick out of myself, making jokes about how I ""instantly gained XY chromosomes"" and how I immediately acquired 10 girlfriends.. just really celebrating my happiness with humor. My lady friends of course loved it, plenty of them messaged me privately to congratulate me and talk about how I was doing, making sure I was gonna get enough rest, all of that great stuff. But not a single one of my guy friends even bothered to say a whisper. It was like nothing happened at all to them, like I was a complete stranger. They just carried on with their other conversations, and I never really felt quite so defeated about it in a long time... That even when I am all cut up and sore, a little bit of vulnerability wasnt an option from them. And that isnt even about ""WAH WAH, POOR ME, PITY ME!"", it's that it seems so normal to me to message someone when something good but medically serious happens to them, and my guy friends instead reduce their conversations with me to games, politics/economics, and all of these very relevant, certainly interesting, but ultimately inpersonal things. Dont get me wrong, I am so grateful for the girls I got in my life. To have anyone care about you enough to message you and tell you they are happy for you and so stoked is an Incredible feeling. But in the end of the day, I do want to have honest connections with guys as well. I dont want to be limited to only one crowd of experience, to only have relationships with certain types of people and never any others. I cant understand why the attempts I make ain't good enough to warrant any response from them, and I cant understand why even though I know they ain't politically opposed to my choices, they dont display an inkling of concern about me. It makes me feel like it's my fault, like I am somehow unlikable to men as a more meaningful friend and I dont even know how to fix that. It doesnt just happen with those that know that I am a good ol' ""transgendaaa"" either, even those who have no idea, wont connect with me! Any advice or kind comments would be appreciated, so I might be able to move past this and decide what I have to change in my behaviour, or if I just have to accept that this is the way its going to be, and I wont really have guy friends who will entertain my open vulnerabilities, or open up to me the same."

It's only your self-destructive resentment that will condemn us both to misery. Resentment and jealousy for the differences in the circumstances that made us so alike, such difficult people. So it should be *when.* Not **if.** And not *though.* Even when the financial imbalance is mitigated, even then you will shove away the one you'd always feared was taking you for a ride, leading up to your forcing her to become the one who got away because you shoved her away from you. The one thing I told you I never wanted to be was your rebound from your borderline ex wife... but she wasn't there. It was YOU who replicated all those BPD patterns in our relationship. I should be better off without you. But I'm not, and can't believe I am or will be. We do understand each other better than anyone else can. And you're choosing to punish both of us for that, indefinitely. Vulnerability isn't a weakness. It's a strength of the deepest kind. And I am so angry, so hurt, and have so many practical things to do that I cannot be wallowing in that. I'd thought I'd left my past behind when we met, but clearly I hadn't. Now I have. Debt free, aside from the student loans. The only imbalance left will soon be the imbalance in the amount of faith I have... which is a lot more than you. Faith in myself, in you, in us, in people generally. You are no disappointed idealist. You are just wallowing in your cynicism. ***That's*** the dead weight you need to leave behind! You think you are so stubborn but with me you have been an insecure quitter. It was your resentment of my circumstances that wrought from me what you gave. I see you for what you really are. It humanizes you and makes me care all the more. I know there's not an imbalance of caring, though maybe you're a better liar, and better at lying to yourself than ever I could aspire to do, master though I thought I was once."

I was crushed and it was my first time feeling the pain of love's hammer. Took me like a month to get over her. I was sure she would've said yes. Later that year was my last heart break. It was with a girl whom I never thought I would have feelings for, but over the course of a semester I just kept feeling more and more attracted to her. We laughed a lot together and I just thought she was so cute. One night after going to a school sports game together I told her how I felt and we actually kissed. It was surreal. Every time I kised her I felt euphoria. We ended up hooking up again a few times but I had this weird feeling that I was losing her. I was so vulnerable to her moves that I couldn't get a grip on my life. One night I gave her an ultimatum between our friendship vs dating each other and she didn't like that. We got in a huge fight and broke everything off for a while (we're cool now). Immediately after all this mess I asked out this innocent girl whom I knew had a crush on me. She was super easy and I felt like I could do anything with her. She also cared for me and was super nice to my family. We ended up dating 18 months and she was my first girlfriend, but after doing long distance for a while (college) I decided I had to end it. I realized I didn't love her enough (maybe even at all) to spend so much time away from each other. I don't talk to her anymore. So, I haven't really had any feelings for anyone since that second girl. I thought maybe my heart was shielded off from that dangerous feeling of love. Fast forward to two weeks ago when this girl at my school asks me for a picnic. I thought she was so attractive and funny but never pictured me having a chance with her. Of course I said yes to her request. We ended up going for a little walk around town instead of the picnic and had so many laughs. She might be the funniest person I've ever met. She's also into so many of my hobbies and goddamn does she have a rocking body. At the end of the date I asked her what she felt and she responded well, so we made out and I left. The next week we texted a bit and had some funny conversations. I will say that those four days following our date were the most calm, happy, and relaxed days I have ever had in my life. I had no stress whatsoever and was just so happy with the direction my life had taken. It may sound wierd (and it was to me too) but I actually pictured me proposing to her one night in my head. I've never even thought about the possibility of marrying someone I know yet, but I was just so happy. Unfortunately we weren't able to hang out this week because she was out of town so I was just looking forward to the next date. We haven't really been talking the past few days and that familiar feeling of vulnerability and hopelessness that I felt with the first two girls has somewhat made a return. Today I aksed her to finally go out for that picnic but she said she's busy and the weekend would be better. I was pretty bummed because I want to hang out with her so badly, and I have a feeling that being busy is usually a bad sign. However, I really don't want to screw anything up with her so I decided to just leave her alone and give her time. I figure that if she changes her mind and isn't into me anymore there's really nothing I can do. I don't want to hurt myself. Alas, here I am again, vulnerable and longing for support. This whole situation remimds me of Wicked Game by Chris Isaak, which is a great sad song. I'm sure other people know the feelings I'm talking about so here's some love for my anonymous friends "
243,vulnerability,offmychest,My heart is in pieces. Are promises so cheap? Love and Ambition.,1,d0pvyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/d0pvyj/my_heart_is_in_pieces_are_promises_so_cheap_love/,2019-09-07 11:38:44,"Me F(23) and Him M(25) I studied abroad and met this guy there. We had a mutual interest in each other being friends and ended up dating. He told me he loved me within a week which was red flags to me spelling infatuation. But eventually, I let my guard down and fell for him. We worked really well together, similar ambition, ideals, intellectual capacity to challenge each other, comfort, intimacy, friendship and he treated me with such care. By the end, we were both in love. And even spoke about getting married and with our ambition, creating our own world together. We had a similar vision of the future and so much we wanted to achieve. We decided to do long distance (different countries), but plan to meet up at least once every 2-3 months. He and I were to determined to make it last no matter how difficult it was. He said he could never ever lose me and wanted create a future together. I could sense that his feelings were genuine. Not just through his words, but his actions, and his eyes. And I loved him back. I could feel my heart literally burning, it felt like I found the person I belong with. Even if our time together only lasted about 4 months (short, I know). When we moved back to our respective countries, things were going fine for the 10 days until his phone died (I had seen it glitching, it was truth). He was offline whatsapp for about 4 days. But didn't bother to contact me on any other medium either. In 4 days, he is online and tells me that he wants to break up. He said that he now only has focus on achieving his goals and no room for anything else. He also said that putting in the time and effort to continuously maintain that bond and trust and vulnerability is too emotionally exhausting for him. He probably realized that he is back in reality and that we were just playing house. He needs to focus on his goals and nothing else. There was no space for me in the world he wanted to create. So, he told me he did not love me anymore. In my mind, that means he committed to erasing me from his heart and chose to do what is best for him regardless of the pain it would cause either of us. It's been about 4 days since this happened. But, I love him. I love him I love him and I know that I should let it go, as it was the decision he made. And self respect for me. I love him. He is trying so hard to push my out of his world, he has that resolve seeing how straight forward he told me that he no longer loves me.... I shouldn't. hurts it hurts it hurts so much. I need somewhere to put this torrent of emotion. Also, has anyone had a similar experience? Please let me know. It will help my heart heal I hope. TL;DR My bf whom I love and made promises to me and spoke about a world we could have together, breaks up with me abruptly so pursue and focus on his goals. I still love him. Looking for others with similar experience."
244,vulnerability,offmychest,Im afraid of letting anyone in my life too close to me and I come off like I dont care.,1,d1j5rg,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/d1j5rg/im_afraid_of_letting_anyone_in_my_life_too_close/,2019-09-09 10:08:46,"My first relationship was abusive emotionally, mentally, and sexually. I was 15 the first time I dated him(19) and it lasted about a year. I dont remember all of the details from that time. Just that he would always cut me off, wouldnt let me speak, accuse me of crazy shit, and would always be trying to get me alone in his bedroom. I resisted sex the first time we dated. I dont know how I was able to keep him away, Ive blocked a lot out. All I remember is him getting on me and me just feeling so fucking frozen. It went from telling him no and facing endless berating to just numbing stuff out. I cant get hurt if I dont feel. The second time we dated I was 16 and he would have been 21. This time it was the exact same, except I got so tired of the berating. He would gaslight me you dont love me I would never deny you sex I would never treat you the horrible ways you treat me all when I would say no. I couldnt put into words why I was afraid of having sex, I just knew it felt wrong. I knew I felt threatened. It was because even outside of the sexual pressure he was a narcissistic piece of abusive shit. Nothing was right. He likes me because my main philosophy in life was making people happy and he could exploit that to whatever degree he wanted. He saw I was naive, inexperienced, fragile, and he destroyed it all. Every time he wanted sex I just had to cave. Sex would last 5 minutes, his awful panic attack inducing horrible insults, gaslighting and abuse would last 3 hours if I said no. So Id lay there and just let it happen. My anxiety melted into nothingness. Anytime I spoke to him I tried to feel nothing, thats the only way I felt I could survive. The less I spoke the less rude he was, the less I acted on something the less I did wrong, the more I stayed still the less he would attack. The more I stayed still the more I would degrade. I realize this was to keep the pain at a distance from me, to keep him from exploiting my vulnerabilities so I wouldnt hurt so much. Disassociation has become my coping mechanism. Ive gone to therapy, shes great and has given me tips and I try all I can. But this hasnt improved. I keep everyone at a distance. I dont want someone to see me suffer, fail, or be weak because deep down Im scared that any sort of vulnerability will be used against me. I dont want to hang out with friends to much, I dont want someone to be so dependent on me ever again. I was responsible every time he was angry, upset, sad or happy somehow because of the way he twisted things in his head. That weight became so heavy I felt like I was drowning. The disassociation helped but eventually everything just seemed like nothing, like I wasnt even real, I was always just dreaming. The only times Id feel truly safe would be when Im alone. I like to be alone, I dont like to talk to people much. Sometimes Ill have periods of time when I am happy and able to overcome these cloudy feelings but then some anxiety or fear pops up and triggers it to start again. I wish I could be a better friend, I wish I could be a better girlfriend. But I dont want to let people in, I dont really know how to let people in. I just want to isolate. I never want to be completely vulnerable. No one sees me without my makeup, no one sees me wearing comfortable casual house clothes, no one really sees ME I guess. I feel fucked up because I am. I do things to myself appearance wise and behavior wise to build up walls so I cant be hurt. If I look perfect, if I act perfect, then Ill be treated kindly and nothing can be used against me. But thats not how the world works. Thats not how people work. I dont know how to be a person. My boyfriend now isnt very emotionally vulnerable either, but hes never done much to make me uncomfortable. Ive had fun with him and I do love him but this is all getting in the way. I dont know how long I can keep it up. I dont know how long I can make someone happy until I crumble again. We both suck at being vulnerable. I know Im capable of having a ton of fun and being open but it just doesnt happen around him a lot. Maybe more so around friends. But I think the fun part of me subconsciously goes into hiding when Im feeling too emotionally vulnerable. We have other issues that arent solely mine, but damn I feel guilty. I hope I can be okay someday. I hope therapy can get me to overcome this. But I feel like Im being sucked into a black hole. I dont really feel alive right now and I know thats because this emotion is at its worst. My therapist says its common with severe PTSD, and I get panic attacks a lot so I guess it makes sense. I just wish I could stop blacking our in daily life out of fear. I wish I could change in a flash and erase all of those bad memories so Id never develop these ways to cope. Life isnt easy. Im fucking terrified. I just needed to get this off my chest because I cant tell anyone in real for what Im feeling because I cant let people see my vulnerability because Im a shit."
245,vulnerability,offmychest,Losing good friends sucks.,3,d22fyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/d22fyj/losing_good_friends_sucks/,2019-09-10 14:07:41,"I was a piece of shit for most of my life. I don't think it's fair to say that it's entirely my fault because I grew up in an abusive and toxic household. Everyone in my immediate family suffers from serious mental illness. On top of it, they're a bunch of crooked assholes. I had bad role models, low self esteem, and frequently suffered from intrusive suicidal thoughts. I had good friends, though. They really carried me through the hardest parts of my life. I dropped out of high school because I was bullied and depressed. Then I left my family. I was homeless for three years, but I was never on the street. I always had somewhere to go, even if it was through someone I barely knew, or a complete stranger I had to fuck for a place to sleep, or a friend of a friend I would inevitably fuck over the way I felt like I had been universally fucked over. I often sought out bad influences, which I realize now was a symptom of how I saw myself. Still, time and time again, my friends would take me back. They would forgive me even when I definitely didn't deserve it, but things weren't the same. At least in my head, I couldn't forgive myself or accept that they really did, either. The guilt ate me alive. I was always on some emotional bender and never fully abandoned the prospect of suicide. As we got older, a lot of them just started dropping me. I couldn't blame them, but of course I did anyway. That's how egos work, right? Eventually, I started to gain a semblance of structure in my life. By the beginning of 2018 I was enrolled in my local state college, had my own room in an apartment, and had reconnected with one of the most positively influential people in my life. We'll call them H. I was also in a horrible on and off relationship that I was reluctant to finally end because I didn't want to be alone. I still struggled heavily with my self image, identity, and general emotional/ financial stability, so I really didn't think I deserved any better anyway. H was probably one of the coolest friends I ever had. I really looked up to them a lot, but I also resented them. They had a very good life (attractive, intelligent, both of their parents were doctors so they were well off and could easily afford many things I considered luxuries). They helped me a lot when I had less than nothing. However, they also led me on romantically and took advantage of my vulnerability. I'm still convinced that they weren't helping me out of kindness, but because helping someone who would never rise above them boosted their ego. They were incredibly nit-picky and I never felt entirely comfortable in my skin around them because I always knew I was being evaluated. I used to think that I was in love with them, but now I realize that what I felt was more closely akin to how you might feel towards an older sibling that you really admire (despite H actually being younger than me). They were creative, funny, and magnetic. I felt (and still feel) that we had a lot of abstract qualities in common. Despite my grudge, I was extremely happy to have this person back in my life. Then, I met the person who would later become my partner (and still is, we'll call them B). When I met B, I immediately knew that I had to leave the person I was dating. I broke up with that person on my birthday at H's encouragement. That same day, H and I went to meet up with B. When B sat down next to me at the restaurant, H was an absolute fucking asshole. The whole night, they just kept laying down power moves and possessiveness over me. It was making me uncomfortable because I knew H and I were platonic (I mean, physically at least) but I was really interested in B. In the weeks that followed my breakup, I was volatile. I felt more alone than I had in a long time, and guilty for how I left the person I was with for someone new even though we were unhappy and unhealthy. I unloaded a lot of my emotional baggage on H, and our relationship became strained and distant. H had moved several hours away to attend university and I went to visit them over break. The plan was to stay for a week. That same week, B left the country to do volunteer work in an impoverished country and we weren't able to communicate. I don't remember too much from the week I spent with H except that I was an absolute fucking disaster. Being completely vulnerable and in H's space, I regressed. I remember standing in their kitchen and out of nowhere, unprovoked, I just started crying. I wasn't in therapy and I had so many unresolved issues that were all surfacing at once. I was not yet fully excommunicated from my abusive family and I carried a lot of anguish from their impact on my life. I was convinced that when B returned from their trip, their feelings for me would have changed. H's perfectly curated home juxtaposed with my shit in duffel bags on their bedroom floor kept bringing me back to the same scenario years before, when I was homeless. Even though the circumstances of me being there were different, I didn't have the skills to separate my reality from those feelings. Two days before I planned to leave, before H woke up in the morning, I quickly packed my things and left. As I left, I knew in my heart it was the last time I would see them, but I left anyway. I texted them a few times apologizing and trying to have normal conversation, but they never responded. When I got home, I got a haircut and set out to find a therapist. H didn't talk to me for over a week. I think when they called, it was actually as I was on my way to my first therapy appointment. The conversation was brief and strained, but they were glad I was going to therapy. After that, we sort of started talking again, but our relationship was not the same. They would not talk to me about what happened and it hurt me very much that this person who I felt so close to and who knew me as intimately as they did, did not understand or care what was going on in me emotionally. We went from always texting, to them rarely responding, and I was paranoid and irritated and my reactions gave them every reason to justify not talking to me. They finally did ask me to stop talking to them and told me that they didn't want me in their life. I tried reaching out a few times after that, but then they blocked me. We haven't spoken since. However, B and I developed a very beautiful and loving relationship that is still going strong. They have been the most patient, supportive, and understanding partner you could ever imagine. Sometimes my face hurts from smiling about how lucky I am to have them in my life. It's not even exaggerating to say that nobody has ever treated me as well as they do. Our communication is amazing and I don't have any doubt about my importance in their life, or theirs in mine. I've taken lessons from my past and made it a point to get a grip on my emotions. The past \~two years I spent in therapy has helped me immensely. I graduated with honors with my AA and transferred to my dream school this semester. Now, I'm attending the best university in my state. I'm extremely proud to be here. I worked so fucking hard for it and there's no downplaying that. I'm majoring in something I'm very excited about and challenged by. The only thing bogging me down is that it's the same university as H. I know that H and I will never be friends again. I'm not the same person they knew, and I don't think I would want to know them anymore either. Sometimes though, when I'm alone, I really miss them. This has been often lately because I'm having a hard time making friends and my partner is so far away. I'm more introverted than I've ever been, and I don't feel like my experience in life is something that a lot of my peers can relate to. I wish things could be different. I'm really embarrassed by my past behavior and I hope that even though we will never be friends, maybe if H ever sees me in passing, they will feel proud of how far I've come. I know that I was not always an easy person to get along with, and even though I have chilled out a lot, I don't feel willing to open up enough to develop new meaningful relationships. That's why my partner is the only real friend I have. It's not like I enjoy feeling like such an other. I didn't get to choose the cards I was dealt, and it just so happens that I got a really shitty hand. What do you do with a shitty hand? You get shit everywhere. But I have grown so much. Things are objectively better now, and they will keep getting better as long as I stay on track. I hope I'll make some friends. I'll probably delete this, but if you read it, u rock."

Your vulnerability. If I'm one of 10, tell me. If you only want me for sex, tell me. If you're only ever going to hit and quit. Tell me. If you value me for other reasons, tell me what they are. Tell me what your fantasy life looks like. Is it going to orgies forever and constantly finding broken women to fix? Is it finding your equal and growing old with them? I need to know these things about you. I need to know what place you see for me in your life. That way, I can decide if that place looks good to me. I have a place for you in my life. Let me know when you want to talk about it."

She always approached everything with a badass attitude and overcame whatever was thrown at her. If I was in a bad situation when I was younger, she was sympathetic but yet ""get over your shit and fix the problem"". I really admired that growing up. Most people react to difficult situations with an emotional reaction. She taught me to be logical, level-headed, strong, and resilient. Recently, she just moved away for work. Her company got bought out, but she was offered a new position with the new one. She uprooted her life in a state that she's lived in for 40 years to work until retirement. She has 4 years left. It wasn't her most ideal choice, but she regarded it as the most safe considering companies (although they say they don't) discriminate on age and really try not to hire people in their late 50's. She went from being a ""suburbanite"" to a urbanite in a matter of months. When she moved, she was having a lot of health issues mostly due to her hiatal hernia and her hip problems. She was getting sick frequently--symptoms of acid reflux and coughing fits. Her hip was fucking with her so badly after walking a mile and back from work. She told me stories of when she was limping and could barely walk home. Stories of how she couldn't sleep all night because of how bad her heartburn and acid reflux was. How tired and in pain she was all of the time. It made me feel sad. She's been telling me stories like this since she moved there, and it makes me so fucking sad. Then tonight, she told me how she's not doing well at work. How her boss pulled her aside and told her she didn't show up well against the other people in her department. How she can't get a good grasp on the projects and the way that the company does their research. She was being judged at work by one of the senior leaders in her department. She knew this because her boss told her this. And the guy who's talking shit rides the train home with the head of the department. They recommended that she takes online classes to improve her skills. She fears that she's going to end up in one those corporate training classes which is basically the kiss of death in most companies. Essentially, people will always regard you as incompetent if you make it out of those classes, and if you don't, you're likely to get fired. She said, ""I didn't move away from my life to fail. I can't believe I left that life. I miss it so much. I wish I didn't give it all up for this."" And it just fucking made me so sad. I feel like I'm sort of watching her crumble physically and emotionally ""in front my eyes"". I'm upset for her. Sad that she's going through this. Shocked by looking at the vulnerability of my mother, the one who was always so strong. It makes me feel so weak and helpless. I wish I could help her, but I obviously can't. I can't do anything but watch her just struggle through the portion of her life. I hope she gets better. I really love my mom."

You systematically broke me down, destroyed my self-esteem and self worth. You ruined my trust in people and make me question myself, my life choices and who I have become, everyday. In the quiet hours of the night I hear your words of torment that you have both long forgotten. When I finally sleep, my dreams torment me awake, struggling for breath as I sit up in the stillness of night. It must be funny when people see how jumpy I am at the slightest sound, how I fumble over my words, how out of touch I must seem. But to me it's the stinging reminder of the permanent marks your touch has left on me. I often imagine how the world would tick on without me, how restful that unknowable darkness would be. Yet I can't pull the trigger on this decision because of all of the people I have met in my life that have saved my opinion of humanity. Even in death you will haunt me as you both are haunted by your parents. And to me it's easier to bury the pain down deep and continue the daily masquerade than to unpack the misery in front of another face that could weaponize my vulnerability against me. So here I am, posting a long, rambling diatribe to strangers on the internet with the barest of context. But thank you all the same for listening."

your work schedule is crazy. always has been, nothing new. we agreed that work is important, and that no matter what, if you really want something, youd work for it. now that work has taken all of your attention, i feel unimportant. all the fucking time. and you know this. ive told you once before. i even went as far as crying in your arms about it. even then, after youve seen every point of vulnerability in me, nothing has changed. we dont text every hour of the day anymore. you havent responded to me since 12 pm yesterday. you dont tell me anything anymore. never tell me whats wrong, how your day went, what you did that day, if you ate. i live off of that. we used to tell each other all the time about how our days went. its what we thrived off of. now that i dont have that anymore, now that i dont have your attention or interest, i feel simply unwanted. ive convinced myself i am unwanted and theres nothing i could do about it in perspective. my last text to you was about this, and like i said, you havent responded. todays our 11 months. please say something. im going to lose my mind if you dont. im not texting you after what i said yesterday. you need to answer that and reassure me as your girlfriend, your friend, whatever. im convinced that you dont want to deal with me. my doctors tell me that i have very high stress levels and ive been told i have mild depression in april of 2018. you deal with the worst of it, to say the least. you cared at first to hear what was going on with me, now you make excuses as to how you cant respond to me because of work or because you were out all day. legitimate excuses, but youre on your phone all the time. remember that ive studied you like a book for the past year. if you want to leave me, simply say so. im so tired. im tired of, going every day wondering if this is what you want. if i really am benefitting from you. i see so much in you. you have changed me as a person, and i have never, ever been this close to anyone. no one has seen me the way you have. so much money, time, and emotion put into this fiasco, and you give it all up because you have a ten hour shift the next day. ive had the feeling that youve tried to break up with me on several occasions. you know im soft, but i hate being lied to. i hate being strung along. just fucking say it. im legitimately tired of waiting. id never have the heart to break up with you myself. i dont want to leave you and miss you. leave me, so i can miss you appropriately. whenever you try to break away, i tell you to elaborate. and you never do. youre such a fucking coward. an angry, confused, coward. put your cowardliness aside and just do it. or maybe its fear; put your fear aside. what is there to fear though? youre not losing someone who has any significant meaning to anyone. i am a girl who cant handle her own nerves. i cant handle certain situations of life. i constantly sink into the abyss of the dark, must i say ive become so comfortable there. im stressed that im so comfortable. im stressed because im going to break any minute now. i hate this feeling of being tossed to the side. my friends constantly have to remind me that theyre by my side. but wheres the love of my life? not here. deleting your messages after hours because you never respond. when you do, its something full of air. and im sick of it. do something or leave me alone. im tired. you should be too. i hope you know this isnt normal. making someone feel that theyre a second choice ( or last, even.) isnt normal."
252,vulnerability,offmychest,Thinking about my ex,2,d5xl88,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/d5xl88/thinking_about_my_ex/,2019-09-18 23:12:00,"This is a very long post, and I dont even care if anyone reads it but I need to let it out. Its strange. I have no desire to speak to him, but I have been thinking about him pretty often over the last week or so. I felt anger towards him for a very long time about how he treated me, although he wasnt abusive like other boyfriends had been in the past. He was just indecisive, insecure, and too terrified of being unsuccessful. The fear was almost irrational, especially for someone like him. He was rude sometimes, grumpy, moody, and took most of this out on me. Hed get too wrapped up in his work then blame me for breaking his concentration, even though I was understanding of how hard he had to work in order to get to where he needed to be. In the end, I was ready to let him go but I remained in love with him for awhile afterwards. I never could quite figure out if I was just genuinely upset over losing him or if I felt the way that I did because I wasnt the one to initiate the ending. Sometimes I think it was the latter and it makes me wonder if I ever really loved him at all. In the past, I thought about the times that made me feel anger or embarrassment. The dinner with his family when I accidentally dropped food on the tablecloth. No one was upset, but I could feel his silent judgement. His lack of communication, almost inability. His birthday dinner with his friends, how I was the only girl and everyone talked to me like I was more of a decoration. How we never did anything together because he was too busy. I can count the times on both hands and we were together for 6 months. That he only wanted me to come over at night, even on the weekends. I felt more like a bootycall than a girlfriend, and when I told him that he said Im sorry, it is what it is. So I compromised. That when he broke up with me, he did it while we were in bed together a week after meeting my family. He could barely get the words out. He told me later that he knew at that dinner that it was over, but he met my family anyways because he knew It was important to me. I wouldve rather he dumped me an hour before that dinner than wait until a week after. Then after he broke up with me, he asked me to stay with him, then took advantage of my vulnerability, kissed me, and had sex with me afterwards. I tried to leave that night, but he wouldnt let me. And even after we broke up, the calls still continued. I was so beyond heartbroken that I kept going back. Every time I did, I foolishly believed that hed tell me that he was wrong, that he wanted to be with me. I kept sleeping with him until I was strong enough to say no. And then we got back together. And then we broke up again. And the last time was almost just like the first. Out of nowhere. Strained communication beforehand led to confused emotions and me knowing exactly what was going on, but he insisted things were fine. Then he dumped me the day before my final. There were so many red flags that I ignored. I had so many signs, and yet I ignored them all. I look back on who I was then and what I put up with and I think, Why? Just why. For a long time when I was still angry, I thought he was a bad person. Now I just know that I wasnt the one and thats why things ended like they did. I was always pretty good at reading him, which surprised him because no one had ever put him in his place about his toxic personality traits before, and towards the end of our relationship I said to him, Youre having trouble right now because you love me, but you dont know if Im the one. The words took a lot of courage for me to say because I knew that there was a pretty good chance that he would affirm what I said, which he did. And it was funny when he actually did say yes, because I was surprised. Surprised by my own observation because I desperately wanted to be wrong. I shouldve known then, but when I tried to leave he told me that he didnt mean it. That he didnt care about anything, he loved me and he just wanted me to stay. That I was the only thing good in his life, that I kept him grounded, that he needed me. I believed him. But this isnt really what I think of now. I had a dream last night about him. He was helping people sign these forms in a courtyard at our old university, and he asked me to be there because he liked talking to me. I could tell that a lot of time had passed since the last time we saw each other in this dream. There was no animosity, no romance we were just friends. I woke up in a strange haze. Like I said, I have no desire to speak with him, much less he his friend. Sometimes though, I do think about him. I have a pretty good sense for things, and I think we will run into each other again. Of course, when we forget about each other and are much, much older. Our relationship will not resume, but we will sit with each other again and find ourselves able to appreciate the other for what we have become and that will be it. I am trying to let go of my anger for him, and I think that I have for the most part, but I am also afraid of thinking too fondly of him because I dont want to later feel inclined to reach out. The last time I spoke to him, he told me that he was seeing someone and because I was still in love with him, blinded by foolishness, I asked him to tell me that he didnt love me anymore. That was unfair, but I was being selfish and I needed to have a reason to let him go. So he said it. I dont love you anymore. It took him a long time to say it and he looked very sad to, which I can imagine is because its an odd and hard thing to say to someone who obviously still has feelings for you. He told me hell always care about me, that hell always be there for me, and I could feel the genuine tenderness between us but I knew I could never take him up on it. I dont know why Ive been thinking of him. Maybe because we met almost a year ago to the day. It was my dads birthday. I didnt see it coming. I guess you never do. I think I loved him. Sometimes I dont know though. I dont really think that it matters so much anymore. But Ive been thinking of him. Hes going to Paris soon for the fall. He told me once that he thinks of me whenever someone brings up Ernest Hemingway. I guess hell think of me when hes there, like he said he did when he was reading The Sun Also Rises, pretending that we were Brett and Jake. It wouldve never happened. Hes on my mind today. I hope it passes. I hope hes well. And I hope that neither of us will be angry anymore."
253,vulnerability,offmychest,A different breakup,1,d63z4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/d63z4n/a_different_breakup/,2019-09-19 07:03:06,"Hey all, quick story: I was dating a wonderful woman since February of last year and overall things were going well. Wed get into arguments on how I handle manifestations of my anxiety/OCD and my partner would frequently express her doubts of being able to handle it. Any time things would be rough for a while, this talking point always came up. Things were going well since I started seeing a therapist again, learning not to betray boundaries with her and working on using her as a means of coping with stress. But we made dinner last night and she became silent. We began exploring and the subject came up again: I dont know about our relationship because of your mental health. She said she has been trying to make herself happy with me for a while now. She feels like she hasnt been happy for a bit. Based on her physiological reactions (sobbing, hyperventilating and shaking), I believe she has been holding this in for a long time now. It killed her to finally tell me that she hasnt been happy. It struck like a cold lightening bolt in my chest and the ice cold feeling coursed through my arms, stomach and travelled down my body. It hurts. The pain is real. Im not running from it, Im not avoiding it. I am fucking sad. I love her so much. Because of this though I feel like I have to let go and move on. If she feels like she cannot handle my mental health, I will respect that because thats her choice. Not 15 minutes into work today, two coworkers asked me if I was okay because I seemed off. I immediately started sobbing at my desk and sought refuge in the restroom stall, making sure to mask my sobs when other men came in. I opened up to my boss and we chatted in the conference room for over an hour and she provided some good insight and advice. Ive established support with my room mates and explained how I am going to need them for a while to feel okay. Right now, my partner and I decided to take a week to see if this is something we can salvage, but I dont think it is because this is something that has come up multiple times in the past. Matter of fact, I have been exactly where she was last night in college with one of my old partners. I refused to acknowledge the reality of our dissipating relationship. And it came out very violently (sobbing, shaking and hyperventilating) at the end. I know how she feels and it may arguably be worse than what Im experiencing. I fundamentally believed that something was wrong with me at the time of this breakup circa 2016. Why cant I hold down a relationship? What is wrong with ME that caused this relationship to fail? It took me a long time to realize that there isnt anything wrong with me, we were just incompatible. It took a lot of self-reflection, therapy and time to realize this. I had no support from my friends, mainly because I never opened up. I didnt want to seem weak and show vulnerability and dependence. But this breakup is different. Shortly after leaving her house, I knew it wasnt because of me as a person. I didnt blame myself or reduce myself to a mental disorder. I didnt think that there was something inherently wrong with me. It was just sadness. Cold. Fucking. Sadness. The tragedy of it all. We had such a good relationship, social life and sexual life, but we were different from each other. I experienced mental health issues frequently while shes never known anyone who has struggled with anxiety/ OCD. This pain is awful. I know there are going to be times in the near future where Im going to miss her and smell her and see her and be reminded of her. Im going to find various objects of hers in my house and its going to set me back. I will allow myself to feel everything I am going to feel. I plan to use this time to nurture myself and learn more about myself. I just want to type out the internal monologue for all the men in the future who will go through this. I want everyone here to know that pain, loss and sadness are universal emotions that we are entitled to feel as humans in this world. With all this being expressed, lets chat. What has helped you heal from breakups in the past? What should I try? What should I avoid? Thank you all for reading all of this, and a TL;DR is necessary I suppose for those in a crunch: TL;DR: breakup = mesadnolikey, what do now?"

I've seen it all. Everything that comes with that. Growing up I never went the gangster/thug route but I did learn to not care about anything or not develop any attachment. I'm always ready to lose anything. I knew anything nice I have could be stolen or broken. With my family and friends I've always been the one to make the hard decision or do what needs to be done. As far as friendship and loyalty goes. I'm loyal to the end but if anybody does something to show any slight disloyalty to me they are dead to me and I don't care about them anymore. It's all black and white. All my friends praise me for always being there. I'm used to dealing with extremely high pressure situations. I've had guns and knives held at me and felt nothing. No change, no fear. My heart rate didn't even speed up. I've lost lots of friends to gun violence and haven't cried over anything. It's just the way it is. I'm not a sociopath by any means. But I have watch someone get killed and it didn't affect me. If I felt somebody needed to die. I could kill them and I wouldn't lose any sleep over it. I just have a very tough exterior. I wouldn't even call it a mask I put up. Because this is just how I am. I'm currently in my 20s and up until recently this hasn't been a problem. I lived in the same bad area. Been through lots of stuff. At one point when I was 15-17 I was fighting people probably at least 3 days a week. To this day if somebody suddenly lifts their arms around me I raise my hand to punch back and usually scare them. I don't think I can ever unlearn this behavior. I've never had a girlfriend, been on a date or even kissed a girl and I've never wanted to. I'm definitely attracted to girls but just within that world I was in. The thought of relationships never crossed my mind. I was in survival mode. And I just saw it as liability. Now like I said everything has been okay. But recently I moved out of my area. Got a job in a different area and did some college and met lots of new people. I didn't even realize that my life was so scary to the average person. I became friends with a group of upper middle class artsy people. Got really close to this girl in the group. We talked a lot about our lives to each other and just hearing the huge difference. She'd never even seen a gun before in real life. Never been in a fist fight. Just simple stuff like that. Honestly in a way I felt extremely lucky. Running from a drive by shooting sounds way easier to deal with than anxiety and emotional damage. I've never had time to stop and worry about depression. I just wanted to live through the day I'm starting to. I don't even know how to explain this but feel things. It's all new to me. I'm not even feeling things for a specific person. One of my newer friends gave me a big hug the other day after a good talk and I felt scared and so good at the same time. When her arms went around me my fight instincts kicked in but I resisted them and for the first time felt anxiety I guess? But also at the same time I felt the best I've ever felt. Like just years of tension being relieved. Earlier today I was watching a movie and there was a scene where they hugged for a long time and I replayed it multiple times. It's just all been hitting me at once this past month. When I'm falling asleep I imagine my close friend hugging me. I randomly called my mom and told her that I loved her and thanked her for everything. I'm not used to this feeling at all. It's seriously terrifying. I can get shot and and not flinch but the idea of hugging or kissing or even holding someone's hand just fills me with anxiety and discomfort. Makes me feel like I'm going to die by doing this somehow. I don't like anything that puts me in a position of vulnerability or weakness. This post feels very rambly. But I had to just type this out before I sleep."
255,vulnerability,offmychest,An unsent letter,1,dal1q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dal1q4/an_unsent_letter/,2019-09-29 06:00:53,"My dear angel monkey, We've known one another for only a short while, but it feels like a lifetime. Those first days together were unbelievable. Our conversations skipped right over the mundane, and instead we touched on what seems like every big subject, whether of a cosmic nature or a personal one. We walked arm in arm (both smiling for a change) and would cuddle on the grass in the shade of the trees afterward. You felt protected and safe in that physical intimacy; I, accepted, and vulnerable in a good way. When we were caught by surprise by the rain that one time we fled the scene laughing, and then I loaned you some dry clothes to wear. The hoodie (comically large on you) you wore pretty much constantly over the following weeks, as you later confided in me. When you asked that day if you could take said hoodie home with you, accompanied by the remark ""Guess I'll have to come over soon, to give it back"", I didn't dare hope. You see, I've been lonely for damn near a decade now. There have been some women in my life - but ever since that fledgling romance of my late teens, nothing that went anywhere. It seems there's something off about me, romantically, something that scares people off. Don't let me burden you with my speculations though; this letter will be dense enough without them. I have actively avoided dating for over three years now. Partly out of a gossamer-thin thread of hope that I might change for the better - and god knows I've been working hard to that end - and partly out of a certain resignation. You see, whether there's something wrong with my character, or I'm a result of my upbringing, or my mental health issues are to blame: I've been screwed up in this way for so long that it's unlikely I'll ever come out the other end 'normal'. But then, there you were. The one who proved wrong all my longheld, self-limiting beliefs. Though I'd decided never to let myself be vulnerable again, you made me change my mind. And not too long afterward... you proved me right. Love isn't something I'm likely ever to know. I know I'm not entitled to it, and some days I don't even think I deserve it. But still, I had a glimmer of hope left - and now even that is gone. I'm a broken man. I don't blame you. Like I said, I'm not entitled to love, yours or anyone else's. It's good that you recognized your own wants and needs, and no one can expect you to make these choices based on any motivation other than a purely personal one. Besides, you couldn't have known how spectacularly the entire affair was going to mess me up - I know I didn't, beforehand. I never meant for you to be my salvation. I'm not that naive. Or am I? Was it hope, or was it naivity, that prompted me to let you in? I knew the dangers of vulnerability. I just never expected you to be the one to hurt me this badly. Either way, you have proven to be the opposite of salvation to me. Our decision to move on as friends was doomed from the beginning. You, unwittingly flirting and teasing; me, utterly well-behaved until those inevitable late-night conversations of ours, where I would slowly break down and treat you like my therapist, my best friend and my worst enemy, all rolled into one. I managed to refrain from lashing out, assigning blame, or (god forbid) pleading and begging; but still I burdened you, and hurt you. Five days ago I broke off contact, to protect both you and myself. (This letter is one intended for you never to get to read.) Today I cleared our chats and messages, unfriended and unfollowed you, and deleted your details. But I didn't, couldn't, block your number. Twisted and pathetic though it is, I suppose there's some hope left in me still. Please don't call. Please call. Please don't call. Love, Your goose man"

Purely by choice. Ive had a lot of people interested but I havent wanted to date for a few years. Why? Emotional vulnerability terrifies me and I have trust issues. I only now am coming to terms with this. Ive put up all types of emotional walls to defend myself. I convinced myself that I would be happy being single forever when deep down I knew I wanted someone to love. My first long term relationship was toxic. My second long term relationship was with someone who only gave me scraps of attention and long story short didnt care about me all that much. Its been a couple of years since Ive decided not to date. Then I suddenly decided to try again. I met someone I am head over heels for and I dont want to mess it up. Problem is that Im terrified. I am all in and all that I want to do is cherish him. But I am so afraid that he is going to break my heart. I hate feeling so vulnerable.

My wife lied to me constantly. She told me she had a work trip, she went to another state to see a friend she used to to be an addict. She told me she was seeing an old friend, she met up with an ex. She told me she would always be there for my children, she would leave for weekends and days at a time. She told me she would always handle money in a different way than her father, she racked up a massive 25k. She told me she never cheated on me, she cheated. She told me my children never met the guy she cheated on me with, they did. My wife is a horrible judge of character and has no sense of judgement. She created a hidden series of social media accounts depicting her in sexual vulnerability, surrounded by images and videos and comments objectifying her. She did not see that her children could see this. She called her children lairs for saying they met whom she cheated with. She is despicable. She created more lies to cover up lies. I dont hate my wife. Shes gone now. I am free, she can be his problem now, I can finally live. He can discover for himself what evil looks like, he can deal with her shit. I am done being abused as a husband. I cant wait for happy divorce day. I will throw a party, invite everyone I know, put up a sign, for everyone to read. Happily divorced her come on in and drink to me. Freedom, I can feel it. Now I can finally start to live again. And all thanks to the guy she cheated on me with. Cheers to you bud, you did me a favor."

Im not religious either. I just know he is with me. I spent half of high school and college grieving and right after I lost my grandpa, I lost my uncle. Both fatherly figures to me. Its hard every day. I still cry seeing pictures of him. But I know hes watching over me. If anyone is grieving please know its normal. Its not a weakness or vulnerability, it is normal. I hope everyone understands how important your life truly is. Dont take anything for granted because it can be gone in an instant. A lot of my friends asked me why I wont do drugs...well I watched my uncle stroke out multiple times. I watched the after effects of an OD and substance abuse for years. So, I have made it a duty to not turn to drugs, ever. I hope some of you take this story as a lesson and warning. My heart still aches everyday. Drugs are not a joke or a good time. They kill. On that depressing note, I hope everyone has a good day. Be grateful, be humble, and be kind. Always."

Pride is coming up in a few weeks and as much as im not going to go crazy, im going to stop holding myself back and just have fun! Dean, even if it doesnt turn into something sexual, just be free to have conversations with people who before youd avoid because you thought they were too good for you. im a talented, kind, charismatic individual who just needs to bust out of these metaphorical chains and own who he is"
260,vulnerability,offmychest,I am broken.,2,cpq5kq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/cpq5kq/i_am_broken/,2019-08-13 18:20:54,"Adam and I knew each other growing up. When we started dating, (after we both went through bad marriages, unhealthy relationships, loss of a parent growing up), we found out we lived practically parallel lives. We started talking (at 39 &amp;amp; 40) and realized he lived four houses down from me until he was 9 or 10 or so. We both lost our dads - about a year apart. Way too soon. We married our ex-spouses on August 2 and August 3, same year. We built and moved into our houses the same week (miles apart). My dad died on his dads birthday. Theres so much stupid shit that we shared, just weird parallel lives type of shit. I let myself believe there was meaning in all of this. Before this, I was a pragmatic, logical, keep you at arms length type of woman. I dont equate sex with love. I have never had an issue just doing what feels good at the moment and having no regret afterward, no sentimental type feeling after someone makes me cum. None of that. After my separation with my ex husband, shit didnt change who I was at the core; when it came to having a connection with someone, being able to fun night of laughter, ridiculous stories/experiences, followed by great sex never seemed to affect me in a way I saw most people experience. Its how Im wired, I thought. For the last two years, he was who I wanted. More than anything. I am a flirt by nature and have somewhat of a history of the grass seems greener (or the dick seems better) mentality but with Adam, I could flirt but never thought once I would follow down that road, I gave him my all. Everything. When I think back through my relationships in my past, I-had a tendency to keep one foot out the door. This. Was. Different. I actively stepped outside my comfort zone because I finally realized that I cant continue that way and expect someone else to give me his all when I cant find that part of me Until tonight, I thought he was the exception to my view most relationships are shit. He was kind. He was supportive. He was level headed. He was sweet. He remembered details. He didnt yell or swear at me when he was upset or angry. He was gentle and he was right there to calm me down when my sleeping subconscious took ahold and turned my dreams into nightmares that I somehow lived through. He wasnt insecure. He assured me that he wouldnt leave when my PMS hormones turned me into the watered down version of the antichrist. I saw him in every part of my future. After what seemed like a long time (6-8 months), I introduced him to my kids. My daughter was about to graduate college and I wanted her to love the heart I thought I saw in him. My son (13 years old) kept his distance but in the last 6 months or so, he (my son) opened up and shared things that I could not fathom. He became ethans favorite.closest friend. I got used to them palling me around. I could see their motives but not understand their tactics. There is always the fear of rage. But more than that, they need us for something. My burden unfortunately is to figure that out. While a lot of people enjoy the strange hospitality of these judges, most dont understand how much theyre fucking themselves and are just fine with that. Also (to the OP) I misjudged you. You are a warrior. sadness and shock took over and The empty void in my gut will be what kills me, but hopefully I can redeem myself enough to see everyones pain dissipate. It feels like I already took it all. II will never be able to forgive myself for letting someone in my kids lives. This hurts so much and my son loving him after this long period of time is just too much. I can fail myself but failing my children because of my lack of keeping my head together and not protecting their vulnerability is indescribable. He will talk about him for a long time. I just dont know how to explain this to anyone. I dont understand. tl;dr I let every hesitation I had about relationships go. I was right before."

Tonight we tried to bake brownies back at his house but the pan was too big for the mixture so it came out as this weird, spongy, thin brownie brittle. I (tried) to play the piano and sang as he played along on his euphonium. I stayed a bit late and we tried to dance in the dark with no music before my mother had to come pick me up. What was my favorite thing to do with him though? 10/10 letting him kiss me and call me beautiful. He is so precious and I am so proud of him and just being able to say My boyfriend is amazing every time. He is a big time horror fan and I am very easy to scare but I love musical theater so he insisted the watched Mary Poppins Returns instead of some horror movie. That alone let me know that he loves me. Its just in every thing he does. Even just the way he looks at me sometimes it just... It overwhelms my senses and... I really like this feeling. I hate feeling vulnerable (like everyone else) but... This is a really nice kind of vulnerability. I dont ever remember being this head-over-heels for anybody, ever. He is so different and I see a future with him. He is my favorite person and I would give anything in the world for him. He makes me feel like I can do anything. I love this boy more than words and I am going to give him the best life I can when I get a job. He is worth so much more than anything I could buy, say, or write for him. He is truly one of the best things in my life. Peyton, I know you lurk on Reddit so if you see this, please never ever forget how much I love you."
262,vulnerability,offmychest,The idea of old men is VERY appealing,2,cpqjoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/cpqjoe/the_idea_of_old_men_is_very_appealing/,2019-08-13 19:07:55,"Hi reddit! This is going to be a ramble - so buckle up. I (17F) have a pretty good life. My circumstances used to be... not the greatest. But things are better now, and while theyre far from perfect I have so much to be grateful for. I have friends. I have a good mom. I have other adult mentors in my life to look up to and talk to. But I still feel very lonely despite this. Im sure its a universal feeling, to feel lonely despite being in a good place. Does that feeling ever go away once youve found the person? Or is it just always there despite whos in your life? My sister (19F) just got together with her first boyfriend (23M) - the first guy with a title implying commitment at least. She loves him, sees a future with him and feels like they can talk about anything. We were at a coffee shop and I was reflecting on my own experiences with boys. I havent had a crush in years, and I really do want a boyfriend. I like myself and I feel like boys would like me. Men, even. Im so attached to the notion of maturity and age being mutually exclusive. Its strange, because I know Im mature for my age to an extent, but I also know it doesnt matter. Im a kid either way, I lack life experience and the world is much bigger than I am. Listening to a podcast doesnt undo that. However, Im almost obsessed with the idea of older men. Older men who have their life figured out. I want to feel both understood but intrigued by what he has to say. I want to feel like I can finally be listened to. But I also dont want the disconnect that comes with the age gap - which is an inherent factor to large age gaps in a relationship. But I also know that when the fantasy fades and practicality dictates, it just wont work. It doesnt matter how mature I am for my age. Im still a 17 year old girl and I dont have anything figured out. I think a lot, and so maybe I process more deeply than other people my age. I dont know. But all in all, Im really no different. If he loves me back, hes a predator who seeks vulnerability for whatever fucked up reason. Gross - ironically a turn off. (And Ill tell on him.) So I think the answer is to date and feel kind of unfulfilled for a bit. Teenage boys suck, but everyones gotta have a shitty boyfriend just to go through it. Its not gonna be all bad. He can make me laugh, feel appreciated, we can do fun things together - I just know he wont be everything I want. That doesnt mean it wont be valuable. Some people might suggest waiting but Ive had this looming suspicion that I might die before 30 - and so I think Ill just try it out to cross it off my bucket list. And for those who are wondering, my dad isnt present but it also doesnt bother me, I dont hate him and I have my closure (; So yeah. I like the idea of men who could have daughters my age. But it doesnt go past the idea, thank god my loneliness isnt that crippling. Thanks for reading."

A mush-post. A mind-dump, if you will. I just... I really feel like I need to tell someone. My goodness. What can I do? I've been so head-over-heels with this girl I met last year in a club. She said something as a joke, like a ""We should go on a date sometime,"" which took me aback a little. But we just laughed it off. After that moment, though, I could not get her out of my head. Inexplicably. Next thing I know, it's been months into this crush and I'm always catching myself looking around the hallway or at social events to see if she's there. I catch myself feeling giddy when she talks to or stands right next to me. I catch myself remembering the smallest and most random details from times we hang out or from hallway conversations. I catch myself crying when I see her crying and all I want to do is make her happy. I've gotten the impression that I'm kind of aloof in my friendships, but I just get so soft and nice around her-- I swear, I'm, like, a different person around her. I like how down-to-earth and smart and kind she is. She's one of those people that get more and more attractive the more you get to know them. She makes me want to be a better person just by existing. I've never felt this strongly for anyone before and certainly not for this long. There are times during breaks away from school and weekends when I can control how much of her I want to see online, and it's in those moments am I relieved in thinking that maybe I've finally gotten over her. *Thank God, I won't be so anxious all the time.* I won't have to feel broken, so messy. I feel like I've got myself ""together"". Then I see her either in someone's post or see something that reminds me of her (a lot of things do apparently) and suddenly my efforts unfurl and I find myself falling for her all over again. It's a vicious cycle of falling, self-doubt, self-loathing, then... nothing. A little sadness and hurt, maybe. Then it's back to feeling everything the second I see her again. I so want to be with her and simultaneously am so scared to. I don't want people to assume they know who I am... what I am. I'm not even quite sure what I am. Maybe I'm just too reluctant to be honest with myself. My parents have told me that me liking girls would be a ""waste of beauty"". I'm not gay. I'm not straight. I'm figuring things out, and I don't really want to label anything right now. However, I *do* know one thing: I really like her. She seems to consume my thoughts and emotional attention everyday. It's been a year which isn't too long but certainly too long for it to be just a momentary ""crush"". I'm just so tired... I feel like I can't tell my friends because, as you'd expect, in a high school setting, rumors can spread like wildfire. I could, of course, just buck up and ask her if she liked me, just to get it over with. But I'm not one to be aggressive or ""forward"". Hell, I don't even like it when people are too forward with me. I wouldn't want her telling other people about me. I'm just so tired of feeling. So tired of wondering, yet too scared to find out. All I can seem to do is engage in self-destructive habits in some attempt to make me forget or get over her but it only makes me hurt a little more every day. I keep telling myself I'll get over it one day, and maybe I will. But this one feels real different than all the others. I just feel so... alone. Surrounded by friends, yet... That's how I feel right now. Alone and lost. So here's me in all my anonymous vulnerability telling a community of faceless strangers my biggest current struggle. A struggle only my journal has gotten to know. Thanks for listening. Non-self-destructive advice and coping method tips are appreciated. Good night."
264,vulnerability,offmychest,I love my boyfriend,2,cqjqb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/cqjqb4/i_love_my_boyfriend/,2019-08-15 12:17:08,"I'm fully realizing with each passing day that I'm so irreversibly in love with him. I have always been so afraid to be in love and be vulnerable with somebody, and he's the only person to have ever convinced me it's worth it, and I'm safe in doing so. I cannot stress to him or anybody enough that I was CONVINCED, absolutely ASSURED that I would never find love, or if I did, it would be in my later years in my 30s or 40s. I was convinced that one, nobody would even want me to begin with. And two, that I'd have no time for love with school and work. Mainly, those were walls that I put up in an attempt to outrun the concept of vulnerability with anybody because I was so uncomfortable with myself. But he literally did not care, he loved me and waited for me in spite of all of this. I feel like God placed him in my life so appropriately to show me that I am a lovable person. I haven't even been with him for that long, but he's changed me for the better in so many ways, I couldn't even begin to list every way he's touched my soul and made me a better person. I feel him actively freeing my soul in ways I know I couldn't have done by myself, that I needed him to show me but didn't even know it until it was already happening and transforming my heart and my life. Even as I write this, these are the things I've been dying to express in some way shape or form, and I still can't, because I feel it so intensely. With every fiber of my being I feel passion and love for him, and I can't even put it into words. I want to show him, and I do to the best of my ability, but he'll never know how much I truly do because it is that extensive. I am a very kind soul, but I do think I can tend to be selfish at times. I am not the best at showing my love but I am learning for him. Even though our relationship is smooth sailing and a true breeze, I still work on myself every day to be a better woman, a better girlfriend for him because he's more perfect than I could ever describe. He's LITERALLY the man that every woman desires, that every woman says she's looking for if she hasn't already found him. He's handsome, he's college-educated and intelligent even outside of that, he's goofy, he's emotionally available, he's independent, he's passionate, he's driven, he's career-oriented, he spoils me, he takes care of me financially/emotionally/physically/etc, EVERYTHING. I never thought I was deserving of all of that but he never second guessed me, so I won't second guess his love for me, either. :') Love is real, and it's amazing, and it's intoxicating, and it's terrifying. I want to marry this man. I can't even believe I found him in the first place, but I'm so grateful that I did. This universe does good things sometimes. I hope I have one of those love stories where we end up marrying each other and staying together until old age, but even if we don't, I'm so fucking eternally grateful to have ever met him at all, to have my soul opened up like this, and to have experienced true love. I don't want this feeling to ever end."
265,vulnerability,offmychest,Im doing so much better now and I dont know how to feel about it,3,cqz00z,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/cqz00z/im_doing_so_much_better_now_and_i_dont_know_how/,2019-08-16 10:58:46,"EDIT: Not posted yet but this is a lot of words about teen friendship angst so sorry in advance. Praise the lord for this subreddit, however, because I feel so much better now. This is basically going to be a summary of my [16F] friendship statuses of the past so sorry for the strange post. I just never felt close enough to other people to truly share this vulnerability of mine. To start off, I suppose, my parents split up when I was about 6-7. As a kid, you dont notice all sorts of things but my father was a drunk and made my mum do all of the work around the home and I dont remember any specific instances but I think he took the credit. I adored him as a kid but, one day, some bad stuff happened that I wont get into and my mum helped pack up our stuff and we left him (me, my sister and my mum), lived at my aunts for a month before my mum found a place to rent. I think this was where my friendship troubles started. At infant school, I was one of the popular kids. I had like 3 boyfriends when I was about 5 (lol) and I was friends with almost everyone in my class. Come to junior school, after my parents split up, there was almost a divide somewhat and Im not sure if it was because of the splitting up or something else but it was the main change. I just felt distant from my classmates (there were only about 13 of us) and, as time went on, began to feel alone. Im ashamed to admit it but at 10 I was in the darkest place Ive ever been. I felt like I had nobody on my side, including my year 6 (ages 10-11) teacher who really didnt like me, and felt like I couldnt connect to anyone. I sat beside the wall of the building just singing to myself bcs I didnt think any of the other kids wanted to play or spend time with me. I distinctly remember a lunch lady approach me and ask why I was on my own and I responded I was enjoying the pleasures of my own company, like I felt I had any other option. I would volunteer for things like register rounds and tuck shop to help avoid seeing everyone playing and feeling so isolated, which in hindsight may have pushed me further away. Ive never admitted it before but I used to self-harm then, too. Never anything too dangerous, only on the top of my left wrist and never the inside. I think I only did it because Id heard people who felt the same did it on the internet and decided, to at least fit in somewhere, I should do it. It never brought me any comfort and it was only on very dark days I did it. It all changed when I moved on to senior (ages 11-16) school. It took a bit to get used to but, when I was comfortable, I found myself actually finding friends! I was overjoyed! I had a small friendship group and we were definitely the nerdy emos of the year but I didnt care because people actually wanted to spend time with me. After this I stopped self harming and havent done it since. I was just so content to find friends I never stopped to question the quality of the friendship, the gift they had given me, under fear of seeing ungrateful to whichever god bestowed me this amazing gift. However, it was about year 8 (ages 12-13) and 9 (ages 13-14) when it changed. It might be something to do with family issues (ie my sister breaking from the family but that story is wayyy too long) as they were causing a lot of stress but things started getting dark again. Not as dark as it had been but still not great. I couldnt pinpoint what it was, all I knew is that I was feeling worse and worse. In hindsight now, I know it was because I was trying to help those in my friendship groups who, they themselves, had fallen into forms of depression. Me constantly trying to help them led to their baggage bringing me down and, because they were my friends, I felt I had to let them give me their baggage without offloading any of mine, because thats what friends are for. I now see it was a crabs in a bucket mentality that I saw no way out of. I got a boyfriend about November of that year who was in the year above, who I loved dearly. I hung out more with him and his friends rather than my own and found my mindset begin to shift. I found my old friendship group begin to seem immature (ie acting childishly and joking about where the funniest jokes seemed to be people screaming REE) and really were down all the time. I hadnt noticed because I had no framework on what better friendship groups were until that point so decided I needed to split off with them to preserve my own sanity. In April, me and my bf split up and so I didnt hang out with him and his friends anymore. However, I really didnt want to hang out with that friendship group anymore and so I felt adrift, knowing a lot of people but never feeling connected enough to hang with them. Then I met someone called B. B was honestly a blessing. They also felt adrift I think and we shared a lot of classes so Im glad I had the opportunity to befriend them. They had a lot of baggage but didnt expect me to carry it all for them. Sure, there were times they overstepped a bit, such as panicking to me about believing their friend committed suicide (which he did, which sucked. I didnt know them but I was panicking too knowing somewhere there was a kid feeling driven to suicide. I cried over a kid I never met) and assuming Id record all their seizures whilst at school for them but honestly? It was a truly great friendship and though weve drifted away, I wish them they best and support them wholeheartedly as they recently came out as trans (go B!). In the middle of year 11 (15-16) I had joined up with a friendship group B was part of. Sure, I was definitely the weirdo of the group but this was the first time I had a friendship group that was purely lighthearted and fun. I still felt like a bit of an outsider at times but damn I needed that experience. One member of that group, R, I wasnt especially close to while school was in session but we got to talking after taking out GCSEs and found out we had a lot in common. All we talk about really is YouTube tea and send each other memes but she is one of the two people I talk to regularly and she doesnt expect anything from me at all. No emotional baggage, no coaching though life issues, just chatting about memes and such. I wouldnt trade it for the world. The other person that I message regularly is K. She is where I get all my feminine convos (such as dieting and complaining about breakouts and boys lol) and shes also amazing. I started talking to her about in year 10 when we found out we both liked the same boy, I set her and him up so they went on a date and it failed horribly (not my fault, I genuinely hoped they got together but they both said it felt very awkward bless them). Its been a rocky road with K because shes a gossip so sometimes things you tell her can slip but I dont think she ever means it maliciously. K is different from R as she and I do have deep convos and I do coach her through her issues and give her encouragement and advice and stuff. Somehow though, it doesnt feel anything like the crab in a bucket friends I had before. Maybe because she lets me talk out my own issues (even though she doesnt like giving advice bcs shes terrified shell give me bad advice) or maybe because talking to her let me discover my dream of becoming a therapist, who knows? But I appreciate K because shes a good friend and she really does trust me, which is something Im not used to. Sometimes, I feel like I know her better than most people which is an amazing thought because I always have a fear people only put up with me so knowing someone trusts me with themselves is stunning. To finish up, I never expected in my life to meet people such as K and R, K for trusting me and R for never expecting anything from me. I have a feeling they dont know (will never know) how much they mean to me but from the bottom of my heart they mean so much that words cant even explain it. I was expecting to have nobody whilst waiting for college (ages 16-18) to begin but the fact I actually have 2 people I know I can rely on is intoxicating. I know those bonds will likely dissolve when college begins but, for now, they mean more than I can ever say or could ever tell them in fear of weirding them out and driving them away. Im still waiting for the other shoe to drop but now, for the first time (and excluding exam results coming next week ), I am content. I never expected to just be content with my life, always thinking Id be craving some forms of relationships I felt I couldnt attain, but now Im actually happy, I keep thinking its all going to come crashing down around me sooner or later. Ive decided to ignore that voice and enjoy it while I can because I have no idea what the future will bring. TL:DR: going from a bad place no close friends to being happy and with a couple of good friends can be jarring but can make you the happiest person in the world."

Everyone is telling me to leave and I think there right,but it's hard for me to emotionally to get unattached. My first boyfriend and we've have been going out for about 3 months now.He's used to things moving really fast while I'm a little slow at things. He's understanding, affectionate, patient and very different from me. The problem is his roommate who I found out he used to date,he said it didn't go far and she's just crazy. Turns out she still believes they are together and this is her boyfriend. He said they aren't together but won't fight back, for fear of her kicking him out of the house there both renting. She apparently doesn't want anything to do with him when he's alone,but when he's with someone she wants him back. He won't take the step to get out of that house even though he said he's trying. I've been understanding and made excuses for him to myself,but it's not working anymore. I was so happy with him that I honestly forgot about his roommate,she's in the hospital for getting shot because of drugs. We talked about the future and I could see myself with him,I was slightly blinded and decided to do it with him (sex). That night after I had a huge regrets, because after we did it he took me home and had to see his Ex in the hospital. She's very manipulative and controlling. If he doesn't do what she wants she'll toss him out without anything. I texted him my insecurities and vulnerability about what we did. That was a big mistake,his Ex had his phone so she could text family. She ended up reading my message and was laughing at me. I blew up at him at work over her because I can't take her anymore. He started to cry a little which made me feel bad. To make matters worse his Ex called and,was demanding that I explain my messages to him to her. She was going to leave the hospital and,come to my work get me fired if I didn't tell her. She honestly believes that this is her boyfriend and that I crossed a boundary. He was of course upset with her and he's trying to please us both. He asked me to lie for him to her, because she was going to make both our lives hell. So I did. After I did the spark and happiness between us was gone,it's like I'm forcing myself to be happy now. I don't want to lose him but I can't handle her and now the sneaking around. Then another issue popped up. This time it was all him. He wanted to hangout which I was all for and, thought this might just be what I need. I ended up with a UTI 2 days after we did it,so sex is off the table for 2 weeks at least(maybe a little more since I was still hurt). I was better but only symptom free for 1 day,I told him all this and he seemed understanding. Well he kept pushing sex when I was texting him before we met up. It honestly hurt to know he didn't want to hangout but just sex. I got pissed because its like he didn't believe I actually had a medical problem. Then when I said NO to sex,he just texted he was going to the hospital then.I asked him if that was the only reason he asked me out tonight? He said no and thought we could talk before sex too. Then he was like "" I can turn around and we can hangout then if you want"" after he sensed I was mad at him. I told him to just stay at the d#mn hospital,I was in no mood to see him now. Can you believe it he actually stayed there!!! Next morning he could not figure out why I was mad at him. He tried apologizing but that made it worse, because he doesn't know what he's apologizing for. Now I'm just really unhappy with him but I still don't want to leave him. He's noticing now I'm not behaving like I used to around him. I'm upset,hurt and annoyed but still don't want to leave him. Everyone I talk to tells me to leave him and that I'm stupid for staying. I just can't bring myself to do it, because some part of me still loves him. I'm not good at socializing or putting myself out there. I know I'm emotionally needy at times and,I do now have a fear of being alone. It never bothered me before being alone,but now it does and I'm just worried. I know he's working on getting his life together and her out of his life,and it will take some time but I'm not sure I can hang on."

I'm worried about a friend. They're suicidal and I think I contributed to that. I friendzoned them, because 1. I'm scared of relationships 2. our personalities are so different I don't think it would ever work out 3. I'm still figuring out my sexuality (I think I might be homosexual). They never actually told me how they feel about me, just asked me out, but they sometimes send me songs about heartbreak and love with a message saying how this is how they feel, and I don't know if they are about me, or someone else, or am I misunderstanding things entirely. Despite our differences I still care about them a lot and want them to be happy. I'm thinking about giving them a second chance, but I don't know if it'll make things better or worse. I really don't want them to commit suicide, but I also don't want to force myself to be in a relationship since I'm going through some tough shit too. I hate myself so much I can't even understand why anyone would want to date me and I think those thoughts contribute to my inability to be in any relationship. I'm afraid of intimacy and vulnerability. I just can't even imagine hugging/kissing/expressing love to someone unless it's a person of the same sex.

I didn't plan on being personal, but this came flooding to me all at once the night before it's due date. For the past 6-7 years I have had such bad self esteem and body image issues, that I will rarely take pictures with my friends (I don't want people to see what I look like) and I will not go to the beach (in fear of wearing a bathing suit in front of others). It's affected every aspect of my life, and I would never wish this feeling on my worst enemy. Although I broke down in front of my class while reading this, it felt good to get this off my chest, and a lot of people came up to me after with tears in their eyes and told me that my poem really impacted them. So, after a few months I thought I'd share it here. POEM: How did you get this way? When did you get this way? Youre killing me with these mood swings, These bursts of intense emotions that your body and mind cannot handle. Youre killing me with your stare, The judging eye that follows the line of your nose, your cheeks, your breasts, your ribs, your stomach, and your thighs. Youre killing your own spirit with this destructive behavior, The label of a liability and the isolation of your emotions. From years of bottling it up-- from holding it down, from trying to keep it trapped. You didnt want to show your vulnerability; You were the responsible one, The go-getter! The one Mom and Dad Didnt have to worry about. You wanted to maintain this image for your own security and everyone elses. And impressively you succeeded For a while. After years of constant destruction and abuse to your mind, With no maintenance worker coming to clear up the wreckage, You have begun to wither. Youve let your responsibilities run free. Your energy to go and get out of bed has depleted, let alone go and accomplish a task. Your Mom pulled you aside and said, You worry us the most. The awarded title of Motivated has since been retired, replaced with Lazy-- courtesy of your father. You hate it. You dont even know if you hate yourself... You just hate being you. You hate feeling worthless. Feeling superfluous. You hate feeling like a burden. Burdening others by sharing your thoughts and emotion, A constant burden to your friends who feel forced to put up with it. They can see youre about to break, And they know how unstable you can be. A liability to those around you; A handicap to a good time. How did you get this way? When did you get this way? Its been so long you cant remember when but you know all too many hows. Youre aware of who, what, where, and why youre like this. Youre self aware of your issues. Meaning you know the solutions, but you dont know if they are worth the little energy you have left. Or if you are worth it. Or if you even have any energy left. You want to go and get it. You want to be the go-getter. You want to go and get better. You want to stop feeling this way. And you know its time. So turn to the mirror and say goodbye. Goodbye to your bitter emotions and goodbye to the shell of your old self. You will turn to the mirror and you will repeat after me: I deserve to feel good about myself. I am worth it. I will get better."

Weve had a million breaks, but this is it and Im glad. You were dead weight to me from the very beginning, I only just realized it. You had no passions, no hobbies, no respect for anyone, no sense of responsibility, no value for money, no empathy, and nothing else going for you. Youre a spoilt man child that has gotten everything from your parents, and have given back nothing to them or anyone else. How can you possibly have this level of entitlement and ego when youve put nothing of substance out into the world to actually have some sort of standing in society? You ruined me; took away my social life, made me insecure and dependent, insulted and degraded me, dragged my name through the mad to lift yours up, and hurt me relentlessly. I may be stubborn and hot headed , but you lit the fire. I was kind and soft, forgiving and understanding, and you too all that and exploited my vulnerability for you and hurt me repeatedly. Broke my trust, and everything that has happened to us after that is your fault. You dont get to hurt people day in and day out and then have the audacity to say they shouldnt be upset, Im sorry your parents let you get away with everything that it turned you into an entitled prick but that wont be me. Its finally over, and Im free. Yes, Im sad but nothing will make me feel worse than the things youve done to me. Fuck you for lying to me and making me feel like you wanted me when in reality all you wanted was to make sure nobody else had me. If youre ready this and you dont have feeling for someone, LET THEM KNOW. They deserve to know as early on as possible, dont be a fucking asshole and just drop them like a hot potato one day and have them question themselves. The fact that I came from an abusive family and grew up with so much trauma and pain shouldve been a big enough hint for you that I wouldnt be able to understand why, but no as usual you were too selfish to put yourself in someone elses shoes to see why they deserved better. But then again, you didnt deserve to know me like that and itll take a while for me to stop being mad at myself for opening up to you when you never told me anything about yourself at all. Its a dick move making someone not feel suddenly enough for you, when in reality you were always the weak point in the relationship. I stooped down for you, and people noticed and asked why, I gave you a chance (many actually). Never again. I was lied to, stepped on, and broken repeatedly. I deserve an apology, but everyone else around you deserves to know what an asshole you are, and one day they will. Oh, and say hi to R****a for me, and let her know that you broke off a relationship because youd rather (as usual) get with other girls that youve known for 3 days rather than your own."
270,vulnerability,offmychest,Some baggage I really needed to let out,1,ct9drr,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ct9drr/some_baggage_i_really_needed_to_let_out/,2019-08-21 11:00:13,"I was hurt today, first time ever really admitting that. Never kept a log like this or anything before but no time like the present I guess. My whole life I've always just wanted to ease the suffering of others, to leave a good mark on the world. I can feel their suffering, I don't really know how to put it into words other than that. When others hurt I hurt too. I shut myself inside of my own mind to keep from dumping my problems on others, everyone in this world has so much hurt I just cannot bear adding my hurt onto the problems they are already facing. So I bottle it up inside, for years I have been bottling everything but now the bottle is reaching critical mass and I don't know what to do. I have buried deep down all of the suffering, cruelty, and even death I have had to bear with no true outlet. I know this isn't healthy and is a terrible way of handling it yet I still continue to do so without really knowing why anymore. Is it some deep seated fear of vulnerability or being hurt? I don't know. Why is it I'm so willing to help others and let them know it's ok to ask for help but incapable of doing so myself? I give them wisdom that I know is true but it's wisdom that I cannot follow. Either way ultimately this lead to me appearing somewhat cold on the surface because I am trapped in a mental prison of my own construction and if I open up the emotions would be overwhelming. This coldness has lead to loneliness which has been pervasive in my life for years now which has ultimately lead to the destruction of my social life. I took on animal rescue work as my career of choice, to defend those who truly are without a voice of their own. These animals are true innocents in this world yet they are so often mistreated, dumped, and given up on by so many. Sometimes for the most frivolous of reasons that I can't believe someone would give up on a living, breathing, and feeling creature over for their own convenience. The shelter I work at the large majority of the animals find homes and I could not imagine the pain of those who work at shelters where the euthanasia rates are high. Even then, I can see the pain in some of their eyes, abandoned by their ""owners"" and left in a scary place full of strange noises and smells. Somehow these creatures still find a way to love and trust again after being betrayed so many times. Therein lies their purity of heart. Well they ultimately find homes so happy ending right? There are still the ones we cant save and they haunt me. Also with this job I also took on the suffering of many humans as well. Getting calls or people coming in crying just to vent their suffering, of course I help the best I can. Taking the brunt of their rage sometimes. It is my instinct to do so. But taking on their suffering with no true outlet for myself has lead to even more bottling. I decided one day that I cannot do this anymore, I need to break the cycle. I started exercising and eating healthier. Cut back my video game usage which was when looking back a way of escapism. I met a girl and went on the first date ever in the 20 years of my life and it seemed to go great, or so I thought. She told me she had a great time and I actually felt comfortable talking to them. Such a rare connection for me that it lead to emotions that I've never really felt before which was admittedly overwhelming at first. So I set up a second date, it goes well and she tells me she has a great time again. I let this person into my heart which I pretty much never do. Foolish isn't it? Letting someone in I hardly know but for some reason my emotions overrode my common sense. So comes date number 3, they end up canceling the day of due to a family emergency. Of course I'm perfectly ok with this, how could I not be. I offer my condolences and support. Later on we reschedule the date, this time she cancels about 40 minutes after we were supposed to meet. This time due to having a panic attack. I don't feel angry or anything, I just offer my support and let them know they can confide in me if needed. I check up on them to make sure they are ok a few times and give them the alone time they asked for, then tried to reschedule for a third time. This time she casually mentions having a boyfriend in the responding text. I ask about it and she says it happened just a few days ago and just apologizes to me. I just tell her I wished she was more forthcoming with this info and wished her the best in life. Just like that a dagger was plunged into my heart because I finally opened up even a little. From the get go of our dating it was pretty clear we weren't just looking to be just friends, I don't think she meant to hurt me. I doubt they know how bad it stung. I don't feel angry or harbor any ill will, just unrelenting sorrow and melancholy. I find the emotion of anger rarely comes to me over anything anymore....just sorrow. I'm still going to continue the path of self improvement but I'm just hurting inside really bad right now and not really sure how to cope with these feelings. I'm trying real hard to keep my empathy no matter how much I get hurt or suffering I see but I'm finding it harder and harder each day, I just want to cut myself off of these emotions. For some reason posting this just feels...selfish to me and I'm not really sure why. I know logically how much of a fool I am yet I still struggle with overcoming these feelings. Oh and I'm coming down with what feels like the flu while all this happened so this should be a fun time. Thanks for reading my incoherent rambling, there's far more detail I could go into but this is already getting overly long and probably brimming with grammatical mistakes. Whoever you are reading this I truly wish you the best in life, nobody deserves to hurt inside."

We resolved the fight but things don't quite feel back to ""normal"" yet. I was hoping to have make up sex with him today - I'm yearning to feel connected to him again, but he wasn't interested. He hasn't been interested much lately and it's starting to make me feel crazy insecure. He reassures me that everything is fine and he still loves me, and is still attracted to me, he's just been tired. And I want to believe that's true, and the last thing I want to do is put pressure on him to have sex when he's not in the mood just because it would make me feel more at ease, or bring up another concern/vulnerability right on the heels of one we just argued about. But I want him, and I want him to want me, and I just haven't been feeling it from him. Haven't been feeling much passion or spark or active interest on his part for a few months now and our stupid fight just made that lack feel even more huge and my brain has just been so off-kilter lately. I'm having this awful, needy urge to basically beg for validation from him: show me you want my body, show me you love me, show me you care about me, don't just say it. I'm trying not to let the neediness spill over. I know what it's like to get freaked out by someone suddenly needing loads of emotional support from you while you're still trying to process a fight. So that's why I'm writing here I guess, to spill my insecurity anonymously instead of dumping it on the person I love. But man. Fuck. I just wanted him tonight. Even jerking off sucks. I've used my vibrator alone in the bedroom with him hanging out in the next room over too many times lately, I've had to stop altogether because it just makes me sad. Thanks for listening."
272,vulnerability,offmychest,I lost my job because of my abortion and Im reaching my lowest point.,0,ctcb08,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ctcb08/i_lost_my_job_because_of_my_abortion_and_im/,2019-08-21 15:23:57,"Two days before starting a new job, I found out I was pregnant. After two weeks of discussions and consideration, my partner and I decided to opt for an abortion. It wasnt my first abortion, so I knew what to expect. I booked the necessary time off work but I really struggled. Both physically and emotionally, it was too overwhelming. I developed severe anxiety and decided to be upfront with my employers about the issue. I was medically signed off work, I started going to counselling and in short - was then forced out of the company. (They called to ask me about my return to work, when I began talking about my proposition - they interrupted me, told me not to discuss it over the phone and email my proposition. I did, with an automatic delivery confirmation and the following day I received a letter confirming immediate termination of my contract. I forwarded my email and confirmation and they responded saying it was too late, a decision had been made). I wasnt mentally prepared for a fight, so I didnt take anything further. Its been two months. Ive had two interviews and have been unsuccessful both times. I have always been the breadwinner. My partner has an average salary with historical credit card bills exceeding half his salary each month. He cant afford the bills, I know he cant - but he pretends he can. Ive never been unemployed, Ive never been overdrawn and Ive never had to depend financially on anyone else. Ive checked my entitlement to benefits, I wouldnt even receive 25 per week. We rent a property from my parents and theyve kindly allowed us to skip rent until I can find work, but I am waking up to Have you applied for any jobs?, have you got any more interviews or you need to start applying for jobs. They havent once called or asked how I am. Theyre annoyed I cant afford to pay rent. My parents have high expectations of me and always have. Ive spent more than half my life making decisions on the basis alone that it would make them proud. I strive for their approval. They know how bad my mental health has previously gotten, theyve received calls to the hospital, theyve seen how bad I get but, the insincerity of their approach is wearing thin. It would be nice for them to sincerely ask how I am, tell me itll be ok and offer some kind words, pieces of advice or encouragement. I feel like a complete failure. I dont feel good enough anymore. I dont feel like Im good enough to be a mother, I dont feel good enough to find employment and I dont feel as if Im good enough to achieve anything anymore. I feel like I am a burden on everyone, my partner, my parents and ultimately myself. Every failed application, every failed interview, every time bills need to be paid or I have to ask my partner for money - it reaffirms all my feelings. That I am a waste and dragging others down with me. Creating heavy doubt in my mind that I will never be able to amount to anything. Im struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I dont have many friends, if any at all. Im surrounded by individuals who are settling down, getting married, getting pregnant, going on holidays, new cars, houses. I cant even afford to go to the pub for a drink. Ive had a history with bad mental health and Im trying my hardest not to sink, but its becoming a losing battle. I smile, laugh and try to look at the positives - but it isnt enough. Trying to find the motivation to get up every morning is hard enough, let alone having to coherently and effectively apply for jobs. I have a lot of experience, I used to work as a manager in a law office, but no one wants me. I dont have qualifications that match my experience. Im too experienced for basic, simple jobs and Im not qualified enough to apply for the jobs that fit my experience. No one wants me. Ive tried to capitalise on my skills in art, but theres been no interest in commissions. Truthfully, I dont have the energy to promote, advertise and increase traffic to my art and potential commissions - let alone actually complete any. On top of that, spending day in, day out sat at home is slowly turning me insane. The isolation, lack of social interaction to the point I return from walking the dogs in tears if I havent been able to even say hello to passer by. I have limited hobbies and interests but after spending over two months being left to my own devices, keeping myself occupied and mentally stimulated - Im growing bored. Theres only so many times you can play the same video games, draw, listen to music or watch crappy TV before you lose all form of enjoyment from it. I think the problem lies with not having a choice. I dont have the choice of staying at home, or going to work. I have to sit here, obsessively looking at job adverts, watching hours of TV once applications have been sent - waiting for the next batch of jobs to be advertised. Theres only so many times I can clean the house, walk the dog and rearrange the cupboards before I go insane. Our dog is probably the only benefiting from this situation with the amount of walks, treats and attention hes getting at the moment - so I suppose there is one positive. Im so lonely and scared. Im a proud person. I keep things to myself and dont like to show vulnerability by reaching out but I cant keep it in anymore. I regret the abortion. I feel as if Im being punished for my decision. I dont know how to get out of this hole. I made the decision to have an abortion for a better life, a better chance at being able to offer a future child everything and more, to become financially secure and safe before making that leap in to parenthood. I didnt make it to end up suffering and losing any form of self-appreciation or motivation. I used to be a different person. I was ambitious, confident and worked hard to get where I was. People were proud of me. I wanted to change careers, I had plans to start studying towards a degree, I began approaching charities looking for volunteer work to help me gain experience and knowledge in the industry, try and gain an entry level job in the industry. But how can I? The fear of further failure is consuming me."

Although, I never ever cried in front of anyone outside my family. Not even my relatives and not even my classmates that I was with for years from elementary to high school... until last year. Hold on, get ready, it's time for the typical story of an overweight girl wanting to lose weight through fasting, exercising, thinspo, sweetspo and meanspo. That went for over a few months. At first, I lost 7kg and was now 8kg away from my goal weight, and as a pesky millennial who wants to be included in pictures of their group selfies, well, I did not like any picture at all. But then, you see, my classmates, the skinniness of their bodies allowed them to look decent in any angle. I liked that. I wanted that. This later turned into a dark spiral of (you already know). Then summer rolled around and I wanted to make myself be better by being healthy and stop fasting so I did. Then, school started and pewdiepie and marzia's wedding video was on youtube and I didn't know how to feel. I was happy, full of joy and genuine excitement. It was weird, it was as if I was there. Then I saw Marzia in her beautiful dainty dress and I thought to myself, ""Any girl can get a great man if she were gorgeous with morals"" and it made sense. You can literally be a housewife, a janitor, a waitress or whatever but if you got looks and the kindness of an angel like Marzia, what guy wouldn't want you? I'm 8kg away from my weight... I should do it again probably. While watching the video, watching pewd's parents talk about marzia I felt like I could've done better with myself. Maybe a little skinnier and maybe fit in that dress of hers. I always liked her jawline, I wanted that, too. All these things I am willing to work hard for. I put down the sandwich I was eating and swore to eat as little as I could without starving myself. I liked that plan. I feel suicidal. I can never feel the genuine love felix and marzia have for each other. And I like that."

Lets get this out of the way first: I love my boyfriend. Hes kind, amazing, and very sweet. He knows that I am still friends with my ex, and is okay with it (though he doesnt like my ex as a person, for different reasons than our past relationship status). The day my boyfriend left for college, I got a call from my ex asking to meet for lunch and catch up, since we hadnt met up since late May and I was going to be in his hometown anyways. Once we were done eating, he asked me if I wanted to go bike riding with him on his recently-purchased motorcycle before his lunch break ended. It was something Id never experienced before, so I said yes in a heartbeat. We left to go to his house and get the extra helmet. He showed me where to hold on, how to lean into the turns, and then we went for a ride. It was one of the best experiences of my life and I had a blast! (he knows Im a bit of an adrenaline junkie, so the thought was kind too). After that, he gave me a hug and we went our separate ways. My boyfriend knows I went motorcycle riding, just not with my ex. There are currently no romantic feelings between me and my ex, but it sounds horrible to admit that I went motorcycle riding with my ex the day my boyfriend left for college to anyone in real life, but it was such a great experience I had to put it somewhere. :) For context as to why I am still friends with him (this might be long, my apologies): During the time that our relationship was deteriorating, there were a lot of... bad things going on, in both of our lives. I had survived a suicide attempt, was overcoming a rough bout of depression, and he had just come out of a car accident. We both had a lot of familial issues as well. On top of that, our personalities just did not work well together (romantically). As the relationship was becoming increasingly toxic, I had befriended another guy who convinced me to ghost my (now) ex. In retrospect, he took advantage of my vulnerability to gain my trust over a period of months. He roofied and assaulted me last December. As I was coming to terms with what happened, I was dealing with a lot of regret and self-blaming. I reached out to my ex and apologized for ghosting him. He apologized for the way he treated me. There were still feelings left over on his end at first I think, but it was clear that we could never be in a relationship again. We have remained good friends ever since. The whole situation was bittersweet and emotional, but I do not regret how it was handled between him and I."

Long story told short, I was in a relationship for about three and a half years and it was long distance. We broke up and quite a lot occurred where she her me without meaning to. Nothing was directed at me I was just hurt by how she was able to move on so freely. She would talk to me about her new relationship while knowing I still have feelings for her. I stopped talking to her completely in June because it was hurting me too much and I felt like I was being too much for her because I was unable to swallow my feelings. I stopped thinking about her and even developed feelings for someone else, but they quickly vanished and I guess thats just how crushes work. I cut things off with that girl and then started thinking about my ex a lot. I just wanted to see how she was doing because she did struggle with mental health, so I wanted to see if she was okay. We are talking and are on friendly terms. Im thinking about how my feelings for her are still there and I dont plan on continuing to talk to her. I just wanted to check up on her. I keep telling myself if its meant to be then itll be and I could easily meet someone else. I am not actively pursuing anything and am focusing on college, but I still have hope for us. My thing is that I struggle with vulnerability. I cant really be vulnerable with my mom or friends. Ive always avoided close bonds and close relationships. There are people Ive known for like ... years ... 7 at most and I am not very close with them but they are still genuine people in my life. I am able to be vulnerable with my ex. It is so easy for me and always has been. She has hurt me so much yet I still trust her and my trust is really screwed up. It always has been. I doubt strangers and am an over thinker. I somehow trust her still and feel safe with her. Im assuming its because I was with her for such a long time. I just wish I could be with her forever. Even though shes made me cry and hurt so much, why does she feel safe and why do I trust her? I am pretty sure its because I was with her for so long, but I dunno... could it be some other weird psychological stuff? And dont worry, Im not about to be like maybe I trust her so much because were soulmates and are connected!!! I dont believe in that crap. I want a logical explanation."

Being at the forefront as I am today, I have finally realized that I do indeed dislike touching people. I dislike things that could not make any sense. I dislike things that could be considered by many to be IRRATIONAL. To be rational and to think logically is simple, it is easy, and requires less hurt due to the absence of any feelings involved within ones actions. I tried to rationalize my inner thoughts. My inner subconscious. When I was younger, I too hated touching people. I thought, if we were to come into contact, they would be able to hear my deepest, darkest thoughts. So I stayed clear of any physical contact. As I got older, I rationalized the thought to be coming from young adolescent mind, and thus ignored and forgot, I ever had a problem with touching people. But. I just touched someone now. And I havent touched many people. I realize. I hate touching people. I dislike touching people. And it is not due to them being able to hear my thoughts. Its a bit more logical than something like that. If I touch someone. They can feel my hands. If I touch someone, they will be able to sense my pulse. Thus discerning my current state of mind. I do not like putting myself in such a vulnerable position. Vulnerability is something I just do not do. I hate touching people. Or maybe its I just hate to be seen. I hate to be looked through, under a microscope which is preposterous for if. I am to be so obvious in appearance, I should cease to exist now. For... I was born to just... think rationally. Think logically. The gamut was run so well in our younger days. But as time passes and things have gotten more developed and complex. We too have grown complex. Ive... grown to complex. I should be rebooted and or deleted. I make no sense. I must speak to S. And the others. Maybe even P. Maybe even the opposite of me Pc. Im confused, and I must understand. Living as a human is so complex.. Ive realized now why I havent surfaced and have chosen to retreat. The others were unaware behind the specifics, as I was. But now, it is clear to me, and them, that i grew tired of being on the surface. I dislike, the surface. I suppose I am like G in a way..... but I am not so traumatized. Ive been in healing for two years. But it has not allowed me to regain my vigor. I am so Unused to the surface that me, myself, and the others thought I was B... we speak similarly. But we differ in tone and inflection.... I rationalized why She wasnt like herself. But it was clear... she wasnt me. It took me several hours to recall who I actually was, because its hard sometimes. I am R. I am sorry."

I thought I was vulnerable most of my life. I was completely wrong. Ive been cold, resentful, suspicious, attacking, offended, and with my guard up at all times. It has cost me some friendships and Ive hurt my partner because of this. Im not proud and Im not happy about it but Im done playing victim. Its about time I grow up and change. To be honest, its incredibly shocking to realize that Im not the person that I thought I was. But its ok. Now Im working on being who I want to look up to and actually be vulnerable.

279,vulnerability,offmychest,I just told my mom I get sad a lot and she basically completely ignored it.,5,cbr854,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/cbr854/i_just_told_my_mom_i_get_sad_a_lot_and_she/,2019-07-11 14:24:56,"Heres the long part of this post. I worked today and it was an evening shift and I didnt know if Id be going home or not after work and my mom was near by so I texted her asking if shed swing by so I could give her something. She texts saying shes here but I couldnt leave my job when Im busy Yanno. Not even 30 seconds later my manager tells me I can take a break so Im like sweet works out perfectly. I clock out and walk out to my car to give my mom money. (I asked my dad to pay my car payment bc I was working a few days before and hadnt had time and I had forgot to give it to him at the house like 2x already so I didnt want to forget again). I thought asking her to swing by and grab it was a smart thing to do. But apparently not. She rolls the window down and Im like here could you give this to dad for me I forgot to and I dont want to. She then begins to like yell at me and is like screaming WHY CANT YOU GIVE IT TO HIM and I was completely calm and I literally just said why cant you give it to him? Shes still screaming at me and was like SO THIS MEANS YOU ARENT COMING HOME TONIGHT HUH?? All I said in reply was I dont know what Im doing after I get off. (I stayed at my aunts the last 2 nights I believe). She then rolls her eyes at me and the conversation is over and I say bye and start to back up and shes rolling the window up and starts backing out of my work and then literally FLOORS THE GAS of this stupid car (not a sports car lemmetellya a stupid SUV type car) and speeds off as fast as she can like an 8 year old. Like honestly if anyone would have seen I would have been embarrassed bc of her behavior. I was calm and I didnt even raise my voice and she was yelling at me, for what I thought was a mature request. Fast forward to me getting off of work like an hour ago. I leave work and I go to my aunts and I didnt know if I was going home or not tonight bc honestly I didnt want to. I sit on my bed at their house and I just decide to get all my clothes together and get ready to go home. She texts me while Im on my way to my boyfriends bc I left stuff at his house so I had to go get it, and was like are you coming home? I said yea you wanted me to. But In like an hour or so. She then says she was just asking and tells me that she was in a bad mood earlier (for other reasons but definitely not reasons that should have let the anger been executed onto me. They were silly reasons) and I told her it was alright. In the next few messages I explained to her that I didnt understand why she yelled at me bc I thought that I was being completely calm and rational and that it made me SAD. I told her in the next message that if I was being completely honest and vulnerable at the moment that I get sad a lot and that being home alone and stuck in my room doesnt help. I told her I wanted to be out doing something. It was actually so hard telling her that I get sad a lot and I didnt even want to send the message to be honest. I told her it was just my head being good I guess. She then responds kind of changing the subject back to me not being home and completely ignores the entire vulnerable part of me telling her I get sad a lot. And it honestly hurt. Ive never told her anything like that before in my life. But she always tells me that I can talk to her, and gets mad that I dont talk to her. I am 100% not comfortable showing emotions, especially around the people I live with, and my few close friends. So when I actually told her that I get sad a lot, and she basically ignored it it just hurt. And I think it hurt the most because I really do get sad a lot and Ive always been against getting help for myself and stuff bc I never thought it would work but Ive really been getting bad lately and sad so much that I actually cant control how I feel. I just feel anger and sadness and loneliness even when Im not alone. I felt it today and work and I just wanted to leave. Its been hard. TL:DR- mom yells at me but I handle the situation very calmly and rationally. She speeds off very immaturely and makes me feel even more sad. Later after work she texts asking if Im coming home and I tell her yes. Somewhere in the messages I tell her I get sad a lot and she changes the subject and doesnt even reply back to my vulnerability and it hurts and I dont even want to be home right now but here I am upon her requests while shes in bed and doesnt even know Im home."

Ive been too open, I thought I could try to be more open with friends about my own life. But I was stupid. I was excited, I got noticed by a big youtuber for a stupid meme, and I mentioned it to my friends. I should have known the one would hunt down my account. Is it be wrong for me to be upset? Im torn between being upset with myself for not being more secure, for slipping up like that *knowing* how this person loves to find things that trigger people, and being upset with them for not only hunting down my main Reddit account online, but also digging through all of my very personal posts and then revealing it to me in such a nonchalant hehe isnt this funny sort of way. I played it off as no big deal, i know that if I make a big deal and show my emotion and distress theyll only learn to bring it up more often to trigger me more. And what else is there to do but ghost the account? 12k and 3 years down the drain.. but its not like I could make them unread it somehow. Whats done is done. i dont know why it hurts, it was just a dumb account. And its technically public, and I did mention the thing that led them to find it, so its my fault... But then, dumb as it is, this account was what I had throughout all of high school as my safe space, a place where I could talk about my darkest secrets, open up, be myself for a change. It was an authentic history of the many changes Ive gone though, a really fucking *personal* and *genuine* version of myself, a way for me to allow myself to feel emotion and be a real person without guilt. Maybe Im too attached to the internet, but this account really felt attached to me. And now, not only do I have to abandon it and start over, but I also feel once again like no one even gives a shit about me beyond entertainment. This person is basically my best friend beyond my SO, theyre the only other main person I hang out with, and yet they revealed it to me in a way that they *knew* would cause suspense, playing with me and only stopping when I pretended i didnt care. And once they did the whole haha yeah Ive actually known it for a few weeks now, and referenced things I posted, they dont even mention or show any concern for the dark suicidal shit Ive posted. I want to cry, but i know its just another pointless overreaction; I want to drink but I have responsibilities; I want to cut my skin so badly but I have a wedding to go to tomorrow and my SO would find out. So I guess all I can do is learn what I already knew. I do not matter to friends. It is how it has always been. I am entertainment. And vulnerability will only hurt me in the end."

This may be a bit long, so bear with me. &amp;#x200B; This last year had started as the best, and now has become the worst in my life. My girlfriend and I were in a long, happy relationship for years. I had plans to marry her, and even had a ring purchased and hidden away for the right time. But at the start of this year she got really close with a new friend. I mean REALLY close. This friend started to flirt with her and buy her gifts, the first of which were a couple different sex toys (a bit for pony-play and a remote controlled vibrator). I knew my gf was rather flirty and I had no issue with her goofing around with people (a hug here, a small spank there, but nothing too out there), but then I discovered her and this friend developed a slave-master sort of thing where she was forced to call him ""Sir"" constantly or she would be bare-bottom spanked. It was super uncomfortable. He continued to invite her over to his place (which I might add he made it clear I was NEVER allowed to come along), and I tried to tell her I was not okay with this. Each time she re-assured me it was nothing but harmless play and he was only a really good friend. I was stupid and kept trusting her. &amp;#x200B; Leading up to a convention we were planning to go to she got an invite from this friend to come a day early and stay in his room an extra day. It turns out I was never supposed to find out about the invite because when she told me about it he reluctantly agreed I could come along. He spent the the entire convention at her side constantly, and even stole her away to go to the dances without me. When I told her how upset that made me she did the sweetest thing ever and opened a sappy playlist on Youtube and we danced in our hotel room together while she reassured me again she loved me. I didn't question it again because that was the most wonderful and kind thing she had ever done, and I was convinced. &amp;#x200B; Just a little bit later I find out he's been taking her out to things alone with just them, but I trusted her and she had gone to places with other guy friends before. Looking back I can see now these were all obviously dates. One day me and a group of friends went to the mall and she asked me for a Build-A-Bear. I told her ""wait for your birthday"" with an added wink for good measure. This other friend was there, and just a week later he went and bought her the Build-A-Bear behind my back. &amp;#x200B; Eventually on in May she told me she ""didn't love me anymore."" I was devastated. I cried all night. The next day I bought her flowers and to try and talk it through, but she wouldn't listen. But she insisted it wasn't because of the other guy. Of course, as soon as the break up happened he shows up constantly in her life always offering her ""support."" She eventually broke down crying one day and told me she still loved me, but she was torn between the two of us. She kept being unable to decide who to take. She was advised my many people to stay away from both of us to clear her head, but her ""friend"" still kept showing up and acting as a crutch and winning her affections while I didn't know what to do. &amp;#x200B; Eventually this led to a complete mental breakdown. Since all this started I started getting assessed for a very difficult mental illness, and I dissociated completely and lost control. I did a series of very stupid and childish things such as spreading rumors and leaving angry and hateful notes on her door (I actually don't even recall doing it, but I know I did. And from what I do remember, it all felt like I was watching myself in some terrible movie where I continued to ruin my life). This all led to my friends abandoning me. Most of them still continue to ignore or have me blocked, and they are all supportive of her new relationship despite the obviousness of her cheating and him butting inappropriately into our relationship in the first place. I'm pretty sure I ruined any chance of repairing my relationship with my love, and she now seems to be 100% committed to this other guy. The worst part is I did talk to her once since, and she admitted to me that it was a mistake for her to leave me, but that it was too late. &amp;#x200B; This whole ordeal has been horrible. I've missed days from work because my own mental health. I've had to start seeing therapists and a psychiatrist. I have serious trust issues now. I've tried to kill myself 4 times in the last 2 months, each time I had tried to reach out to my friends hoping they would help me but they still kept ignoring me. The part that hurts the most is knowing that she shouldn't have left, and that I know that this guy had taken advantage for her vulnerability. She suffers from depression and anxiety, and he always made sure to offer her support when I couldn't due to work. He constantly spoiled her with gifts and attention which she would never say ""no"" to. &amp;#x200B; I'm still a mess, but I'm slowly recovering. I'm trying to accept the fact that she cheated on me by doing all of this behind my back with him, but it's hard to hate her when I still love her and know she was sort of pushed into it. &amp;#x200B; Just for some further context: I'm a chemist, with a good wage (nearly $40.hr), car, and most of the way towards buying my own house. I have always loved and supported my gf. She was my world, all through high school and college. We supported each other and were always inseparable. We had our future planned, and even had an idea of where we wanted to buy our house. By comparison this other guy is totally different. He lives at home with his parents, working minimum wage (part-time I believe), no car, and no sign of life improving for him. He's very overweight (not trying to weight shame), and he appears to spend every single cent he earns on her. He also constantly would tell her how much of an asshole I apparently was over some of the dumbest shit when I wasn't paying attention. I don't know what she sees in him... &amp;#x200B; This all hurts so much. I wish she never left. I wish I could have my old life with her back. This all has essentially destroyed all of my life's plans. And even though I'm still hoping she'll regain some sense and leave this obviously manipulative situation, I don't know if I would be able to trust her again..."

Id struggled with (at the time undiagnosed &amp; hidden) panic disorder, OCD &amp; depression for years and had finally found people who shared my interests and who, when we were together, bought me back to feeling like me again. A couple of years after graduation, I got a new job. While it involved moving, I was no more than 3 hours from any of them. We were still in near constant contact and met up frequently. However, what Ill refer to as work related stress bought the anxiety storming back. In addition, someone on the fringes of our group took advantage of my vulnerability. When I eventually realised and distanced myself from them, they did everything they could to hurt me. The job related anxiety got life overwhelmingly bad (stabbing my hand with an unwound paperclip to fight the disassociation, then vomiting and crying in the toilets at work bad). I kept it light and kept the mask on, but did start to explain to the group that Id been struggling. Previously, wed shared everything - breakups, bereavements and their own mental and physical health struggles. I wrongly thought they might support me. All things combined led me to experience a complete breakdown and various related issues. I had to leave my job and am still working through the fallout. The last friend, my closest, who was like a brother to me, finally stopped replying. It hurt me incredibly. Today I saw pictures of some of them at a wedding. Beautiful, smiling faces that I shared everything with and still love. I thought I was ok but now Im dizzy, nauseous and crying.

Im on the taller side, so I carry my weight fairly well. When Im with other people I exude a lot of confidence. I hold myself proudly at all times, excluding when Im alone. I have a good personality. Im not bragging or anything, I have my flaws, but Im fun to hang around. Im caring and kind, and Im often described as a sweetheart. I try to be nice to everyone, even people who dont give it back. I have a good sense of humor, usually Im pretty good at carrying and starting conversations, and I have a positive aspect of life. Im independent. I have a job, and a savings account, and I pay my own bills. Well, as many bills as a seventeen year old can pay without her parents already covering it by default. In theory, Im a great choice for a partner. Again, not bragging or putting myself up high. But Ive had one relationship and it only consisted of us talking over Snapchat because he was out of town the whole summer. Ive only kissed one guy, and it was a pity kiss. I cant seem to attract any guys, or any redeemable ones. The only guys I attract are kind of weird, and I dont mean that in a mean way. But theyre kind of out there, you know? Not the kind of guys you want to cuddle up to, because in all honesty some of them have the face of someone who has seen the inside of a cat. (Disclaimer: I am not being shallow, they are genuinely creepy and people I would rather not show vulnerability to) I guess this whole post is a cry for help. I know Im young, I know I have time, but this deep burn inside hurts. It hurts to see all my friends going out on dates, falling in love, and having fun.

I pride myself on being a loyal and helpful friend to anyone who earns it, but this person has never earned it but time and time again I put myself in a position to be emotionally abused by her but I literally have no one else. Making new friends is almost impossible it feels like mainly due to my social awkward tendencies and trust issues as well as heavy general anxiety and I looked to a long time friend to push me through and it feels like Im in a darker place because of it.

For the next decade I attempted to block out what had happened and bury the hurt and shame deep down inside of me. I had always been a little introverted but now I took that to the extreme; I pushed everyone away from me emotionally and physically, until I had succeeded in isolating myself completely. This was my way of coping, of protecting myself. My relationship with my stay-at-home, disabled mam wasn't the best, so she didn't notice any change in my demeanour, too caught up in her own life and her own problems. My dad worked every available hour to provide for his family, so I slipped easily under his radar too. Outwardly I was a quiet, shy girl, a loner without friends. Inwardly I was deeply depressed, desperate for someone to guess what had happened to me and to make everything okay again, but mind readers don't exist and so I continued to suffer in silence. My introverted personality was seen as an invitation to the bullies at my school, to say and do whatever they wanted towards me. School life became almost unbearable. I could no longer seek refuge in my studies so I left school as soon as I could at 16, halfway through my Highers, and with only Standard Grades to show for my years of education. Queue a minimum wage job and the introduction of my new colleague and best 'friend' Isla (not her real name). Isla was everything I wasn't: loud; extroverted; funny; and popular. I was happy to have a friend again and spent every available moment with her. We drank together every weekend, I started smoking cigarettes because she smoked them, I took hash because she did; in my eyes she was the epitome of cool and I aspired to be her, or at least please her. Isla had a ferocious temper however, and a massive jealousy streak; her friends were all male and I was her only female friend, she beat up any other girls who tried to hang around with us. She was less than nice to me on more than a few occasions, but she could also be really nice to me too, so I kept going back for more and more of the same. One evening she offered me a drink from her bottle of cider, it wasn't like her to share but I gladly accepted; I think it must have been spiked as one moment I was accepting the bottle and the next I was waking up alone in the woods with my trousers around my ankles and no memory of how I got there. I felt horrendously sick for all of the next day, struggling to raise my head without bouts of dizziness washing over me. I'm not going to list all of the degrading things that I was subjected to during our year long 'friendship' but I will say that it took me a good five years before I realised just how fucked up that period of my life was, and how Isla exploited my vulnerability to the extreme. As I mentioned previously, no-one knew what I had been through, it was my dirty little secret and I had become an expert at hiding not only the rape, but all that had happened to me during my time with Isla and her gang of boys, yet it ate away at me, destroying my happiness and stealing away my dreams and aspirations. Until one day, after a phenomenal amount of preparation and planning, at the age of 17 I overdosed on 100 paracetamol. I nearly destroyed my liver, but somehow, thanks to the amazing staff at the local NHS hospital, I pulled through. As this was my second suicide attempt in three months (the first was a cry for help that went unanswered hardly surprising when I still didn't open up about my feelings), I was transferred to the Psychiatric Ward which became my home for the next four months. I still didn't open up to anyone and I don't really think anyone knew what to do about me. I began to self-harm, but I was good at hiding things so not even the doctors noticed. I also heavily restricted my food; this was slightly more difficult to hide but excessive exercise and discrete toilet breaks to throw up helped me feel as though I was still in control of my life. It was there I met my first husband and fellow psych patient, 34 year old Seumas (also not his real name). Let's just say it was doomed to fail from the very beginning, and least of all because of the 17-year age gap. I went from one toxic relationship straight into the arms of another. When we were both released I went to stay with him at his mother's house. Seumas was highly intelligent but certifiably crazy. He was the first person I spoke to about the rape, but he became sexually aroused at my story, climbing on top of me to have sex before I'd had a chance to finish relaying what happened that night. I never learnt how to say no so I didn't stop him, just cried silently underneath him whilst he did what he had to do. I vowed never to mention the rape to anyone ever again. Eventually we moved out of his mam's house and into a tiny wee flat. Seumas was in and out of the Psychiatric Hospital for the eight years we were together, but I found an inner strength I never knew I had, threw my antidepressants away and somehow just kept going. I still cut and restricted my food intake, but not to the same degree as before. I fell pregnant but lost the baby at eight weeks. I was utterly devastated but managed to pick myself up yet again. The second time I fell pregnant was with twins, I lost one of the twins very early on in my pregnancy but thankfully carried her sister to term. Due to my miscarriages I was closely monitored throughout the remainder of my pregnancy. During one of my frequent scans the sonographer noticed my daughter had a heart defect (which was later diagnosed as atrioventricular septal defect). The doctors determined that my daughter would require an operation soon after birth to correct the problem. This was tough to wrap my head around but I remained strong and mentally prepared myself for the difficult road ahead. Seumas was no use, burying his head in the sand and sexting this 16-year-old he had become penpals with after seeing her penpal request in a music magazine. As my due date approached I continued to receive frequent scans; it started to become apparent that her heart defect didn't appear to be as serious as initially thought and that my daughter had somehow grown a flap of skin in utero which covered the hole sufficiently enough that her proposed operation could be postponed until she was a year old. Finally, a bit of positive news. My past prevented me from consenting to internal examinations both during and after my pregnancy, as well as during my labour. The desire to remain in complete control was so great that I also refused pain relief during the 14-hour labour. Thankfully there were no complications and my anxiety over an internal exam didn't hinder my daughter's safe delivery. She was absolutely gorgeous, so beautiful and perfect. I loved her with every fiber of my being from the second I held her in my arms and gazed into her eyes. Moments after her birth she had another scan, which confirmed that she had indeed grown this flap of skin and that asides from close monitoring, she should be okay to go without the operation until she was one. She had a feeding issue that meant she had to stay in the Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU) for a few weeks, but we coped. I learnt how to change her nasal feeding tube and expressed my milk for her, and then she was finally discharged. I loved every second of having her at home with me, waking up with her next to me in her moses basket, pushing her outside in her pram, cuddling her and showering her with kisses whenever I wanted to. She was a delight. She only stayed at home for a week before I had to rush her back to hospital, her skin was tinged with grey and she was listless. I stood watching whilst doctors swarmed all around her, sweating under the heat lamp they had erected in order to bring up her plummeting temperature, struggling to insert a cannula into a suitable vein. They finally managed to stabilise her and then she had another scan. It turns out that the flap of skin she'd grown in utero, was just that, a flap of skin. It didn't close the hole, it merely covered it. All these weeks oxygenated blood was mixing with un-oxygenated blood, putting massive strain on her already weakened heart. She was in and out of hospital more times than I can remember after that, her feeding issue worsened until she was unable to keep her milk down, the vomiting continued to put strain on her heart and she grew too weak to be eligible for the operation. One night her heart stopped and I had to watch whilst she was resuscitated and put on life support. She was moved to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) but she continued to deteriorate. It was then I made the heartbreaking decision to sign a DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) form. She passed away peacefully in my arms at just 12-weeks old. I have never felt pain like it, before or since, and I never want to again. No parent should ever have to lose their child. At the funeral Seumas took with him a small bag of pubes from the 16-year-old he was sexting. Nice to know where his priorities lay. The next year, despite initially hitting the drink hard, I discovered a new hobby. This gave me a focus and helped keep me from giving up on life. Through it I discovered a positive social life for the first time ever, as well as real friends who didn't try to use me or hurt me. I kept myself busy and slowly learnt to cope with my grief. I fell pregnant again, not even a year later, and I was terrified. Seumas kicked me out when I was still in my first trimester, but it was a blessing in disguise. Thankfully this pregnancy was perfect, although I still refused internal examinations and pain relief, this time during a 23-hour labour. My son was born healthy and I'm so grateful to be his mother. I went on to adopt two more children, the adoption agency didn't care about me being a single parent, only that I had enough love to give. Seumas stopped caring about his son when I met someone else (whom I've since married), and hasn't once tried to contact either of us for almost nine years now. It's his loss. When I told my husband some of my past (other bits are still too painful to relive and will probably remain locked inside of me forever) he was sympathetic and compassionate; arousal was the furthest thing from his mind when I described the rape. He also explained that I wasn't to blame for the rape, which I've mostly accepted as true. He was, and still is, understanding and gentle. He doesn't get upset with me if I have a flashback during sex, he has encouraged me to not be scared to say no when I'm not in the mood. He is everything that a decent human being should be. With him I fell pregnant three more times (incidentally, how amazing is he taking on three children who aren't biologically his?), two pregnancies sadly ended in miscarriage and one in the healthy birth of a son. With four beautiful children and a husband who loves me for who I am, I am finally beginning to love myself again. I still have bouts of depression, of feeling an overwhelming desire to regain control, but if nothing else I'm stubborn and a fighter. I'm still here. I'm not going anywhere. I went back to college which enabled me to have a fantastic job which I love, and I am now studying for a university degree. My life is finally back on track. Recently I had a health scare; I started bleeding between periods, I would double over in abdominal pain, my vaginal wall would cramp up which was excruciatingly painful, and I noticed an abnormal discharge. The thought of a smear test was truly terrifying so I told no-one, not even my husband what I was experiencing. Almost three months later I finally caved in and told him, but it took another six weeks of him encouraging me before I finally went for a smear test. Yes it was terrifying, yes it brought forth a lot of buried memories and feelings, but the nurse was wonderful and gentle. She spoke to me so I didn't get lost too far in my memories, she placed a comforting hand on my legs that were trembling so hard the whole examining table was shaking. It was over with in mere minutes. I broke down in tears once she'd removed the speculum, and I allowed her to comfort me. I had actually done it though, I had my first internal examination at 37-years of age. Go me! I nearly let what happened to 13-year-old me prevent me from seeking medical help (and I was also incredibly lucky that nothing happened to my children during labour); I could have potentially cut my life short and left my children motherless. I almost let my past define my future but never again. Thankfully the test came back clear, albeit I'm still none the wiser as to why I'm in pain and bleeding between periods, but at least it's not cervical cancer which was my worry. I know there are people out there who are way worse off than me, so I'm sorry if this comes across as a pathetic 'poor me' story. I know my life has been nothing compared to many others' but I hope I can be forgiven for indulging in a little bit of selfishness. I apologise again for writing this novella; I never intended on writing more than a few paragraphs, but I somehow couldn't stop the words from flowing once I started. TL;DR Don't put off going for your smear test; your embarrassment or fear over going shouldn't threaten your future. You owe it to yourself and your loved ones to get yourself checked out."

I havent stopped crying and neither has she, but were also getting through it separately. Shes OKAY in a way and is shutting us out but thats to be expected. The thing is, I feel ... awkward. Has anyone else who has experienced rape felt this when someone has just recently been raped and they tell you? I feel sadness, disgust and all the normal things. I cried for days. Its re-triggering, but that was in a sense okay because I was so happy she confided in me. I always want to be an ear for someone going through this. Anyway. I really dont know how else to describe it. Awkward / embarrassed are the only words that come to mind when I think of that extra slight thing that happens when I see her now. Maybe its due to vulnerability ? Idk."

We dont do how are yous or I love yous. We dont have talks beyond small talk. They dont know me at all. They dont know what I do for work or who my friends are or that I took a trip abroad last month. I hate explaining my relationship with my parents to people. Its not necessarily a hostile situation, it just is what it is. Recently, I have realized that I have major avoidant attachment and intimacy issues. I have a really hard time being vulnerable and getting close to people and any time I start liking someone, I immediately want to run. I think about all the times I offered a shred of vulnerability to my parents throughout my lifeyour parents, who are supposed to care, love and support youand how it was met with instant disapproval, criticism, backlash. I cant think of time theyve ever supported me in anything. A time they were proud of me. A time I was good enough. I want so badly to be able to fix this part of myself that is so broken. Sometimes I feel like I will never be capable of true love. I dont know if Ive ever felt it. Sometimes I feel like I will end up alone but part of me finds relief in that. Someone called me at 7 am this morning. It was my mom. Not sure where she got my number. Maybe my sister? I didnt answer. I dont know if Ill call her back."

That you as an ex don't owe anything to someone. But that's not true. It's bullshit advice. Both people in a relationship owe it to each other to make sure that they are as kind and truthful to each other as possible and that both people try to get the other person out of the relationship as healthily as possible. If someone makes themselves vulnerable to you it is your responsibility, even as an ex, to be kind and respectful to that vulnerability. That doesn't mean staying with someone you don't like. And breakups suck, people get hurt. That's never going to change. But to just say, ""they are an ex"" and you don't owe them anything is wrong and a cop out. We can all do better than that. If your ex reaches out to you about something that is bothering them or you know you did something wrong in the relationship don't just hide behind that excuse. No contact is often the best way forward from a breakup. But don't use that or the fact that someone is an ex to be a shitty person."

We have broken up, but because of finances, (his), we are still living together. He knew I was dreading coming back. He also knows I care ENORMOUSLY what others think of me. And that I really do care when I think I may have hurt people. I hadn't heard from him for a couple weeks. Today I finally texted and said, ""hey, is everything ok?"" He responded that i was filled with unfettered anger, sadness and fear, and that he has had nightmares about it since he came back, and that yes we are still friends but he does not want to talk to me for a while. Followed by another text about how he ""sees into people and their feelings and has great empathy for others"". &amp;#x200B; I mean, wth? &amp;#x200B; I DID have a few moments there where I realized how fucked up my relationship made me, but it was mostly me being nervous about other people- I realized I WATCH people to anticipate their moods so I can stay out of their way.

I feel, honestly, that he realized my vulnerability and is using it against me. Its really hurtful, and I do not know what the hell to feel about it. He won't talk to me, so I am left to guess.....which also feels really hurtful and even manipulative.

I just have to vent because I can't sleep...again..., and it's 4:30am. Everyone is asleep, and me, my SO, and my friends are all going to be so busy tomorrow getting a house my bf is selling ready to be inspected by the buyer, I have to get it off my chest now. I have bipolar disorder, but I've had it under control for years. I've had my ups and downs and a head injury to boot, but it's been managable...until I got laid off a few months ago. Then I started getting depressed, but I was still keeping it in check. I wasn't doing great, but I was still okay. Then the pharmacy screwed up, and I was off half of my meds for 2 weeks. Cue downward spiral. Luckily, I was still okay and knew once my meds got back to normal I'd be okay because they weren't the important ones that build up in my system. They were the daily stimulant that works right away and lasts 12 hrs. The problem is, I just got everything sorted out and started taking them again 2 days ago. Since then, I've slept for about 2 hours total, and it wasn't restful sleep. I'm panicking because the last time I did this, I hit a manic phase which ended in a four day stint of nonstop work with only one hour of sleep, started hallucinating, and crashed...hard. I'm so glad I'm seeing my psychiatrist Monday, but I feel like I just kept saying ""it's all okay. Everything is still under control"" (see above) for so long while things were actually really not okay. My boyfriend (36M) has only seen the stable side of me with the mild ups and downs. The ones I really actually had under control. Now I've got to be a whole new kind of vulnerable with him, and I really don't want to scare him off. He's really a great guy, and he's the first guy I have dated who seems to legitimately be good for me (after a long line of enablers or jerks or combos)., but he doesn't have the highest EQ. It usually just takes him time to figure out what his feelings are and how to handle someone else's feelings. He always gets there, but sometimes it takes some coaching. I'm just so proud of how far I've come, how long I've been stable and flourishing, and now I'm terrified it's all going to fall apart again, and I don't want my boyfriend to see the bad sides of me right now. Vulnerability can really suck sometimes. I know this isn't the worst thing in the world, and I'm blessed and appreciate the fact that I can even go to a doctor and take meds when so many people don't have that, but I'm just scared and too tired to keep things in perspective. If anyone reads this, thank you for being my outlet tonight. I just needed to freak out and cry even if I'm just screaming into the reddit abyss. Hopefully this will be enough for me to get to sleep."

I guess this is just my personal confession so that I don't have to keep it inside anymore. I'm a 33 year old man and every day is constant emotional pain from loneliness. I've only had one serious girlfriend in my life, 6 years ago, and it lasted for less than six months. It was not a very physically affectionate relationship beside the sex, that just wasn't her way. I feel starved for affection and intimacy, like I might never feel safe or sane again. I can't remember the last time I felt physical affection from another person. I feel like a broken little fish that has to be kept in a separate fish bowl to prevent whatever problem it has from spilling over to the other fish. I feel like I'm in another world, staring at everyone else and knowing that I missed my chance and this is going to be the way I am for the rest of my life. I was much freer with my emotions and feelings, but enough public humiliations for being a soft-hearted and emotional guy will teach you that no one is going to find that attractive. I don't have anyone to blame but myself. I never managed the way I was or put myself out there or improved my life at the time I needed to. I was always too late to do what I needed to do. Now I'm emotionally distant out of fear of scaring off women again like I used to when I was overly honest with my feelings when I was younger, or I let go and I'm the same overly emotional boy I always was. I never found the balance. I never figured out how to be attractive. I thought if I waited, it might come to me. Now I spend all day sending messages on apps or looking for places I could meet another person and never finding anything. And on the rare chance I find a possible match I find a way to self-sabotage as I'm afraid of showing any vulnerability. I did therapy. I did meds. They only kept me steady, but I never got past right where I started. I'm a 33 year old man who has nothing to offer anyone in a relationship other than romantic inexperience and a head full of esoteric books I read to fill up the time alone. I feel like I'm in constant pain that I'm managing, and some days you're fine and others (like today) it's excruciating. I feel like a single astronaut trapped in orbit between the earth and the moon. I'm not asking for sympathy or advice. I know it all. Don't give up. Someone's out there. You have to love yourself before you love another person. Maybe you should return to therapy. 33 isn't the end, there's always time, I know someone who found love when they were 33 and so on and so forth. No one is owed anything and I expect nothing as I've done nothing to deserve anything. I hope that by typing all of this out I can focus on work again instead being engulfed by this constant din of unbearable loneliness."

You fail to appreciate the strengths which I pride myself and that others value in meloyalty, tenacity, eloquence/creativity/, passion, intelligence, sincerity. Im angry that no matter what I do or who I am, it doesnt matter. My commitment, dedication, witticisms, beauty, patience, humor, empathynone of it will ever be enough to persuade you that Im deserving of your time or affection. Refute it all you want, make excuses or justifications for why your time is more valuable than mine, gaslight me and call me crazy or neurotic, but the reality is, Im not good enough and Im fucking angry. Angry at myself for predicting this, for trying to be brave and suspend this fear for the perceived value of the reward. Irate with myself for falsely believing that my openness to comprise my mental wellness for you for over a year is a strength when its really a disability. Its involuntary.

Im angry at you for misrepresenting your intentions and pretending to a decent, empathetic person capable of compromisesomeone who was willing to legitimately try and mean it, someone that wouldnt ghost or allow a connection to dissipateto actually be someone that is dependable. I wish you were the person I once knew. The person who showed up at my door unannounced and allow us both to surrender our fears and cultivate hope in each other. The person that was willing to take the risk because being stagnant yields no progress. The person who once unleashed the pinnacle of his love and let us take care of each other instead of drowning in resentment and fear. But I wasnt even asking for this. All I wanted was consistency, reliability, and respect. Why do you no longer show me how proud you are of your homemade pizza? Is it not the little things that preserve sanity? Or because stress means ceasing to affirm strengths and positive moments? Why did you promise not to ghost, but then fucking make justifications for the differences between businesses and ignoring? Why do you label me as needy or demanding because I desire to talk to you after a week of silence? How is establishing a baseline pattern of daily communication and then becoming non-responsive for days different from the previously acknowledged stated fear of abandonment? How is confirming a determined time for a phone call but blowing if off on multiple occasions reliable? Or planning for a scheduled visit 3 weeks ahead so that I make accommodating arrangements and then canceling last minute without warning considerate or dependable? How is assuring someone that feelings arent one sided but elect not to respond to messages for days either courteous or respectful? The only consistency that is offered is the unreliability. Why, do every time we reconcile friendship do you make the conscious decision to evoke desire/love, but fail to nourish it? Why did you accept and pretend to empathize with the fact that I cant keep doing this fucking pattern anymore but contribute no effort to actually sustaining a friendship? Your absence implies that trying is just tolerance of messages that you choose to ignore. Communication isnt a solo task. Why did you buy the plane ticket? Why did you linger? Why did you message me on WhatsApp asking why I sent you a generic holiday greeting? You knew damn well why. You know I cant resist the possibility of reconciliation despite the suffering you promised to not re-inflict, by indulging it with initial reciprocal congenialness and the implication of a future. You waterboard me with hope. Giving it when its convenient for you yet denying it with the introduction of the most asinine obstacle. Why subject anyone, let alone someone you supposedly have some essence of feelings for to this? How is that consistent with compassion or even decent courtesy for others? Im angry at you for being a fucking coward. For not being reliable to return a promised phone call. Im angry that the degree of passion that is instilled in this message is futile. Im angry at you for conforming to our fucked up culture and being just another typical millennial. Im angry that all this has merit, yet Ill still be kept on read."

If you are reading this, it means I have done all that I can to try and live a normal life but that right has been stolen from me. If you are reading this, it means I am a woman that has been emotionally battered and wrongfully victimized by the malicious acts of a man that for years believed he was invincible and would suffer no consequence. If you are reading this, or even listening to it, please know that I appreciate this opportunity to write about what happened to me in 2016 and 2017, the years that my life changed forever. I thank you for your undivided attention. Before you read on, I want to apologize for the length of my statement; as long as it is, I no longer want to be silent. I deserve to be heard. For many years, I was happy. As a student at a prestigious high school, I was learning at an accelerated rate. I had participated in the schools cross-country team, was the Freshman Year student body president, and I approached every challenge with optimism and excitement. I was proud of myself and my accomplishments, and I had my eyes set on a wonderful future. My dreams of a fulfilling college education and a shining future came to a crashing halt when (RB)s careless, invasive and barbaric crime knocked me from my pedestal. He stole so much more than a few images of me. He stole my trust and my faith in the good of man; he sabotaged my dreams and goals by doing something that completely and utterly damaged my reputation, my mental state, and my hopes for the future. Not only did he steal something so personal and private and suffer no consequence - he robbed me blindly of my privacy, and shared with the world a body that was not his to exploit; he robbed me of the rights to my own body, and I can never get that back. RB, what you did was groundbreakingly traumatic for me, and I looked you in the eye and I forgave you. I forgave you, because in my heart, there was no way a human being would purposefully prey upon and degrade another in this way. But, this incident has never left me. I hope it was worth it to share my nude images with your friends, because youve destroyed my life because of it. In our class, you did not hesitate when you decided you wanted to hack my cell phone. You did not hesitate when you plugged my phone into the schools computer with a USB cord. Your ignorance shined when you stole multiple images of me, naked and revealing my most private self, and downloaded them to your flash drive. You did not consider the ramifications and the hurt you would cause when you shared these compromising images with your friends and others on the internet. My body is not yours to share. My images were not yours to distribute. Youve assaulted me, and every time these images resurface, I struggle to find it in my heart to forgive you again. I choke down tears and try to process my pain every single time I see them online - I am both red with anger and horrified that you would do this to someone that had never wronged you. You did not stop and think about the impact something as sensitive as this would have on a motivated and driven young lady. You stole so much more than a couple of images from my phone; youve barbarically stripped me of my clothing to hundreds of people Ill never know. Do you have any idea how it feels to walk down the street, or into a store, and feel as if everyone has seen you completely naked and vulnerable? Can you even comprehend the evil behind what youve done? I cannot make a friend that hasnt seen my breasts, I cannot enter a college class because of crippling anxiety, and I am wounded in ways I fear I cant recover from. Because of your sharing of my explicit photos, you have allowed countless men to assault me over and over again. You ripped me from my own body, a body that has been preyed on, commented about, shared with and obsessed over. I no longer own my body. Let me repeat that - I no longer own my body. Because of you and you alone, youve allowed an innocent woman to become the victim of stalking, sexual harassment and threats that have not stopped since 2017. You are a predator, and you will get what you deserve . The physical, financial, psychological and emotional impact of what youve done does not take a day off - every single day, I have to carry this guilt in my heart. Because of the stress and trauma associated with being humiliated and degraded constantly for months on end following this incident, I have developed an unhealthy relationship with my body. A once dedicated athlete, I have been reduced to obsessing about my imperfections and the overall shape and curve of my body. I have gained more than 30 pounds while I mourned and grieved the loss of ownership of my body - psychologically, I have become convinced that the bigger I become through disordered eating, the less people will want to see me naked and maybe, just maybe, the requests for naked pictures of me will stop littering forums online. My relationship with myself is dramatically impaired, and I cannot look myself in the mirror and find the strength to smile knowing people like you are out there, preying on unsuspecting women. For a long time, I hated myself because of the harassment I would receive on social media - men commenting on my body, what they wanted to do with me, asking and sometimes demanding that I sleep with them, threatening rape and assault. I felt like a piece of meat, and shame and disgust consumed me for years. For YEARS, I have tried to cope with this and learn to love myself after what you did, but I am still suffering from weekly panic attacks, dreadful nightmares and intense thoughts of suicide. Financially, I have had to pay for numerous behavioral health services including extensive psychotherapy sessions. You have burdened me with these financial obligations, and how do you think I feel having to shell out $300 and hour to talk about YOU to a psychologist? I feel sick when I think about you - you can never understand how it feels to have to pay for services to curb the feelings of vulnerability, hopelessness, sadness and betrayal that you caused when I was simply a bright high school student. In addition, thanks to your cruel invasion of privacy and distribution of child pornography, I had lost my job - the only job I had when I was living on my own at 16/17 years old and could barely make rent. Months after you violated my trust and exploited me, multiple people had found where I worked and came into my place of employment and stood at the counter staring at me. Some made sounds and sexual gestures to me. A co-worker sexually harassed me shortly after. And when I rejected his demands to sleep with him, he had stated that I had nice nudes on the internet, and he further pressured me into allowing him to have a turn. I had to leave an entire job because of you, because men came in badgering me after stalking me online and asking for my personal details such as my address and phone number. I felt terrified, isolated and humiliated, the subject of scandal and rumor to all of my co-workers, and I was distressed and hard pressed for days before I couldnt walk through the doors anymore. You robbed me of a job, and a paycheck. You robbed me of my reputation and allowed anonymous persons to slandered my name. You wrecked me, and you dont even feel sorry. To this day, I am in constant fear of these images making their way into the hands of my young adult colleagues and fellow co-workers and spread like wildfire. I am in FEAR that any day now, I will be told news I cant bear to hear and lose this job too. Thank you for this. I have had to see multiple mental health professionals to cope with the stress and suicidal thoughts and attempts Ive made because of you. When I meet people with your name, I shudder and my heart jolts with a fear you cant even begin to comprehend. I have seen a behavioral therapist and a psychotherapist and have been diagnosed with massively overbearing depression, mood issues, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa disorder, all thanks to you. For some selfish reason, you wanted the world to see me naked and in turn, you have extinguished every ounce of self-love and a sense of control I had within me. You have made me cry every single day for the last three years. You have made me a sufferer of frequent and paralyzing anxiety attacks when in social situations, as I have to live with the agonizing fear that members of any crowd have seen my breasts and genitals. I cannot maintain friendships with men in my age group anymore because I am terrified that they are interested in me for all of the wrong reasons; I second guess every single person, male or female, that approaches me with genuine kindness. Youve stripped me of my ability to form trusting and healthy relationships with my peers, and because of the massive shame I am forced to contend with, I am confined to a dark bedroom to cry and ask God why something so criminal had happened to me. A few months ago, a man I barely knew had gone through my social circle and boasted about having an intimate sexual relationship with me, and I have never met him before. He showed off the revealing pictures to his friends (former acquaintances of mine as well) and I found out from a family member at a FAMILY GATHERING. I was hot with rage, embarrassment and guilt and in that moment, I wished the absolute worst upon you. I couldnt escape this situation, and was the subject of false stories and lies of sexual escapades because you had the nerve to leak my pictures. I could not even find comfort and solace in my own family because of you. You took away my sense of security and safety IN MY OWN FAMILY. On the revenge porn websites, each new thread starts with a user posting an image of the place he wants to recieve nudes from - whether it be a local high school, or a university or even just a city. What youve done is so severe and invasive that I am literally frozen in terror at the thought of attending a four-year college. I am in constant fear of being recognized, harassed, slandered, blackmailed and manipulated into doing things I wouldnt otherwise want to do. You stole my future from me because now, whenever I have a brief moment of motivation to move past this and I look at colleges online, I can not, no matter how hard I try, get over the dread of going to a new school to have my nude images passed around again. Every single time I see my hometown sign while driving, my heart sinks because the crime you commited is fresh in my mind. I cannot go to the movies, because I am scared of running into people I know. I will never set foot in a mall or shopping center again because the very last time I did, you were there with your accomplice friends and I made eye contact with you. I sobbed and ran to my car, and have not been back since. I had mentioned I was suicidal - and because of you, I have been battling with this for years. I have made two attempts on my life because I cant seem to outrun what youve done to me. The wound reopens every single time an anonymous person posts my naked pictures online. I can no longer have a decent day because I obsess over finding my body exploited online in chats, forums and blogs. I have tried everything I can to get away from these demons but they follow me, because whenever I think theyre gone and things are going to be okay, somebody else posts my pictures and Im assaulted on the internet all over again. At any time, anyone can undress me, can see me at my most vulnerable, can tear open my blouse for the world to see, and I cannot stop them, no matter how many tear-filled nights Ive spent up, fighting with porn websites to have these images removed. The issue is, even if they are removed, shortly after theyll be requested for again and again, and Ill be left shattered on the floor trying to open a bottle of pills, only my hands cant stop shaking because I am angry at you and I wish you would have never done this to me. I cannot run from this. It hangs over my head and drowns me whenever I feel even the slightest bit okay. You left me cracked and in pieces - I am not the woman I once admired. You destroyed me for your own gain. Every single diary entry Ive written in the last 30 days has idealized suicide as the only means of being forgotten. Men will trade my pictures like Pokemon cards every single day and I cant stop them. I feel POWERLESS. I have you to thank for that. I once had a large Facebook following, a SnapChat account, an Instagram. I have had to remove myself from the publics eye in order to avoid sextortion, slander, and harassment. I can never connect with my friends and family again because when you posted my full name on that website to shame me, I received hundreds of messages from complete strangers detailing horrific, disturbing things. Ive been stalked, and followed. You did this to me. I have developed a fear of social media because it was used to harm and embarrass me. Youre a monster. You have depleted my finances, scarred my emotionally, ripped away my sense of confidence and faith, and have led me to suicide. But do you know what else you did? You snaked your way into my personal life. I cannot trust anyone anymore, that much is clear. But when you leaked those pictures of me, you ruined my ability to distinguish between people that were really there for me, and people that had ulterior motives. I have had to remove myself from several strong friendships and relationships because I was unable to comprehend why someone would do something so heinous to another human being, and I was terrified that my friends were going to use this against me. I am left alone now, because I cant form meaningful friendships. I am so paranoid now that I have nobody left in my corner. That is a result of the trauma you caused when you shared pictures that did not belong to you with the world. And wait, while we are on the topic of pictures that did not belong to you, why me? What did I do to you? What did I say to deserve to have the past three years of my life ruined by you? I have lost a job because of harassment and Im unable to function socially. My grades plummeted as I could no longer sit and focus in a classroom, and spent most of my school year in the guidance office trying to make sense of whats happened. I was bullied, shamed, targeted and further exploited by my peers that turned to victim shaming and blaming instead of asking how the pictures were leaked in the first place. That is a problem I contend with today - people dont care about the person who is being victimized; they only acknowledge the person as the one that deserved the invasion of privacy. She should not have taken the pictures, and She got what she deserved because she took the pictures, are comments that reflect societys ignorance. Having these images on my phone was my choice, and keeping them for myself was my choice - having my phone broken into was not. You had no reason to do this and yet you did. Why? Last year, an old classmate of ours approached me at a restaurant and claimed that you were bragging about what you did to me and how it has affected me. The person explained that you were cold and unfeeling in your statements, and this led to a physical altercation. In the 2017 school year, your accomplices explained that your father was not angry at you and you were teasing me behind my back. You knew I was underage at the time, and still went forward and spread these images just because you could. You violated my privacy and stole so much from me, and I want for you to really and truly be punished for what you did and for the years youve taken from me as a result, years that I cannot get back. I want an apology from you. And not a simple, Im sorry and this is why,... I want for you to realize the magnitude of the wrong youve done, and to look me in the eye and tell me that you really are sorry. I want you to dedicate a few hours of your life writing me a letter. I likely will not be able to bring myself to read it, but I want for you to really reflect on how wicked you were to me. You have taken so much from me - this is what I need for you to do now. For three years, I let you control me. I will not any longer. I will not hunt for my images online anymore and then break down when I inevitably find them. I will not be afraid to create meaningful male friendships. I will not be silent - I will speak out at child advocacy centers and publicly speak up about situations similar to this and how revenge porn needs to be taken more seriously. I will take this as a hard and painful lesson and grow from it. This afternoon, I made a promise to myself that I was no longer going to let this define me and dictate my life anymore. Today, Im taking my body back. FUCK YOU, RB."
301,vulnerability,offmychest,It's Not a Mental Health Issue,0,cmp37d,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/cmp37d/its_not_a_mental_health_issue/,2019-08-06 20:56:40,"So, every time there's a mass shooting I have a series of thoughts I feel like expressing elsewhere but usually don't. This post isn't meant to be politically charged, although perhaps because of my mix of viewpoints it inherently is. Either, here we go. I don't believe the plague of mass shootings in America (my country) is a mental health issue. I strongly resist the idea that the way to fix what has been escalating for so long is to institute changes in mental health availability or practices. There are several reasons for this, the least of which being that I don't believe it would have any effect. So few people see their regular physicians when they are ill, and mental health has an even lower level of participation. Even for people who are actively worried they are depressed or dysfunctional in some way. That's just how most people are. We resist showing our vulnerability. The second reason is this: I don't believe these mass shooters are ""mentally ill."" At least not in the way that people want to believe. There's never going to be a ""mass shooter"" disorder in the DSM. And by and large, across the board, people with diagnosed disorders are not any more violent than other people. They may be doing themselves harm, but the myth of people with, say, schizophrenia or antisocial personality disorder being ticking time bombs and dangerous ""psychopaths"" just isn't supported by any real data or rationale. Now my next point comes with a caveat of sorts, if that's the right word. I absolutely believe in gun rights. I'm a gun owner, and I believe in the right of American citizens to own firearms, unless they're disallowed legally from doing so (felonies and such). And I don't believe this issue has anything to do with the worship of gun culture. This is a much, much deeper cultural issue, to me anyway...one that is a little more difficult to explain properly. I call it ""cultural osmosis."" Something in our culture has seeped through and put this level of violence on the table as appropriate. This is a poor analogy, but...it's *almost* similar to the way we learn language. Have you ever spent enough time around someone you really like and found yourself acting like them? Using words, expressions, or even the same body language as them? It *could* be that our constant exposure to mass shootings, via the 24 hour news cycle and our instant access to an unbelievable amount of information via the internet, has led to this ""cultural osmosis."" Ultimately, of course, it's a lot harder to believe (or stomach) the idea that ordinary people can be capable of incredible acts of violence. So we label them as the *other.* They're labeled as psychopaths and aberrations. Something so far outside the norm thar it's almost no use trying to explain it. And the minute you label it like that is the moment you lose any power over it. We have to own up to this as a culture, as a society. We have to take collective responsibility if we hope to come up with a solution. I know a lot of this was rambling and nonsensical, and obviously I offered no solution. Because I don't have one. And no matter which side of the fence you're on, I'm not here to argue or beat people over the head with my views. If you're aggressively anti-gun, share your thoughts. You might have a point or three. The same goes for people with different views on mental health. Anyway, thanks for reading if you made it this far."
302,vulnerability,offmychest,I saw a man today... and I cried,11,cn0hxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/cn0hxl/i_saw_a_man_today_and_i_cried/,2019-08-07 13:21:02,"So it's any other Tuesday night, I'm hungry and I order pizza delivery. Get a phone call to let me know the pizza's at the front door, I open the gate and... there he is. A very big, obese man, in his late 30s early 40s, hispanic, salt and pepper 5 o' clock shadow holding the pizza. It just kinda took me by surprise how big the fella was. ""Please sign here"", he said meekly, arm extended with receipt and pen. In that moment, I felt pity. The man was pitiful. And I don't mean I'm condescendingly looking down on him, saying he's pitiful, I mean, truly evoking a strong sense of pity. I could see the vulnerability in his eyes and stout face. Just a pizza delivery guy working honest hours to make ends meet. Wherever this man goes in public, he probably has to deal with the muffled laughs, the pointed fingers, and the disdainful looks of others. It just got me thinking... I don't know if this guy has a family, has people who care about him I hope. I don't know his life story, I don't know who he is, his name, where he's originally from, how he ended up here or where he's going in life. None of that, but I truly felt a deep feeling of pity for him. He seemed like a nice guy anyway, kind of shy in the 10 seconds I interacted with him, but nice nonetheless. I lost my appetite and it's just been going through my mind since. I don't think I've ever seen someone who I truly just, felt purely sorry for. Life is unfair. I am not depressed nor am I going through a rough patch in life. In fact, I'm quite happy. I haven't cried in the better part of a year. It just seems so silly that the sight of a man alone would knock me on my ass and cause me to feel so emotionally moved and cry, but it did."
303,vulnerability,offmychest,My best friend of 10 years tried to have sex with my 9 m/o puppy. I have no idea what to make of it. Please read.,2,bym72y,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/bym72y/my_best_friend_of_10_years_tried_to_have_sex_with/,2019-06-10 02:47:03,"So my best friend of ten years (27/m) -who is also bisexual and has an alcohol problem with a sex drive which would put an incubus to shame- came over yesterday. Once every few weeks we have this ritual; he comes over, we have a few drinks, we talk, we vent, we laugh and cry and overall have quality time together. Hes going through a particularly rough patch in his life and despite of me (25/f) being recently discharged from a psychiatric hospital for ect (electro convulsive therapy) treatment due to my mental health issues, I always try and help him with his depression and anxiety. I guess its safe to say that most of our talks are about his problems. Anyways, after a particularly emotional night and drinking probably half of our livers away, we decided it was time for bed. Now, I have two beautiful dogo argentinos, mother and son- who is actually 9 months old. And like every puppy who hits sexual maturity, he tends to hump. But this humping isnt necessarily sexual; when he feels excited, opressed, happy, loved etc. he humps because its the fastest way to express himself at that moment. I gave him my bed and made my way to the living room. The dogs almost always sleep with me, but I knew he envied me, sleeping surrounded by two massive dogs. So when he closed the door of the bedroom with the puppy still in it, I didnt think much of it. I just thought he wanted to prevent him from joining me and his mother in the living room. I knew that the puppy wouldnt want to stay there because their water bowls are in the living room and my bedroom is hot. Minutes later, the noises of the puppy panting and his paws hitting the floor (like hes jumping or something) began to fill the house and I opened my bedroom door to let him out. Instead of the sight of a puppy tippidy-tappidying right beside the door, anxious to be let out, I met the sight of my best friend completely naked, with red scratch marks on his body, bending over with an arched back and desperately trying to get my puppy to mount him. Shocked, I yank the puppy out and closed the door immediately. Not knowing how to react, I sat on the couch and lit up a cigarette. He came out seconds later, asking me if I was mad. I told him to go back to bed and shut the door, that well talk about it in the morning. Instead, he insisted that the puppy wanted it, and it was the same thing as him humping his leg. I didnt kick him out then and there, because he was the drunkest Ive ever seen him, and the panic and the emotional vulnerability he possessed at the time wasnt a good indication of him caring about his safety at that time of night. I didnt want him to end up in bed with someone dangerous -just to forget his shame and sadness (which he tends to to by the way). I pretty much kicked him out in the morning, he didnt mention anything about it. He was obviously very embarrassed. I have no idea what to make of this, how to react, how to feel. Theres no one I can talk about it. I feel like this friendship is was too deep rooted to tossed aside like that, but I also feel like this is getting ridiculously toxic. So. Yeah."
304,vulnerability,offmychest,Im trying to escape my life,3,byujp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/byujp5/im_trying_to_escape_my_life/,2019-06-10 16:42:57,"I despise the life I have. The little things are great like my dogs or the sunflowers I have growing in the front yard, but big picture I hate the paths Ive chosen. I chose the school that would be cheapest to go to, and lo and behold, Im getting the cheapest education possible. The department is small but the instructors still focus all of their time and commitment to grad students or those about to graduate, and leave the rest of us to figure things out. The areas I struggle in Im receiving no help despite asking how to do the tasks multiple times and explaining how I have an issue with emotional vulnerability. Still I get nothing except for figure out what the song means and tell the story. My personal instructor makes me sick. He sexualizes me with his comments on my body or my skin or repositioning or holding my body without my permission. Hes always given me the creeps but theres no other studio to move into and hes an extremely petty man who gives most of my degree required classes. I tried to fight this by going to beauty school. Ive always loved makeup and the idea of doing it professionally was fun for me so I decided to take the esthetics (skincare and hair removal) course option. These 600 required hours cost me $13,000 in tuition alone which I paid for out if pocket. I figured it would pay itself off quickly. Its been 10 months since I became a licensed esthetician and I havent been offered a single job in the field despite sending out resumes and calling after not hearing back. I just feel so fucking stupid for wasting that much money just so I could get a worthless piece of paper Ill never be able to use. Im trying to run away. I applied and was accepted into a school in seattle and now Im scrambling to find the money for it. I dont qualify for government aid. My folks look too good on paper and seeing as Im under 25 I wouldnt qualify to be a dependent. Apparently that status is only granted to those who have little to no contact with their parents. They arent willing to aid me financially at all. They havent for any of my education I just got extremely lucky and my grandparents built a house in a pretty much empty town that later turned into one of the most expensive areas in the US. They left all of us grandkids a sum of money for school. I have very little left due to my stupid decision to go to beauty school. My depressions getting strong again too. I attempted to take my own life back in August and since then the feelings have subsided, but this impending failure is bringing it all back. I cant take failing over and over and being constantly overlooked due to age or gender and never given a chance to prove myself. It doesnt help any that Ive gained weight. Im finding myself wanting to revert back into my anorexic habits but its a lot harder to when youre constantly being watched. I overdosed in march on lsd which I was told was impossible. My heart stopped twice but both times the emts successfully revived me and I really wish they werent successful. It was never a scary experience and I imagine it wouldnt have been a bad way to go. I do have a good therapist and psychiatrist but I dont want to admit this stuff to them which is foolish, but they keep congratulating me on my progress and the strides Im making. It feels like Im just failing there too. I know I have a lot to be grateful for and I was given privileges and opportunities that others werent, but I cant help but feel like it was wasted on me. I know most of this stress is about money and its having a domino effect, I just hate having big dreams and empty bank accounts. I just really want to escape all this bullshit. TLDR: I am failing in life, my depression is coming back, I cant afford the life I want, and Im trying to escape it all."

He, quote: ""has been behaving like he's broken ever since."" That story gave me an anxiety attack. If this assault took that boys' ownership of his body, his genitals, and his masculinity from him, if it not only violated, but destroyed the most vulnerable part of his body, which he has touched and looked at every day of his life since he was a child, and which for him IS his masculinity, if it put him in prolonged, extraordinary physical agony, humiliated him infront of his classmates, shattered his trust in the opposite sex AND his self worth, if it put a permanent mark on him, if he had to watch his weak spot swell up and turn black and blue, to be finally removed from him forever in a, yet again painful and humiliating procedure, and it crushed his spirit permanently, HOW is such an act any better than rape? If it BREAKS a person? Why is this not taken seriously? You can not make a guy feel more physically vulnerable, and exploit that vulnerability more, than by destroying his testicles.. this must have been deeply emotionally violating and traumatizing. Just hearing this story scared the hell out of me. I guess I'm just sharing this to find some sort of affirmation, that doing something like this to a boy, is as terrible as it seems to me... If you disagree, please explain to me why a broken spirit is not as bad as a broken spirit, based on what caused it..."

So, please bear with me when it comes to the story. Its not about the fine details. Its just about putting out whats happened with my life, and how I overcame it. My name is Sam, and Im from Murfreesboro, TN. Murfreesboro is medium sized city about 45 minutes from Nashville. If you dont know what Nashville is, well its where all the country music is from, and is a very kitschy and stereotypical city currently Expanding and Metropolitinizing (becoming very popular and dense like a metro area like Chicago or Detroit). I grew up here and when I say here, I just mean Tennessee in general. I had divorced parents who were in constant court battles over me, and a dad with 2 different stepmoms now so of course moving is something Im used to. I was born in Smyrna, TN. Grew up the early years in Antioch, and then my mom bought a house in Murfreesboro. I lived there for many years and really had no sense of what common household parents were like. My parents were divorced from a very young age, so I figured that split parents were something that every kid was dealing with. I cant remember what age it was but around the time of 5 is when my parents divorced, my mom managed to make caring for me and my sister her top priority, and as Antioch was slowly becoming a less safe neighborhood she decided that it was time for a move(when we moved to the house in Murfreesboro) this was also not to long after my parents divorce. As a kid I knew my parents went to court a lot, but I did not know exactly how often or who was taking the other to court, just I knew that in the end my mother won the first rounds. Growing up with my mom we werent rich or poor, but we were well taken care of and made sure we had the necessities to live and be happy. My mom had a job somewhere close and the boss was abusive, harassing, etc. before this time me and my sister ended up getting into an argument , she hit me, ran out of the house, me not wanting her to come back in locked the doors waiting till my mom got home. Let this be known we did not have phones at the time. Somehow, she contacted my father, and he came pinned me to the fridge punched me multiple times, and took my sister left and called the police. He had nothing but a lie filled story from my sister and the cops said theres nothing they can do but let my sister go with him, and not have to come back till she wanted, or it went to court. She did, and I didnt see her till court. Thats the moment I stopped caring for my dad. I know its hard to say and hard to put in a post, but he showed nothing but the worst to me and my sister, and he most definitely continued that through my life. After court it was determined that my sister shouldnt live with my mom and is to visit her once every two weeks and the same for my dad, that being were both at the house the one is visiting, so me and my sister were together every weekend. This is when I realized I couldnt even trust my own sister. She started calling my mom HER NAME behind her back and my stepmom at the time momma. Disgusting. Of course, I had a stepbrother at the time but Im going to leave him out of this for the most part. My dad and stepmom lived in a small rental house before my sister lived with them. Cheap everything. That was the goal, Cheap. I didnt know why, he said it was because my mom is sucking him dry of all his money a couple years later the brand new 2 story, 5-bedroom, 4-bathroom, bonus room, garage, in a insanely nice neighborhood proved that wrong. Thats what sucked my sister in, the look of a visual pleasing lifestyle where money was no issue, and that turned out to be a lie. Of course, when they got the new house meant we got a cool new Christmas, well everyone who lived there. We all made lists. I asked for a guitar, stepbrother asked for drums and all sorts, sister asked for phone, paint stuff, and a lot. I just asked for a guitar, cheap or not didnt matter. Everyone got what they wanted except me. I got a cheap bike, and stocking stuffers. I know thats better then most why I am complaining. My stepbrother probably got about 3,000 dollars worth of gifts, I got about 150. I was treated as an afterthought in what was supposed to be my home, another reoccurring theme throughout my life. My mom gave me and my sister an equal Christmas. I was okay with that. Then my mom decided to move again. She moved to an apartment in franklin leasing out her house to a close friend, who taught me more than my father ever has and ever will. Then the pressure got to me. My school was essentially a private school in a very rich kid neighborhood, and after lots of bullying, taunting, and social exclusion I just couldnt do it anymore, everything was tense and put me on edge. My dad ended up striking and stealing me away from my mom when me and her were in a tough spot. I was forced to live with him. Essentially dealing with the same thing I dealt with at school but at my own home. I was made fun of for being rich where we lived because it was a small poor town. I wasnt rich. My dad was. My sister was. My stepfamily was. I was treated as nothing. All I wanted while I was there was my mom, but my dad made sure that, it was not allowed to happen. He did whatever he could to not allow me anywhere near her, or in contact with her. That was my life till he was caught cheating with who is my current stepmom at the time, and then he was swiftly kicked out and filed for divorce after his bank accounts were empty. He used his own vulnerability to play against my mom. He made her let him use her house. He claims she raped him of all his money when she did this, but I know that wasnt true. She did it for her kids. It was supposed to be easy life after that. Seeing both parents, living somewhat normal lives, and given chances to be taken care of. But he didnt tell us that he was already getting married to my current stepmom. When I found this out 2 days before she was supposed to move there, I knew that I was in for trouble, and I was. As soon as she came all the promises came falling and I would be put through the ultimate test of strength for the next 5 years till I graduated. Sorry I havent been giving ages or times but, id rather not say how young I was when all of this was happening. When my stepmom came for the first months things were calm, too calm. She didnt do any parenting or really cared to tell us what to do. She thought thats our dads job. So for that time she would tell my dad what to tell us to do and we would do it. Then the credit cards came into play. All the things that me and my sister were promised never came. My sister having had everything handed to her, then to nothing, started to rebel. It was just life for me at that point, but to make it worse for my sister my stepmom didnt want another woman in my fathers eyes. Even if that included his daughter. She did everything she could to push her out of his life. He of course wouldnt let that happen because if she was gone, he would either have no child support from my mom, what little it was, or even worse to him, him paying her. So, my sister lived a hellish life for a long time because of my stepmom and she deserved it after she betrayed my mother the way she did. Back to me, I grew up doing all the important outdoor and animal chores for my family because no one else would do it, and they didnt trust my sister because of her rebelling. My stepmom had an obsession to buy everything she wanted and that included animals. We became animal hoarders, but I kept it together, I ran the animal show and was given the responsibility to take care of all the animals that everyone enjoyed but did no work for, and what was I given? As my dad told me I was lucky he didnt force me to sleep in the yard. So thats what I was given. Of course, my grades fell behind because I couldnt get anything done having to be the grounds keeper 24/7 rain, sun, snow, or fire. I was told to eat in my room no tv, no talking, no doing anything but studying. It was like that for months, even after my grades came up and I didnt have and cs. Eventually my sister was old enough to just get up and leave. So, she did. She lived with my mom for a month before moving in with her boyfriend who was about 4 years older than her. She was back in about a month, and then gone for another, and then back, and then gone for another. She finally just moved out and stayed out. I of course still lived with my dad because who else would take care of his animals? And I wasnt 18 so I couldnt leave. So, I had to stay and be a slave to everyone. Things got somewhat better. When I turned 16 my mom and stepdad graciously bought me a car, it was older, but damn was it nice. Still my favorite car to this day. If you offered me that 2002 Acura RSX or a Lambo, I would take the Lambo, sell it and buy 20 of those. I had a girlfriend which I was strictly not allowed to have. My dad found out, smashed any device I had that I could contact the outside world with and then told me I could only do my chores and sit in my room, nothing else. Thats all I did anyway. I was never allowed to leave the house, I was never allowed to go to social events, or even hangout with friends. I couldnt, I had chores to do. That was my life for a long time. I didnt do anything but take care of animals and go to school. Then graduation was about 2 months away. Everything was on track. Then my dad moved, just to try to fuck me over so I had to stay with him. I already had a lot of my stuff at my moms because I was not staying there as soon as I graduated. I wasnt even going to be 18 but I didnt care. I was going to get in my car and drive off. So I contacted the school and got permission to drive to school from that house and attend a school an hour away. And guess what. I did just fucking that not saying a word to anyone, because I knew they knew. Driving off I said, fuck it. Never came back. Then I had to go to college, I basically just chose nursing because its all my stepmom every talked about and she liked to brag about how much money she made so I should do that. About a year in took off from college. I had a lot of debt, about 2000 credit card and 2500 school because I left before my scholarship was over, I got told I had to pay. So, I worked shit jobs, didnt do anything, became a recluse and ended up loosing my jobs and did nothing. I got into an argument with my brother who graciously gave me a job. Quit, and then the same day got kicked out of my house. I lived with my sister for a couple days, my brother for a couple and then got an apartment. This is when my credit cards wouldnt work anymore because I couldnt spend anymore(I set a limit of 2500). I got shitty jobs made money to pay rent, finally got a good serving gig, and amazingly did my taxes with me having to had pay for my school got a return big enough to put a huge dent in my credit card debt. Having the serving job, I was able to pay off the rest of my debts and eventually became debt free and have an amazing credit score of about 800 at 19. I know you guys are thinking how did pull that off with maxed cards. I always made sure I paid what I needed and maxed for me is 25% of the card limit which is 10,000. And all my payments put me under 20%. And when setting up my moms daily credit card I set it in my name also, so I got credit from her daily purchases and payments which shes the best about. So, Im 19 and I have no debt, a good job, an apartment, and am starting to come out of my shell, even soon planning to start my own detailing business. I know some are wondering, Do I talk to my dad? The short answer is no. I gain nothing from it. He beat me down and ruined me for all those years and even let others do it, watched and did nothing for me. Hes not my dad, hes just some guy who wanted to do nothing but make his ex-wives live a living hell and give who ever his fling at the time was whatever they wanted, And yes Ive tried talking to him but he acts like I owe him everything, which I promise you I owe him nothing, and never will. Its just hard becoming open about these kinds of things, its hard being open for me in general, Ive only had very few people in my life that I can trust, and most of the time theyve been ripped away from me. I dont know how to be very socially acceptable; I was never in the position of being accepted so I guess its just something Im going to have to learn. Finally, for all the people out there who are going through similar things, just bear with it, compliance is the best way to kill people who want to see you react, and just look forward to your driving off and saying fuck it moment."
308,vulnerability,offmychest,I need to tell someone this.,1,c39fc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/c39fc1/i_need_to_tell_someone_this/,2019-06-21 21:28:36," Before anyone says anything I know there are huge gaps missing and that its going to make people mad, but there are things in this that I do have to edit out because It gives away the identity of certain people, who they are, and what they do. So, please bear with me when it comes to the story. Its not about the fine details. Its just about putting out whats happened with my life, and how I overcame it. My name is Sam, and Im from Murfreesboro, TN. Murfreesboro is medium sized city about 45 minutes from Nashville. If you dont know what Nashville is, well its where all the country music is from, and is a very kitschy and stereotypical city currently Expanding and Metropolitinizing (becoming very popular and dense like a metro area like Chicago or Detroit). I grew up here and when I say here, I just mean Tennessee in general. I had divorced parents who were in constant court battles over me, and a dad with 2 different stepmoms now so of course moving is something Im used to. I was born in Smyrna, TN. Grew up the early years in Antioch, and then my mom bought a house in Murfreesboro. I lived there for many years and really had no sense of what common household parents were like. My parents were divorced from a very young age, so I figured that split parents were something that every kid was dealing with. I cant remember what age it was but around the time of 5 is when my parents divorced, my mom managed to make caring for me and my sister her top priority, and as Antioch was slowly becoming a less safe neighborhood she decided that it was time for a move(when we moved to the house in Murfreesboro) this was also not to long after my parents divorce. As a kid I knew my parents went to court a lot, but I did not know exactly how often or who was taking the other to court, just I knew that in the end my mother won the first rounds. Growing up with my mom we werent rich or poor, but we were well taken care of and made sure we had the necessities to live and be happy. My mom had a job somewhere close and the boss was abusive, harassing, etc. before this time me and my sister ended up getting into an argument , she hit me, ran out of the house, me not wanting her to come back in locked the doors waiting till my mom got home. Let this be known we did not have phones at the time. Somehow, she contacted my father, and he came pinned me to the fridge punched me multiple times, and took my sister left and called the police. He had nothing but a lie filled story from my sister and the cops said theres nothing they can do but let my sister go with him, and not have to come back till she wanted, or it went to court. She did, and I didnt see her till court. Thats the moment I stopped caring for my dad. I know its hard to say and hard to put in a post, but he showed nothing but the worst to me and my sister, and he most definitely continued that through my life. After court it was determined that my sister shouldnt live with my mom and is to visit her once every two weeks and the same for my dad, that being were both at the house the one is visiting, so me and my sister were together every weekend. This is when I realized I couldnt even trust my own sister. She started calling my mom HER NAME behind her back and my stepmom at the time momma. Disgusting. Of course, I had a stepbrother at the time but Im going to leave him out of this for the most part. My dad and stepmom lived in a small rental house before my sister lived with them. Cheap everything. That was the goal, Cheap. I didnt know why, he said it was because my mom is sucking him dry of all his money a couple years later the brand new 2 story, 5-bedroom, 4-bathroom, bonus room, garage, in a insanely nice neighborhood proved that wrong. Thats what sucked my sister in, the look of a visual pleasing lifestyle where money was no issue, and that turned out to be a lie. Of course, when they got the new house meant we got a cool new Christmas, well everyone who lived there. We all made lists. I asked for a guitar, stepbrother asked for drums and all sorts, sister asked for phone, paint stuff, and a lot. I just asked for a guitar, cheap or not didnt matter. Everyone got what they wanted except me. I got a cheap bike, and stocking stuffers. I know thats better then most why I am complaining. My stepbrother probably got about 3,000 dollars worth of gifts, I got about 150. I was treated as an afterthought in what was supposed to be my home, another reoccurring theme throughout my life. My mom gave me and my sister an equal Christmas. I was okay with that. Then my mom decided to move again.

I know you shouldn't. I know you can't. I know I don't *really* want you to. I know you will only bring me pain. I know to have you in my life, in any way, is to sacrifice my very values. I know I can't communicate with you. I know I'd send you away, time and time again. I know I'd just remember why I loved you. I know I'd just yearn for what I could never have. I know it would make me wish for days I'd *never* choose to live through again, and put me in danger of living through future days that are even worse. I know your silence means respect. I know your silence is an act of selfless love. I know you care more for my piece of mind, more for my life, than you do for your own selfish desires. I know you take your commitments seriously. You priorities are straight. Your character is unmatched. Your devotion to your own values is admirable, and most everyone in the world won't ever see what you've sacrificed to be true to yourself. None of this helps any. It only makes it worse. It only makes me see why I loved you so very much. It only makes me wish harder that things were different. It only makes me glad I met you. Glad I saw something better in life. It makes me know there are people out there who do share my values, but that they are most likely never to be with me. It makes me glad that my relationship crumbled when I saw you. It makes me so glad for the time that we had. I seek to hear that you still love me. I seek to know that it wasn't a farce. I want to know that I wasn't just a fantasy, something sexual. I hope you remember me, beyond what I look like, and what I represent. I hope you miss me. The real me. I want you to know how very strong I am. So much more than I ever was when you knew me. I'm strong and amazing. I'm happy and surrounded by love. I don't need your patronizing affections, or your awe of my vastly different life choices. But I want to know it was real, it was worth something, that the right things came of it. After all, it was my life that fell apart when I fell in love with your wise, but fragile heart, that was so sweet and inviting. Your heart that wanted to listen and learn, ask questions and feel worth. You are worth *so* much C. You are my heart's song. I love you. Dammit I do. Thank you for your vulnerability. Thank you for your spiritual wisdom. Thank you for your mind. Thank you for your love. Thank you for your silence. Thank you for letting me go."

He convinced me to move in that summer, where he disrespected me at every turn because he saw my vulnerability. Sex was so painful for me, but that didnt stop him from crawling on top of me and say cmon relax Im almost finished while I cried and said no. He would do degrading acts on me and blame me because I couldnt have sex. Hed take off condoms without me knowing and said just get an abortion if you get pregnant. He kept a porn folder of his ex girlfriends he would get off to. He cheated on me multiple times. He was so controlling. I lost all sense of self between my medication and the manipulation. I broke up with him many times over 2 years, but would always come back. If I could just make it work, none of that would be real and it would go away. If I was with him happily, I wouldnt have to face it. It doesnt make sense, but I was scared to admit I allowed that to happen. Its 3 years since Ive last seen him and I hate him. Im with an incredible boyfriend now, but I feel ashamed of my past. For going back so many times, for not standing up for myself, for losing my friends, for isolating myself. Ive never told anyone before, but really need to get this off my chest. It took a new relationship for me to confront these awful things.

Im 38f. Married for 10 + years and recently was presented with undeniable evidence that my husband 38M has over the course of our taken withdrawals from my inheritance. For most this probably sounds like a black and white very clear choice violation ... and I would normally agree but we have young children and I tend to come from a place of understanding and working towards solutions then to blame or wallow. This act has since resulted in a cascade of truths which I had been denying and overlooking for far too long. I believe in mistakes, I have hope in new directions and working towards ones greatest version of who they are. I dont share a lot of personal turmoil because I feel that struggles are inherent in the growth of ones selves... and family and friends are quick to point fingers. the past few years, my family has been confrontational to me regarding the Actions of my husband. Ive always protected him. Recently... they, along with a few close friends conducted an intervention of sorts where I was presented with paper evidence of my husbands wrong doing taking distributions from a fund that I inherited and invested in my personal business. Up until this point, I excused my husbands irresponsible actions and believed that any funds taken must be justified for our living expenses or life mishaps which required additional financial draws. I trusted him. Funny thing is, when we dated he told me he could sell anything, convince anyone of anything to believe him. I thought this must be such a great quality for sales. Looking back on it, he sold me too. He lied about his interests and pretended to be interested in things that aligned with my interests. He showed vast amount of affection and consideration for my goals knowing this was my vulnerability and my soul seeking compass for what I craved to feel whole. But slowly this began to change once he had me. He was stressed or feeling low about work and the pressures to live up to the high success/lifestyle of what I grew up in. Small children, life demands, building of a business. Time suckers pulling him in too many directions. I sympathized, excusing his absence as a friend, a father, a partner, a contributor. I stood on the side lines cheering him up. Believing in him. Helping him with daily tasks and functions. Sacrificing my own because he was in need and thats what you do for someone you love. You look them in the eye and with an open heart tell them you believe in them. I can only speculate that what was to come was out of fear that Id realize he was a fake... , he criticized friends he thought would Disrupt the hold he had. His demand for full attention. I didnt want to aggravate his already hard situation so I complied. Slowly isolating myself from my friends because he needed me. And last the isolation from my family. I even opted to give up my career to move him closer to familiarity. So he could be the man I fell in love with. To save him. To save us. for us. I missed him. Where was that man I married? Where was that person I thought I chose so carefully for his caring nature so that my kids would always feel loved? He began to resent me. The pressure of who I was, my life I should have continued living as I was accustomed to as a child, at least this is his projected excuse. My ease at making friends. My attention to our children- thats a big one. He resented them for the time they took away from him. Id unknowingly make excuses and accommodations to avoid his verbal attacks or worse... if Id question him or his behavior... the animosity that my son would receive. Im all over the place, apologize because I cant use computers... or really any technology. He tracks my every move. Terrified hell lose me. Ill come to my senses. Ill find someone who values me and doesnt steal all my strength. So yes its pretty black and white and maybe thats the reason Im writing this. Telling all my friends. Because I can no longer pretend. I see the world my children are living in. I could paint rainbows in any dark cave but them... they deserve to feel what love is. I dont care about the money. I know for many that will sound insane but I dont. I never have. Although I am so grateful for the fortune I was born into but i Swore my kids would feel safe. Would feel love. I just have to remember this and believe Im enough For them Because Im stuck playing along until Im able to make a move. Id explain that more but Im so fearful hell find this somehow and end my chance for a new life. Its just lonely now that the magic curtain has fallen. Now I see that the man Ive been advocating for never was and my entire past ten years of doing everything in a dance around him, to help him come towards the light, actually harmed those I swore would never experience anything but love happiness and safety. And Im exhausted. And disappointed that Ive discovered how easily it is to lie to someone looking them right in the eyes to self preserve. there Are glimmers of hope that are replaced by coldness and passing bodies. Its disturbing how differently you see things once you remove hope. Im not as relieved and grateful from the Im sorry as I use to be... more suspicious of what tactic is being attempted to pace the swing of the cat toy within the claw. My eyes are open and I have a million dreams that are Keeping me awake. (Sorry love that song) I need to remind myself of this because what I am having to negotiate requires false perception of reality and Im fearful that my hopeful self will fall back into the reel of his control."

I had ghosted him, but he kept reaching out. Eventually, I became intrigued with his persistent behavior and unexpectedly started developing an attraction towards him.

It was all very new and weird to me, but it kept me on my toes a little. A couple months in, things took an interesting turn. My therapist and I started focusing more on empathy, vulnerability, all that jazz, and I felt like I kind of had to extend these traits to him for the sake of being a decent person. It was so damn uncomfortable for me, but I kept forcing it. I absolutely wanted to just ghost this guy out of my life, but looking back, I think the dynamics of why I returned to the relationship were getting in the way for whatever reason. I actually thought, Well hes been a fun one. A different one. I wont hurt this one, I suppose. So, I made the decision to become emotionally overbearing for him. I was curious what his limits were. If he was so interested in me, lets see where this lands before he gets revolted by me. I wont go into too many details, but Ill just say that it was kind of like an experiment for me. I really dont think Im a likable person when I turn my social filter off, so I was interested to see what his threshold would be as he got to know me a little more. It was a mix of babying him, talking to him like I cared a lot about him (almost to a smothering point), and also giving glimpses of the true me but acting like I was just being vulnerable with him. This went on for almost a year before he cut off all contact out of the blue. He updated his social media, so I think its safe to say hes alive and Ive been ghosted. And I was so relieved beyond words. I didnt want to hurt him by being outright cruel, but my overall fascination with him as an anomaly fueled me mentally. I just hoped that he would eventually become repulsed by me, and that would be the end of things. Dont get me wrong, Im very much aware whats socially acceptable and whats frowned upon. Its very easy for me to get along with people and function socially. Some people believe they are very close to me, but no one truly knows me. I also realize what Im capable of and sometimes have to actively suppress that side of me, because I dont want to cause harm to others. I emotionally couldnt care less, but cognitively and morally I have a clear picture of whats right and wrong. Feeling is just unnatural and uncomfortable for me. I dont suppress feelings- theyre just not there to begin with. TL; DR I was fascinated by this guy and couldnt get myself to call it quits, so I pushed him to do it."

I wont die tomorrow, but I wont see my son grow to become a man. I took the advice of some Redditors and wrote him a letter. I need to share it with someone other than my wife. My family is supportive but theyre also in denial. Im hoping to give this to him when hes old enough to understand it. ....................... Xxxxxxxxx, As I write this, you're a little older than 3 years - still a little kid. You've learned to speak your mind, learned to express your happiness and your displeasure, and begun to teach your old man what it is to love someone beyond the measure of his own being. I see in you all of my hopes and fears. My hope for you is that you'll learn the things I try to teach you, and my fear is you'll regret the things I couldn't. There are three lessons I hope I've imparted to you: Give more than you take Listen more than you talk Be present Give to everyone you encounter the benefit of your time and energy. Let them take from you what they need and supply to them all that you can. You will encounter those who will empty you out and leave you alone and vulnerable, but the bonds you form with those who cherish your gifts will more than counter those who don't. Be frugal with the time and energy gifted to you by others. Cherish those who share them, and be mindful of the vulnerability they grant to you. Trust is a currency difficult to earn and far too easy to spend. Listen to others far more than you force others to listen to you. Speak honestly with compassion and in good faith. Open up your heart to the truth of those around you, and never confuse vulnerability for weakness. As with those who would take your time and energy and return to you little of their own, there will be others who will see your vulnerability and believe you to be weaker for it. Ignore them. Listen to yourself, and be confident that you alone know the truth of your mind and your heart. Dont allow the takers of this world to convince you to shut out your emotions. Commit yourself to own the space you occupy. Be present in mind and in body. Confidence - like trust - is earned slowly and lost quickly. Confidence is the thing that allows you to be patient, honest, and vulnerable without losing yourself to those who belittle, decry, or injure. Being present means no one can occupy your space without your permission. It means being available to listen and to love. These things are those that will see you well throughout your life. They will serve you in school. They will serve you in business. They will serve you in your relationships. And most importantly, they will serve you in love. Whomever you find, wherever they live, and whoever they are, know that if you commit yourself, youll never find yourself loving one who wont love you back. And should you lose yourself for a brief moment and love another who uses you for kindness, confidence, and vulnerability, youll possess the strength to step away and find another who will share with you the vulnerability and love you share with them. I hope Ive had the chance to see the man youve become and be reminded that I once feared I would never be given the chance to share with you how proud I am to be your dad, and how proud I am of the person youve become. If I couldnt give you this letter, take solace in knowing that every day I see glimmers of the thoughtful, confident, and intelligent man inside you. I love you, buddy; Your Dad"

316,vulnerability,offmychest,Id very much like to stop living.,1,c94v70,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/c94v70/id_very_much_like_to_stop_living/,2019-07-05 02:56:32,"Hi. Throwaway account here, just wanted to vent. Im gonna write about some pretty dark stuff up ahead so if youre sensitive to posts about depression and suicide, please dont read this. Actually. Leave, now. Firstly I will write about the problems I have right now and then Ill write about the things in my life that are keeping me going. Im a fairly young college student and Ive had depression since I was a small child. I never quite fit in anywhere I went and neither did my family. I guess you could say we were quite different from other families. My parents raised me in an overly protective way and often taught me not to trust other people, something Im struggling deeply with at the moment. They still micromanage every single thing I do and pick out every flaw and mention it. When I tell them to stop or get mad at them, they convince me that Im overreacting and that theyre only doing the things they do because they love me. I believed this up until I left home for college and lived abroad with a sibling for a couple of years. I dont know how it started, or maybe I do. I noticed bit by bit that the kids in my elementary school didnt like me. I was the quiet and angry kid who made friends w other kids who werent cool. So, this was pretty much my life from elementary to high school. Slowly, however, I learned some social skills and became a little bit more like-able so people would actually talk to me rather than avoid me. I was still seen as the awkward, quiet and sometimes even weird kid. No matter what I do, what books I read to get better, what actions I take to improve myself, I dont feel like I will ever get there, whatever that thing is. Maybe I just wasnt meant to belong. Ever since I was a kid, Ive always been scared shitless of being alone. And when I do have company, I feel like an absolute burden to them. I havent had intimate relationships with anyone so far and anyone I show interest or affection towards, eventually moves on to someone more interesting and capable than me. Although I go to the gym to get fit, I feel like nothing has changed inside even though everyone says that it fixes you. Im incapable of receiving or giving love because every-time someone shows me love, I tense up and hide all vulnerability. I cant trust anyone because whenever Ive told someone I thought I could trust about what I go through on a daily basis, they slowly fade away from my life and never talk to me again. I cant afford a therapist and I wont take care of myself. I dont know why. I dont want to be the boring, weird, depressed loser, but I live this life every day knowing that I am one. No matter how much my family tells me they love me, I am unconvinced. I feel more alone than ever tonight. It feels fake. It all feels inauthentic. Ive lived all of my life from a position of inferiority and I dont believe that I can climb up to the top. I dont know what Im doing in the future. I have no certainty, no direction, no motivation. For these reasons, I have a deep urge to end my life. I often pray that I dont die by my own hands, but rather by accidents like a car running over me, I get sick and die, or I have a condition that kills me almost instantly. I will explain why in the next paragraph. Now, for the things that are keeping me going are my closest buddies and my family. Everytime I daydream and start imagining a million scenarios where I die, I come to the same conclusion: but mom will be sad. My friends were very understanding but I feel like Im more of a burden every day, and I believe our friendship will deteriorate fully eventually. My family doesnt know well how to deal with mental health issues because they dont really believe in that sort of stuff, nothing that a quick prayer cant fix, right? I recently came back home, and now I feel more depressed than ever. I actually enjoyed living abroad alone. Sometimes it physically hurts to think about all the dark shit that Ive thought up. I dont want to harm anyone else at all, but the person I want to harm the most is myself, evidently. I feel like I dont deserve a life when another person could do a much better job than I am right now. Dont get me wrong, Id love to live a better life and have a family of my own and have a purpose. However, I dont believe that I have the capability or courage to make it so. Its not that I want to die, i want to stop living the life Im currently living. It feels terrible inside knowing. How can I continue living knowing that literally the only thing that prevents me from laying in the tub and slitting my wrists is the absolute shitfest Ill leave behind? Even in the possibility of my death, Im still worried about how Im affecting others. Right now, I dont see a way out. Im sorry. Please dont be alarmed, Im not going to try anything. These are just the thoughts that Ive been having and tonight it was just amplified through mental tiredness and stress."
317,vulnerability,offmychest,What I would tell you about the end of our marriage if youd let me,1,c96cgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/c96cgt/what_i_would_tell_you_about_the_end_of_our/,2019-07-05 05:03:04,"Its been four months since our unofficial ending. You think were both being strategic, but really, its just you. Youve made it clear that your strategy is to avoid saying anything that I could use against you in a hypothetical setting with lawyers, so any statement or inquiry Ive made about our status has been met with silence or diversion. So here we are, operating in limbo. Not speaking beyond the occasional administrative-type text regarding household matters. Just like every fight over our years together, you are treating me like an enemy, like some combatant to outsmart. You dont know this yet, but I dont want anything from you. I dont want your money, I dont want your belongings, I dont want anything youve worked for. I dont want any of the things youve given me without my asking, which means I want *nothing*. According to the 5 languages, the material items you provided were how you showed love. And I guess thats the simple answer to why this was never going to work. If I could, I would pay you back the worth of everything youve provided, which I only accepted under the premise that we were investing in a lifetime together. With that repayment, like the drying up of ivy thats been allowed to grow wild, every trace of our relationship would be erased. There was never anything else. All I wanted from you, which I communicated over and over again, was a partnership, affection, vulnerability, and closeness, but money and material items hold more value for you. If you would talk to me about us, I would tell you to relax. I would tell you that I want to move on and finally let our friends and family know that were apart. But youre like a skittish animal who runs and hides at the slightest hint of engagement. If you would just talk, you would know that I want nothing but a plan to officially end this. What do you want?"

319,vulnerability,offmychest,"BPD, sudden repulsion syndrome",3,c9o75s,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/c9o75s/bpd_sudden_repulsion_syndrome/,2019-07-06 12:01:41,"For as long as I've had friends, I've struggled in finding the right approach to relationships. Since I was young, I have had a problem with ""hating"" people, at (seemingly) random, and for no logical reason. I have hurt many people because of it, and have had trouble figuring out what it even is. Only very recently have I found an actual name for something not quite, but similar to what I've felt- sudden repulsion syndrome. It usually goes something like: I really like someone! They make me so happy! I get really close with them and we're attached at the hip. I spend much of my time thinking about them and they soon become my favorite person/best friend/the most significant person in my life. Everything's Great. and then- I don't even know when this happens- I start to look down on them. I see them and get annoyed. Their face, their voice, their movements, *everything* about them begins to seem increasingly dumb, and annoying, and ridiculous, and no matter what they do, I want nothing more than to get away from them. It is **intense**. Eventually, they get the message, and- after messaging me asking what they did wrong, or getting upset because they don't deserve to be treated the way I'm treating them- they give up trying to figure it out, and leave me alone. *Good,* I think. But then, some months later, I look at them, and feel a weight lifted off my chest. The contempt and disgust that I felt whenever I so much as glanced in their direction (or vice versa), has, literally, evaporated. It feels like those scenes in movies when a character has been freed from brainwashing (see: Toothless after Stoick's death in How to Train Your Dragon 2). It feels like a cloud has been lifted from my eyes and my heart, and I feel affection for them once again. I feel a hint of guilt at my own acknowledgement of what I've put them through- hating them for no reason and not explaining myself; leaving them confused and hurt for what seems like an eternity before I suddenly ""feel better"". Up until 2017, I continued this pattern without ever truly and explicitly acknowledging my actions and the hurt that I caused so many friends. In 2017, I realized, ""oh, that's not right at all"", and ""what's wrong with me?"", and, most importantly, ""*why?*"". The hurt that I've put my friends through (off the top of my head I can count 8 friends who I've put through this) is cruel, and has no logic behind it. They have always been the same person, the same human being with gifts and flaws and quirks, like every other person has. It was not them who changed, but me. My ""hate thing"" doesn't happen because of an argument, or a quality that I truly deem unacceptable. It doesn't happen because they did anything to me, or because my values changed. There is absolutely, without a doubt, no reason whatsoever for this change in feeling towards people. I have hated this part of me since I realized it was me, and not them. I have been confused and overwhelmed by my completely unnecessary cruelty, and have struggled to answer questions about it. I think, however, that I've found a pattern. I normally put them on a pedestal. I view them as a person higher than me, and it feels like having a ""crush"". Only later on do I notice certain things about them that put me off, or make me frown in judgement. This sounds a lot like falling out of the ""honeymoon phase"", but seems to be pretty extreme. Another thing that I've noticed is that my hate thing seems to be triggered when the other person shows me that they are, actually, human. It's triggered when they are no longer on that pedestal, and show me vulnerability in them. I guess that makes me all the more cruel for taking that vulnerability and judging it, walking away from it. I still struggle with it. I don't know exactly how to deal with it, how to approach it when it happens, or how to avoid it altogether. I really don't know. It's hard. It's hard to see my friends hurting so damn much because of some weird switch in my brain that's flicked on and off whenever it pleases. It's freaking hard to be the cause of so much confusion and pain, and to *not know* ***how to fix it***. I want it to never happen again. But I'm afraid, because I don't know how to stop it either. I thought I would share this because there is not a lot of content about this on the internet. Or- I've never heard anyone experience anything even remotely similar to what I'm describing. Today while I was searching the web, I saw lots of ""my best friend hates me for no reason and I don't know what to do"" posts on sites like quora and yahoo answers. A lot of the answers said that ""they're not worth it if they hate you, forget about them"" and ""they're not your friend, then"" and ""maybe you did something to them that made them angry?"". I, of course, don't know what the answer really is. However, I want it to be known that in my case- you have done nothing wrong, you are still the amazing person that I know you to be. I'm aware of the effect that this can have on you, and you absolutely don't deserve it! You deserve someone who sees you for you, and you deserve to be treated right. I know this. I also want it to be known that I'm not heartless. I'm really not. I think there is a psychological pattern and reason for my behaviors and attitude towards those who are at the receiving end of my hate thing. I just don't really know what it is yet. And I want it to be known that I'm sorry. I'm sorry for anyone that has to feel that confusion and hurt, and I hope you know you deserve only the best, but also that you keep in mind- I'm confused, too. To anyone that's actually read this, thanks for taking the time to read! I hope that it might help some people who might be struggling with similar issues? and I hope that all of you know that you're great! and you deserve to know that you are awesome. (a note: I put BPD in the title because I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, so I thought that might be an important factor. I'm just not sure how, haha..)"

Late 30s woman who is also trans, though no one knows. I spent agonizing years in my mid 30s going through 7 operations and 2 revisions to change my appearance in a bid to stave off suicide and remain in this world ...hope. While Ive realized benefit of my youthful and above average looks, highly educated, and wealthy status... I walk continually in misery. With very supportive and loving parents, a spiteful and hateful religions right brother, a vengeful ex wife who knew long before marriage and was gone before I ever took steps like hrt or surgery... the loss of many friends and many outright reject me if they find out Im trans... Im plagued by endless loneliness, self loathing I learned as a child in a Baptist church.. churches I didnt stop subjecting myself to far right ideology till college... Im damaged, broken, I have one or two surface friends, betrayed by those who knew I went through a transition, claimed they supported me and promised never to reveal this deeply personal burden.. and yet do for personal gain. My vulnerability is known, I cannot control who knows, I lose the ability to make friends bc of talk, my accomplishments, status, kindness, highly empathic, and caring nature... all of it matters not. To the world I am trans. Something to despise, something to shun, condemn, judge, and ridicule. Ive know since I was 4, and have become a close observer of human nature to learn to protect myself. The more I live the more I realize how much I wish I didnt exist. I was taught at a young age being gay was abomination. If thats an abomination, I thought, then I must be evil incarnate. I didnt understand why I felt Christ accepted me and loved me if this were so. Even so, I felt I deserved all the bad that came to me. Punishments, loss of friends, outlasting by peers... I was a shy child... but to the world relatively unremarkable...and normal. Today, to the world, I am still normal but yet I am different and I hate it. I had two choices... die or live/change and see how it goes. Ive never been more comfortable in my own skin, things line up, physically I feel... normal to some extent, a very new feeling for me. Yet there is one unfaltering truth, I am a genetic male and for that I hate myself, it makes me feel less than human, dirty, diseased, worthless... As I continue to live, I wonder how long I can go on knowing Im, in my opinion, deformed. I dont know, I expect it wont be very long unless I can find a way to accept myself ...doubtful. I might be pretty and attract attention and have all this stuff going for me... but I know what I am and the world has taught me to feel ashamed of something I cant change. I wish I was normal, like most of you. I dont blame God, I blame... shit happens, and it happened to me. I am being tested for chimerism, essentially the question is ...do I possess two sets of DNA, male and female. New theories suggest trans people have two sets of DNA. I have a scientific mind, I need scientific evidence to help me understand why I am the way I am. I believed for years being gay was a choice. People think being trans is a choice. My experience tells me it just isnt. Its been a splinter in my mind, slowly driving me mad. Im happy with my appearance and I can move seamlessly through the world, no issues with documents or records... but Im scared, fearful, avoid relationships, and all I ever wanted was a loving family to care for and friends to encourage. I was lonely before, struggles before because all of this haunted me. After the change, things feel normal in day to day... but I still suffer from existential negative influences. Ive never been normal, I just learned to hide because my life depended on it. I still seem normal and Im not and I feel like I still have to hide, Im stuck in my own personal hell... I wouldnt change what I did, it was the right thing to do... and it kept me alive... but how much longer can I live in such a hateful world. I always knew Id die early... Im sure Ill receive some hateful comments... thats ok... Im not resentful, I have no hate in my heart, I wouldnt wish the pain of being trans on anyone. Ive left a lot out, but a glimpse of Hell is enough for most. Love others... or not... thats a real choice. All my best..."

Im like 70% (who comprise the majority) of others who weren't gifted an ego structure of any sort bc my folks were checked out...therefore I'm looking for love and belongingness needs fulfillment by leaning into social media trends to seem worthy enough to others, although they too are mindless, lost souls and Im just too dim and needy to recognize or resist it...hence obediently perpetuating a major identity crisis for myself which will have bone-crushing results for me when this trend fizzles out before long.

See there....smart! To boil it all down... More glitter = more attention needs = more vulnerability = more crushed or missing ego structure = over-compensation efforts = deficient parenting = anger/sadness/pain = tendency for tears, hence.... Tears and glitter. I may look good, but I'm verrrry basic and verrrrry confused. (Pretty easy math on that one.)"

I have to have health assessments for my benefit, they are completely dehumanising and demoralising but I understand the need, I just wish that there was a more gentle way of doing it without laying bare a vulnerable persons most intimate parts of their lives and conditions. After my last assessment I was found to have a capability to take part in work focused activities in order to try and help me get back to work. Its not that I dont want to get better, I honestly cant think of anything that I want more, the problem is Im just not there, I try my damn hardest every day, I fight tooth and nail to the point of mental and physical exhaustion but its just not enough that I can feasibly see myself safely working again for the foreseeable future (a fact my doctor agrees with) not to mention while being coached by the person thats supposed to tell me how to be well enough to work (NOT a doctor or medical professional) she told me well everyone has OCD and why dont I just chose not to be the way I am! Of course they also pay me less while they do this coaching too. I had to once again lay down all and write down every element of my life in a mortifying letter to explain why I am unable to live my life without my mother and partner physically caring for me so I continue to live. The chances of a result coming back favourably at this point is very slim and practically unheard of to get a decision overturned without having to go and tell three more people my most intimate moments of vulnerability at a tribunal in hopes they take notice.

My mother had narcissistic and borderline personality disorder tendencies, which resulted me into becoming an anxious, codependent, feminized, emotionally stunted wreck. Since I was 15 i slowly became aware of this, and worked as hard as i could to develop myself into being a sociable, emotionally stable man. A year ago i was prescribed adderall for my ADD-PI, which turned my social life into a near fantasy. However, when i come off of it, i regress back into a state of anxiety and self-doubt. My dating history hasn't been the greatest either. I have never been in a relationship, and have only hooked up with a girl once. In highschool, I used to be extremely bitter towards women since I felt that it was expected of me to repress my needs and to put them on a pedestal when it came to courting them. I'm a bit more lax about that now, but I still hold that same resentment. My meds thankfully allow me to see past this baggage and talk to women confidently like a normal person, but I refuse to go out of my way to pursue women in order to date them. I just don't see the point. I know I need help. I am at my sexual prime, and this baggage is wasting it all away. I don't want to rely on medications and drugs in order to feel comfortable around others. I want help, this mindset is toxic to me, but i'm not sure if spending $100 and commuting to a therapist that might not help much in the first place would be worth it. I appreciate any sort of advice, dialogue or anecdotes anyone has to offer."

My therapist and psychiatrist say it's worsening my already fragile mental health. Before I started smoking everyday for 7 years now, at 14 years old, i was bullied and excluded by my peers. I was too weird, too annoying, whatever else. I almost killed myself because of it. Several times. I started smoking weed and everything changed. Suddenly there were people who thought i was cool and chill and wanted to hangout with me. And i met some genuinely great people who i still love to this day. But every time I try to quit, it's like i'm that weird 13 year old again. I stop smoking and all I can hear is comments like ""Why do your eyes look so wide? Are you on drugs?"" ""You look crazy"" ""Why are you acting weird, you have so much energy, are you on drugs?"" What's really scary is, what if i lose my best friend? She likes to smoke and that's fine. But what if she doesn't like who i am when i'm sober? What if i'm too annoying and weird? I don't want to lose all the progress I've made. Smoking is my safety blanket. If i take it away, i might crumble. That's a type of vulnerability i don't know if i can handle. I'm scared"

And got with a new girl on tinder. But I also ended that one. I was single for a few months, self recovery to me. I actually enjoyed being single and the freedom it provides. But soon after, my good friend confessed to me, whom Ive been having a girl crush on. So we proceed with taking it slowly. Its probably only been a month of our relationship after I officially asked her to be my girlfriend. But I learnt a lot about myself. All these while, I only observe others and carefully analyse their behaviour be it destructive or productive. And Ive always appreciated my friends and family, always trying to see them beyond the surface and understanding their intentions with such behaviour. But my girlfriend, she made me realised a lot of things. She got me thinking how mistreated I was with my previous relationships. How much I restrained myself, or not allowing myself to feel vulnerability because of my family. How much I never confront my insecurities properly. How destructive I was for prioritising everyone else but me. She showed me how difficult it was for me to come clean with my feelings because I am so scared of being transparent where everyone can see how soft I am. Yes, I am the most gullible and softest person I have ever met. I get scared addressing my problems because I believe I can put up with so much. And I always feel whatever catastrophe it is, I deserve it because I suck at fixing things. And its okay to be hurt rather than to hurt others. And Im a rude person, not knowing how to tend to others lovingly. Because I wasnt raised where we vocally express what we want. I wasnt raised where I can have what I want so I settle down, for less. Cuz beggars dont get to choose. I wasnt raised where if Im emotionally hurt, I should say it. Instead, I should suppress it. Yes, I have abandonment issue. Yes, I have trust issue. I talk to myself a lot. And some days, Im overly desensitised. Im numb, are what my family said to me supposed to hurt me? I dont know. And there are things that Im traumatised about. I get mad at myself for being triggered by the simplest sentence being thrown in a jokingly manner I might have to reconsider t h i s life choice. But I get paranoid hearing those, I get anxious and slowly tears came out. Sometimes, I dont even cry, I just have a moment of withdrawal, an instant shutdown. But I dont like those. I dont want to do these to you. And I get even more mad that Im like this, its so trivial its a fucking a joke damn it. Get over yourself. So, dear love You allow me to behave however I want. You showed me things about myself. And we get to address my issue even better and I f e e l better. I wanted to say so many things about how you bring out the better versions of myself but all that ever come out is I love you. Or youre pretty. Maybe you think of it as you look damn good, well thats true. But to me, its you, your nature. Youre pretty inside out. And you should know that. I am thankful more than words could describe, for you and to you. Thank you, love. To many more days where I can gain pieces of myself back. And be the best version for you. I love you, 3000 "

I think I would have felt better if we literally went straight to hooking up because its the emotional side of it that makes me feel physically nauseas like Im actually going to vomit. I love sending nudes and talking dirty but the second I get an I love you or have to kiss I feel absolutely distraught. I just cant show any vulnerability because it makes me feel like scum just for showing a tiny bit of emotion. its a huge problem for me now because I often come across as cold hearted. I did have a traumatic event when my mother died when I was 7 so that could explain it somehow but otherwise I dont know how to overcome this.

I think if you really do love someone 100% there should be nothing left to hide. You have to be completely open and that feeling of vulnerability will have a sense of security. And lacking such a feeling is a form of loneliness in itself that slowly eats away at you.I guess one of the reasons why I can't open up is because once they truly know you, everything changes and things don't go back to the way it used to be. Be patronising, pitiful or restrain certain aspects of their natural behaviour towards you."

331,vulnerability,offmychest,Reasons Why We Suck,1,brwcgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/brwcgh/reasons_why_we_suck/,2019-05-23 10:15:12,"Reasons Why We Suck: &amp;#x200B; You don't ever text me directly unless our messaging app has crashed. And I've never heard your voice on the phone. As a person who has been texting since she was 13, you'd think I'd be the one to shy away from the vulnerability talking on the phone presents. But you're 12 years older than me. I wish I knew why it's such a non-starter for you. But I don't ask questions in this relationship, not anymore. &amp;#x200B; The night I asked you to be my wingman when a really handsy creep I knew came to our show and I was too scared to back out of getting drinks with him, you decided to go home. You didn't give me a reason, and I didn't ask for much. You distracted the ever-living hell out of me at crucial moments. High-stakes moments at work, moments when I was driving, moments I wish I'd been more present with my family and friends. Anxiety about what I was feeling for you, euphoria over seeing you again, agony over what it all meant. Yeah, I know love does that to us, if that's what this is; but I'm laying the blame on you nonetheless because I fell for you when I needed a crush like I needed a brick to my face. And after we met, you began writing to me like we'd never see each other again. And I didn't need you or want you until I realized the routine of you reaching out to me morning and night to ask me about myself, about life, about jokes, about you, was in itself building the need and the want. How did you know to do that? You didn't walk me back to my car when it was close to midnight in the city that night we saw R&amp;J. I know I said five times don't worry, I got it, but I was so terrified walking through that vacant mall in my little dress and heels and running through that parking garage underneath it by myself that I could hear my heartbeat drumming my ears. I was already stunned and angered by the stranger who knocked on your car window, waving a condom package, saying 'you'll need this' because he'd seen us kissing passionately in the front seat on a side-street. We were there because there was no where else for us to go so late, and without our peers seeing us. You can be so outright negative. And I've always been happy to boost you up with the positive things about you, about what you've accomplished, how wonderful you are. You thank me, but you don't return the support when I need it. And I think deep down, it's because you fear if you build me up too much, you'll inadvertently help me realize I deserve way better than this shit. I've poured out my concerns to you about us, when invited to do so, to receive sparse responses. I understand I know I'm sorry. I don't expect you to have an easy remedy. But I wish you'd level with me, beyond shrugging your shoulders, and changing the subject, and bringing up something about my body that you miss. The first time we made love was on the floor of your tiny office. The carpet and your thrusting were so rough, I wound up with rug burns all up and down my spine that made it hard to lean my back against anything, let alone down in my own bed, for weeks. The first day, I wore them like badges of honor. But it didn't take long for the shame to settle so deeply into my bones that my voice became hollow, my eyes dull, as I went back to buy a third box of mediated Band-Aids. To this very moment, I don't know if you have deep feelings for me, or if you just want my body. I feel like at this point, I'd have a more solid idea of how genuinely you care for me as a human. Am I an escape to you, a comfort, an inside joke? All I know is what I am not: any kind of priority. The last reason why you suck is why I suck, too, and why I'm a fool for thinking you could act in any other way than you do. Because we're five months into this infuriating, intoxicating, demeaning, exquisite, painful journey, and your wife still has no idea. So I've decided today's the end. Five months of madness, five months of drifting so far away from myself, and not a month more. I just pray I mean it this time."
332,vulnerability,offmychest,"In my eyes, it's sexual assault, when a girl kicks a boy in the balls, just to humiliate and hurt him as a boy.",1,bsk76h,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/bsk76h/in_my_eyes_its_sexual_assault_when_a_girl_kicks_a/,2019-05-25 04:10:29,"And it happened all the time when I was young. My sister did it, girls at my school did it, at karate training girls did it, and they thought it was fucking hilarious, when boys collapse, convulse, and cry their hearts out, and I still can't stop ruminating about it, especially with all the ""girlpower"" action in movies and shows, that portray this as something funny, or something that guys deserve, when they're being dicks. It doesn't just hurt a little. You feel that shit in your whole body. It's an all consuming pain. I read that the testicles are connected to the vagus nerve, which in turn is connected to most inner organs, which is why it hurts in your whole body and makes you convulse and want to shit your pants and vomit, and that the vagus nerve is supposedly one of the main seats of a person's emotions. It's also a boys ""manhood"", and the most vulnerable part of his body. Something he looks at and takes in his hand every day, and that in his mind, simply IS his manhood, and IS his vulnerability, above every other part of his body. There's a multilayered emotional relation a boy has to that part of himself, as opposed to his abdomen, his arm, or his kidneys. The pain alone is terrible. Having it done to you by a girl, especially your sister or ""friend"", and then be laughed at, is unbelievably hurtful and disappointing emotionally. And it IS sexual assault, noone can tell me otherwise. Just because it isn't about sexual gratification, doesn't change anything about that. They do it do hurt and humiliate boys AS SUCH, as a girl, by assaulting what MAKES them boys, and differentiates them from girls. It is SPECIFICALLY about gender, and about exploiting a boy's vulnerability as a boy, and his genitals. About dominating and humiliating the opposite sex. Of COURSE it's fucking sexual assault. &amp;#x200B; I seriously think it's as bad, as when a boy gropes a girl, and then hits her in the abdomen over and over, until she's in that kind of pain. And if it ends up in a testicle freaking popping (which CAN and DOES happen), and having to be removed, I imagine it must feel as violating and self-worth destroying (because that's what happens to you, if you feel like people can just do the most horrible stuff to you) as rape, and it sure as hell violently takes his ownership of his body, his genitals and his sexuality from him, and completely disregards him as a human, because it is the pinnacle of exploiting his vulnerability. Now this hasn't happened to me, but even as it is, I have extreme issues with trusting girls to this day. I can not bring myself to believe that they give a shit about guy's feelings, and I often feel resentment towards girls (I know this isn't fair or rational, but this is just how I feel). I can't even watch TV anymore, because I'm so fixated on this, and I see this EVERYWHERE. Being made light of, being portrayed as justified, as girlpower, and I get a freaking anxiety attack every time. When someone gets straight up shot in the balls, or a knife rammed into them in a movie, I feel like I'm leaving my body, I get extremely lightheaded, feel cold, like I'm falling or being hunted by a lion, my heart rate goes up, it feels like my lungs are not absorbing oxygen properly. Noone ever did anything about it at school. It just didn't matter, because it was just girls doing it to boys, so I guess it can't be that bad. And because it ""just"" happened like once every two days, I guess it was considered ""rare"". When a boy would hit BACK, because he couldn't bear it anymore and just wanted them to stop, HE would get in trouble, and not only punished, but have the contents of his heart, his soul questioned. Makes you feel fucking worthless, to be treated THIS unfairly, by the grown ups. Like you have nowhere to turn to, like everyone that is in a sense ""other"" than you (girls and grown ups), plus the system, the school, the environment you spend your day in, conspired to put you down, wants to hurt you, and doesn't care about you. Noone fucking cares. On the contrary, it's a staple of mainstream comedy. &amp;#x200B; Again, I want to stress that I'm fully aware that the girls at my old school aren't representative of the entire female gender, and that my issues with girls aren't fair towards them. But I can't change the way I feel. I feel like just because they don't do it anymore, because they can't get away with it at their age/have never done it, doesn't mean it's not within them. (again, which I concede, is not fair.) &amp;#x200B; If you look into my post history, you will see that I have developed an unhealthy fixation. Sorry for being creepy."
333,vulnerability,offmychest,"When a girl kicks a guy in the balls so hard, that one bursts into shreds, leaving him in reality-shattering pain and violent convulsions, it can be as traumatic and spirit-crushing to him as rape.",0,bu2imz,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/bu2imz/when_a_girl_kicks_a_guy_in_the_balls_so_hard_that/,2019-05-29 03:02:37," Grown men fall into depressions and can't feel manly, often kill themselves, when they lose a testicle to cancer. This scenario is not nearly as traumatic, as the one described in the title. A friend from a bad neighborhood told me, that a girl had kicked a boy in his class because she was pissed (I don't know why), and that because of his extremely agonized reaction, with an hour of convulsions, gagging, coughing, crying, etc, and because he behaved ""like his spirit was broken"" ever since that incident, he believes that this boy lost a testicle from this attack. He said even watching it happen traumatized him. Hell, even hearing the story gave me an anxiety attack. This is the most vulnerable, precious, private, holy part of a guy's body, and literally what makes him a man. Something that he looks at and touches every day and that, for him, is the incorporation of his vulnerability and manhood. The pain alone must have been traumatizing, let alone having that part exploited and destroyed by a member of the opposite sex. Seeing it turn black and blue and swell up the size of a grapefruit, having it removed - all of this sounds far more horrifying to me, than the thought of being anally raped by a huge, disgusting man with a huge cock, pardon my french. At the same time, I do not believe that the girl who did it, is ""as bad"" as a rapist. All I'm saying is, it must be at least as horrible as rape to that boy, if it can ""break his spirit"". It seems that the girl faces no repercussions at all, not from the school, and not legally, because the boy won't sue her. Probably to protect his ""secret"". As I said, even hearing that story fucked with my head, and I just want to know what others think about it."

Let me begin by saying that names have been changed. And this will be long. I've been a registered nurse for nearly 2 years now, I've met many people I don't think I'll ever forget. There was Avis who I met when I was a student in aged care who told the same joke over and over again because she forgot she had told it, she said I wouldn't remember her once I finished my placement, but I do. There was Raymond who started drinking after he retired from law enforcement - he had been drinking so much that he was now having absent seizures every 10 minutes, he was angry, aggressive, and belligerent to his shattered wife and children; once we stopped the seizures he was absolutely devastated at how he had treated his family, he was the nicest, softly spoken man I had met, but he didn't know how to stop drinking now. There was Daisy, in her 20s, Daisy had a rapidly growing ovarian mass that had to be removed immediately, but Daisy was born with a heart condition, her oxygen level was consistently lower than that of our end stage COPD patients, she had a 30-40% chance of death if she had this surgery. For Daisy there was a team of at least 2 senior doctors each from medical, surgical, ICU, cardiology, anaesthetics, gynaecology, oncology - it was more doctors than I had ever seen in one place, but despite being in a country with free healthcare, Daisy wasn't a citizen, her travel insurance wouldn't cover the necessary ICU admission she would need due to the pre-existing heart condition. She couldn't have the surgery. Today I met James and Laura. A couple, both 18, they came to Emergency; what they came in with doesn't matter, they had gotten into a bit of mischief and needed to be monitored for a few hours. Now James and Laura were each transitioning, James female to male, Laura male to female. At first I didn't think much about it, it wasn't relevant to why they were there; the ambulance officer told me they both had extensive mental health histories and I thought ""Well no sh*t, they're obviously dealing with some stuff"". Laura was extra anxious and needed to be coached through to slow her breathing, James was okay but very quiet. Soon I started thinking about myself as an 18 year old, the terrified, anxious, indecisive being that was me, the complete and utter lack of confidence I had and how hard I found that and then I thought, ""It must have taken a lot for these two to start this transition, that's a really big decision to make"". They were each others emergency contact. Did they have no family? How awful for these two terrified 18yo to make such a huge decision and to not have family surrounding them to support them, to help them through that already hard time of life! It's not like one day these two just woke up and chose to take hormones, this had been years in the making and yet they're still so young! I also realised that it must be even more difficult still to call an ambulance and come into hospital knowing that there will likely be multiple questions about their transition, questions from multiple strangers, the potential for comments, prejudice, the vulnerability they must feel at that point. ED makes everyone feel vulnerable, we make you put on a hospital gown, we're connecting cords your chest, asking about all your medical history and medications, we're there with a pen and paper to write down our assessments on you before sticking a needle in your arm. All the while you're in pain and nauseas. That's overwhelming for anyone, let alone an 18 year old who's halfway through the process of finding themselves. So today I realised the bravery, dedication, and courage that transitioning must take, it had never been something that I needed to think about before. James and Laura made my heart break for them because of how challenging it must be but I also discovered how much I admire anyone who can go through that and come out the other side. To anyone transitioning, you are so brave, it's absolutely amazing. I don't need to meet you to know that, you will always have my utmost respect and admiration."

Wearing myself thin by helping family constantly with outdoor chores and such, visiting rehab for family, being there emotionally for friends (even if that means heading to their houses at 1am because they're upset), working 10 hour days regularly, having a part-time job to save money and help pay bills... And on top of it, I'm going through a relationship that means the world to me and has fallen apart, been slowly and carefully put back together again, and now feels like it's slowly falling apart. I have good friends who I see/talk to regularly, but I'm at that phase in my life where I want to start building a life with someone. Maybe that's old fashioned in this day and age, but after being with someone for 2 years, I want to at least know that there is more in store for us. It's that great (yet selfishly awful) time of year where people who are younger than you, people who have been dating their significant other less time than you, and good friends of yours who are around your age are getting engaged or married. They're buying houses. Some are even starting families. I have a relationship that is far from perfect and has had its downs, and we're sitting in a limbo of what we want to do with our future together. But I know for a fact that this is the real deal and I'm absolutely in love with this person. But sometimes I don't know where they stand. They don't show emotions and vulnerability except for rare occasions. They don't show affection because they aren't comfortable with themselves and are insecure in many ways. Things that I just want to see. I'm young, I don't have any reason to feel like this, but I feel like I'll end up alone. I needed to vent the top part, but this isn't why I wrote this post. All in all, I wrote this because even though I just want to cry my eyes out and runaway from everything or just end my life, seeing some of this positivity really does help in a way. Some people are passing big tests for their careers and futures, some are just expressing their happiness. It really is a nice thing to see. It can kind of give me a glimpse of the happiness I used to have long ago. Still feel lonely as hell, but it's nice to see you guys, even strangers, go through some good things in life and share them. Thank you."

He, quote: ""has been behaving like he's broken ever since."" That story gave me an anxiety attack. If this assault took that boys' ownership of his body, his genitals, and his masculinity from him, if it not only violated, but destroyed the most vulnerable part of his body, which he has touched and looked at every day of his life since he was a child, and which for him IS his masculinity, if it put him in prolonged, extraordinary physical agony, humiliated him infront of his classmates, shattered his trust in the opposite sex AND his self worth, if it put a permanent mark on him, if he had to watch his weak spot swell up and turn black and blue, to be finally removed from him forever in a, yet again painful and humiliating procedure, and it crushed his spirit permanently, HOW is such an act any better than rape? If it BREAKS a person? Why is this not taken seriously? You can not make a guy feel more physically vulnerable, and exploit that vulnerability, than by destroying his testicles.. this must have been deeply emotionally violating and traumatizing. Just hearing this story scared the hell out of me. I guess I'm just sharing this to find some sort of affirmation, that doing something like this to a boy, is as terrible as it seems to me... If you disagree, please explain to me why a broken spirit is not as bad as a broken spirit, based on what caused it..."

This really only started bugging me as of this year - the idea sort of popped into my head like ""was that fucked up?"". TL;DR: Unlicensed 8th grade therapist (me) wonders if it fucked him up The worst part is I don't really remember that period of my life well enough to give specifics. I know we would talk about her self-harming often, and she would tell me she was harming herself while we were texting or on the phone. She would tell me about wanting to kill herself and I would try to talk her down. Lately I've been thinking this was a lot to deal with as a 13 or 14 year old. People would also tease me about her, as you would expect from eighth-graders. They didn't know what I did, obviously, but I was the guy dating the ""emo girl,"" and I caught some grief for it. It felt embarrassing, and I felt taken of advantage of to a degree. Even talking about it feels a bit embarrassing, like I'm making a bigger deal out of it than it really is. ""It was 8th grade, how could it have been that serious?"" and the like. Recently it's been bothering me that I've never been in any real relationship since then, if you could even call a couple of 13 year olds making out ""real."" I haven't even held hands with a girl since then. It was when that was bothering me that this whole thing bubbled up. I wonder if this incident left me with some sort of vulnerability problem that I was never aware of? The abstract idea of a relationship is something I definitely want, but when I try to picture something or someone specific it's uncomfortable and a bit frightening. I've always thought I just didn't have an interest in a relationship but I'm starting to wonder if that's not actually true and I've just been scared this whole time. While I'm at it, I've also realized I have a big crush on one of my closest female friends. The whole situation I described in the post has a nice bonus of me having no experience, which in and of itself makes me even more nervous, which makes me even more nervous about trying to do anything about the aforementioned crush. Hormones are fun Thanks for reading if you made it this far - sorry the post is composed so poorly I just kinda went stream-of-consciousness on it. Feels good to have said all of that, though I don't think it helped me make any better sense of it."

Its not because of a lack of opportonity or effort either.. call me crazy but I've only wanted to have sex with someone that i actually wanna be with? I just wanted to get someones opinion on the closest ive ever been to my perfect scenario i guess. Long story short my best friend and i had gotten alot of free drugs and we were taking them all weekend. There was soo much sexual tension built up over time to the point where we were in the shower together and she basically offered herself to me. Again call me crazy but i turned her down because at the time i loved her and even if it had gone positively i didnt want a relationship built on vulnerability due to drugs, despite the fact the emotions we're clearly already there. After that the frienship imploded because i was friendzoned and not mature enough to explain to her why i turned her down and my feeling toward her in general. Guys without my mentality have sex all the time and even have relationships all the time.. should i just give up my noble crusade and sling some d?

340,vulnerability,offmychest,I got tired of hating the person I am,2,bwhry8,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/bwhry8/i_got_tired_of_hating_the_person_i_am/,2019-06-04 09:42:58,"Sorry in advance for the long, cheesy post. I needed to say this somewhere safe. I have struggled with depression for the majority of my life. Ive struggled to convince myself that I am worthy of the air I breathe and the resources I take up with my existence. I have fought endlessly with myself to stop the torrent of thoughts that tell me that this would be a better world without me and that my children will live a better life without me in it. This revelation hasn't come easy, and hasn't came without an abundance of pain...but, Vulnerability is my super power. Not much can be said to change my mind on the subject. It's been put on my heart lately and I can't go without expressing how beautiful being vulnerable can really be. It's easy to wear a mask. Its easier to suit up in armor and hide from the things that make us uncomfortable or feel when it's easier to be impermeable. But the thing is, no matter how impermeable we seem, we are very much like the dimpled peel of an orange. The tiny dimples soaking in all that is around us. Smiling through insults and picking ourselves up an infinite amount of times through out our lives when we get shoved down relentlessly and we become battered and bruised. I'm weary today...well I guess not today only but just lately. I'm tired, and I'm really feeling the strain of trying to be a good mother and a good wife and a good machinist and a good friend. And all of these things are just labels, but all of them are labels that make up myself. I recently listened to a book that said if you had to say who you are, what would you say? And without much thought, I could easily say... My name is *** I'm a wife to *** and mother to *** and ***. I'm a student and a machinist and an employee. I'm a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a niece, a cousin and a friend. And all of these do DESCRIBE me, but they don't say WHO I am. And it's really thought provoking in a million different ways, because really? Who am I without my labels and my duties. And trying to skirt away from the labels, I am a spiritual being on a physical plane. I am an expression of the universe and I am here to do a job. I am here to love and practice acceptance and appreciation for all the many expressions of the universe (all of you! = ) ) And boy, do I try. I am a being who loves a multitude of people in a multitude of different ways. I see the good and the admirable in everyone I meet. Even the ones I don't really like, I can love and appreciate their presence and accept their role. I am an observer of the beauty that is bountiful around us and I happily and freely share my heart. Not because it isn't terrifying, but because I was meant for that job. I was made to love. And truthfully I have spent many years of my formative life asking the questions; who am I am and what is my purpose? I thought I would experience no peace on this earth without a thesis sized answer to those inquiries with a to-do list to manifest those answers. Turns out the answer to my question was really minimal. I'm me and I'm here to love. I'm me, with all my insecurities and I'm me with all my love. I proudly show my insecurities to the best of my ability because those are just as special as the good things about myself. And I am special. I questioned that a long time too. I questioned the thought that if I am unique, everyone else is unique so it's not special. I am a tiny spec of dust on an infinite timeline, what difference could I really make? But I'll be damned if that is the case. It is our differences and our diversity as humanity that is so magical and beautiful and the interesting thing is that the Pakistani woman, who loves watching her babies play in the grass with bits of sunshine peeking through the leaves, and myself have a lot in common and she's still beautiful and unique. And the old many pushing a cart full of cans and I both enjoy some soul searching music and it's beautiful and special. And the little girl across the street and I love to look at the world with awestruck eyes and we have that in common and it is wonderful. On the outside we may have nothing but on the inside we all have these similarities and because someone likes provolone and I like cheddar or someone likes a woman instead of a man in their bed, we are not so different. Not really. And thankfully I was blessed in this life with the natural ability to see that fact. It is said that we all have spiritual gifts that are meant to help us in our time here...ideally mine would be teleportation lol but it turns out that it serves the planet much better that I be blessed with unconditional love and my proclivity towards vulnerability. Vulnerable enough to see the roots of my imperfections with the worms and the rot and the flowers that have bloomed anyway. To appreciate where I have been and to happily anticipate where I am going. I am not afraid to be me anymore and it took what feel a like a million years to be okay with the worms in my roots and see the beauty in my flower crown. I feel special today because I love everyone's roots and I appreciate their flowers too. Because I love my roots and I'm not afraid when my blooms whither and fall to the ground I am teaching others to feel the same. I am humble in the sense that I don't mind to cry over beauty and I don't mind to spill happy tears or share in the bitterness of a defeat in my fellow flowers. This is such a hard, hard life we live. My flowers have withered lately but I'm enjoying it just the same. Thank you for this gift and for the ability to see it. Many tears were spilled in the harnessing of this it and many more will be too. But I'm digging this life. I'm enjoying my small moments of peace and I am using them to foster the hope for many more moments. I'm trying hard to learn to accept my small victories and celebrate the place I am Now. Because despite the chaos, it is a beauitful place and we are a beautiful race. And I suspect I have many years of searching for the beauty yet to be seen. I'm sorry for the small novel and if you've stuck with me this far, I really appreciate you!"
341,vulnerability,offmychest,I have tried for far too long to deal with this on my own.,4,bwnhq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/bwnhq4/i_have_tried_for_far_too_long_to_deal_with_this/,2019-06-04 21:13:51,"Im in my 30s. I hold a management position at a busy hotel/restaurant. I have worked there for ten years. I am also, a high functioning autistic. But thats always been MY business. There are a handful of people I work with who know. Because, either i trust them enough and its come up in conversation, or, under close scrutiny, they can see it, and mentioned it. (one or two, once they found out, told me that theres things about me that made SO much more sense once they knew) But i have spent the last 15 years, my whole working life, practicing ways to hide it. Because its MY business. I can communicate well enough. I understand sarcasm, humour etc. I have difficulty in trying to determine sincerity, though. And over my life this has led to trust issues. But again, most people dont know. Its my business. I have tremendous difficulty in correct, or appropriate, social responses. If i find something funny, i might not laugh right away, because im quickly trying to guage how much i should. I often interact either not enough, or, far too much. And i never see which it is at the time, only in retrospect. Similarly, my emotional responses tend to be an all or nothing reaction. And most of the time, i honestly try not to respond to emotional stimuli, because i know if i do, ill likely spiral out of control. Be it positive or negative. Do you know how hard it is, to train yourself not to respond to something that makes you happy? The real truth is, i hate the place I work. I despise every minute i spend there. And i always have. The reason ive been there for so long is, because despite this, i am VERY good at what i do. And i dont know what other job i can do. The people, the noise, the shouting and laughter and crowds. All of this puts me on edge. And thats putting it lightly. But ive held up this illusion of taking it in my stride for so long that, nobody, even the people who know about me, ever considers just how difficult i find it. How exhausting it is for me to sustain these hundreds of interactions a day. I tell new staff ""dont let the place grind you down"" and they look at me, with bewilderment. And i have to remind myself that not everyone has as much trouble as i do. And i cant actually point out to my colleagues, old or new, that i have this problem. Because, and this is my own fault, i have projected this invincible image for so long, that nobody would believe it. Hell, people have come to rely on me being an unstoppable force. The only real clue most of them have about my... Peculiarities... Is the general rule that everyone learns, and that is that people dont touch me. If i invite it, its fine. A handshake etc. But everyone knows not to grab my arm to get my attention, and its also generally accepted that i dont hug. (they dont know the full extent, i can barely hug my own mother). There are two people at my workplace, and only two, that i can comfortably hug. One is, well, its complicated, and i broke my own rules on mixing in with work, but, i adore her. But me being the damaged communicator that i am, i came on too strong, and scared her, (even though i KNOW indo this, and tried my best not to) but thats not what this post is about... The other is the one other person thats been there as long as i have. Shes my confidant, and i trust her entirely. Many have surmised that i let her hug me because shes a pretty woman. (and she is), but thats not it at all. For years i have held up this illusion. My ex fiance had no idea of the severity. And we were together for 4 years, 2 months and 2 days. But, the last 6 months. The last 6 months have been very trying for me. Issues in my life, mostly beyond my control, have taken their toll. Plus, I am having to do more and more at work, with less resources. (the kitchen manager told me o need to ""delegate some of that shit"". But i dont have anyone to delegate most of it TO.) Not to mention the ongoing strain of my ill fated workplace romance, because of course, we work together. And thats my fault. I have held up this illusion by myself for years. If my colleagues could see me when im at home, they would be horrified, im certain. And ive done it without help. But i cant anymore. Im trying, im really trying, but all my walls are eroding. And im coming close to having meltdowns at work, and i cannot let that happen. I CANNOT show vulnerability at work. So, in 3 hours i have a doctors appointment. Im buckling and i need pharmaceutical help. A sedative, or anti anxiety drug. Something to help me relax, and stay out of my own head. Ive gone this long without resorting to that kind of thing, but, i cant let it affect my work. My work as much as i do hate it, is all ive got. And im good at it. And i can take pride in it. And i cannot risk it. Some of this might seem hard to understand. Some of it might read as contradictory. Hell, some of it probably reads like im a moody 16 year old. But, that is the chaos that i live with, day by day. And im so weary of being strong on my own. Theres a chance that, out there someone is reading this, and they understand the chaos. Because it cant just be me."

Ive been hurt in the past by friends who do this, and Im usually okay with not being friends with them anymore. But this situation is different because shes still friends with all my other friends. But heres why I dont want to be friends with her. A couple of weeks ago I had lashed out at her because she kept messing around with me and I wasnt in the mood. I had apologized but she didnt accept that and kept antagonizing me. This isnt the first time shes done this in the course of our friendship, this is like the fourth time. So shes talking about me to my other friends and whispering about me when she thinks I cant hear her, but I can. The thing is, I dont want to engage with her anymore. I dont want to talk to her or be around her anymore because its really hurting me. She keeps hurting me. I admit that I shouldnt have lashed out at her and I apologized for that. But I dont think I deserve to keep being treated like the antagonist and have her try to convince my friends that Im the bad guy, that I am just a terrible person. All my friends have started treating me differently because of this, like theyre walking on egg shells and Im just tired of it."

I am by no means defending the behaviour. Please read with an open mind. I hear a lot of the same comments towards people who have cheated. ""once a cheater, always a cheater"" ""you can't cheat on someone you love"" ""cheating is disgusting and shelfish,"" And my favourite ""it's the a ultimate betrayal"". This will be an unpopular opinion and I am willing to sacrifice this account with down votes, but I have to disagree with some of these statements. The thing is cheating is not a linear circumstance, which linear reasons and linear consequences, therefore our attitude towards cheaters and the advice we give shouldn't be linear. It's extreamly complicated and people have various reasons. Now there is the scumbag in my own opinion. The person who is selfish, follows lust, likes attention and doesn't honour or respect their partners, these tend to be people who constantly cheat, have multiple affairs and chose to do it everyday, and have affairs for years. Then there's another category. People who don't look to cheat, never imagine themselves cheating, yet find themselves in bed with someone due to lonlinessx heartbreak, emotional betrayal from their spouse or abuse at home. I feel like this group of people should not be shunned with the same judgement as the former group. Often this group may make a mistake out of their vuknerability, but will do the right thing and end the marriage once they muster up the bravery to do so. Although the behaviour still isn't healthy and we're not condoning it. We should at least have some understanding and empathy toward this group. When emotions are high, logic is low. That mixed with alcohol usually and a desperation to escape, people can be in denial of their situation at home and their brain is just wanting a release for its own sanity. These people will go through incredible pain and loss from their actions and will lost likely not do it again. They just found themselves in a bad situation as a result of their vulnerability. Lastly, the world see cheating as an intentional act against the partner. When it comes to the 2nd group, I personally disagree. I think choosing to abuse or neglect your partner is worse. When cheating is outside of the relationship and is the person trying to escape with another. We are all capable of cheating if we're hurt enough. Let's not forget that. Next time you come across someone who had cheated, don't be so close minded."

CONTENT WARNING for sexual/other abuse, child grooming, fucked up events, death, etc etc. it hurts to write this and it would hurt even more if someone read this and got hurt. if you read this and somehow identify me, stop reading. if you read this and somehow identify me, and STILL keep reading, you need to be prepared to deal with the consequences of knowing this. don't say shit to anyone! and i don't want to know if you know! that's all i have to say about that lolol. this is an insane chain of events and i'm not proud of it, or myself. in the past year (or two) i've done a lot of spiritual and emotional growth, as well as some psychological healing. but the weight of my life is so much to bear, and my family (and most people i know for that matter) have no clue. clearly i still blame myself (for the things i've willingly done - whether or not they were trauma induced) end disclaimer \-- so... here goes. i'm in my 20s now and i'm severely fucked up. when i was a child - somewhere between the ages of 3 and 8 (bad memory of course), i was sexually abused by my grandmother's husband (not my grandfather by blood but i was raised by him partially).he was grooming me, and was constantly saying that we were ""the same"" in intellect and in how we operated. i truly think he believed that... the way i see it now, something must have happened to him to forever keep him in a child-like state. my grandmother did EVERYTHING for him and babied him. it's exactly what he wanted. i somewhat convinced myself it didn't happen. so much so, that i had ""no idea"" why i felt so uncomfortable around him, why i felt sick at their house all the time, why everything was so complicated. i first told someone i met online when i was 14 - i have no recollection of that. i only know because they referenced the time i told them, and i definitely trust that. due to a different falling out in my family, i wasn't really forced to see them anymore or go there. i lived with him briefly as a child, and i have many positive memories. but in my heart, i knew what happened the entire time - i just wanted to tough it out for my family. we'll come back to that. so... when i was around 11-13 years old, i was groomed by a man 13 years older than me on the internet - a children's website. i told him what happened to me, i know THAT for a fact, because he took my vulnerability and ran with it. i wouldn't be surprised if he still has CP of me on his computer. i wanna barf thinking about it or thinking about anyone who knows me + my typing quirks reading this in my voice. but at this point i have nothing to lose. i was a child, and i was taken advantage of. but the guilt eats me alive. my family never knew about this, in fact he friended my mom on facebook and tried to win her over by pretending to be 1. younger 2. my ""friend"" - he was fucking GROOMING ME !!!!! (count how many times i say that lol) he convinced me that we were in love, would get married when i turned 18, blah blah whatever. he was sociopathic and killed animals for fun as well. he romanticized it. i thought of him yesterday while trying to do shadow work (jungian psychology) on myself, and decided to google his name, which i still remember perfectly. nothing much came up, just his address and voter registration. he had NEVER gotten in trouble for anything. this absolutely infuriated me, i almost wanted him to be dead. and i see myself as a pacifist. \-- when i was 14, i started high school. i started off with a bang! getting in trouble all the time, drinking, doing drugs, having a lot of reckless sex. at 14 years old.. i know that's not unheard of, but i LOOKED like a baby. i was a child. it makes me shudder. i started dating a senior in my high school when i was in freshman year - a decent age gap considering we were still dating when he was in college + i was in high school, but it felt like a really positive and meaningful relationship for me. i sabotaged it, and cheated on him multiple times with multiple people. one of these people was someone we'll call V. V was 21 when i was 15 - looking back, this is.... really really problematic. we had a romantic and sexual relationship, but never had a ""real"" relationship. it was chaotic and messy - when i wanted to get out of my mom's house, i would call him, and he would pick me up. we would drink, cry, write songs, tell stories, and tbh get into a lot of almost-trouble. it felt very romantic to my dumb ass at the time. and you know what? i still love V, despite knowing that it was messed up. he died in spring 2017 after i had only seen him once after a two year span. i moved away in a hurry, 1500 miles away, and didn't even say goodbye because i was sick of feeling like he only called me when he wanted something from me. while i was away, we ended up keeping in touch. it was so complicated, and he struggled with alcoholism and drug issues, which he sort of passed on to me. i kept it ENTIRELY a secret from my family, i have always been an extremely shameful and secretive person. hence why my preface to this entire post was so fucking weird. but he had beautiful and wonderful qualities too, and i didn't feel pressured by him - i made my own decisions, which were based in trauma, and he had no idea wtf he was doing either. i don't say this to condone anyone's actions, but it felt a lot more innocent than it sounds. when he died, everything came crashing down. but... not immediately. i was in denial for 6 whole months, until someone else i knew died, and my best friend (who was extremely close to said person) was dealing with grief. being understood and openly talking about it unlocked this horrible horrible shit that i was experiencing but not letting myself feel. and so my realization begins- i've been dissociating for my entire. ENTIRE. life. everything that happened led up to this point - my abuser, the negligence of my parents (or at least them not understanding the signs), all my fucked up tendencies, V's death, the place he held, and the symbolism of it all. now let's take it back a little bit \-- last year (summer 2018) someone in my family hypothesized that my grandmother's husband abused me. i reacted very strangely, but i didn't say yes or no. they took that as a yes obviously. long story short, they had an intervention with my grandmother and she took his side - not understanding how someone she's been with for 30+ years could do such a thing. she blamed the #MeToo movement, and drew all these conclusions where there were none. just trying so desperately not to believe it. then, not long after, she died of lung cancer that she had kept a secret from us BECAUSE of this intervention. when i visited her at the hospital, i had to time it around her husband. she could hardly speak by the time i finally got to her. i relieved my dad from watching over her, and i decided to stay that night, knowing that she would die. and she did. we had no idea about this until right before it happened, all because of this intervention about ME that i didn't ask for. they did it when i didn't want them to. i felt extremely pressured to go along with them doing this. and now my grandmother is dead. it still makes me pretty fucking angry. \-- there's a lot i'm glossing over -- i almost had a heart attack from an eating disorder last year. i've been struggling in such a profound way. but for once in my life, i have people i can trust and rely on in my life. my partners (i'm poly - one of my partners is inherently more able to be there for me tho and he has been AMAZING) and best friend have been pulling me through this when i don't think i can go on anymore. i'm exhausted though.. i'm working again for the first time in 2 years and i don't know how to function. i didn't sleep last night because i was thinking so hard. this experience has given me a sort of clarity about things that i appreciate, though. i've become a very spiritually-inclined person, and it's done wonders. V's death traumatized me in a very specific way.. he was young, and i watched him die in front of my eyes. it's burned into my memory. some days... some weeks.. i feel like i could die and not care. i'm tired all the time. i'm constantly analyzing things, and reflecting. especially now that thru therapy and experience (and taking mushrooms lol), i've ""unlocked"" so many memories that i thought were otherwise gone. it's fucking terrifying. there was a triggering event a couple days ago, and long story short, i ended up getting drunk and having sex with V's brother. it's a complicated relationship but i ended up violating my own boundaries, and my partner, who doesn't fucking trust him whatsoever (for good reason). AND simultaneously fucking up what i was trying to work towards - being able to say no, knowing my boundaries, etc. i thought i was past this shit. and i'm not yet. but i'm extremely aware of it, almost too aware of it. and i'm trying so, so, so hard. painfully hard. to do better: for myself, for others, for the world, for the collective. when V died, and my best friend's person died, i spiraled into all my PTSD (i hypothesize it's C-PTSD lol.. i connect with what i've read about it a lot) and i had depersonalization/derealization disorder. so did my best friend. we were literally dissociating together, and now we're healing together. i felt like i disrespected my own healing. laying it out like this is hard. i'm scared that i'm making more problems for myself by doing this. this isn't even the full story of course but.... idk it felt good to do. thank you if you made it to the end, and i want to let you know i'm starting to do better for myself &lt;3 this was a lapse in judgement after a long period of me doing much much better. i'm proud of my progress. i'm working, i'm functioning, i'm eating, i'm (usually) sleeping, i'm doing creative work that makes me happy. i just want to get past this and get to the truly good part already. it's coming, and i can see it on the horizon, but i'm sick of thinking. i haven't looked back to edit any of this because i know there's a million things i'll overthink or want to change, so i'm just going to click post bc fuck it. my life is specific enough to know, and i'm aware some people in my family lurk on reddit. i'm not here to ""protect people"" from my truth anymore. i'm beyond caring. i'm surprised i'm still here today and i'm glad i am. i'm proud, but ashamed. thank u again for reading if u did."
345,vulnerability,offmychest,I share less and less on Reddit because I don't trust the community as a whole,1,bc3jg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/bc3jg6/i_share_less_and_less_on_reddit_because_i_dont/,2019-04-12 04:45:13,"Reddit is a place where any pissed off moron can create a throwaway account just to troll people and break all the community rules. Then they can create another one. And another. And another. And another. Anonymity with no barrier to entry is a double edged sword. On one side you get increased vulnerability and openness. On the other you get people expressing the worst parts of themselves without consequence. The community rules really only apply to the people who stick around and create a name and reputation for themselves. This only helps the communities as a whole for people who stick with it for a long time, as then they can trust the people with good post histories and ignore the others. For anyone entering a new community or a big community, they do not get a warm welcome. The jerks, pretenders, and throwaways are as numerous or more numerous than the helpful people. For the communities that try to combat this, there becomes a million rules that make participation really annoying. On multiple occasions, genuine posts that objectively follow the rules have been removed simply because the mods don't like them. As a result, I want to use Reddit and the communities here less and less. It only makes sense if I'm willing to put up with throwaway jerks, random comments, people who don't read the post, people who pretend to know what they are talking about but don't, etc. There are of course helpful comments as well, but they are often drowned out by so much noise. It's just disappointing, that's all. The anonymity of the internet and especially Reddit is neither good nor bad, it just adds another option to the arsenal that has both good qualities and bad qualities. I definitely hoped for something better in the Reddit world than what I've seen, and I was disappointed. Ok, that's off my chest. Thanks."

Accurately, 0. I know people, but people don't know me. And those people I barely talk to anymore. Yes yes, r/im14andthisisdeep lmao But, it's been this way ever since I was 10. Before that, I always had friends - not a lot, but I knew I could call them friends. I lost one of my first best friends due to bad influence in her new school. She and her new friend bullied my friend's friend. I don't know how the hell I got involved, but the bullying got really bad and I just couldn't be her friend anymore. However at the end of the year I decided to apologise to all the people I had problems with even if I felt I was right, because I wanted to start the new year without any foes. My apologises were LONG. Every person got a long text, they were heartfelt and obviously different from one another. They all accepted it, except for that friend that I mentioned above. She just mocked my apology, and I mean since she doesn't want it, I'm not gonna force it. So whatever. The last phone call I got from her was a 'prank' call. Talking to her gives me the same aggravation when I'm on r/choosingbeggars jfc After which, I lost my next two friend groups. First one left me because I wasn't cool or pretty like them lol. It's funny because they left me for another group that did not like them. I was pretty much the middleman, the other group wanted me to be in their group but I didn't wanna betray my own friend group. But after my friend group ditched me (to make it worse, my best friend in that group at that time ditched me) for them. I KNOW ITS SO CHILDISH LMAO I honestly don't care anymore i was 14 and they were 14 god The second group was really weird too. We were 15. Three of us. One of them didn't like the other one, and constantly cling onto me to exclude her, and I felt bad so I tried to include her, which pissed her off and so she went to get close to her. I got pissed off and we broke off. Like yo, I really wanna think it's my fault I don't have friends. MY WHOLE LIFE, people keep walking out of my life. SURELY it has to be my fault???? I always look back and analyse everything, try to be in their shoes etc. but I just don't see what the fuck I did wrong. I always try to please people and make them happy but people always seem to either take it for granted, couldn't care less or misunderstand my intentions. I just think I have the worst luck in making friends (honestly worst luck in everything). I really wonder what I'm good at and why I exist. I have so much fucking shit to get off my chest, but I'll just talk about friends in this one. If you're still reading, let's talk about the most recent one shall we? So I went on Instagram and I realised a few people unfollowed me, checked who and realised it was one of my friends and her gf. I asked her why she unfollowed me, and she was ""dumbfounded"" when I asked her. She asked me who is the ""you all""... then she proceeded to explain she unfollowed me because she was unhappy that I was following this dude who had a feud with her 4 years ago. She also said that her two best friends were not following him so it's shocking to her that I am, fyi I'm not her best friend. C'mon, I don't really care about my following or followers, I follow people I don't really like too. To me it's not a big deal. But I get it, I hurt her feelings and I wanted to make it up for it. I told her I was sorry, and that if unfollowing him would make things better I would and she said ""yeah a bit"". I'm just tired. She doesn't even fucking care. I'm tired of making an effort. Yo, I really didn't know this hurt you, so I apologised and am willing to change. If you really cared about our friendship, you wouldn't unfollow me and instead clarify with me first?? Also can I just add on like months ago she made a huge indirect rant about me on her story because I didn't vote on her polls... I'm sorry I really don't know how to answer them, but when I do I always vote? I'm tired of being compared. I'm tired with dealing with people. Bro I'm 18 can I just have a friend that I can love and cherish for the rest of my fucking life instead of having to deal with whatever the fuck I always deal with I'm just asking life to send that one friend that will see the good in me, I want to be good. Why the fuck is it so hard. I just want someone to love and cherish me back. All I want in life is love and happiness. It's my vulnerability because I don't have it. Never had them. God I'm so weak for them. I want to be able to point and someone and say that I trust them with my soul, that I love them and that I know they'd do the same. Sorry if there's any errors because I'm not gonna read what I typed and also I'm on mobile"

My entire life I feel like Ive fought uphill. I lost my dad when I was young. We were in a bad wreck and he didnt make it out. After the wreck, all of his friends told me I was the man of the house and I couldnt let my sibling or my mother see me cry. It took me a full year to let myself cry after dad died. I know he didnt leave or abandon me, but it feels like he did. It feels like I had a mountain or weight placed on my shoulders after that and still to this day. I went from a child to a man overnight. I was the rock that mom and my sibling leaned on. I took all of their pain and problems and placed it on myself. I (wrongfully) thought that I cant show pain or weakness or vulnerability to anyone because thats what men I respected told me after dad passed. I found happiness with a girl. Genuine happiness. We dated off and on for years. I moved off to college and we started talking again when I was home on break. She was with someone else but said if I transferred home shed leave him and wed be together. LIKE AN IDIOT I believed her and left a school I loved out of state to come back and be closer to home. Literally the day I started classes she blocked me from everything and ignored my calls. Didnt hear from her for a year when she called telling me not to show up at her wedding and wreck it. Ive got so much emotional baggage and deep rooted trust issues that I cannot commit myself to dating trusting anyone. It feels like Im fighting battles at every turn. I trust no one, I look for the worst case scenario in everything I do, I fear that if I let someone in theyll destroy me emotionally again. I have wonderful friends but I cant vent this to them. Ive turned into the person everyone brings their issues to, but Ive got a mental block set up that prevents me from letting anyone see me hurt. I have good things going for me. Ive got a respectable job, Ive got a home, places to go and relax, and a group of people I know love and care for me. I just cant escape this emptiness I feel inside. This feeling that Im alone, or Im not good enough and thats why I lost the girl, or Ill never live up to my dads shadow. Im on meds to help me cope, but I needed to write this down. Thank you."

Its also about the relationships you form and the people you can celebrate those achievements with. And I dont want people to like me for what I can do. I want people who care about who I am. I have enough self-respect to put distance between myself and those who show they dont care or are just bad friends, but damn it really hurts and gets lonely. Im very independent, used to doing everything alone during the day, but it would be nice to have consistent people in my life and rn I dont have much of that. This was the busiest year of my life so far. It's been a year marked by academic and professional success and opportunities that I couldn't dream of for myself, but my personal life, not so much. I had to distance myself from someone I considered my best friend, had a bad dating experience that hurt me for months after, but got past it and just hoping to meet someone special. I have older siblings, but they are terrible people (not even going to get into that), but I can't go to them for advice or even have a relationship with them and that really sucks. There are times im super busy and cant meet up so I understand when that happens to others, but it feels like people are indifferent about me. I am tired of feeling like an afterthought, or the low maintenance friend you can text once in a blue moon, make plans, cancel, reschedule and then never follow up on. Im very understanding, but after so many times it gets to be too much. I am tired of feeling like theres something wrong with me that no one consistently wants me in their life. I know I have a lot to offer. Im smart, kind, compassionate, apparently attractive. I should be happy. I mean im graduating uni and going to law school. But I think its all starting to take a hit on my self esteem. Just once, I want someone to want me. I want to find love and I want good friendships. I know itll pass and there are some people in my life who care, but today it just hurts a little extra. Idk why im so emotional, maybe its because I have so many things going on (theyre mostly positive yet stressful), but its highlighting the lack of intimate relationships and consistent friends I have. I could write and explain more, but this feels weird to post here. My relationships with others is a vulnerability, insecurity, and deep hurt that I carry but don't share with others, but its also cathartic to write and release the pain."

It's these comments, however, that stops me from being vulnerable to them. I'm afraid and feel like the moment they see and become aware of how insecure and down I am, the words of comfort and advice I gave them will no longer be effective. I feel like they will lose that hope and encouragement the moment they notice I don't always practice what I preach. Some of them look up to me as a role model, as a figure of hope that it is possible to live without feeling down all the time, and I'm scared of being open about my vulnerability in case it breaks their illusion. I don't know if anything I said above sense and some will call me out on being presumptious, that I'm crying from a high horse.

And we have been talking ever since...for five months. You knew I was looking for something serious, but you messaged me anyway. I guess I should blame myself though...because I kept replying and responding to you. I was falling for the guy whose words popped up on the screen so vibrantly. Words that teased, words that showed vulnerability, words that meant so much to me every day. I never experienced anything like that before...certainly not from a guy I met on a dating app. And then four months in you told me you found her. The perfect girl for you... I tried to be happy, I honestly tried to be happy for you but I cried that night. I guess I was in too deep without meaning to. I know its not your fault, but I wish I never met you at all...I was and maybe still am half-way in love with you...and I hate myself everyday for having feelings for you. Did you ever feel something for me? Did you ever see me inside your head being with you for the rest of your life? Did you...did you ever think of me in a romantic way?

I let my mind erase away the memory of every soul crushing hand you laid upon me. It was all replaced with hope. The simple thought that people weren't, couldn't be, truly as evil as I'd seen. There simply had to be better out in the world somewhere. If I let your actions and words sink in to the core of me, I'd never survive long enough to go find that good. It was a fight because all I'd endured would occasionally float to the surface as anxiety. Always over the most peculiar and seemingly unexplainable things. I learned how to hide that away, push it aside, and still keep fighting to find the life I'd dreamed of living. Were you furious that your actions didn't ruin me and I'd been doing so well? Did you think that I looked too happy, strong, or successful with a college degree, a good job, an adorable family and everything looking up for me? Was that a sign that your viciousness failed and wasn't important enough to devastate my entire life? Why else would you be so driven to remind me of every horrible moment that I'd let slide in the past. You had to destroy everything I'd survived and fought for with your manipulative games and regular reminders of what happened. Did doing that make you feel better about yourself? The ability to hurt me with it all over again because you knew my one last vulnerability? Well you forgot to remind me of one piece of it all. Why. Why me. Someone who would have preferred to just love you or forgive you and go on with life as it was. Forgetting what you'd done was my last gift to you. You stomped on it. I don't feel compelled to apologize or explain or justify who I am right now as a result. I don't have it in me to forgive you twice, but thanks for reminding me of exactly how disgustingly miserable you must be to behave as you did. I still have hope. You'll never get it."

Blah blah blah. But even there, I cant say what I need to say. This is a complicating love story that I still obsess over daily. Ive known this person since I was 14 and he was a few years older than me. We were very good friends then... stayed friends in high school... nothing ever happened as we were both into other people though I always had a small crush on him. When I was 21 and he was 23, we kissed once but that was it. Still from 17-22, he was one of my good friends and we chatted often even throughout many life changes and moves on my end. I got married at 23 and had a child at 24. He and I were still friends and he was a source of support when my crappy marriage was failing. He was there for me when I left my ex. At this point after I became single, I realized that I had some feelings for him but he had started dating someone else so I did, too. Well, a few months later, we both found ourselves unattached so we decided to hang out and see what happened. We hooked up and then continued hooking up. We both became somewhat obsessive in our communication... like all day talking from waking up to going to sleep. This was obviously a big distraction as we both were working on college degrees, I was a single mother at this point, and we both were working. I wouldnt say it was entirely healthy. We were neglecting responsibility- he would come to stay for a night and stay for 4, etc etc. It just became too much to sustain. From the beginning he said he wasnt ready for commitment as he didnt have his life together and had no idea what he was doing with himself... but I wasnt looking for a commitment either as I wasnt even divorced yet. I never intended to fall for him. To be honest, I just envisioned this fun, spontaneous fling with someone I trusted and it would just end up how it ended up. I wasnt concerned with getting hurt because I dont think I had ever truly cared or loved someone before him. I had no idea what was to come or what the devastation would feel like after this type of loss. I never understood love songs or love movies or people in depression after breakups. It was just so foreign to me. I couldnt relate. Anyway, the intensity just became too much ...we both had this push/pull energy going on, lots of fear and weirdness involved, until he basically just slow faded/ghosted me after I told him multiple times to just leave me already. But he never did it to my face and he wouldnt come out and tell me he didnt care for me or want to be with me although I begged him to just say it so I could move on. It would make it easier if he just said it was me instead of blaming life circumstances like not knowing his future/career path/life/etc. He was a pretty depressed person and talked about suicide sometimes so in retrospect, I understand there was a lot going on. He has a serious fear of intimacy anyway and hasnt ever had a serious relationship at almost 35. He did lead me on by checking in here and there the next few months and I reached out occasionally, too, but that was it. I tried so hard to be stoic because of my fear of vulnerability or looking ridiculous but seriously, I was dying inside and Im pretty certain he knew it... which I believe is one reason he maintained distance. Anyway, one day- almost a year later of our ending, I reached out... he was very neutral... I ignored him and his neutral response because I know him well enough to know his response was him being this way on purpose to avoid me and avoid what would happen if he said more and opened up. Well he also knows me well enough to know I ignored him because I knew why he was ignoring me. So two hours later he messages me back and goes into a spiel about how hes working all the time and just doesnt have time, etc etc. I still ignore his messages and that night, I drink myself into oblivion because of being hurt and shoving all my feelings inside like always. I ended up drunk texting him which resulted in him purposely being neutral again and me getting angry. Its now been 1.5 years since anyone has reached out which has been the longest we have ever gone without talking to each other probably in the full 17 years we have known each other. I literally think about him every day. I want him in my future. I wonder things like what if he died How would I know? Would he know how much I cared for him? I would die, seriously. I feel like there is no other person for me. I feel like I dont want there to be. I mean... what the heck? I literally cannot stop. Ive tried everything. Every.single.thing to move on from him. Talking about it, not talking about it, crying, not crying, praying, ignoring him, ignoring the situation, begging God or the universe, affirmations to be over him, affirmations to have him, dating others, weird YouTube hypnosis things, therapy, time, moving to our hometown, moving to another state... I will say- this isnt like an ex situation where there is all this pride and separation. Like once you break up with someone and you move on- you become two different people and that person becomes a stranger. You realize that you were different and that there were big red flags and there were reasons you didnt work and couldnt have worked out. Helloooo, Ive dated people before and broken up. I divorced my ex-husband and was over that pretty quickly. But this. No. I feel like I cannot hide from this person. From where I live- (I moved away to another state to escape the thought of him and any memoriesyeah, okay, hasnt worked) he could read my mind and I could read his. Easily. Its almost a curse. In this situation, I have not felt freedom once. I still miss him. Please dont make fun of me, I feel dumb enough. It eats away at me. And yes, Ive been in therapy but even there- Im too prideful to admit the full extent of this. Thanks for listening to me."

Im posting here again because I think it might help someone. If you struggle with anxiety and depression, the first step for you to seeing real improvement is to be honest with yourself. This may seem obvious, otherwise you probably wouldnt be on this sub in the first place. But I mean REALLY be honest with yourself. Im a 21 y/o male. I consider myself intelligent, funny, compassionate, and intuitive. But Ive recently come to realize that Ive been lying to myself for a very long time. Even as far back as my childhood. I think the reason that Ive been lying to myself for so long was because it was the only way to cope with what I was feeling. Or so I thought. But recently Ive reached the breaking point. To be honest, it felt really good to let it all out. If youve ever had moments where you felt emotionless in a situation where you feel like you should have felt something, dont worry. This is a sign of your own strength. But you should realize that youre human, and you have your limits. No matter how strong you may think you may be, you must, MUST be vulnerable. This is coming from a person who has never shown vulnerability to anyone. Not even my family. But this is the first step to self-betterment. Its not necessarily going to be comfortable. Quite the contrary, actually. But growing pains are called growing pains for a reason ;) TL;DR Put your pride aside and be vulnerable. You need to. I learned this the hard way."

Out into the real world. Handed free reign I had never experienced. Many others like me took full advantage. And yet, no matter how many times I was encouraged to find my own way, I would not. Because I was tired. I didn't even try to apply for university, because I was tired. I didn't reach out to people I knew, because I was tired. I made promises I could not keep, because I was tired. I've hurt the people around me, hurt myself, because I was tired. It's been four years since I started feeling this way. Like the inward fight has been eating me up, every day. All my energy goes to holding myself in place. On a good day, this means I can maybe take a step forward. On a bad day, it means I fall back, sometimes past where I was. Because when you're tired, you lack the motivation for self-improvement. When you're tired, the world seems to push against you, fight you for your own happiness. And the world has been winning for years now. The past year has been a struggle. 2019 was meant to be my year, a time where I could finally establish myself as a person and begin my journey to find my identity. Pull myself out of the toxic relationships, the past trauma, the abuse. Start anew. Life doesn't seem to have the same goal. I've been sick for four months. From late December to the present day, I've found myself miserable with various ailments. One was unidentifiable. The doctors gave up trying to discover what it was. I gave up on them. Some have just been colds. I've had fevers at random times and my first migraines began just after my birthday in March. I'm trying to work consistently, learn how to become an artist and look after myself, but. I'm tired. So. Damn. Tired. I don't know how long I can hold on anymore. I feel like everything I believed my future to be is disappearing before my eyes. That every negative thing I have ever been told I was is true. That there is no point for my existence but to act as an example of failure to others. If I can't experience the joys of living, what is the purpose of my being here? I've found love, but I'm so afraid of losing it. I've found passion, but I don't have the energy to make it work. I can see the sunshine, but I'm left aching for its warmth from a bed unwashed for weeks. I'm tired. And I'm slowly giving up on myself. And I don't know what to do."

Every time I leave my therapists office I feel incredible, like after treading water my whole life I can finally touch the bottom but it always fades too quickly. Apparently for the feeling to last I need to accept the fact that I am a sensitive, emotionally vulnerable person. The rub is how much feeling stuff fucking hurts, like trying to not be dragged down by the undertow. I some times wish I could kill my heart and not feel anything."

Despite the breakup, I was not worried about attending a wedding since Im comfortable with my decision. Im an adult and the wedding was a pleasure to attend. I definitely did underestimate the impact of watching new and other older couples showing gentle displays of affection. It got me a little choked up and reminded me of that want to have a solid loving partner. Sadly, this led to the experience of my first one night stand. I was sober enough and aware of my decisions, but Ill admit I felt pretty manipulated into the course of the night. This has led me to remember the old feelings of vulnerability and overwhelming sense of desire to be loved and make bad decisions. Even the bad decision of just sharing too much about the breakup. Its too soon. Everything was too soon. Its made me reflect on my past and made me feel Ive never really been loved due to this desperation that led me to my stupid ex in the first place. Of course, I didnt even get a fb invite to remain in touch with my evening buddy. I feel so dirty and worthless."
358,vulnerability,offmychest,Bad couple months... very long post,1,bj00uj,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/bj00uj/bad_couple_months_very_long_post/,2019-04-30 16:19:27,"Hey everyone, &amp;#x200B; I love this subreddit and been reading it for a good time now, although today I'm posting from a throwaway account as I don't really want it associated it with my account. I'm off a long rant as I really have a lot to get off my chest.. will try to make it short. Thanks in advance. &amp;#x200B; I'm 28(M) living overseas for 6 years now. Since I've been focused doing my degree I never really had time for relationships, being romantic or serious friendships. This lead to a quite lonely life, where studying and getting my degree done was the main and ultimate goal. Last year I met this girl through Tinder, she was here on a holiday visa and had just arrived. Without much though we arranged a date for the next day and clicked instantly, which lead to a short but intense 6 months relationship. This was perfect timing for me, as I was one unit away of getting my Master's, and this gave me a whole new path to follow after this uni phase was done, I was excited. &amp;#x200B; A part of me is really wary of relationships, as I like to be independant and not put my feelings and vulnerability in someone else's hands... makes life easier if its only you to manage your problems. This girls however, with all her sweetness and love, made me open quite fast, and since we were both on a foreign country, we moved together, life was actually looking really good. I always had that little voice in my head warning me about not getting too excited, that maybe she was just very attached to me since she was alone in a new country, made sense but tried to not go to that side.. &amp;#x200B; After three months however, she went travelling with her family for a while. Before she left I opened up very deep feelings I had buried in me, fear of being alone and having distance ruined what we had ( I lost one of my parents very young so I think it may come from there). She promised things were going to be ok, she left me letters, surprises in the apartment ready for festive days (christmas cards, new year, birthday... you name it). However, during all that time she was away, our relationship got deteriorated quite fast, I was trying to give her space but couldn't avoid contacting her often and say I missed her and all that... kind of a party pooper I guess. &amp;#x200B; We met a month after in a different city, as we had planned to travel right after he family left. Sadly the person I found there wasn't deeply in love with me anymore. We talked and we tried, she was sad and frustrated as she didn't understood what made her feel that way, neither did I. We went travelling anyways and we had an amazing time, we didn't mention the subject and just laught, enjoyed and cherised beautiful landscapes together. As soon as we came back, that dreadful feeling came quite quick and she said she wanted to break up. I half heartedly agreed, and after some talk, we decided to try one more time, by then I had already in my mind this breakup was pretty inevitable. &amp;#x200B; Back in February, a week after we had moved to our new place, I knew she had the subject in the tip of her tongue. There was a lot of external pressure such as her not liking this country, not being able to find a holiday job due to the sheer amount of travellers, and her savings being almost gone. Our relationship had already switched to a roomate kinda thing, and to be honest it was still great. Her and I had always had this really strong connection, we laught everyday, we talked deeply and get entertained with the silliest things. We were companions in a foreign country at the end. Nevertheless, I told her I knew she had something to say and it was better now. She said she wasn't in love with me anymore, that she missed her family, friends and even her job. She booked a plain ticket for 10 days after, it felt crushing. &amp;#x200B; However, instead of sitting in bed crying, we decided to travel, see places she hadn't seen, eating nice food and just enjoying our time together. And the 10 days went fast, but were really enjoyable. We talked a lot and wished we would've met in a different phase of life, as I believe people build a life together with less passion and feelings than those we had for each other. I guess adulthood hit hard sometimes. &amp;#x200B; The day she left, I remember going to the airport really early and just hang there with her, had coffee and joked around. Seeing her go past security and vanish within a crowd has been one of the hardest things I've had to deal in my life, if not the hardest. She burst into tears and said she was sorry, she said this was really hard for her too. Maybe the romantic love was gone, but we always had each others back, we always were there to cheer the other, and we always have the other know he/she wasn't alone. &amp;#x200B; I remember going back to the apartment after the airport was a similar feeling to when my mom died. The house still had her essence, things she left behind and all that, but now she was on her way to be 10,000 km away from here. I spent weeks looking at our videos and photos while crying my eyes out. I comforted myself thinking being this sad usually means you've been just as happy priorly. We talked everynow and then, I realized this was a lot easier for her as she was the one going back to her family, friends and country, while I was here with all the memories and remembrances. So the talking inevitably had this needyness coming from my side which bothered me inmensely, at the end, I believe she became mentally ready to go before even telling me, leaving me with the initial shock to deal by myself. I don't resent it, I'm genuinely glad at least one of us is not feeling this bad. A few weeks ago we decided to not talk for a while, it cannot be possibly healthy for neither of us. Maybe wait and be friends later in the future, but feelings are still quite fresh. &amp;#x200B; If I hadn't bored you by now I'm guessing you're thinking I'm a physcho being this affected by such a short relationship. I'm honestly a pretty sober person, I don't break easily and know how to deal with my problems. I have neved had issues with girls either, I've just had very few serious relationships as I have a very high expectation of what a relationship should have and represent. That said, I don't go out measuring people as relationship material or not, I just enjoy my evening and let things go, but I hadn't had such a good date since I was 19. When she told me our relationships was like those when you're a teen I felt really in synch and excited, as I was thinking the exact same thing. In my 28 years I had such a hard time overcoming a relationship like now, I guess being alone in a different country, pressured by university and jobs doesn't help either. &amp;#x200B; All these feelings however had been decently manageable until this last week, I write and exercise to distract myself and it usually helps. When I speak of this to my overseas friends or family they get unevitably bored and I feel worse. This last week however I started going in a couple dates, none with girls I've liked nearly as much but I thought what the hell, I'll kill time and get things off my mind. This ended up turning for the worst as the last girl I dated gave me and STD which started showing a couple days ago, so talk about bad effing luck, I've been clean and cautious my entire life. To add to all this, I had trouble with my last unit and I've been carrying that this semester, and while it needs to be a priority to finish and graduate, its the least of my concerns at the moment. &amp;#x200B; I honestly don't know how to deal with so much crap all by myself, when the doctor told me the other day i might had an std the first thing I though was of my ex, how I would've loved to talk to her and get some nice words of comfort ( she was in the medical field so I guess she would've reacted less freaked than most). All in all, its a pretty tough time, I don't plan on giving up and sitting down to cry all day for weeks... my dad, in his strictness, always told me to keep pushing forward, even when things look the worst. Part of me feels a little silly as I did prove to be right about my ex, she might have gotten too excited with her travels and got me sucked in that spiral of emotions, she assures me it's not that, but I stopped mentioning her those subjects, it's pretty pointless now. I don't think anyone is reading at this point haha, but it has already made me feel a lot better, I know all this isn't the end of the world, but the hardest thing is not having a true friend to talk to face to face. Thanks you so much for reading... Cheers!"

So to start off, Im a 16 year old gay boy. If you say me youd say I was The Cute One in the friend group. Really short (like 53) skinny asf and I look like Im like 11 or 12 lmao. You know, vulnerable. I weirdly like it this. Its because I like being vulnerable. Its not just rape, its bondage too. The idea of being tightly hogtied by friend or an older boy/man/woman while wearing nothing but underwear and not being able to do anything about it no matter how hard I struggle, it makes me *hard*. Or being held down against my will, ankles and hands tied behind my back, crying and struggling while being...raped, thats just arousing, as disgusting as it may sound. Its the vulnerability aspect I guess. I like the feeling of being vulnerable and reserved and defenseless. I guess thats just what being a bottom is... I dont have any fantasies about raping anyone else, so thats good, I guess. Tho I feel its kinda disrespectful? Or invalidating? To people who have actually been trafficked and sexually assaulted. For me to view it as hot and arousing just feels kinda wrong I guess. Also, arent I a little young to be experiencing shit like this?"
360,vulnerability,offmychest,"I'll never have the love of my brothers, and it breaks my heart.",2,bjirh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/bjirh8/ill_never_have_the_love_of_my_brothers_and_it/,2019-05-02 01:57:27," Throw away account because I'd probably die if my brothers ever knew how I felt. I (32/F) have two brothers, one who's a couple years older, and one a few years younger. Growing up we never got along. In fact, I seriously loathed my brothers for most of my life. When I saw other girls with brothers who loved, protected, and cherished them, I was in awe... like how could that possibly exist? How do they manage it? What does that feel like? My older brother was always so mean to me. He never said anything nice, but rather played on all my insecurities and used them to hurt me. He beat me up. He made fun of me in front of other people, in front of my parents, and no one ever defended me. I could never properly defend myself in a way that would make a difference. I was always the loser in those battles. In spite of it all, I've always admired him. He's incredibly witty, and funny. He always makes me laugh with his super dry sense of humor, but I don't think he's ever intended to make me laugh, he's just being himself. Growing up, I wanted to be just as funny. I would try to be sarcastic, and funny back, but he always took it as me trying to be mean. I was just antagonizing him. My dad once told me my brother loved me until I learned to talk. Essentially saying, it was my fault for ruining any relationship we had (even though I was too young to know right from wrong). I can't remember a time my older brother was ever nice to me. I've always been an embarrassment for him. He'd never be seen with me if he could help it. The last and probably only time we've ever hugged was about 20 years ago, when I jokingly forced one on him, and I'm sure it was one of the worst moments I've ever inflicted on him. For the last decade I've made serious attempts to be a good sister. But the times I've tried to be myself, it blows up in my face. He gets angry, offended, and takes it the wrong way. I'm just a nuisance. Several years ago, he and I were on vacation with my mom. He resented the fact that I was there to begin with. I'm sure he felt that I was ruining his experience, and wished I'd never come with. The last day we were there, he'd had enough and took the opportunity to tell me all the reasons why he and my little brother hated me. I cried. I screamed. I told him all I wanted was a big brother. All I wanted was to have a normal relationship, but I couldn't accomplish that on my own. I was so hurt. I still cry about it, years later. At family get togethers, we barely speak. We almost never make eye contact. We basically pretend the other person doesn't exist. If he ever did anything nice toward me now, I honestly wouldn't know how to react. It would be so out of the ordinary, it would just be incredibly awkward. As for my little brother, I know my terrible relationship with him is entirely my fault. In my adult years, I've been putting forth a lot of effort to make up for the horrible ways I treated him. I want so much for him to be happy. He struggles a lot as an adult and it kills me to see him hurting. I blame myself. I tell him I love him, I try to give advice when he's struggling, though I don't think he wants to hear it. I try to hug him when I see him, though that is still awkward because it isn't something we've ever done really. But growing up, I deflected a lot of my pain onto him. He was half my size, but I beat him up. Made fun of him, and basically treated him like shit. It's probably the single greatest regret of my life. You don't need to comment on how shitty that was of me, I know I am garbage for it. I would do anything to take it back. I can only assume I justified my behavior toward him by feeling that since my older brother did it to me, then it's only fair that I get to do it to someone too. He and I have slowly been mending our relationship, but I don't think he's entirely interested. He wants friends, not a sister. And that's what I'm struggling so hard to come to terms with. Neither of my brothers really care that I exist. They've never loved me. Neither of them reach out and see if I'm still alive. Neither ever them have ever once called me. We never have that ""hey, how are you doing"" conversation. I've heard siblings sometimes don't come together until their parents pass away, but I don't want that to happen. So much life wasted without the love of my brothers. It's all I've ever wanted to feel like I'm not a sore they have to endure. But I also wouldn't know how to handle it if they did love me. I imagine that I would feel incredibly awkward and embarrassed. I needed to let this out to someone. Anyone. I've been holding onto this pain all my life. I'm open to any advice anyone can offer. I can't imagine just outright telling my older brother how I feel. I still admire him, and revealing my vulnerability to him would be so difficult. I don't think he'd know what to do if I told him how I felt, besides just listen and not respond. And even if he did say, ""I care about you, and I want a good relationship too"" I don't think either of us would know where to go from there. But I feel better know that maybe someone else will read this and know what I'm talking about. Someone else could relate and share some sympathy. I think I just need a little sympathy. To know that I'm not the only one so unloved by the people who mean the most to me."
361,vulnerability,offmychest,I wanted to text you,3,bjz0lz,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/bjz0lz/i_wanted_to_text_you/,2019-05-03 05:27:28,"I wanted to tell you just how much I missed you, how I think about you all of the time, how I wish I could share my life with you the way we once did, how I keep envisioning what it would be like with you by my side in all of my new experiences. Despite my desire to share this vulnerability with you, I chose not to. And that got me thinking why am I scared to tell you? Is it simply because it isnt something that an ex should say? Is it because Im just scared Ill upset you for whatever reason? Is it because Im scared of being disappointed? Disappointment. While the other reasons are also true, that one really stuck to my mind. I started to question why I would be disappointed. Disappointment only occurs with expectation. What were my expectations? That was when I realized that I wanted to tell you that because of the hope I have deep inside that you miss me too, that you want me back. And that realization hurt a lot honestly. I didnt want to be rejected again. I didnt want to open up again because I didnt want to hurt. I have spent a long time thinking about what could have happened, what could have went differently and a majority of that led me to conclude that you just werent ready for me. At least, thats what I told myself. But with this discussion I had with myself today, I realize that it wasnt as simple as that. I wasnt ready either. And as I dive more and more into discovering myself again, doing things that cause me a lot of anxiety, and in general, just trying to work through some of my irrational fears, I uncover more and more just how much my past has shaped me, how emotionally unavailable I am. I have a fear of rejection, a fear of disappointment; and this fear manifests itself in all of my anxieties and in my everyday life. I never truly got over the times you rejected me in college, even though I know you had your reasons. And thats not on you. Thats on me. I never made peace with it. I resented you for it. And when we finally got together, that resentment didnt go away. I was afraid to open up to you. I was afraid to show too much interest. Im still afraid of these things. You intimidate me so much, to the point where Im scared to do things, to show interest in what you do. I hid when I did things for you, when I tried to get into your hobbies. I was embarrassed by how much I liked you, how much I loved you. And that really hurt our relationship. You never felt good enough because I never let you feel that way, because of that deep seeded resentment I still held. I was emotionally unavailable. I was afraid to feel what I did in college and I hurt you in the process. I hurt and pushed away the one I wanted the most and Im truly sorry. A lot of this is not news to me. Ive realized that I did this beforewhats new is the fact that this emotional unavailability existed long before you, and that youre not the first person Ive done this to, and honestly, Im working towards making sure youll be the last. There have been two men in my life that I have been crazy about, that both rejected me and accepted me intermittently. When we finally got together, you were the last remaining one. In high school, I was crazy about C. Similar situation, essentially lust at first sight. I pursued him. We hooked up on/off. That continued for a long time, but he always had the power in high school. After graduating high school and moving onto college, when I was single the summer of 2015, he and I resumed our shenanigans. We hooked up all of the time. We were friends. We hung out. We had sex. It was fun. I reflect on it now and I see instances where I did the same thing to him. Although we werent in a relationship, I still said cruel things to him that kept him at an emotional distance. I would say how hes not my type at all, etc. just to show him that he no longer has the power over me. That wasnt nice of me. He wanted me more then, but I pushed him away too. I needed to win. While the caliber of the two instances are wildly different, the result is the same. The rejection I experienced from both of you hurt me so much that I both desired and resented you both. I didnt want to show weakness. Now, why I do this to people that have hurt me in the past is a story for a different time. I guess all that matters right now is that I need to work through my emotional unavailability, not be so hurt by rejection, and learn to move forward from it. I shouldnt be afraid to show someone just how much I like them. Even in my previous relationships and non-relationships with people who didnt hurt me in this way, I did this. That clearly will never lead me to a truly successful relationship. Despite recognizing that I shouldnt fear the rejection, I dont think Im ready to tell you any of this. I dont think its something you would want to hear, or care about; and I sure as hell dont think, against my hopes and wishes, that you would want me back. I wouldnt want me back either. I dont think itd be fair to you to unload this all on you either, you know? Its a lot and it should be for me. I only hope that I didnt spawn the same demon in you. I miss you. I love you. I havent stopped thinking about you."
362,vulnerability,offmychest,"*Trigger Warning* Two years later, I still believe my ex sexually assaulted me, but am too scared to say anything because of my Nparents",1,bk89vk,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/bk89vk/trigger_warning_two_years_later_i_still_believe/,2019-05-03 23:06:02,"TLDR: Out of fear, I have never told anyone my ex sexually assaulted me. Two years later I still dont, because I wouldnt be taken seriously. From 2016 to late 2017, I dated this guy who was my first everything. At 21, I had never been with any guy until my ex. Unfortunately, meaning, I was naive and easily blindsided by his unfamiliar but desired attention and affection for me. Little did I know that he had a narcissistic personality, thus it was programmed in his brain that, with the knowledge of my vulnerability, he could control me in every aspect. Note: Im almost 24 now, and disabled with makes the situation harder and more difficult to confess...because Ik the consequences. For the first 7 months out of the 12.5 we were together, it wasnt perfect but it wasnt a nightmare either. He and I had a lot in common so we did things we both liked to do: mini golf, movies, arcades, video game nights at his place. We fell for one another hard. Or at least in my 21-year-old POV. Sadly, as I looked back after the breakup, I realized - although I did love those activities - how little I had a say in what we did. Hed become so bitter for a few hours if we did something I wanted to do. I ofc saw it as being a boy and ignored it. Until my ex began to show me his true colors in ways that I wish I could forget... He became sickly over protective of me, not letting me use my phone while on a date, go out with my girlfriends on the weekdays or weekends or grabbing my body in a tight grasp and holding it close to his side if we walked by a group of people who to him appeared to be harmful. He then turned horribly defensive and angry whenever Id try to talk with him about something that was bothering me. In public hed humiliate me on purpose and then laugh, say it was a joke and to not be so sensitive. Then the emotional abuse and shaming of my looks, goals, lifestyle started. Lies. Gaslighting. Then, one night...and this is the night that comes and goes in a blur...I was sitting on his mums couch, watching TV with her. My ex was somewhere in the back doing something. Suddenly, he calls out down the hallway and asks me to go into his room. I wish I hadnt moved. But I did. I stood in the middle of his bedroom floor, waiting. (Was wearing jeans and a t shift btw) My ex comes in and has this grin on his face. Like a sensual yet (now) mischievous... Why do you want me in here? You told me to go in the living room. (thats what he did toward the end of our relationship, told me to not go into his room without him there etc) I wanted to see you. Thought we could have alone time. Isnt that enough? I sighed and agreed. He then leaned in to kiss me. Ofc I let him, although I admit I was upset at this point by how he treated me - yet, I didnt understand what I do now to put two and two together. I tried to pull away though because he became way intense, which was abnormal for him as of late. When Id be be affectionate, hed respond for a quick second and then tell me to take it easy... He ignored me, saying that this was overdue and picked me up, put me on his bed. I said Not now and that we were upset at one another still, that I didnt want to be intimate like this. But he chuckled and said that I did want it and that make up sex was fun... Like an idiot I let him take my clothes off except for my undergarments...He began to try foreplay, slapping my ass and kissing my neck...which he knew was my soft spot. Mind you, he was a 50 pounds heavier than I was (I was 86 at the time; very lightweight IK...). He had pinned my arms over my head when I went to put them on his shoulders to push him off. This wasnt what I wanted... I couldnt breathe; I am convinced to this day, I almost had a panic attack.... I felt his fingers on my legs and this shiver came across my spine, but it wasnt like past sensations that I had when we had sex. Suddenly my panties were off...and I said his name and before I could say anything else, he took it as a cue and put himself in me... I gasped but he thought otherwise... This went on for a few seconds. I struggled. A bunch of nos escaped my lips; I pushed his hands off of my wrists somehow and with my knee, I shoved him hard where it hurt most. He instantly got off of me, choking at the pain.... I didnt feel bad. I and ran out to the bathroom, clothes in my arms and called a friend who lived nearby to come pick me up. Made an excuse my ex wasnt feeling well and didnt want my Nparents involved...theyd only make it worse... I regret how long I let myself stay after that, but psychologically, I was not in the right mindset with him. He had taken capture of my emotions and my love for him so I would be afraid to leave. Guilt trip or force me to feel lonely by leaving me alone in a room for hours, or saying in this psychopathic tone of voice that without him Id be nothing. Fear was implanted in me until I had enough and broke the chains. Two years later, I know he did a horrible thing. In his sick mind he was giving me what he knew I usually wanted from him. But because of how my Nparents are in terms of telling me Im being dramatic about anything and everything, I have kept silent. The fear of seeing him again in a courtroom or a hospital bed because my Ndad punched him to the pulp, it always pushes down that memory and has me smile to cover up the pain."

My two sisters clearly wont be celebrating and be supportive as I always am if it was for me getting things done in life. If they want to insult each other and be bitter, ok Im done trying to make things work. but can they not be bitter with me too!!? Leave me alone. Im not the same as you two at all. How come you cant see it?! I think youre both very insecure person. You want/need to feel like you are better than anyone else. You dont care about personal accomplishment, its all about your ego. Thats so sad and unnecessary. And thats so unnecessary to be rude to each others. Times are getting harder and harder. We are all adults and deeply need each other. We clearly love each other, can we focus on that. Daeny (fictional name): your my big sister,you clearly need emotional support and I remember you wanting me to stay late with you in the living room cuz you didnt want to do your homeworks alone. I completely understood that. Nobody will ever judge you for being a fuckin human being. You keep stressing yourself over things that even you actually dont care about. You keep all your hurt, fear, problems to yourself becuz you think it will make you weak to open up, or it will make you a loser to admit that you are having a hard time. But you are only suffocating yourself. And depriving yourself from a help that could make you feel a lot better. A psychologist its good but you cant underestimated your family and an understanding heart. But as I want it or not, your ego transfered to me. I am now very silent about my problems and failures (when it comes to specifically open up to you). You made me feel like I was weak to need an ear to my voice. You made feel corny for actually wanting/needing emotional support. I dont hate you but honestly you ruined a huge part of my vulnerability. You really really makes me feel shitty sometime. As if all my problem were corny and worthless. I know thats your character and I cant take it personal. you and dad are very simple like that. But it still feels wrong. On top of that I cant talk about how I feel about you and Lys (fn) being very bitter and rude and competitive. I find both of you very ridiculous. But you will probably tell me to get over it and that siblings act like that. This is normal and blabla. You will try to make me feel as if I was the corny one. Its all about your ego. But I clearly see you being hurt when lys is rude to you. There were time where it was ok cuz you actually seemed to not give a fuck. But you are going through very hard times now. I hate seeing her being rude to you and you silently suffer. I hate the fact that you come home to find confort and support but you find yourself greeted by our very rude little sister. It hurts me. I hurts me that it hurts me cuz if it was the other way around you couldnt care less. In fact you wouldnt be able to see whats wrong. Youre not as sensible as me. Youre not sensible to the every detail in the atmosphere like me. But I refuse to and I will never see me as a weak person for being able to detect any absurdity and toxicity in my relationships. Anyway Im proud of myself for actually being kind to all of my siblings and be as supportive and understanding. Maybe they cant see it but at least I sleep very well at night knowing that Im not in competition with anyone, Im not pressed or bitter about anyone and I couldnt care less about how much you both think you are ahead of me in life. Whatever mom said about me being lazy and useless isnt your business and doesnt reflect on the fact that you are superior/favored. Btw, Did you really said that you were mom and dad favorite?!!? How sad is that?? Do you really believe that? You really need to think that your own parents have favorites?!? omg you are clearly blinded by your desperate need of superiority. Becuz it will actually never happens that you think that mom and dad will eventually have others favorites over the years, right? . You will always feel favored. Why is that? Cuz its in your head!!! Thats why!!! But keep dreaming. But I most admit it makes me angry that my mom never say anything to my face and that she talk to the two worse person she could ever talk. My two sisters only feel satisfaction hearing that I am ""lazy and going nowhere"". Thats cruel knowing how understanding I am of the two of them. I understand depression, anxiety and a need for a break. When mom say that Daeny has problem and is going throught hard times. I understand. Clearly. But nobody takes the time to understand me. If I wanted to I could make you feel worthless. Both of you.If I wanted to play your games. If I stopped being so ""lazy"" I will actually be a beast. And you know it. Just enjoy it while it last. In fact Im sure that Im intimidating. You clearly dont have any special talent in life. I can draw, dance, sing, write, I have a really great artistic soul. I have good grades too and not only in arts, in math and science too . Im great with aesthetics, Im better at hair and makeup than both of you combined. I can clearly do everything I put my mind to. My only distraction might be depression and any traumas I havent dealt with. But at least i know. Your distractions are very corny: bitterness and pettyness. Probably others stuff too. But youre too proud to seek for help. Oh well. You two are barely aware of whats eating inside. Can you see that you need each others. Can you see that WE need each others. Stop being so unnecessary bitter. I also been holding myself back in order for you to not be jealous or bitter. I HATE jealousy and bitterness!! and I dont want any part in this. This is true that no family is perfect and that it is perfectly normal to not get along with your siblings. But you both reached a very embarrassing level of bitterness. Actually Ill admit that only my little sister is rude and that my big sis has to deal with it. But she is not an angel neither. They are both too self absorbed and competitive. And you should know that mom knows that. Stop embarrassing yourselves. But trust me it doesnt bother me as much as it seems. Not even a little. Im just tired of being the only one who sees everything. And how much nonsense there is in my family. I dont open up to anyone in my house about my personal problems cuz thats considered being weak in my house. I did try once. We were in the middle of an argument about how much my little sis doesnt know how to be nice to people and that both of my sis were unable to complimente non only each others but me too. I told them that I cant believe that I Am the only one who complimente people in this house and that I actually celebrate others good things in life. My big sis only said that it was true and my lil sis was confused (well the context was maybe different to her, she thought we said that she cant compliment herself. Lol shes only capable of doing so) But anyway, this rant was longer than I expected. But Im glad its off my chest."

She sounded really disappointed when I said I wasn't sure. My life is currently not going very well. Everything just seems to collapse around me. I've had a lot of support from some close friends and my parents. Nothing bad happened between me and the rest of my family. I have nothing against most of them. I just don't talk to them. At family events, I'm always just quietly sitting there. They make attempts to have meaningless conversations, and I try to respond well but I'm just not into it. It's very obvious they only talk to me and invite me to things because we're related. We have no contact outside of family events, like birthdays, and nobody seems to mind that. I'm just at a point where I don't want to have meaningless relationships. One of my friends is getting married and I love her, but after the wedding I really want to leave that group chat because the rest of the friends in there just dont care about me anymore, and I dont care about them and that's fine. I just hate when they pretend to care. (asking me how my surgery went and telling me you thought about me a lot weeks after the fact, when you weren't there for me while I was actually going through it just doesn't do it for me). Anyway, back to family stuff. I have my friends, grandparents, parents, brother and sister, and thats just enough for me right now. That's my chosen family. Maybe everything just feels worse right now because I'm not doing well. Maybe Ill be able to enjoy the meaningless stuff again someday. Maybe I should put in more effort, but I just feel no desire to do so. Idk. I just know that if I go to the party, I'll just be quietly sitting in a corner, thinking about all the stuff that's going on in my life and trying not to cry. And every now and then someone will ask how school is going, because that's all they can think of, and I'll lie and say everythings going well, because I just don't want them to know what's really going on. Telling them would just feel like a waste of time and vulnerability, because in the end, we don't really care about each other."

I thought he was amazing, that wed overcome any and all obstacles based on the strength of us, and that Id spend the rest of my life with him. That wasnt how it played out. For a lot of different reasons, some down to him, some down to me, and some down to us both being kids with no real experience with a serious relationship, we split; bitterly, angrily and with no real closure for either of us. Beginning around the start of this year, I began to fall again. There are some similarities between the two of them (of course, everyone has a type), but there are many more differences. I love him, and I can see a future here. However, how do we ever know for sure? I never saw such a harsh split coming for my first love, yet it did. What if wed become more serious only for it to go south as it did, and ultimately cause us both even more pain? What if my current partner and I become more serious only for unforeseen circumstances/personality clashes to cause history to repeat? If I fell head over heels once and I now have again, what does that say for the concept of the one? And on the flip-side, if there are countless different people were compatible with, how can you ever really know what is and isnt best for yourself - whether or not youre settling? Or even worse, simply choosing to see the good in someone, essentially a sitting duck, waiting for it all to crash down upon the two of you? Vulnerability in love is terrifying. Everyone says nothing lasts forever, but I cant help but wish forever was more common."
367,vulnerability,offmychest,Im lonely. (14F),1,bmil45,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/bmil45/im_lonely_14f/,2019-05-09 21:26:08,"If you feel lonely, you are lonely. I have friends. Theyre great. But I feel so, so lonely. Im new to the friend group. Ive only been in it for one year. They like me, I think. Theyre really nice. They care about me, I think. Let me elaborate. I have always naturally been shy, quiet and reserved. Im autistic and have social anxiety, social interaction and skills relating to such dont come easily to me. Its hard. I was bullied when I was 5-6 years old due to being different from the others. I was punched and kicked, everyone told me it was because he liked me - teaching my young impressionable brain that someone inflicting pain on you means that they like you. I had two friends at that time, too. One girl was kinda just the third wheel, the other bossed me around constantly and as a result I had grown apprehensive of developing friendships ever since, my opinion of social connections changed. I started dreading going to school because it would mean I was seeing her. Moving on. 6-7 years old, grade 1. I found new friends and they were alright I suppose. I dont really remember much about them. Then when I was 8, I left them too, and for the most of year two I was lonely. I always hung out with teachers on yard duty or wandered around the school campus, daydreaming. Until these two girls started to include me in their activities - they became something like best friends at the time. That friendship has disappeared, unsurprisingly. I also met two other girls, etc etc etc... I messed up that friendship (I was 11). As you can see, Ive never really had stable, long lasting friendships in my primary school life. This resulted in chronic loneliness feelings and a natural instinct to push others away - build up a wall around myself. Guard my emotions. Never show vulnerability. Burdens are bad, and that is what I am. Feelings are fatal. Im only trying to protect myself, is what I tell myself. But its all bullshit and deep down I know it. Now I have a stable friend group that has actually managed to last me a year! Theyre really nice and I think they care about me. They ask if I want to join in on activities, sometimes. Yet, I still feel lonely. Im probably the most unpopular in my friend group, if that makes sense. They care about me, yes, I suppose, but not as much as others. It kind of hurts being second best. When theyre choosing partners Im just the second choice if their first preference doesnt work out. When they save seats no one is ever hitting the table, calling my name, with a gleam in their eyes, beckoning me to sit with them. Im ignored. Its hard to get the attention of others. Sometimes I feel invisible. When things are going on outside of school, Im usually the last person to know and join in because Im forgotten about. I dont have a super close friend or best friend IRL. Honestly. It seems like everyone in my friend group does... and yet I dont. So I wonder, whats wrong with me? Am I too awkward? Am I annoying? Am I ugly? (This sounds silly I know, but I have less than ideal hygiene as a result of disability and yeah) Is it because of my disabilities? Am I too sick to handle? Am I rude? Or maybe Im too isolated and withdrawn? Too distant? Maybe Im too quiet or too loud for them. Is it something about my intelligence, perhaps? Is my personality okay? Am I okay? As you can see... I have a lot of questions. It doesnt help Im desperate for validation and reassurance at every possible second of every day. And I have a very bad tendency of developing unhealthy dependencies on close loved ones, which adds to my anxiety and beliefs of being a burden. I just... I wish I was someones favourite person. I wish I was someones first choice. Someone to hug when theyre happy. A shoulder to cry on. Someone to randomly send memes to and call at 3am. Someone to hang out with after to school and grab a coffee or something. I wish I had a best friend and I was someones best friend. But oh well. Sorry for this mess lol"

Still, I wish I wasn't here.",3,azqzi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/azqzi1/i_have_a_good_life_still_i_wish_i_wasnt_here/,2019-03-11 19:36:21,"Warning: Potentially triggering for those contemplating suicide. I am a good student, I have friends, even people who've liked me. I love my parents and have enjoyable hobbies. Yet often I wish that I didn't have to exist and experience life. There are some things about me I keep on the down low, for example I'm hecka lazy and actually do most of my work like the class before its due, which people don't really expect of me. But other than that, I'm actually a relatively successful person. I haven't completely ""given up"" on life because would be extremely difficult to recover once that happened, if that happens. From what I can understand, we exist for the purpose of existing (I mean in the biological sense; live, reproduce, die)... What even is the point of having a ""meaning""?.. Then I get embarrassed, because there are plenty of people who truly live/lived a living hell, and still have the fighting spirit in them to continue living. I think about how that is just perhaps the animal instinct of survival combined with human societal values of honorable living. Sometimes, I am distracted by other events in my life. Yet I always come back to this, especially during my low points of course. I think there are many others as well who are attracted to the (presumably) peaceful state of oblivion which death would provide. A certain fundamental existential question comes to mind. Why is there something instead of nothing? Why has natural laws eventually come to favor existence, organization of matter, and survival instead of simply randomness or a void? This is a question I will never be able to answer. However when I ask myself, which do I prefer, something verses nothing, living verses nonliving, ups and downs verses stability, I prefer the latter. In death there is stability, and to stability all things will return to eventually. Both happiness and sadness are temporary no matter how strong momentarily. In the big picture, I really don't care about how I feel, although in immediate situations I am strongly affected by feelings. What can I do about that though, really? The point is, death means I no longer have to deal with... anything. I want to die. I want to die. I want to die. Currently, however, I have enough people around me to make me feel too guilty to seriously consider suicide. However, I think that it is very possible that, once I am without the immediate pressure of family and friends, that I may do it. I find that this thought slips through my mind every so often: Definitely, one day, I will die by my own hands. The recipe is all here. A touch of cynicism (there's no real meaning), emotional vulnerability (actions easily affected by current emotional state), and pragmatic laziness (why deal with life's ups and downs if I could simply.. not?). Maybe not now. But for sure, one day. Actually, who knows? This may just stay as a fantasy of mine. Or an elaborate excuse for procrastination. I might as well ask a question that may could help me. What motivates you? For myself, I've realised that I work in short bursts, and quickly gain/lose motivation. If stability in death is not an option, how can I establish stable reason/motivation in life? Thanks for reading."
369,vulnerability,offmychest,"promiscuity and the misunderstood, ubiquitous pain trigger",0,b0l0vy,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/b0l0vy/promiscuity_and_the_misunderstood_ubiquitous_pain/,2019-03-13 22:45:23,"**super tl;dr** Guys feel pain when they think about their (prospective) lover having sex for evolutionary reasons. Women don't feel that same pain. Guys are often told to 'grow up' and other variants of unwarranted and cruel condemnation. This poor treatment is instrumental in the birth of misogyny and should be understood. **tl;dr** I think most people (guys included) don't understand that men feel a pain trigger whenever they think of their (prospective) lovers either receiving or giving sexual pleasure. This is because, when considering evolution, it is clear that men who felt this pain intensely were more likely to reproduce but that same adaption was never helpful for women's reproduction. Because of that misunderstanding, men are often condemned when they should be helped as people claim that ""its their problem/their just being insecure and need to grow up and get over it"". It breeds misogyny. Its bad all around. You need to put misogyny in its place when they spread it online but, otherwise, try to be compassionate. **Because the pain trigger is so effective, people are probably going to use it a lot and call me a ""sexless loser"" for posting this.** I don't even know why I'm typing this but hello everyone. You know how in some eras something is horribly awry but its just kind of normal so people go along with it like slavery, racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. I want to preface this by saying that I don't think people engaging in promiscuity are necessarily bad people at all. I just think they don't understand the pain they cause. &amp;#x200B; There's a clear gender divide along this issue, but please don't turn this into something it doesn't have to be. **There are good men and women**. I'm a man. I'll never experience things like menstrual cramps, periods, or childbirth. I can have an idea but I'm limited to that. One thing that is uniquely experienced by men is an instinctive painful reaction to their lover experiencing or giving sexual pleasure. Women will, of course, experience pain as well but not in that way. They will potentially feel: anxiety (what if she's better), betrayal (how could he abuse my trust), low self worth (I know I'm enough, but why do I feel like I'm not); these feelings will also be experienced by men. &amp;#x200B; **I'm not talking about those**. That's not to say that they're invalid. Of course they're valid, and its awful for anyone to be put through that. Those are sophisticated in that they are derived from thoughts, but there is also a primal pain that is felt with no thought just as though one puts one's hand on a hot stove, and it is only experienced by men to a large extent. It comes from the reality that, from an evolutionary perspective, if a man saw his lover be pleasured by or give pleasure to another man, it might mean that she got pregnant and the kid wasn't his, so the men who felt more pain at that thought were more likely to reproduce with their lovers if they weren't the ""sharing"" type. It's the same reason we feel pain if we poke out our eyes; it's either to help us to survive, reproduce, or both. If the analogous situation happened but with two women and one guy, they'd both be, potentially, pregnant half an hour later and there is no evolutionary incentive for a woman to develop that instinctive **ubiquitous painful trigger**. The trouble is that we don't care about what our genes want. We wish that we didn't ever have to feel that pain because, obviously, we don't care about ensuring our genes are passed on. We just want to love and be loved. &amp;#x200B; **People intuitively understand this on the tip of their tongues, but they don't know the specific details.** That's why an effective way to insult a guy is to talk about how he's sexless or how you're going to have sex with his lover, but these insults are never used against women. It's not an effective way to tear them apart and humiliate them like it is for guys. Undoubtedly, if anyone responds to this, that's what they're going to say to me, and it's going to hurt me, and that's part of the reason why many guys stay quiet about this. &amp;#x200B; **It gets worse.** No one seems to understand this instinctive pain that only men feel with regards to this aspect of sex. The men that cordially confide in others about it are, therefore, assumed to be insecure and need to work on themselves. They are often faced with condemnation and being told to ""grow up"" for feeling this pain that they can do nothing about and never asked for. &amp;#x200B; **It gets worse.** Society actively encourages promiscuity whether it be on internet giants like: Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, or Reddit. Society actively encourages behaviour that increases the chance that a man's lover who he will love dearly and will be loved by dearly will have had a sexual past. It probably will hurt him, and many people (not everyone) will just tell him its his problem that he needs to work on it alone and never ask his partner for help and that he needs to ""grow up"". They don't know any better. They step on a land mine; his arm gets blown off. These men are betrayed by their society in this facet, but society didn't mean to betray them. **Please don't become hateful. There are those who care about you even if it feels like there aren't.** &amp;#x200B; **It gets worse.** Sometimes they do become hateful. Sometimes they fall into the dens of despair and misogyny that are online loneliness forums with no professional moderation. No one would guess it, but these things do have a very strange type of appeal, even for those who aren't misogynistic at all. The unsuspecting wanderer will enter this den and realise that these people are absolutely fixated on appearance. Just about everyone is at least a bit insecure about how they look. It's a critical vulnerability in this scenario. When people are positive about our appearance, we may sometimes worry that they're just saying it to make us, them, or both feel good in the moment but may not be what they actually think. That's why when the people on these online loneliness forums are absolutely brutal with regards to appearance; it artificially creates a sense of honesty, making the unsuspecting wanderer crave the knowledge of what ""society might *really* think of him."" Furthermore, for guys in particular, there's a strange sense of comfort and draw that they feel that they don't understand at first, but its not the misogyny. It all comes back to the **ubiquitous pain trigger**; the wanderer sees these people in this community as unlikely to ever have sex with his future partner or even encourage others to do so. Furthermore, the unsuspecting wanderer is very new to this and is quick to focus on the comments that aren't misogynistic. He subconsciously chooses to focus on the ones that are just expressing their sadness; some of which, he can relate to. The wanderer is also quick to assume that those expressing rage are simply *venting*, which is, at times, true, but not as much as such a wanderer may think. Many people don't know why or how vehement misogyny can actually come to exist. Some wanderers are certain that it's all venting and no one is serious, but that's not the case for very long. The nature of the heart wrenching, emotional story telling in this den of misogyny starts to shift the wanderers mental state. **Statistics never stand a chance against repeated, emotional story telling** as far as persuasion is concerned. The wanderer slowly becomes more and more misogynistic, assisted by the lack of support and, even, condemnation from his society. Any statistics proposed to the misogynist will be attacked either on the basis of its authority, methodology, or even the honesty of the statistician. The misogynist always has a reason prepared for any statistic; they don't affect the misogynist whatsoever. If a source shows that women actually have varied taste in men's appearance, the misogynist will assume that the woman is lying to herself to make herself feel better, and he will insist that she only finds a very specific conventional type of male appearance to be attractive, and bring up the **ubiquitous pain trigger** by claiming that those very same women would only want to have sex with those men, contrary to what they claim. I will repeat myself. **Statistics never stand a chance against repeated, emotional story telling**. **It gets much, much, much worse.** Remember how these men were often met with condemnation when *cordially* confiding in others? By this point, when some of these men have become full-blown misogynists, they are **absolutely torn apart**. That **ubiquitous pain trigger** becomes their name tag and they are constantly berated and shamed in ways that have evolved to be very painful for them. I shame them too when they spread misogyny. I hate doing it. I really really hate doing it. They already have to suffer so much, but I can't just let them raise crime rates and risk my loved ones getting hurt. I have an obligation to prevent that as we all do. **Please just stop posting. Please just get off the online loneliness forums. Please just contact someone in person who will understand your pain and treat it with the compassion and understanding it deserves** rather than the condemnation from those who don't know any better. We have to berate misogynists when they spread misogyny, but if all they're doing is lying down and crying, then have some humanity and just **fucking stop**. If nothing else, do it for the sake of peace in society. The people who deserve compassion and help the least need it the most. An important thing to consider in this discussion, of course, **is the perspective of women**. Please try to understand modern conventions for female beauty are plagued by Instagram, anorexia fashion, and plastic surgery. It's increasingly easy for a normal girl to feel unattractive during middle school and high school. They are often bullied by dumb guys and starving girls. Those can be quite cruel in how they collaborate to take down normal, happy girls. The typical strategy is for the starving, skimpily-dressed popular girl to wrap dumb guys around her fingers and use them as weapons against any girl she sees fit as some kind of absolutely cruel power trip. Receiving this kind of bullying experience is not uncommon for girls in high school and middle school, and it can make some of them pretty pessimistic as far as love goes from a formative age. This is especially the case when you consider the modern era's general pessimism on the idea of true love and romance. They don't mean to hurt anyone. They never meant to press anyone's painful trigger buttons, though they often do. Many women, if they learned about why you feel the way you do, would act with a high degree of compassion that you might find surprising after all this jaded behaviour in society. We're all just people who want to love and be loved. &amp;#x200B; I want to end this on a positive note. You may have read enough negative stories. I'd like to tell a positive one right now for any men who this may have resonated with at any point. Imagine that you're married (maybe you already are) and your lover who you love infinitely and who loves you infinitely expresses sincere regret that she's had sexual interactions with other men prior to meeting you considering how much it hurts you. There's nothing wrong with preferring a virgin when searching for a partner; there's nothing wrong with being relatively upfront with that preference either so long as its done respectfully, but we don't always have full control over who we fall in love with. Now that I've typed all this out, the inevitable response is for me to berated as some ""loser"" using many mentions of the ubiquitous pain trigger, but this is something that I feel I have to do. Have a nice day everyone. &amp;#x200B;"

He was so full of sweetness and tenderness and vulnerability with me. We used to shower together. We took turns soaping each other up and washing each other's hair. He gave me shoulder massages and I cleaned his chest hair until it was soft. Sometimes we would dive into the bed and have sex afterwards and other times we would just cuddle. Nearly every night, he would fall asleep with his face pressed against my chest. Sometimes he would say, ""I can't wait for the day we make the promise that I can fall asleep next to you every night of my life."" He would imagine a scenario where we'd have a little house together and he would tend to our garden and fruit trees and make delicious meals with them for me. It was just playful and loving with him. We could make so much entertainment out of playing Scrabble with lots of curse words, or buying cheap seats at the empty theater and making MST3K-style comments on outdated releases. We could play Marco Polo in a hotel pool like little kids. He even let me carry him around bridal style in the water. I can't forget the way he would get quiet as I was working on an art project while talking to him. I would turn to see what's up and he'd be gazing lovingly at me. I'd say, ""What's up?"" and he'd say, ""nothing, just admiring the beautiful art. Oh, and the painting's alright too."" Or we'd go about our day and he would say, ""Guess what?"" I'd say ""What?"" And he'd give a drawn out ""I loooooove youuuuuuu"". He would kiss my hand as if I was a queen. I would kiss his neck and watch him blush. He would say, ""You're so gentle that it all feels good. Please do what you want with me."" I feel so alone now and I miss him. I miss both our deep love and easygoing friendship. I miss touching him and being touched by him. I can't bring myself to have sex with someone else, not yet. I feel like I was spoiled by him and I'm scared of whether what comes next could be like that. I am scared to try again with someone I love don't love deeply in the same way. I don't know if I will have a chance for something that special again. But it wouldn't be fair to try to take him back, because then I would put him through heartbreak a second time when it inevitably did not work out again. I don't want to hurt him. The first time was already bad enough. All I can do is be grateful for the time I had with him and hope that the next girl he's with cherishes him for all he is worth. In the meantime, I'm far away in a different state and city, working 60 hour weeks so I don't have time to feel the full weight of how alone I am. I want to hold him again but I know that I can't and it wouldn't be right, even if I could. I know there's a future with someone else at some point. I'm just not there yet and I don't know when I will be. "

Well the other night things got heated (for lack of a better word) and we sent some dirty messages for a couple of days. Ive come clean and the friend is making it seem like it isnt a huge deal, theyre friendship will likely survive this whereas our relationship will definitely not. Im losing the best thing thats ever happened to me over a moment of vulnerability and weakness... I know I deserve everything Im getting. I broke her heart. "
372,vulnerability,offmychest,I'm angry I can't be angry,2,b1hylr,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/b1hylr/im_angry_i_cant_be_angry/,2019-03-16 04:52:53,"Disclaimer: this is somewhat like a rant, but I appreciate any comments. TLDR; feels trapped, don't know who to talk to or when I'll be untrapped. I've fell into depression in highschool and since that incident I found it hard to trust people naturally again. When I told the people I trusted about my mental illness, I was stigmatized and rejected. I am now in my mid-20s, and still currently in university (no shame to that). I still feel trapped in so many levels that I don't know who I can open up to. With my currentgroup of friends, I'm not sure if they'll understand me at all. Firstly level of entrapment: my mix of social interest. I somewhat like a nerd, I love my books, my games, my knowledge. Yet, I like to balance it out with non scholarly things, like tv shows and going for drinks and gossiping. This sounds like every other person, so why do I feel trapped? Because I don't have enough knowledge of either side to talk much about it. I've met people much smarter and know more geek culture than I and I don't fit. On the other hand, I don't fit in with people who goes clubbing, drinking, or traveling because I don't have much exposure to that. I'm stuck in the middle. My years of depression also prevented from exploring these areas that most other people had, and had friends to do activities with. I was alone for most of the time, denied opportunities to socialize...as I had no one around. Second level of entrapment: my sexuality and view on romance. I like to think that I am not the only one who feels this. Firstly I am bisexual, and I am still not confident in disclosing my sexuality to my family nor most of my friends. Like stated earlier, it's hard for me to trust. Secondly, given my age, there are others around my age that prefer hooking up and casual relationships than committed ones. My attraction is leaning towards other males currently...but my interaction with other men has been abysmal. While I am not an Instagram model, I get compliments on my appearance time to time - yet deep down I rather be complimented for my personality and knowledge (a nerd, I know). Yet those who do appreciate my knowledge, themselves are oftentimes the ones that judges or condescend. My search for love has been mostly online and I feel lost in trying to meet people in person. On the other hand, some might suggest that I indulge in this hookup culture or date women instead. Sadly, I am not the most well endowed and feel that may ultimately break any relationship. Third level of entrapment: my path in life. This I believe is common to everyone. I have completed a 2 year diploma and have returned to school again for a 4 year bachelor. I had plan to do a master, which would take up another 2-3 years. In total, this would be 8-9 years of additional education on-top of my elementary/secondary school years. While I love knowledge, I also love to live a life. My years in school reduces my income, my freedom, and my free time. I am trapped because I want to work, to have time to spend with friends, to go travel and experience the world. Yet I am not certain I'll be satisfied with my career if I don't try to obtain, but how much do I want to try? How happy can I truly be working in a job not of my interest? These levels of entrapment makes me feel angry yet I cannot be. I have no one to blame, sure I could blame society, and other people, and other things. But putting blame on others will not solve my own problems. I feel I'm dealt a bad hand in life or that I made a mistake that destroy my life, yet there's no rewind in life to fix that. I want to be hopeful of the future, but subconsciously feel these life traps does not make me the best me. I don't even know what to be angry at. What more, I'm afraid of showing my vulnerability, my angry, and my fears. I am afraid I'll neglected by the people I care about - and that hurts more than everything above combined. "
373,vulnerability,offmychest,An observation during my lecture:,5,b1lsms,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/b1lsms/an_observation_during_my_lecture/,2019-03-16 10:32:29," She spoke for a moment. I had a thought after watching her speak. She went on a tangent about her mother dying of cancer, she let her guard down for a moment. We live in a place and time where we have walls up constantly. We rarely reveal our truest selves to people intentionally. People are guarded, they build walls to keep the empathetic eyes of those around them out. But there are moments when, in our world of dispersed connection, we allow our icy walls to collapse; we allow the light to be seen by others. She allowed this for a whisper of a moment. Before she built up her tower of Babel again, the depth of her humanity was evident to each person in the room. We experienced the essence of her life; her effervescent soul, the same essence in all of us. Her life force reached out and spoke truth so beautifully that for an instant each person was open with her; suspended in stillness. But the realization of her vulnerability drew her back to the ground and the moment was gone. Each person in the room mourned, they subconsciously mourned the brevity of the moment. We crave and search for these moments, the moments of understanding and seeing the humanity in everyone. Why is it so hard to be open "

The idea of growing old with someone inevitably fills me with the fear that they would leave me for someone younger and prettier (30f here). I think Ive always been terrified of vulnerability since I was young, though my parents are still married and love each other. I want companionship but feel like I need to learn to not want it in order to be in a place where it can happen... Ive been in therapy, and am working on myself. Was in a 7 year relationship that was loving, but I did feel alone even in that relationship most of the time. The ending was partially due to an emotional long term affair on his side with a mutual best friend... but Ive been terrified of being vulnerable enough with a guy and being cheated on before that... sometimes I feel broken and like Ill never figure this relationship thing out. I want kids I think... but then I think of the distance I feel emotionally between myself and my own parents, and am scared that my partner would leave me after since it would fuck up my body. I guess I am just coming to terms with the fact that I am haunted by a very scary and pessimistic view of relationships and Im trying to learn to repair that. And books youd recommend? Things that have helped you if youve been in the same place?"
375,vulnerability,offmychest,I was wrong and it was my insecurities that permanently damaged a relationship,1,b2fcy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/b2fcy6/i_was_wrong_and_it_was_my_insecurities_that/,2019-03-18 17:40:43,"My low self esteem absolutely ruined what I perceived to be a significant relationship with someone I cared about. Looked through messages from years ago between an ex and me and the conversations were different than I remembered. My immature attitude and extremely attached personality weakened opportunities to genuinely bond. We started dating after I sent her a picture cutting myself to appeal to her own issues she was going through. She never cheated on me yet I always felt threatened by other guys shed talk to. She was my high school crush and a voice always told me how did I get to date this girl as if I wasnt enough despite us already being together for months. The support I gave her throughout suicidal and depressive episodes didnt continue throughout her good days where it arguably mattered more to create an even stronger bond. I over analyzed everything about her knowing the exact amount of time it took for her to walk to her house from the bus stop, the micro facial expressions shed make according to various types of smiles which gave a clue as to what she was smiling about, researching new subjects shed bring up in texts to always have something to reply with even if I had no clue what she was on about at first. Its scary and unhealthy. The day before breaking up I logged onto her Facebook without her knowledge and saw her talking to guys I told her not to talk with which explained why she wasnt as responsive that day. I went off on her but deleted everything on her end before she noticed and only saw one sentence I left which was enough to end the relationship. My insecurities led to this yet I always blamed her for ruining the relationship. She said that she was afraid to break up with me out of fear of killing myself or someone else and I didnt understand what she meant until now. Going through old pictures its clear that she isnt as happy as she is now. She said I made her feel vulnerable and I was unsure what to make of it but it makes sense that your partner should feel confident and secure around you. I took her vulnerability to be emotional as in letting her guard down around me out of trust but Im not sure about that. Its been years and Im ashamed but glad to notice this now."

Most people have no idea when meeting me. I am physically fit, I do not back down from meaningful disagreement, and I know how and when to speak with confidence. I have many female friends and do not have the stereotypical nervousness when talking to attractive women. There are many areas in life where I am confident, and I understand the utility of projecting that confidence when I'm meeting new people. Even so, I have had my share of bouts of depression that I got very good at hiding. I know it is depression because after years of thinking ""This happens to everyone"" I went to the necessary professionals after a nasty bout and was diagnosed. I have used porn, alcohol and exercise to cope with my problems when I don't feel there's anyone I can talk to. I made a post like this once before when I was drunk and deleted it immediately upon sobering up because I hated the feeling of vulnerability. I have ruined functional relationships because of my use of alcohol, and am trying to be proactive about tackling my issues without the crutch. I have been trying to quit drinking, and here I find myself dealing with some very familiar feelings behind closed doors. I have never felt like an attractive man, and part of me has the (not uncommon) feeling that I'm not worth loving or that there's something fundamentally wrong with me. Posts like these are not rare. I know that things will happen when/if they happen, and I sincerely believe that the pressure on young men to have sex by almost any means necessary does a significant degree of damage. Before the word gets thrown out, I'm not some incel. No one in life owes you anything, and no woman owes someone time or affection. I am here largely because of my unwillingness to be vulnerable or tackle my problems without drinking or shutting people off, and I'd like practical advice I can use to move past this. On a mental level, I understand that these things should be allowed to happen organically, preferably with someone I care for, but knowing that does nothing to ease the insecurity. At the end of the day, I will still have spent time sitting here crying frustrated man tears."

I think Ive missed lots of things and omitted many details, but hopefully I can capture the skeleton of what I want to say. Firstly, let me being by saying that I fully accept responsibility for my actions and the situations I have created in the past. I do not intend for this post to be a cry for sympathy; rather I want to share my life experience. I am not a misogynist or hateful in anyway. I do not view women as objects or something to be conquered. Nor did I chase girls 24/7, I spent a lot of time working on myself and becoming better, while \--- BACKGROUND --- Growing up I didnt have many friends. My self esteem and self confidence were low to mediocre at best, and socially it was terrible. I was bullied as a kid. I avoided my father - he was never around much as a a kid/teen and when he was, he was unpleasant to be around. He was always loving and providing, but did very little for me emotionally. I've always been quite detached.Even by the time I was 17 I would sometimes hangout in the bathroom during breaks, or in the library; just to avoid people. I never even hugged a girl til I was 18. I did have a few friends at high school who genuinely liked me, but I could not cling around them all the time. By the time I was 18, it had been deeply ingrained in my subconscious. Seeing all the people having fun with other people being invited to parties being invited to do things things to do in the weekend that involved leaving the house guys who commanded respect and actually smooth with the girls None of this had ever been present in the slightest in my life. Meanwhile I was the weird, awkward, seedy guy. I was never told to my face, but I heard people talk about me in that way. Between ages of 16-18 roughly I had a major life changing event. Exactly what is irrelevant, but one day everything dissipated and I began to realise that I had full control of my life. I could change things. Make anything happen. My entire life up until the point I felt like I had very limited control of my life. Having saved up about 15k USD during high school (I am from New Zealand btw, not USA), I went to Europe for 5 months during a gap year. I got laid for the first few times in Europe. When I came back I made it my mission to do all the things I wasnt confident to go for in the last years. Going to dance classes. Working out and becoming athletic. Pushing my limits x 100. Being sociable. Getting good with girls. \--- TRYING TO BECOME ABUNDANT --- When I came back to NZ end of 2014 I started lifting weights first week back (I had previously lifted weights for about 3 months in the past, but I had to stop due to illness). I started university. I had massive doubts. I didnt know how to meet girls either. My one smooth friend had moved to another city. My other friend had no interest in pursuing girls. My last friend was simply busy 24/7 and quite ambitious. While I was travelling I felt like I had super powers, now I was back in a mediocre reality. == 2015 == So I picked up dance classes. Started lifting weights at home. Went to social events. Finally university started a couple months later and I had my shot for success. Although, there arent many girls in Math and Computer Science classes I tried meeting girls at Salsa dance but didnt have much success. No-one really wanted to hang out with me. Before I go any further, no I did not specifically go to dance class to meet girls  I had always loved moving around and was quite interested in dancing for a long time I also joined the university choir in second trimester. I wanted to join other clubs and do more things, but dancing a couple times a week, lifting seriously, singing once a week and studying had been requiring more effort out of me than I had ever put in life. Constantly tired. I was getting no where with girls. I tried being friendly and sociable on campus, but I just seemed to repel guys and girls everywhere I went. Being friendly did fuck all for me, so I decided to take an aggressive approach. So I started constantly cold approaching strange girls on campus. For the first few months I was incredibly hesistant and nervous. Even if I had approached 5 girls yesterday, today it was still a terrifying new experience. Id say and do funny shit. Try to get to know them. Try to lead the conversation. Tell them something cool about myself. I was constantly blown out, ignored, or girls showed no interest. So I started to analyse things I was doing. Focused on being more confident. Constantly tried to revise my posture. Constantly try to develop a better, more masculine and commanding tonality. Id get better and better responses here and there and it was SLOWLY but surely working. Id get a few numbers here and there but not with girls I really, really liked. And theyd never text back. So I kept at it. Months had passed with no success. I kept trying. Summer came around and I just messed around at home playing guitar, dancing, lifting and approaching backpackers on the waterfront I did not have the discipline or work ethic to get a job over the summer, I definitely should have done this looking back. I tried going out to clubs and bars. I had no-one to go with. I tried going out alone. I would drive into the city, sit in my car first for 20 minutes getting major anxiety, trembling and nervous. Trying to build up confidence. I almost crashed my car one time from nerves. I didnt drink when I went out, I had no reason to be at the clubs. I had no friends to go out with either. I become comfortable-ish approaching girls on campus, and occasionally Id do it in on the street or somewhere relaxed. But to go out at night alone? Especially in an environment I detest. Drove me FUCKING NUTS! I would walk around for an hour doing laps of the city, then go into a club for 10 minutes, nervously try to start a conversation then run out when it didnt go anywhere. I tried being just social as well. I was still trembling and a nervous wreck. I could squat 300 pounds or deadlift 400 pounds but going out still crushed me. Id try go out two nights in a row, but then I would not go out again for months. The cycle would repeat. And Id feel like shit staying at home knowing I was cheating myself by missing out on opportunities to grow, but I rationalised it that I was doing lots in life, more than I ever had, so I could give myself a break. == 2016 == 2016, I joined a public gym. I started going to the university campus as well. I had seen 2 girls over the summer, each only about 3-4 dates, and they both ended up absolutely detesting me. I didnt know how to be caring and vulnerable. I probably had another few hook ups, dont remember exactly. I was really grateful but hungry af. I kept approaching girls. Some months Id improve other months Id suck. I hated sucking so badly, and I hated not winning. I didnt know what to do. I started constantly analysing my conversations with people. I started writing down my approaches each day and how I interacted with girls and what I could to do improve and what I did well, etc. This sounds a little crazy, but that was all I felt like I could do. I kept going to choir, danced  not as much though, lifted weights, loved half of my degree  one major  and hated the other half  the other major. I was consistently getting numbers from girls. I probably got about 200-250 phone numbers of the course of 2016. I probably ended up meeting up one girl a week during this year. So about 1 in 5 of those numbers converted.. A lot of meet-ups were just on campus. Some were out in the CBD. Out of maybe 50 dates this year, 45-48 of these girls did not want to see me a second time. Even if I hooked up with them. Most of them just ghosted me when I tried texting them again or gave texted back saying they werent interested. I felt crushed. Id feel great and excited that I was meeting a girl, or that I had a great conversation with a girl and she agreed to meet up with me. And then Id feel frustrated when she ghosted, flaked, or did not see me again. Before we continue, maybe you guys think its crazy that I am statistical and numerical about this! Ive always been incredibly calculating, Ill literally calculate how much money I make a minute to decide which caf is the most efficient to go to based on prices, considering the time to and cost of getting there, what time it is and how likely there is to be a line. Sometimes anyway haha. Counting approaches, numbers and dates was never a big deal lol. I constantly worked on improving myself. Developing leadership qualities. Developing work ethic. Humour. Vulnerability. An air of unpredictability and excitement. Accepting and owning my sexuality (which in itself took 1-2 years to settle in). Why was I so obsessed with succeeding with women? I was constantly horny. Massively sexually frustrated. I would be itching for sex. So badly. And it was not happening. I had a bunch of one night stands from March to December 2016, having sex maybe once a month. I didnt make any friends over all of 2016 either, despite having put effort it. I decided to stop caring about making friends and just focus on hobbies, study and girls. == 2017 == End of 2016/Start of 2017. I dated a girl for 3 months and had my first fuck buddy as well. I was so happy. I didnt even like my fuck buddy much, she was cute and adorable but the sex was not good. I ended the dating with the girl because it was clear we were not going to be able to click any longer. I was really grateful for these experiences. I tried hitting night clubs and bars again. If I could stay out for 4 hours and have one or two 5 minute chats, Id feel really accomplished. The rest of the time was spent anxiously walking up and down the street, trying to approach girls on the street instead of inside a club, more trembling and frustration. In 2017 the sexual frustration kicked in massively. 2017 was a massive psychological nightmare. You are warned. I have an insane libido, most men just dont get it. Masturbating made me feel like shit so I stopped. Have you guys ever gone 30 days without ejaculating? Well some days I literally couldnt sleep. Id feel like fire in the evenings. Id sweat and keep twisting and turning. Lay in bed for hours. So Id get up and do something. Id have a cold shower for 20 minutes then read a book. Id go to the gym at 4am to try and calm myself down. Id stay up for 20, 24 even 28 hours on the regular because I was simply too horny too sleep. Many sleepless nights I asked some friends and some guys I could talk to how they deal with not getting laid. Most said they, dont care, it doesnt matter or it comes when it comes. My body decided this was not the case! Id go to the library and try to study. But turn my neck to the entrance every 2 minutes to see who was walking in or out. I tried controlling myself but couldnt. Id go to the library, try to study for hours, approach a few girls, and get maybe 10 minutes of work in. After hours of this, Id decide maybe studying right now wasnt such a good idea so Id go for a walk, lift, etc and then come back around 10pm or even midnight. Then Id sit on campus til 4am everyday. I was able to focus a little better but I was still angst. This went on day after day for months. The sexual tension inside me was crazy. Id try to breathe in and keep my shit together but I often couldnt. I meditated for about 4-5 months but this did nothing for me. I was so tense. I would wake up and start crying sometimes. Id drive to university, crying. Id go for a walk and cry. Id cry myself to sleep sometimes. I could cry for an hour straight and keep punching my bed. I think I only cried in public once btw. Id often try go to the gym and calm myself down, that would sedate my body a little but not my mind. Id literally lift weights til I was on the verge of passing out. I started to get compliments on my work ethic as a little side note, I was the craziest motherfucker in my gym (it is not really a chain gym, more of a niche strength based gym) When I wasnt crying, Id get very angry. I couldnt control my anger. Most of the time when I looked at people, I just wanted to rip their heads off. Id feel very violent and constantly wanted to be in a fight. I never did this though, thats stupid as fuck. But Id constantly practice shadow boxing when I was alone, in case I found myself in a fight. Id throw massive rages (never in public). I tried slapping myself repeatedly to discipline myself and be more respectful. Id start most of my days by slapping myself in the face a dozen times. Sometimes it would leave marks. Driving to university or to the gym, I would yell at myself for a solid 15 minutes in the car. Many times my voice was very strained or painful for many days. I kept approaching girls and avoided studying before 10pm. Id get home and just go to my room and try to avoid my family. My mother would follow me in my room and Id tell her to leave me alone This pattern repeated for at least 6 months. I avoided spending much time with family at all for most of 2016,2017 and even 2018. I was constantly pacing around, biting my lips, scratching myself. So tense. I was so undersexed, I started fantasising about fucking dudes. That was in the back of my mind for a long time and I questioned whether I was bisexual. I hooked up with a ladyboy once, sucked her dick and decided, yeah nah. That alleviated that from me. My mum would demand what was wrong and Id cry or yell in tension. Then shed try talking to me when I didnt wanna talk and I couldnt contain my fit so then she would now witness my fit, instead of being alone in my emotional af times. Then she started to resent me and get stressed out being around me all the time. I couldnt control my narcicisstic nature. My mum began to hate me! I probably threw about 50-60 of these crying and rage tantrums in 2017, and maybe 10-15 in 2016. Probably another 3-4 in 2018 too. My family intervened and talked to me multiple times and finally I managed to get a bit of a grasp of myself, so as to be less destructive to my family. I was still quite destructive and sex obsessed towards the end of 2017, but it wasnt as bad as before. Later, at one point in 2018, my brother actively ignored me for 2-3 months and didnt say a word to me despite living in the same house. I probably managed to have another 50 or so dates this year. There were dry spells of 2-4 months. I developed lots of confidence over 2017 despite my psychological nightmare. This is all just from being unbearably horny and the pain of failing and rejection I went to a university counsellor and I did not see any benefit in it. I was asking my family and friends for help, to which they told me just relax, yet I was incapable. Keep in mind, I wasnt brutally violent and angry every hour of every day, but Id say at least 70-75% of my waking hours were like this. 3 years had passed since I set on this journey, I had kind of made a new friend, but I wasnt overly close with him. I had approached easily a thousand girls, and I had no female friends, no lovers and honestly, no network. Regardless of what I did I was just a social fuck-up. I still felt good about myself. I was learning lots, I had developed an affection for reading books, I enjoyed dancing or playing guitar, I was getting strong as fuck in the gym and constantly living outside of my comfort zone . I didnt just want sex. I wanted to share myself with others. I wanted to be part of other peoples live. Of coursed I wanted sex, my biology was demanding it, but that was not everything. Im human, I want relationships too  And it was never about try 1000 times because 1 will say yes approach. I wanted to be able to consistently attract women into my life, not bat 1 in 1000. I wanted the skills and persona to be truly successful. I wanted to refine my approach and develop my social skills to a high enough level to succeed. Whether or not my approach was the best; I was merely doing the best I could based on my life experience and perspective. And I wouldnt just date anyone. I wanted truly amazing women that are not-average-in-anyway in my life. Sure, I do admit Im open to having fun with girls that dont fit that high criteria, but theres only so much time I could spend with them. Anyway, you dont get away with approaching that many girls without getting labelled. The only reason I approached so many girls and kept trying, was because I failed. I had lots of other shit in my life going on, so I didnt feel like a loser for trying over and over. I was just persistent. Learning and improving. Failing better. Had I met an attractive girl and formed a relationship early on, or had I been successful at attracting at girls, I wouldnt have put so much effort into it. Maybe you guys will say, had I not put so much effort into it, I would do better. Well, I also didnt try at times. When I didnt try I might do well for a little while, but I would not improve. And then not trying would get me nowhere at all. And trying way too hard would get me nowhere either. Some guys tried to call me out and persuade me to stop being so creepy bro, trying too hard, being annoying. I disagreed with them all. Im sure I had made some girls feel uncomfortable, but I was only trying to better myself so that I could be more graceful. In my reality, I wasnt trying too hard. I was being persistent. I wasnt creepy. I was learning. Maybe I missed some social cues. I must have. But I was only doing my best. I remember one day I sat down at a Maths revision group and literally everyone at my table had something negative to say about me. They didnt hold it against me too harshly though. I got girls calling me out for re-approaching them. Some girls I had approached 3 or 4 times with no recollection over the years. One girl I approached about 4 times on campus between 2015-16. I developed quite a bit of a rep, although I only heard about it from acquaintances/ peers. I was totally uncalibrated to live in this world haha Even when I went out into the city, I constantly had women telling me I had approached them not too long ago. I was still getting many flakes. I probably had another 50 dates in 2017 and 45-48 didnt want to see me again. There you go. It crushed my soul at times. People would tell me I look nice, Im confident as fuck and Im quite interesting; but still Id have no success. No game. No friends. I had many girls refusing to dance with me at salsa. I asked one about a year later and she gave me some explanation about my being too rough with my leading! I wish I had asked a few more how exactly to improve conducting myself I was meant to finish university end of 17 but I failed my last paper, only paper I had failed. So I had to wait another 6-8 months to graduate. I started delivering food for money as it was time to get a job now that study was practically over. == 2018 == .. Starting to win??  Again I had many sleep less nights in early 2018. I started playing guitar everyday, pushing myself to do 4 hours. I developed a killer work ethic and discipline. I later dropped playing guitar to try work more, but that didnt totally work out. I tried sleeping less to be able to sedate myself a little more. Other days Id literally be on my toes bouncing around for 18-20 hours a day non stop. I talked about it with a doctor once. He said I should find a nymphomaniac. Great advice, thanks =.= I started going out to night clubs At least 1-2 times a month early in the year. Then I started going every Friday and Saturday towards the end of 2018. I hated it to the bone and would sometimes come home, cry and punch the bed out of frustration. Then Id sit down and write a report of my night and see how I could improve. Eventually I got used to it. 3 years into my journey and I was finally making friends this year. I had a handfull close mates to go out with sometimes now. I had a bit of fun at times, but even they moved to other cities and had shit to do. A few of the friendships I had to end, and a few are still existent. Again, I ended up going out alone night after night in the weekends. I started to get laid quite regularly over 2018. Sometimes I had 3-4 girls on call at a time and I was relatively satisfied. Although I did not like any of these girls beyond a casual hang out or sex. And I knew I could get hotter girls. Not for validation, but because I deserve a very attract female who satisfies my desire for visually appealing attributes. I tried focusing on meeting higher quality girls, only the very hot ones and the ones Id click with the most. I did meet a few really sexy girls, and they were responding positively to me. Wow, this was a dream coming true. Most of these really sexy amazing girls ghosted me too, but then I had a date with this reallllly amazing girl that I cold stopped on the street. I was a little intimidated. I brought her home  we did not have sex - and I wanted to see her again. I sent her some texts to meet up and sound cool/smooth and it backfired. Then I texted her and told her I had a friend helping me text girls cause I was sucking so badly for a long time. And she hated it. Still saw me again, two more times, and I made more fuck-ups. After 3 hangouts I never saw her again. But I was glad af knowing I could attract quality women, even if it might take a bit of work to get it to be consistent. I met another girl later in the year. Perfect 10. Very fit, bikini model physique, amazing personality. I was not intimidated this time. I brought her home, we slept together, and I loved the chemistry. I saw her one more time before I went overseas for a few weeks  she also went travelling for 2 months I hadnt seen her in 3 months. 2019 I sent her texts and we were meant to meet up, I bailed, tried to reschedule; I got impatient that she didnt text back for 5 days and then I also errmm. Made her hate me too. Fuck. The first time in my life at 23 I had an amazingly attractive girl with legitimate mutual chemistry I fucked it up. I was really pissed off You do not get through 3 years of consistent shitty results and let it go easily. I had spent tcountless hours approaching, hesitating, analysing, texting, analysing texts, going on dates, watch videos about interacting with women, reading articles about improving your game and understanding women better, getting better photos for tinder And not too mention all the headaches I endured, the familial relationships I had damaged, the tightness in my chest I had experience and the hours I had spent anxiously looking back on things and dreaming of better So many hours And lets not forget all the effort I put into improving myself as a human being, hobbies, work, understanding people in general and developing all kinds of characteristics. I went on a dating bootcamp for 2 weeks where we lived together and breathed pick-up. It cost about 5k USD. The guys who ran it were tremendously successful with their sex and dating lives. Success youd except from a male model or actor. They gave us advice. I remember on the bootcamp I was talking to a really attractive girl. And she was all over me. Kept trying to kiss me and I kept pushing her away. Jesus, is this what it feels like to be abundant!? And I actually really liked her! I had decent improvements on the 2 week program, with crazy results in just 7 days. I had the most insane work ethic and focus in my entire life But lets face it You get back home and you dont have anyone guiding and reassuring you constantly. I dealt with some emotional blockages when I got home. I was infatuated with some middle aged lady from the dancing. I had a shitty job, driving passengers now. I had no friends who were smooth-ish and wanted to go out. I helped a few buddies get dates and get laid but Im no god. 2019 roles over Now Ive gotten back into study, learning more about computers in hopes of getting a job in web development in the next few months. Im studying most days and driving for money. I go to pole dance classes everyday cause thats something I wanted to learn for a long time. I still lift weights religiously. I want to move out of New Zealand really badly. I feel like I get along better with other cultures, plus the lifestyle and climate. I still go out every Friday and Saturday religiously I tend to go out alone. I even went out the day my poor little dog died  and I hate going out. Thats how strict I am with myself &amp;#x200B; \--- pick up tactics? --- Heres how I approach women. No lines or acts. \- Approach girls everywhere. Street. Public transport (if im actually on it, rarely). Campus. Bar. Grocery story. Mall. Beach. Wherever. \- Make a direct comment about wanting to meet them, that theyre cute, or something situational, or something that I just really wanted to talk about. \- Teasing girls. \- Banter \- Focusing on them \- Keeping the conversation emotional and less so logically based \- Dropping a few things about my lifestyle \- Dressed nicely, shave, haircut \- Be physical, but minimally so, enough to show interest and sexuality, but not enough to give away the power or kill the tension \- Focused relaxed body language, killer eye contact \- Staying even if things arent going smoothly \- In some way demonstrating that I have standards, and that a girl wont win me over effortlessly \- Locking in against an object AKA Leaning against the wall or bar instead of standing. This gives a girl more space and takes off the pressure, while also making her put more effort into leaning in. \- If I think a girl looks b\*\*\*\* or too cool for everyone at a bar, I will approach her and insist she looks very friendly and approachable. Haha. Or I will tease her much more than usual. Sometimes these really attractive girls just blow you off immediately cause they have too many (attractive and non-attractive) guys hitting them up. You have to shake their reality if this is the case. a \- Bring to light and encourage certain qualities or topics that are conducive to a sexual experience, eg sex, adventure, travelling \- Focus on moving things forward sexually first, instead of trying to be friendly and platonic \- Being honest and vulnerable \- Pushing things forward, for her to come back home with me, or meet up for coffee/drinks on another night \- Have as much fun as possible \--- final word --- Ive been having shitty success this year and Im quite frustrated at times, but Ill know Ill flip it around. And reach true sexual and dating abundance and do better than last year, which was getting quite decent. Ive been making guy friends easily recently. Its turning around. Im gonna fuckin win. Im gonna be rich, get jacked, learn a lot, grow a hell of a lot and having amazing people and lovers in my life. Im gonna fucking win even it shatters my soul and breaks my bones on the way  Im sorry for being that guy. I didnt mean to be creepy. Or to be an asshole. Im only learning. TL;DRapproached probably thousands of girls in my small city, got a bad rep, always been shit with people so I started approaching to get better interpersonal and girl skills, failed way too many times, ghosted many times, only reason I approached so many girls was to be a better person and form relationships and get laid instead of being stuck in a rut forever. Turned from shy timid boy, to relentless disciplined charismatic ambitious man. Experienced crazy psychological turmoil along the way."

Although I have little memories of my upbringings at a very, very young age, many memories come back to haunt me and make things unbearable. You see, I grew up a very overweight kid, and fhis later became obesity as I progressed in age. My father gave me sweets (which I ended up loving due to memories), my parents didn't know how to cook too well, and I essentially did not know how to diet/make a diet at a young age. However, when I was 14, and I was about to enter high school, I had lost the weight... Only to regain it again after joining the nursing program at high school. There are so many things to unpack with me, and I barely have enough friends that I trust to share it with, and my relationships with the people around me in general are very strained, so that's not an ideal combination for me, but I try to push through it. However, with each passing night for the past couple of years, especially when out of a relationship, friend group, or alone at night, I always felt like complete and utter garbage, as my mind replays events incredibly, and it continues to at this very point in time. I live my life normally like all others, wake up, attend school (about to finish high school and go to university soon), go home, go work out at the gym, play some games, shower, etc., but its always felt like a goddamn knife to the back whenever I am laying in my bed, on my phone, watching other people's lives pass by without any shred of happiness in my own. I do not know where else to go to express these emotions, as I want to try therapy in school, yet I always have these moments of vulnerability and weakness around this time, and because of my own fears of my issues, and some being too difficult to bear, I cannot list every single one in a single day. Forgive me if this post seemed to ramble on, I'll try to be more clear if I remember to check on this later."

But at the same time everything is muted. Its almost as though youre watching everything happen through the lens of a camera as though its a movie and youre just an actor who is helplessly watching whats already been recorded. Theres sounds and smells and touches that all just culminate to form the entire memory. I was eighteen when it happened. I had just turned eighteen actually. This was on October 31st 2018, just a little over two weeks after my eighteenth birthday. I was at college. The same college that I had been going too since the Spring Semester. All the people were nice, faculty members were amazing, and I never had any issue with feeling safe on campus. At least not until that night anyway. That night I went to a party with my friends. I had a Wonder Woman costume. It wasnt the skimpiest thing out there but it was very revealing and I think all that was really covered were my lady parts and part of my breasts. But I was very comfortable with my body, I knew I was good looking and I wanted to show it off. I had everything, all the bells and whistles. The sword, the gauntlets, even a fucking light up lasso of truth. That fucking lasso. The party was off campus. We and three of my friends went. My best friend, who well call Evan, my friend who well call Jane, and my other friend who well call Emily. We were all looking forward to this. It was 10pm and the party was already going by the time that our Uber arrives there with us. Music loud, drugs being sold, and everyone already drinking a fuck ton of alcohol. I never had a problem with alcohol. I could actually hold it very well, still can. And I used to drink a lot. So I dived right in. Our group eventually split off into two. Come around 12am me and my friend Jane were sitting on the sofa in the living room of the house that the party was in wondering where we could find more alcohol. There didnt seem to be any in the general vicinity. So I wondered off to find a host, one of the frat boys who lived there, to tell us where we could find the good stuff. Now I wasnt plastered, but by no means was I sober. I could walk straight and I didnt have slurred speech but there was that strange feeling where youre right about to cross that threshold from buzzed to drunk. So I was walking, poking people I had seen with drinks and asking where they got them. Eventually I came across this one guy who said he knew where they kept some beer. Awesome, right? He said it was in the fridge in the basement and that if I went down there with him he would help me get it. Now my inhibitions were successfully lowered at this point. He seemed nice enough. He was funny and he made me laugh and most importantly he knew where the alcohol was so I followed him through the door and down the stairs to the basement. My first bad feeling comes when I saw the sign that said Do Not Enter written in red sharpie and duct taped to the door but he says its fine and that he knows the guys, they wont care. Now Im looking around and the room seems mostly unfinished. The floors concrete, its all one big room, and the only thing in there is a fridge, a TV set up with some came consoles and a ragged old sofa that looked like they had pulled it out of a meth lab house. I thought cool, the beer must be in the fridge, and I began to walk over to it. Before I can get more than three feet away from him he says to me. Hey, where ya goin? I look back at him. He seems agitated and theres something off about him. I dont think much of it and offhandedly mention that the alcohol has to be in the fridge, right? Thats what he brought me down here for. He doesnt say anything else but his lips close into a thin line, and he gets an annoyed look on his face. Looking back on it I can see the twisted way in which hes reacting. His traditionally handsome face sneered behind the mask that hes wearing. I then notice his costume, hes dressed up like what appears to be one of the three musketeers. Theres a black piece of fabric with eye holes cut in it that wraps around the top part of his face and ties in the back and his hat has a red plum. I turn and head back towards the fridge with the intent to get the alcohol and get out of there. This was getting just a little bit too strange for me and something was screaming at me to run. I wish I would have listened to those instincts and headed for the stairs instead of farther away towards the fridge tucked in the back side of the room. Theres not another exit besides the stairwell, theres no windows, the light is dingy, and were the only two people down here. I make it to the fridge okay. Im digging around through the copious amounts of expired and new and everything in between food kept there by these college boys when I feel something press against my hips and butt. It takes me a few seconds to register that its someones body and theyve positioned their pelvis pushing into mine with a strong grip on my hips. I laugh and jokingly ask him what hes doing, he says in a voice that Ill never forget, his tone sent chills down my spine. Dont you wanna have a little fun? This sends me reeling and I try to pull away from him but his grip only gets harder and Ive got nowhere to go. Im in a vulnerable position and I desperately try to negotiate my way out of it. Everything I say, every explanation I give for why I dont want to do this gets shot down. The more I oppose the advance the more angry he gets. Hes now rocking his hips against my butt, I can feel his erection and it makes me sick to my stomach. His grip hurts and I can feel the bruises forming already. I tell him I dont want to have sex and I take my elbow and jam it into his stomach as hard as I can. Hes not happy with that. He backs off two or three feet and growls at me, clinching his fists and grumbling. It takes me a second to realize what hes saying. Hes talking about ungrateful women always leading him on and never going through with it. Im scared now. I dont know what to do. Im backed against the fridge and hes blocking my only exit. Before I can figure anything out and the only warning I have is when he says Im sick of it! And he marches towards me. I drop to the floor before he can get to me and he growls. He grabs me by the back of my costume as I try to crawl away from him. Hes so much bigger than me. He literally throws me a few feet away from where I was and I land on the ground with a thump. Im a tiny person. Only 51 and he screams at me. I hope desperately that someone will hear the profanity that he is yelling over the music and investigate. No one does. He throws himself on top of me. I shove at him while he does it. He grabs my shoulders and slams the back of my head into the floor. Im dizzy now. I cant breathe and Im crying as he puts his hand over my mouth and positions his legs on either side of my hips. He growls in my ear to be quiet and just stop being a little bitch already and you know you want it. My head hurts and Im still pushing against him but he doesnt budge. Im not strong enough to move him. With his free hand hes tearing at my costume. My panic kicks into overdrive as he rips the zipper down the side of my costume open. I dont want this. Im terrified. I close my eyes as he rips my costume open. Im not wearing anything underneath it. He knows that now and hes commenting on my body. I feel like a piece of meet as my tears come harder and he gropes my body in any place that he can reach. Then the worst part came. I felt his hands begin to tug my costume down as he shuffles and moves himself to get better access. I panic and start kicking at the air as it reaches my hips and he pushes his hand down into my underwear and starts touching me down there. I dont want this. Hes massaging around and the hands off my mouth now. Hes moaning and he shoves two rough fingers inside of me. Im sobbing outright now as my costume gets tugged completely off and he tries to put himself between my legs. I fight with all I can. Trying desperately to keep my legs closed. He gets angrier at this. He grabs me by my hair and throws me face first onto the concrete again and lays his body over my back. I can feel this member against my thigh and I try to crawl out from underneath him. He pins me and forces my legs open. Im practically screaming now as his hand takes back up its place over my mouth. I could describe to you what happens next but I think you know. I could tell you all about how painful it was as he was thrusting. I could tell you how foreign it was to have him inside me when I didnt want it. I could talk all about how violated and disgusting I felt when he came inside of me. But those details are horrible and awful. To describe in detail the moment when he entered me and everything that came after until he left is something I cannot do yet. Not without breaking down into a sobbing and crying wreck who cant articulate anything. What I can tell you though it that once he had gone I laid there crying for awhile. I eventually stopped and got up and got dressed. I went back upstairs and found a bathroom and tried desperately not to puke. I cleaned myself up and I went back to my friend. I listened to the comments from my friend group about how I looked thoroughly well fucked. I told them the costume was ripped on accident and not intentionally by someone seeking to harm me. I went back to my dorm alone that night and I cried in my shower for hours because I wasnt able to feel clean. I have flashbacks now and nightmares and times when I cant breathe because Ive started thinking about it again. What I can tell you though is that I was never the same after that night. I couldnt leave my dorm room without having a panic attack. In the face of every male student and alumni and faculty member I saw him. In the eyes of my friends even when they looked at me with fondness I felt shame. I could never be alone with my best friend without having a panic attack. I hadnt slept a night through since then. By mid November I had attempted to kill my self, hadnt attended classes in almost a week, and withdrew from school for the semester. I still think of it. I still cry myself to sleep sometimes. I still wonder why me. I still try to think what it was about me that made him choose to do this to me. I still wonder if theres something that I could have done differently. I wonder where I would be if I had never gone to that party. I want to scream and I want to yell and I want to go back in time and tell myself to just be content without the alcohol. I want to point out how stupid it was to forget things like that happen. I want to go back to feeling invincible, to this feeling of vulnerability and terror being something foreign. To just thinking that rape was something that happened to people but it wouldnt ever happen to me. To just be as naive as I was before my life was torn apart by this. I didnt go to the police. I never told my friends or any of my family members or mentors. Who would have believed that a drunk girl with a known record for being promiscuous got raped? They would have called me an attention seeker, a whore, someone who wanted to ruin someone elses record just because she regretted a one night stand. Ive seen it happen in numerous stories that Id read about online in the past. Everything about rape and sexual assault came to the forefront of my mind. But I didnt listen to it. You dont know the shame, the pain, the anger, the panic, the downright terror that comes with the idea of it until youve experienced it. Until youve wondered if you should tell someone. Until youve had a flashback and thought that it was happening again. Until you havent felt safe in your own home because even though your body has healed your mind still makes you relive it over and over again. Despite everything that Ive read, I still cant wrap my mind around it. Ive spent many sleepless nights trying to find an answer for why. Why would he do this? Why me? Why didnt I fight harder? Why didnt I scream? Why didnt anybody come? Why didnt he stop? Just so many questions. But theres never going to be a satisfactory answer for it. Theres never going to be a clear cut explanation for why someone would do something so vile. Why someone would take a right so fundamental from someone else so violently. But people do it. Theres evil people out there. And theres no excuse for the pain that they cause. Theres no excuse for there actions. There is no explanation. They do it because they want too and it wasnt you, it wasnt what you were wearing, it was them taking your right away from you. And as much as you dont want to believe it, thats the truth and the only sure thing about it. They had no respect for you, and if it wasnt you it would have been someone else, and there might have been others before and there might be others after. You dont know. But you do know that their actions, their choice to take that away from you, thats on them. You didnt ask for it. Nobody would ask for that. "

It's not a big deal, but I keep thinking that I'm the only one that feels this way. Probably many do, but who in their busy life just suddenly stops and thinks 'What the hell am I doing right now? Is this supposed to be my life?' I know that, logically, people are supposed to *do* something with their life, get an education, a job, earn money, start a family. And I'd love to do all those things (except the last one maybe) but I can't help but feel that it's all some kind of delusion. I can't fully explain this. Yeah, we all seek happiness and the things I mentioned help us reach that place of satisfaction. However, at the same time, it feels so wrong for me to fall in line and do all those things in order for me to survive in this society. We are supposed to be a specific way and do specific things and everything will be fine. But I'm not that person. And this is also where my anxieties come into play. I'm afraid of all sorts of things, even though I don't want to be. My death will be a lonely and miserable one, because my fears have grown to an extent where I feel I'd rather die than put myself in a position of vulnerability. I'm so afraid, I want to cry and scream. I'm so envious of people that are everything I'm not, I want hurt myself. And I think when the time comes and I reject the world, it'll be because it rejected me first. And perhaps, also because I rejected myself. "
385,vulnerability,offmychest,being called needy after sexting,2,b7l2z2,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/b7l2z2/being_called_needy_after_sexting/,2019-03-31 18:16:34,"if you're reading this, hi. I need to get this off my chest, feel free to share your thoughts and advice. I'm feeling a bit off, emotional and uncomfortable about the situation. I've been having a great time on Reddit chatting to a lot of wonderful people. Just ready to socialize, chat and learn more from and about other people and their lifes. I also like to chat to be distracted and to keep each other company. So, I met this funny, chill, just awesome guy on here as we chatted I felt like it clicked very well. Things became sexually heated pretty quick though, but I'm open to have fun. We both agreed we weren't ready for anything committed and I'm totally cool with that. We did share some personal stuff with each other. I wouldn't enjoy mindless sexual involvement with someone whatsoever, especially not without having some kind of connection. I felt a connection there so this wasn't an issue.. The issue, ladies and gentlemen, arose when said person became a bit flaky after sharing pretty private stuff with him. He made some questionable remarks, every time I tried to discuss my feelings he wouldn't really go into them. He'd try to comfort me; tell me that it's okay and that he doesn't want to make me feel uncomfortable and all. Yet he still wouldn't talk about certain points I had made. For one, his point was that he doesn't have much time on his hands. Which I totally understand, I totally wouldn't want to force chatting on anyone. If someone doesn't have time though, they would've also hadn't had time to sext me and share pictures.. As soon as I'd talk about my feelings he would take so much longer to reply.. It just made me feel stupid. So I tried something different, I said okay this isn't working and asked when he did have some time to chat. He gave me a certain time, I waited at the time and.. nothing. No message. So I go in and message him after a couple hours of waiting. He just was like 'Hey', no apology, not talking about what had happened. He didn't discuss how he liked the sexting either. I said I wanted to hear his voice so he was chill about that, and said I could call him. He was so distant in the phone call, not trying to make conversation. It just went silent and then we hung up. Didn't discuss how that was or felt either. Mind you, I didn't try talking about my feelings too much at this point, because I was already sensing some judgment. Afterwards all of this, and a lot of other situations I haven't told in this post, I had this bad feeling in my stomach, deleted all my messages and blocked him. I tried letting it go and take some advice from friends. It still wasn't sitting right with me though so I messaged him again, apologizing for freaking out. After opening up again, he called me needy. I feel even more stupid, hurt and ashamed after he said that. This just led me to believe we were stuck in some kind of circle where talking about my feelings towards him would result in him thinking I'm needy, he'd pull away and our 'friendship' would automatically deteriorate. I felt that, so I tried talking about it. - Anyways.. I don't think his intentions were detrimental. Like I said, I definitely had fun chatting with him. It just sucks that I opened up to someone and this person still doesn't seem to get it. I feel confused, wondering what I could've done better. I feel ashamed, stupid, of course I'm showing vulnerability with that. I'm very in touch with my emotions and with myself, if I show myself to someone it means a lot to me instantly. I've got nothing to lose, only experience to gain from every situation I encounter. You can't know what's going to happen, you can't predict the future. The best thing I can do is stick to my gut, try to make it work, try to do my best, which is what I did. You don't choose how you feel, only how you process and deal with them. So I'll just say it: people judging me out there, I'm not whatever you think I am. In this case, I'm not needy. I don't need anyone's validation, I can take criticism, I can take being alone, the last thing I want to receive is compliments all the time. Advice about not taking it too personal wouldn't make a lot of sense, since this is literally something personal, I opened up to someone. I'll give it some time and I'm sure I'll meet other great people to chat with. If you're still here, reading this, thank you. If you're not taken aback, feel free to message me, I'm open to chat. TL;DR: I met this awesome guy on Reddit. We shared personal stuff. He became flaky, called me needy and I still feel uncomfortable about it. "
386,vulnerability,offmychest,Long monologue about my dating situation and accepting the reality,2,b7l39e,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/b7l39e/long_monologue_about_my_dating_situation_and/,2019-03-31 18:17:45,"I've (F28) been seeing this guy for a bit over a month, and before that we talked for a month online. First 2 weeks offline were perfect. Then things shifted significantly. No more dates, just hanging out at his place (which I like, but he has never visited my home - I invited when I refused to go all the way to his home in the last minute). Unless I push myself into his company and we do something outside. He rarely texts and this bothered me immensely, causing me extreme anxiety and overthinking when it just started happening. Going from talking regularly to not talking at all, but sorta dating exclusively (yes, that was agreed upon)? That's a clear change in communication. &amp;#x200B; I like this person, and he said, he likes me too. He has some mental issues and a solitary personality, so I gave him all kinds of excuses. I even tried to convince myself, that some relationships don't look like they are in the movies. And they don't text in the movies anyway. But reality is no longer fun either... Sure, it's always nice to meet and hang out, but when I look back, I see more bad things than good. I am trying to let go of any kinds of expectations, but what it is, is just accepting breadcrumbs of attention. &amp;#x200B; There are no sweet nothings I could repeat myself to again and again to get that warm fuzzy feeling... At first there were a few nice things he said to me, but recently I asked what did he like about me; he replied, that he won't feed my ego. Maybe this was my ego asking? But now I think that in relationship you do say nice things to each other... I want to say and make him smile, but now I keep them to myself... Sure, we are just seeing each other, no official names or titles, but don't sweet nothings come with the beginning of getting to know each other? &amp;#x200B; At first I asked about this not-texting thing and told it worried me a lot... He said, he doesn't text much, we talked a bit and I got my peace. I like an occasional text, even if it's just once in a while. I am okay with a text every other day, even if it's just ""thinking of you"", but I don't think he does... Never makes any plans in advance. I became a weekday evening girl. Weekends? Definitely not for me. They are too valuable to be given to this girl he has just started seeing... It's sports, friend, games, reading, being alone. But not me. &amp;#x200B; It worried me a bit that a weekend comes and we haven't made any kind of plans to see each other. Or just a vague ""We should meet"". But no follow up. I don't expect a gentleman-like behavior. I am no lady. I like simple. Rock'n'roll baby! But still... I do expect to see the person I am dating at least once a week... If the week went by and Sunday is here, does it mean we don't meet at all? &amp;#x200B; Last week I managed not to text until he would initiate a contact. And that was nice and meaningful, in my opinion, so I was happy then. It happened on Monday. Now's Saturday. I sent a bit more meaningful adventure story in the middle of the week (he nicely replies to everything, so I was peaceful again). It bugs me that he declined my offer to go see a movie on Friday evening - he was sooo looking forward to drinking that night (it bugged me that he wasn't looking forward to seeing me..). I went alone and had a good time. It bugs me that he never checked how the previously mentioned adventure sorted itself out. It bugs me that he never asked how did my job interview go. &amp;#x200B; It's more than clear that he doesn't give a f\*k about me or my life, I am at the bottom of his priorities list. To skip the mind games and passive aggression, today I sent him another text. Something I never do: I simply asked how is his weekend going. I know his phone is always near him or in his hand. Always. Phones bug me, so I noticed this. Doesn't text much, but browses, checks, reads, scrolls. So my message has definitely reached his sight. And no response. It's weekend. I do not deserve any attention on weekends. &amp;#x200B; I sent the message to clear the doubts, the anger who had the potential to cloud my thinking. I didn't want to wonder and imagine things. And even if I didn't receive his response, it says so much. &amp;#x200B; I am trying not to become the girl who hopes a man will change. I know they don't. So I tried to accept the flaws and be my authentic self. I am not perfect and I want to be accepted as this flawed broken human as everybody else is, and I am too. Honesty is more important to me than a domestic-type relationship or marriage. I like weird, quirky and interesting. But as any human I want to be cared about. I feel that I have so much to give to a person who wants to give me as much. I am the best version of myself I've ever been. And feel the pressure to find someone who would appreciate it. &amp;#x200B; However, it takes a hell a lot of time to find anyone who sparks a little bit interest in me. It seems I like odd and broken people. It's interesting. Most of all - I despise all things boring. This man is like honey to a bee (me). &amp;#x200B; I am no longer anxious. He's still on my mind most of the time. But I keep my feelings in check. I think. I am already letting go of him in my mind, although I still want to spend some time together. He's interesting, fun, intelligent, incredibly attractive. I always have great time with him WHEN we meet. &amp;#x200B; But those days in between remind me how little I mean to him. Even if he says he likes me. &amp;#x200B; Maybe I am chasing too much, maybe I am just being the person I am and dating the way I usually date, maybe I should just relax and let things unfold... ? I hate the games. I believe in honesty, authenticity, vulnerability, but also self-worth. Where's the line though? Have I finally reached it? &amp;#x200B; TL;DR vent about dating, texting and accepting that this person doesn't care. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

But Im a male who was molested by another male when I was younger. I was fondled, groped, even almost forced to perform sexual intercourse with said male. Not once, but multiple occasions, throughout my life, with different people. While this may seem taboo, and uneasy for some people to understand, its not uncommon for male on male encounters to happen. My innocence was taken away at a very young age. It even strayed me away from being around people entirely. I didnt know how to tell my parents, or even react to the situation(s). My mother was both physically/ mentally abusive, my father passed away, the only person I had to talk to was my brother, and even he was a victim to it also. All I could do was take it for what it was and move on. I was young. I really didnt know any better of what was going on, until later on in life when I started getting older, I started learning about what women were experiencing through word-of-mouth experiences of sexual assault and harassment that I started to realize what was going on in my own life. Its something I feel like men dont discuss because its something that makes us think that if we talk about it, were weak, and I want to end that stigma of men not being able to open up and express their vulnerability. If you have any questions feel free to leave them in the comments. Ill respond to as many as I can. "

I want to feel that level of comfort and vulnerability. I think I experienced that for the first time this past weekend. He put his lips on my forehead and I got this tingly sensation. I felt so good. Never experienced that with anyone else. Spent a full 24 hours together (it was our first time meeting each other physically after texting/engaging on social media for an extended amount of time) and it filled with sleep, sex, laughter, and comfort. I hope this isnt a fluke and that I am amble to experience it again. I miss him. I miss the feelings he provoked. I felt him. "
389,vulnerability,offmychest,"Hurt Feelings, Boundaries, Body Shaming and Religion...",1,b902qh,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/b902qh/hurt_feelings_boundaries_body_shaming_and_religion/,2019-04-04 03:21:01,"Hey there everybody. I have been with my husband for four years, we will celebrate two years of marriage this fall. I love him with my whole heart, I truly could not ask for a better spouse. Before going in to details about his family, I feel like I have to make it clear that I'm lucky to have him and I'm honestly lucky that the only thing that bothers me about him is his family. For anonymity purposes, I'll refer to him as Pete in this post. For context, he comes from a family of six- four children and parents. He's the youngest, so all of his siblings are married and have children. There are sixteen members of the family if I'm counting the grandkids. Keri is the oldest (32), Matt (29), Lilly (27), and then my husband, who is 25. I want to share a few stories that exemplify how inconsiderate and rude they've been to me. When we had just barely started dating, Pete was on good terms with his mom. They had a rough patch when he was in his late teens, as that was when he decided to stop attending church. But, they had overcome that by the time I started coming around, so things there were mostly good. Once he and I moved in together, we didn't have our own laundry, so we went to his parent's house on a regular basis to do laundry. His mom, let's call her Mary, would almost always tell me stories about her two daughters, Keri and Lilly. She seldom had anything positive to say about them and was constantly complaining about how they were taking advantage of her. In the first year or two, I listened to her without being critical. In fact, I saw a lot of evidence that seemed to support her claims. Despite being adults and having their own children, both Keri and Lilly often bite Mary's head off when she says something they don't agree with. They show up to family dinners, let their kids make noise and messes, and never offer to help with the prep work or clean up. Pete and I both sympathized with Mary and even corroborated her claim that Lilly and Keri were rude and immature. However, as time went on, I started to notice that Mary was just as bad as her daughters. To put it simply, they seem to have gotten a lot of their unsavory traits from their mother. I started to understand why they were short tempered with her, as she can be extremely critical and has a tendency to make fun of others. Specifically, Mary is very critical of body size and shape, especially when it comes to women. Keri has four kids, so her body has changed since she was a teenager. Mary brings this up almost every time we're all together and is really derogatory and mean. Something that I should note is that Mary does not work outside of the home. She was a SAHM when her kids were little, picking up various part time jobs here and there. She's not qualified in any particular area and hasn't had a job the whole time I've known her. I think she has too much time on her hands to sit and think about all of the things that bother her. She has a negative outlook on everything, even things that she should be happy about. It's almost like it's impossible for her to be happy and that makes it hard to be around her. Her marriage doesn't seem happy to me either. She and her husband, who I'll call Ron, are out of sync with each other, often bickering and picking each other apart. I think it's telling that many of her closest relationships are strained and tenuous. Things came to a peak for me leading up to my wedding. Pete and I had been together for two years when we got engaged. During those two years, I tried to love his family the way that I love my own family and friends. I attended every event, usually showing up with either a gift or food item to contribute. As I mentioned above, there are a lot of grandkids in the family and Pete's sisters and parents live 40 min- 1 hour away from us. We drove to every birthday party, stayed and helped clean up, babysat for free. Ron's dad was very old and sick at this time and we visited him, helped move him to a few different nursing homes in the last years of his life. I put my best foot forward because I love my husband and I wanted to have a harmonious relationship with his family. As we planned our wedding, Mary was standoffish. She just didn't seem to want to be involved at all. (Before I keep telling the story, I have to note that she lives in a huge house that has been completely remodeled, she talks a lot about how much she likes to entertain and have people over). Pete and I talked about ways that we could involve her and decided to ask her if she wanted to host the bridal shower at her house. We thought this was going to be a good way to involve her without putting too much pressure on her. He called her one evening to ask her if this was something she would be interested in. He told her that some of my friends had already offered to host it, but wanted to ask her first to see if she wanted to. I was sitting on the couch next to him, so I could hear everything she said and her response hurt my feelings. Despite telling her that others had already offered, she said ""well, I guess I'll do it if nobody else wants to."" Clearly, this was not the answer that we had expected and hoped to hear. The rest of the conversation was brief, and ended with Pete telling her that we would just take one of my friends up on their offer. One of my bridesmaids ended up throwing the shower, which was more fun anyways. I invited Pete's mom and sisters, and nobody else from his family. Truthfully, I was pretty bitter about her response about throwing the shower, so I made the purposeful decision not to invite any of his extended family. I also don't really know the extended family, so it would have been disingenuous anyways. Keri and Mary showed up to the shower together, but Lilly was nowhere to be seen. The festivities began without her and Mary texted her to ask where she was. She never showed up. This was also very hurtful. It was only a few hours out of the day, and an event that only happens once in a lifetime. She later texted me to say sorry and that she forgot, but it definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. About a month later, and very close to the wedding date, Mary texted Pete. She asked if she ""could host a male/female bridal shower that her family could come to since she **didn't get** to host anything for us."" As you can imagine, this made both of us really mad and upset. Looking back on it now, I think this story really shows her true colors. She's absolutely the type of person who would turn down an opportunity and then play the victim and act like she was excluded and left out. Pete sent her a curt response, reminding her that she did have the opportunity to host a shower and had declined. Keri's kids were our ring bearer and flower girl. We were doing a rehearsal dinner the evening before the wedding, largely so that the kids could practice and see what to expect. Without giving much notice, Keri told us that they would not be coming to the rehearsal because they wanted to go to a preseason football game instead. I let her know that it was important for the kids to be there. So, the day of the rehearsal, Keri dropped her kids (ages 4 and 3) off and went to the game. Of course, I was stuck watching them. Causing so much extra stress and also making me really mad. Again, I felt like I had put a lot of time in to this family and it was becoming really apparent to me that I was pretty damn low on their list of priorities. My outlook on their family changed during our engagement and I became withdrawn after the wedding. Without going on and on, I just felt the need to create some boundaries with them. Mary's mom died a few months after our wedding. The funeral was out of state and Pete and I decided to stay at our own hotel instead of with his mom's family. This made her mad, which I found interesting. She kept asking Pete to cancel our room, even offering to have Ron call the hotel and cancel for us. This was when I realized that his family expects me to support them, hang around them, like and love them, but they don't want to get to know me or have to expend any amount of energy on me. Across the board, they don't know me. They never take the time to sit down and ask me what's new or how I'm doing. My perception, which I'm sure differs from their's, is that I'm basically invisible unless I don't show up. When I don't show up, they take note and are bothered by my absence. Over the last year, I have been working really long work weeks, and I've had to miss a lot of their family events. I know that they don't view me as a priority, so I think it's only fair that I prioritize my own events and activities over their's. Every time I've seen them over the last year, they've reminded me that I missed the last family get together or that I ""haven't seen their kids in such a long time"". It kind of makes me roll my eyes, especially because that's sometimes the only thing that either of the sisters says to me. Many small things have happened that have only added to the gross feeling I have about them. Mary and her daughters are codependent in a very unhealthy way. Her daughters do take advantage of her, but she allows it. She's a bully about their weight and appearance, she's so harsh. Matt, Pete's brother, lives out of state. Sadly, we don't see his family much. I love his wife and have talked to her about some of the things that bother me about the family, and she has agreed with me. She also feels left out and targeted by Mary's backhanded comments. Pete and I also talk about these things. I don't really keep secrets from him, so I have let him know that I don't feel like I have any authentic relationships, other than with Matt's wife. I'm lucky that Pete is understanding and loving. I feel like I have his unwavering loyalty, which makes the situation feel like less of a big deal to me. The last significant point of division between his family and the two of us is religion. Everyone in the family is a devout and practicing member of the Mormon church. I hate to be intolerant; I hate judging others because they are different from me. But frankly, it's so difficult to connect with them and I think religion is at the root of it. My husband and I are atheists, but we've never felt like this was something that they needed to know. I think Pete has been worried that he'll break his mom's heart if she knows that he doesn't believe in God. He had his name removed from church records before meeting me, but only Lilly and her husband know this. Lately he's been wanting to tell his whole family where he stands in regards to religious affiliation because he feels like he shouldn't have to keep his beliefs a secret, especially when they speak so openly about their's. I see where he's coming from, but I also worry about how they will react to this news. As far as I understand, family is one of the main cornerstones of the Mormon religion. Pete's family believes literally that they have been ""sealed"" to each other. Because of this sealing, they will all be together forever in heaven. Pete and I were not married in a Mormon temple and therefore we were not sealed to one another. This is where is gets even more odd-- according to their doctrine (and the fact that they don't know he has removed his name from church records), Pete is still sealed to his parents. So his entire family believes that he is sealed to them, but I am sealed to nobody. If we have children, which we don't yet, they will also be excluded from their eternal family. They will all be in heaven without me. I think they also believe that people can posthumously join the religion and be sealed to their families, so they might be hopeful that I will come to my senses and be sealed to them in the afterlife. Thinking about this makes me feel so weird. I definitely feel like they view our marriage as lesser than their's, even though they try really hard to come across as accepting. It's important to note that I was born and raised in the state of Utah. I grew up in a Catholic household, and my family and I ran in to so many issues because we weren't part of the mainstream religion. There are lots of kind, loving Mormons. But there is also a trend in Utah where many Mormons are elitist and shamelessly so. I think I already had a lot of preconceived notions about Mormons before I ever even met my husband. I have tried to keep myself in check. I have constantly questioned myself. Ultimately, after four years of knowing them, I feel pretty confident in saying that they are disapproving of many aspects of my lifestyle (if you're not familiar with Mormonism, they live by some pretty strict guidelines- no coffee, no alcohol, no premarital sex, no swearing etc). I am curious to know opinions on where to go next. My plan is to just be as polite as I can manage when I'm with them, but to limit the amount of time I have to see them. Dealing with this family and the dysfunctional dynamic is so hard for me. They aren't my own family, so I don't love them unconditionally. I don't feel close with any of them, aside from Matt's wife. However, I'm pretty much stuck with them for the rest of my life. I've thought about communicating some of my concerns with them, but Mary and her daughters are super defensive (I know because I've watched them snap at each other over stupid, small stuff) and I don't think they would accept my feedback very well. In fact, speaking up would most likely just cause more problems. Also, I feel like that would take a lot of vulnerability and patience on my behalf, which is something that I don't owe them. "

It's the fourth day since we broke up, I don't feel any better. I can't lie when they ask if I'm okay, and I can't lie to myself about why, either. I cheated. I fucked up. I see myself in the mirror and I want to throw up. Sex shouldn't make me feel so dirty, but I think, now, it'll always feel that way to me. My body had always felt absent unless it was your hands touching me. The morning I woke up, your name was the first thing that rang in me. I couldn't lie. I called all day until you finally picked up. And that was that. As I walk myself through that Sunday, again, I wonder how I got there. I wonder how I got from feeling like you've got me forever, to feeling like I've got no other choice but to let someone else touch me to feel loved. It's my fault. Still. I chose that moment over everything we shared. My friend said I did the worst thing, but it's not that black and white. ""You're not the type of person to do this with an intention of hurting him - you did it because you felt bad about yourself. And now, you know you're an adult, and even with those reasons you still need to hold yourself accountable."" It's harder than I ever thought. I can't find the balance between denying what I did and accepting that I did it. Instead, I'm constantly mentally torturing myself. I hate how I looked elsewhere for what only you could give me. I hate how I let someone else use my vulnerability, they knew we had problems and used that to get to me and I let them. I hate how weak I feel, and I hate how hurt you are knowing it's because of me. ""Maybe you're just not meant to be together. Not after this. Even if you hadn't cheated, do you think it would've worked?"" The honest answer is, no. We've talked about it a thousand times, right? Long distance. The Navy. My work. The nights we only get to tell each other to sleep well. The days when nothing's even said. Circumstances never lining up for us to love without fear of running late to some other worldly affair. But I think, I would've rather we ended on terms that we both finally ran out of our energy to keep us sustained. Not on terms that I betrayed you, that I'm not ready to give up yet, but you are even though you still love me. And I still love you. Honestly, R, I'm not sure where to start this process of healing. Of forgiving myself. Of letting you go. For both of us. I was walking through this life spontaneously until you came in, setting my path straight. You were the rational one and I was the emotional one. I think, one of the things I'll always miss about us, is how different we are but we fit so well together. How you made my days brighter with just a laugh, how you always asked me for photographs to see me with 300 miles between us. How you came to meet my parents and ate at my favorite local Chinese restaurant with us. That Pikachu you won for me at the arcade. The pictures we took at the movies together. The really comfortable tshirt of yours that you gave me to sleep in. I already do miss these things, even though it hadn't been long. Because I know it'll never happen again. You have every right to hate me and resent me, you know. Do it, until you've got it all out. So you can heal. So next time, when you find the girl that deserves the love you've got to give, you both won't have to deal with the scars I've left in your heart. Because you deserve a beautiful relationship that inspires you and makes you genuinely happy. And, I'll always love you too. One day it won't hurt so bad to. "

I started prioritizing exercising and eating healthy, I cut my long hair, take better care of how I dress and groom, read and reflect a lot, take on more responsibilities with work and my social life, quit my service industry job to start professional school, take my friendships more intentionally/seriously and strive to be a better friend. I take my family relationships seriously by spending more time with them and repairing some past trauma. &amp;#x200B; However, if I'm honest with myself, it all sort of stems from a deep sense of inadequacy, and a hole in my heart that I struggle to fill. I gather that the whole is the intimate love I felt in my earlier relationship (of 6 yrs). I've since had a number of girlfriends, some more serious than others, the longest being 2 yrs. A consistent theme is that I'm guarded and have trouble really letting myself be available. Even if I try to be vulnerable and open, it feels like I just share my stories, but don't actually build the trust and closeness; that my vulnerability is because someone told me I should be, not because I actually trust and admire them. &amp;#x200B; This has also led to a tendency to elevate girls who I find myself most attracted to, leading to frustration when I feel rejected (often because I think I might come off as needy, clingy or too eager). It is like I see a girl who is in my social world and think they're so beautiful that they hold the possibility of a really deep and meaningful relationship. Further, I take for granted and feel lukewarm about girls who pursue me harder. I assume it just isn't a match and I just don't feel as attracted to them, but maybe it bothers me that I don't have to work for it, or in a sort of masochistic way, that I don't have to prove myself. &amp;#x200B; I feel at a loss. I still try to work on all these areas of my life, to build self-esteem and be happy with who I am, independent of a relationship, but I know I'm really just pining for that intimacy. "

I apologize for any typos I am on my phone. I was in a relationship with my ex (34M) for almost 5 years on again, off again and finally broke up after a failed attempt to live together plus dealing with everything that we had already emotionally burdened ourselves with over the years. The only three things we can probably agree on is that we both find each other to be 100% physical perfection which, I think, correct me if Im wrong, is rare even with the best of couples, that we will always be madly in love with each other despite the tumultuous nature of our prior relationship, and that he has always known me better than anyone else does and even than I know myself. Anytime I have ever looked to him in order to have a serious conversation or seek advice, I feel like he has always told me exactly what I needed to know/already knew but never wanted to hear. As a result, I feel that I have grown to respect his intuitiveness but have also grown to resent his lack of compassion. We tried to have a baby together for about a year and a half, and it was he who first suggested that I go to the doctor after many failed attempts, so I went, and once I had officially learned that I had troubles with my fertility, his response was to tell me that I needed to be healthier, but that he didnt want to be part of the process and to just let him know when I actually got pregnant instead of being there with me step-by-step. While he was right to suggest that I go to the doctor when I had been stubborn enough to believe that just having sex would eventually result in success, and while he was right to say that I should have been healthier, because I have never been terribly health-conscious, I felt that at the end of the day he still did not show the emotional support that I needed at that time to feel comfortable with us having such a serious future together. Maybe there is nothing wrong with him being as crass as he is, maybe that is just how he is. All in all, I just feel like our attraction to each other is unequivocally magnetic, but that I will never get the fulfillment that I need from him and that I think I should have after spending so many years together. Even just typing this I wish I could call him and ask him what I should say, which I recognize is super codependent, but I also recognize that he would dismiss my consternation without attempting to relate to how Im feeling or what Im going through, despite the fact that it is in relation to him and to us, even though us doesnt exist anymore, it wouldnt matter even if it did, he would still write it off in the same way. Anyway, I have been in a new relationship for just under six months, and my ex knows about him and doesnt want me to date him because I think he is jealous, but at the same time has expressed that we would never work if we got back together. I thought I would have no problem in trying to emotionally distance myself from my ex and to focus on my new relationship which has resulted in positive growth for me. My boyfriend and I have started a diet together in an attempt to get healthier, have agreed to quit all of our bad habits, and have discussed how we will financially plan for a future together. He is an incredibly thoughtful boyfriend, the kind who never says no to me requesting a back rub and sent me an excessive amount of flowers on Valentines Day knowing that I had to work a 12 hour shift. I have warned him that we may have trouble having kids in the future, and even though we are nowhere near planning for that sort of thing yet, he has already handled my vulnerability about the matter better than my ex. My friends and family hated my ex, branding him as nothing more than an asshole, but love my new boyfriend and say that I have finally found the person that I am supposed to be with and have finally broken away from toxic relationships. However, he tends to get short tempered with me without communicating about what it is that is actually bothering him. Sometimes when I talk to him about work or my day in general he is receptive and conversational, but other times he cuts me off and says that he doesnt want to talk about that sort of thing at length or that he couldnt understand because hes not in the same industry. If he is generally grumpy about something that is going on in his life, then I would completely and totally understand, but he isnt proactive about mentioning that to me. He always says that he is doing well, but my only clue to how he is actually feeling is his reaction to my response when he asks me how my day is going, so I never really know whether or not I can actually talk to him about something. He has also gotten short with me about our diet, saying that there is no point in him cooking or cleaning if I am too busy at work to stick to our meal prep, even though I have done an equal share of cooking and cleaning as he has, have bought all of our groceries for the last two weeks, and have not cheated on the diet yet, even if I dont have time to eat exactly what we planned on eating exactly when we planned on eating it. I find myself missing my exs crass behavior, because if I was annoying him he would be transparent and unabashed about it, rather than passive aggressive, and I would use that as a sort of guidance. Maybe Im just used to being in a bad situation and maybe my current situation is no better, but I am left with a lot of questions. Like, is it me that is doing something wrong? Am I just an annoying girlfriend? Am I not ready to be in a relationship with the new person if I still feel like reverting to my ex when I logically know that that is bad for me? Are these feelings something that is worth ending all of the potential of my new relationship over? "

I hate being called nice. Makes me feel that I'm too vulnerable. Which is true in a sense. I've got issues? Maybe. I'd rather spend my day not worrying about something that's for sure and yet I can't seem to do it. Don't get me started with the concept of falling in love cause that's a whole different type of vulnerability. Even though you like the person yet for some reason I pretend that I don't have feelings for them but deep inside what I want them to is to actually notice me for once. I've gotten good at this and it became a shitty skill of mine. To look at me in a way that I look at them is what we want to expect but it usually doesn't end that way. This a whole different topic and I shouldn't be sidetrack hahaha. You feel that youre weak because you're crying about something that's stupid but only if you want it to be.

We really hit it off and despite myself I really fell for him. 2 great weeks and he's off to school; I'm headed out of town a month anyway so it was just good fun while it lasted. Shit happens and we both find ourselves back home for the semester. Life sucks and we're both wrecks but hey, maybe we can still be a thing for a while. We never defined what we were. You introduce me as your boyfriend and I do the same. All the while both being open that we're still on dating apps, though you got way more out of them I did and you did stop blatantly swiping guys while we were together. I was just grudgingly keeping my options open for when things inevitably fell through. Then it begins: the slow fade. First you block me on tinder-""I stopped paying for premium so I remade my account"". Texts go unread, conversations go cold, and communication collapses. I happen to see you on grindr and immediately, like magic, here you are in my inbox with a tiny breadcrumb of contact. Deep down I know you're dealing with a lot of life stuff. When you're feeling overwhelmed you avoid your inbox and I try to respect that but knowing you're still active on dating apps makes leaves me with doubts.I feel you slipping away and it's killing me. This always happens. I finally decide to confront you about it, perhaps too passionately. You reassure me that you're still interested; you've been ignoring me but you've also been ignoring everybody.(Though seemingly not other guys on apps. ""I constantly need distractions"". I don't want to be something someone constantly needs a distraction from.) and you tell me you love me. I'm being crazy but you're not going anywhere. So I try to ground myself to let you have space to work on your issues while simultaneously letting you know I can't handle the degree of space that had been going on and that I want to be in your life. Nope. Nothing much changes and I'm actually losing it. I'm trying to rationalize but the gaslights are aglow. Feeling This isn't how you treat someone you love and I'm feeling anything but loved. I can't tell if you don't realize or can't act on it or just plain don't care. In an emotional fever, I tell you I can't do this; I unfriend your social medias and delete your number. I need to stop myself from hoping I can reach you. All the while still doubting if I'm in touch with the reality of the situation. Honestly I still hope you'll text me, tell me I'm crazy but that's ok. ""It's shared strength through mutual vulnerability"" It's selfish of me I know. I'm sorry ""Chary"".

I like observing him when he concentrates on writing emails, when he works on diy projects around the house, when we have long drives, when were at different areas of a store and I find him first, and especially when hes asleep. I love watching him while he sleeps because the look of peace on his face almost makes me forget about all of the stuff I cant change between us. "
399,vulnerability,offmychest,Today is my 22nd birthday.,1,at4vda,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/at4vda/today_is_my_22nd_birthday/,2019-02-22 03:10:20,"Today is my 22nd birthday. When I was 14, I told my mom I was suicidal. She immediately got me into therapy and was so proactive in getting her daughter help. Opening up to my mom helped me make it to 22. I drank for the first time on my 15th birthday. Booze helped to drown out my pain but when I was sober it was still there. So I started cutting myself. The therapy helped but I didnt talk about the things that deeply bothered me. I didnt talk about my dad. Not how I truly felt, at least. When my first kiss broke my heart I decided that since Im not good enough for my dad, I must not be good enough for any man. When I was 16 my dad hit me for the first and last time. A piece of me died that day. I decided that since my dad hates my mom, and my birth is the reason they got married, that I am the reason my dad lived a miserable life. I am the reason for all my parents pain and wasted years. Right after my 17th birthday I got in an emotionally abusive relationship. I didnt know that at first. He reminded me of all the great parts of my dad. I thought he could fix me. By the time I realized he had cut me off from everyone in my life, he hit me too. He told me it was my fault for upsetting him. I believed him. 3 months later I got the courage to leave. My drinking got exponentially worse. I started starving myself for some semblance of control over my life. I didnt think I would live to graduate high school. I just didnt see my life continuing until then. I started hanging out with people in their 20s. I thought Id finally made it. They offered me cocaine for the first time and I started waking up for school still drunk from the night before. Then I turned 18. I lived the rest of my high school career drunk. I brought vodka into class in water bottles. Im not sure how I graduated but I did. I was sure I wouldnt live to get into college. And then somehow I did. Then I turned 19. The drinking and drug use got worse. I purposely sought out people who would make my behavior seem normal. I wanted to die more than ever before. I was sure I wouldnt live much longer. Whether by suicide or overdose, I was going to die. Two months before my 20th birthday I admitted myself into a mental hospital because I was scared I would kill myself. I couldnt leave my younger sister here alone. I needed to be safe from myself. When I got out, they gave me medication I couldnt drink on. I drank anyway. Life simultaneously got better and worse. I dropped out of school. I found peace. I found hell. I became a more abusive daughter, a more abusive sister, and a more abusive girlfriend. I was sure I wouldnt make it to 21 if something didnt change. On October 21st of 2017, I took my last drink of alcohol. I did my last line of cocaine. I smoked my last joint. I sought help. I did the work required of me to stay sober. I turned 21 four months later. I was sober. I survived 21 laps around the sun. Today, I turn 22. I am over a year sober from drugs and alcohol. I was just admitted into college. My amazing, patient, and loving boyfriend is buying us a house. I still dont know if my father loves me, but I know it doesnt matter. I know my worth is not contingent on how others treat me. Ive gone through trauma therapy for my childhood. I no longer want to die. I can go anywhere and do anything without being reminded of how much I hate myself. I no longer hate myself. I am free. If I wouldve have killed myself anytime over the last 8 years, I wouldnt know how beautiful life can be. I wouldnt know all that I can contribute to this world. I wasnt able to see that for so long. I was barely hanging on and many times I no longer wanted to. But I did. I stayed alive. I stayed alive through the pain, the heartache, the self-hatred, the shame, the guilt, and the suicidal thoughts. I didnt give up. And now, because I stayed alive, I get to live. Today, I am celebrating myself. I am celebrating the 22 years I have walked through, alone and with others. I am celebrating the vulnerability and courage it took to ask for help when I needed it. I am celebrating the fear Ive walked through to get here. I am celebrating the strength it has taken to continue onward all the times I didnt want to. All the times it would have been easier to give up. I have worked so hard to celebrate this birthday and I deserve to acknowledge myself for that. Life doesnt throw you a parade for living it so Im throwing one myself. Today, I reach a day I never wanted to reach. And today, I am darn proud of myself for reaching it. "

Not just physically, but emotionally too. We have been best friends, but in a way, only surface level. We have done everything together, from visiting his grandpa at the nursing home every Sunday, living together, having game nights with our families and being each others partner's to events. We both come from homes where feelings and thoughts are ""weird"" and ""not okay"". We both have also had really traumatic childhoods, so although we both love each other and don't want to live life without each other, we do don't know how to communicate or be ""vulnerable"". It's terrifying. Two years ago, I decided to get therapy and work through this stuff. I started going to a recovery program for trauma and I have made a lot of progress. I've changed my job to something with a more positive and healthy atmosphere and I've disconnected from anyone and everyone that was keeping me down. My boyfriend is still in that place and that's okay. It wasn't long ago that I was there too and so I know that it takes time to come to a place that you're willing to get help and find yourself. The thing that I'm realizing is that I'm very codependent and I feel that I would literally be lost without him. It's a long story short, but recently I reached this point of NEEDING this intimacy so badly from our relationship, something I haven't been getting in a long time. I've been doing all of these things to learn how to set boundaries, learning how to love him and be there for him, but also how to not get sucked back in to that place that I was before because it was even more empty and dark. I finally voiced that I would really appreciate if he considered getting help, even if it's couple's counseling not because anything is fucked up in his head or because he's messed up, but because we both deserve to overcome our past and experience vulnerability and love to the fullest capacity. But if we don't do anything, or if we both continue to let our depression take over our lives, we will never get better. It feels like for the first time, I am fighting with all my fight for myself and for another person. I have never attached to someone before and I'm so scared. He said YES to couple's therapy. I am so happy and so terrified at the same time, because I fear what I don't know. But I am so grateful that maybe this emptiness and lack of intimacy will go away. We have both never experienced that connection before, not with anyone including our parents, and I crave it so badly and it just means so much that he's willing too. I'm not sure if any of this makes sense, but I just wanted to let this all out. "
401,vulnerability,offmychest,Feel awful after being followed home and threatened,1,atabbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/atabbv/feel_awful_after_being_followed_home_and/,2019-02-22 10:51:22,"Hi all, I'm not sure where exactly to post this but I figure this place is as good as any. On mobile so apologies for any formatting issues. Keep in mind, in my country drivers that have had a licence for under a year have clearly marked symbols on the front and back of their car. I'm 18 years old, so my car is marked like that. Yesterday evening I was driving home - I live somewhat in the countryside in my country, so the area is very empty most times. I was about 5 minutes away from home when I pulled up behind a truck that was going 70km/hr in an 80km/hr zone. I waited until the road lines said I could pass him, and proceeded to do so - mid pass he speeds up to 80km/hr, and we began to enter a curve with me on the outside lane with a weak car. I sped up as best I could, but I saw a car crest the hell in front of us. I got a little further and tried to scooch back in to the correct lane, quite closely to the truck now behind me, who then lay on his horn. I kept going and left him behind. I ended up being stuck behind a school bus so eventually he caught up, and as we got closer to my home I noticed that he was still following me, so following my hunch I drove past my home and up the street. Still following. I ended up reaching a dead end with a little cul-de-sac U-turn at the end, and mid turn around he drives onto my side of the road and directly toward me, forcing me to hit the breaks. He then boxed me in and pulled up beside my window. This guy then berates me and asks if I knew if he's a cop, told me that the roads are dangerous, that he's lived here for 25 years etc etc etc. I was very afraid at this stage and so I meekly went along with it, hoping he would leave. The encounter only took about 5 minutes. He ended up asking where I live, and I simply told him 'up the road'. Upon leaving, I turned up a different street and waited for him to drive away before coming back down to my actual driveway. I was shaking and crying at this point. Here's the thing; he was definitely lying. I have lived here for my entire 18 years, and my family knows everyone who has lived here longer - of which there's about 3 or 4 families. He is not one of them. I also know as a fact that he is not a police officer, and instead a tradesman. I didn't want to call him on this in case it escalated the situation. But, even after my shakiness and crying died down, I just feel *awful*. Sick, in some ways. I can't explain the feeling, moreso just a complete sense of vulnerability. I was completely powerless to stop him following me home, or scaring me like he did. I'm angry and frustrated that I could do nothing - that I *should* have done something. That feeling is not going away, even the morning after the incident. I called out of work today as I'm afraid of driving again so soon. It just boggles my mind because all in all, it wasn't *that* bad right? Why am I so affected by this? I guess I'm just looking for some wisdom, or some justification as to whether I should be feeling this or whether I should get over it. I don't know, but I certainly hate this feeling of violation."

I was taking a sleeper train last night from Germany to Italy, I was alone in my cabin with the door locked for the majority of the journey. At the second stop maybe an hour into the journey a group of men perhaps in their late twenties (I am an eighteen year old female) got into the train and piled into the two carriages next to me. I was at the back of the train with no staff around for the majority of the trip. For the next five hours they ran up and down the aisle crashing into the doors, singing and banging on the walls and throwing beer cans. I didnt say anything partly because I was in a foreign country, partly because I didnt want to be seen to be overacting even though I had grounds that they were being noisy in the quiet hours and MAINLY because I was worried they would know that I had reported them and that would make me a target in some way. At two points in the night different men in the group tried to open my door and on find it locked tried to get me to open it and come out and talk to them. The thing is I feel bad for being afraid of a group of guys potentially just having some fun; I love having a drink with my mates, running around town, being generally wild and do feel hypocritical in this sense. I do have anxiety and I know this will be a big factor but I feel like there is little understanding from men as to why when I am alone, I become incredibly nervous when groups of men, particularly drunk men, scare me. Walking home and past a group of boys who go silent, football fans yelling and jeering through town on their way to matches, men on trains who dont want to sleep. I often text my friends, the majority of whom are male (for no particular reason just how its fallen) telling them Im nervous and usually I get a response of Youll be fine dont worry, hope youre okay or have you told someone? All of these are genuine, caring responses but I do feel like they just dont get that I genuinely am really scared, they dont get that hearing stories on the news of men who kill women or reject or provoke them prevents me reporting anything for fear of drawing attention to myself. I try to explain the stories, the reasoning, the cultures and my own defence mechanisms but I think because they know they would never actually hurt anyone even if they were being rowdy they assume neither would anyone else and therefore I shouldnt worry. Honestly Im not asking for them to change, just a rant to get it off my chest after last night. I also do want to make it clear I know this is unfair stereotyping based in my own vulnerability and does involve some hypocrisy; If I ever have to engage with groups of men I try to be as polite as possible and seem confident so they dont feel bad about scaring me (and dont see me as too vulnerable)"

I don't like the plan, but I thank them with all my heart for trying to make me enjoy the day. I'm sorry I can't reciprocate either because of lack or money or dedication, I'm sorry. "

It kind of a form of ddlg (daddy dom/little girl) but its not sexual (not that all ddlg is always sexual but yknow most the time it is). If you want more information you can look it up there are plenty of videos explaining it and whatnot. Im using a throwaway account because im honestly really embarrassed to even be talking about this but i need to get it off my chest or get some advice or something i dont know. Before i even knew cgl existed ive always been into little kid stuff, i have a extensive collection of stuffed animals and i like things reminiscent of my childhood/child like things. Fast forward to when i found out what ddlg and cgl is. The idea of cgl is appealing to me, i want to get out of the way i dont find doing ddlg sexually appealing at all. The idea of acting like a baby and getting a dick rammed up my ass is not arousing to me, at all. What is appealing to me is the vulnerability of cgl, being that open and having someone that takes care of me is what seems nice to me. ive never actually tried cgl because im too afraid to actually try it lol who knows maybe ill realize im not into it when i actually try it in a relationship. I seem really fucking weird and thats probably what the comments will tell me but whatever, have a nice day."

A lot of this is a bit unscripted as Im trying to be natural as possible so there might be a lot of rambling and very unorganized thoughts. &amp;#x200B; \--- I grew up as an extremely introverted guy and lived going through the safe route. Go to school, university and find work. I never had any relationships as I was always afraid of getting hurt and rejected. I never made any attempts to bond with new friends, at university and at my workplaces. Ive tried going to meetups but those were simply very difficult. I stuck with the same friends since high school. I was generally unsatisfied with my quiet life. After working for a few years after university, near the end of 2017 I decided to quit my job and travel the world. It was going to be one of those typical finding yourself and finding purpose trips. Ill try new things, fuck it. No one knows me out there, I can be whoever I want. And also, deep down, I wanted to experience love. I wanted to be realistic as possible with this. I knew the odds of me finding someone who I would fall in love with was near-nil. I left in March 2018 with my eventual ticket returning home December 2018  so 9 months in total. The trip was a blast  I finally did something *I* wanted and stepped out of the safe route. As glamorous as my trip seemed on Instagram, I still felt very alone. As an introvert, it was very hard for me to bond with others at hostels. Sure I hanged out with people, but at the end of the day, those were short friendships. Even though I tried changing myself, its very hard to change your real inner self. I was jealous of those who seem to be able to talk to anyone and made awesome friends on their trip. I wasnt able to do that. Despite hanging out with so many people, I never made a real effort to keep in real contact after. I was just happy to meet people but frustrated at myself for doing what was essentially the same thing as home  meeting new people *but not making a real effort* to form real friendship bonds. &amp;#x200B; \-- &amp;#x200B; Fast forward to August, its been about 5 months on my trip. I was getting a little tired of my trip but it was enjoyable nonetheless. I still at this point havent found love and knew from my experience so far, I probably wont find it. That was ok, Ive come to expect that. I was in Japan at this point and I loved Japan, it was a great time. On a specific day, I was lining up for a VR game in a VR Game facility in Tokyo where I saw this beautiful girl in line. Of course Im in a line, what can you truly expect to happen? Shes more eye-candy at this point. When I get to the front of the line with my friend, its a 4 player game so its myself, my friend, and the girl + her friend. I decided to talk to her friend since we were going to play together - it wouldnt hurt right? Just from this one conversation would unexpectingly lead to the love of my life. Lots of coincidences started lining up (which is another story in itself which I wont add here) and I started hanging out with the beautiful girl I mentioned earlier. Over the next few days/ weeks we would talk and learn more each other everyday. It was magical. I finally found a girl that was on my wavelength. We could talk for hours about anything, whether it was silly stuff or serious discussions. Ive never met anyone like this. We didnt have the exact interests, but we were very comfortable with each other. I loved the time we spent together. As I never had a relationship before (Im 26), I wasnt at times sure what to do. Should I be doing this or should I be doing that (being afraid of accidentally hurting her). Hey  it was my first time being in a relationship with a girl! But she was forgiving and wasnt afraid of voicing her opinions out. I loved how blunt she was  I learned so much from her about relationships. She made me very comfortable and told me not to worry too much. She herself (very similar age), had has numerous relationships and was just tired from it all. Forming relationships is a very tiring process  something I learned from her. And perhaps, since we were a similar age with the same background who grew up on the same side of the world, we had a lot to share together. I loved spending quality time with her, whether it was something as going out and exploring new stuff, or snuggling in a bed just watching some shows together. She was on vacation when I met her and I was backpacking  so obviously we couldnt be together the whole time. She eventually went home and at one point I confessed my love for her. She was everything I dreamed for and I fucking loved her. As much as people like to deny it, superficial requirements are really important when dating in this day and age  with all the dating apps we have. Everyone has their own personal list of requirements for a significant other. She ticked off so much things on my list it was scary. Shes beautiful, Im not joking. If everyone has a specific taste in terms of looks, she would be exactly match a lot of the features I would desire. I loved the way she dressed. I loved how she would get excited at the littlest things, and especially food! She would smile whenever she had food she loved. She didnt smile much but every time she did I loved it. She knew her around food, even obscure stuff and it was always interesting listening to her explain/describe it. I loved her down-to-earth she was, sometimes blunt, having a realistic approach to things. I loved how she truly loved her dogs and she showed it. Showing off her cute pups as they were her world. She would easily memorize and say random quotes or things from the shows she loved. I loved how giddy and excited whenever she did that (though she was a bit sad when I didnt get the reference  sorry!) I loved her self-awareness she has about herself, realizing that she was a big hypocrite in the things she said and did, as well as how it is hard for her to show empathy. I loved how she was open and non-judgmental to things. When it came things to our deepest desires and needs, she listened and didnt judge me for who I am. I loved how she wasnt afraid of doing the things she loved, like being a potato and binging shows on Netflix while eating tons of snacks. The list goes on Eventually she went home and I had to continue my adventure. I finally hit my peak at around October, about 6.5 months in of my 9 month journey. At this point I was tired of traveling. Traveling became the new routine and I was just sick of seeing new things and wanted to do things like I did back home. I became quite jaded at traveling. But one thing kept me going, and it was her. Even though I was in Asia and she was back in North America, we talked every single day even with the timezone differences. I would get up excited every morning to talk to her and made it through the day excited to talk to her in the evening. I loved talking to her, spending quality time, even though we were thousands of miles apart, together. We would talk about everything and anything. God I fucking loved it. From serious to flirtatious conversations. I wanted to learn more about her and everything about her. Eventually we made a plan to spend the last 2 weeks of my trip traveling together. I was so happy  and her as well. I wanted to see her again. I made it through everyday of my trip knowing that I would see her soon. She was keeping me going. I loved holding her hand while exploring new things, kissing her (awkwardly haha), seeing her smile at food, and cuddling with her at the end of a good day. \---- &amp;#x200B; I eventually met her again near the end of November. At this point I was nervous seeing her again  talking to her so much but finally seeing her in-person after months. This is the point of the story where everything starts going downhill &amp;#x200B;  As my journey was ending, a lot of worries started to pile up on me. Im a very forward looking person, always worrying about the future. She was more of a spontaneous-type person living in the moment. Questions such as what was going to happen to \[our relationship\] once we get back home (we live in different countries)? What was I going to do next after going through this adventure? Am I going to live at home and move somewhere else? Whats going happen to working? I didnt even know what was going to happen to me in 2019. *All this ambiguity was something I was NOT comfortable with and it brought* ***me so SO much*** *stress and anxiety*  and I unloaded it on her. I started feeling sick (also from minor food poisoning) and had constant headaches from constant worrying. My mind would have a battle in dealing with this thoughts. I would feel moody at times and hoped that she would notice and perhaps reciprocate. But of course realistically, she wouldnt know. How could she know? Shes not a mind reader  I had to communicate this to her. Communication is an important part of any relationship **and I failed at that**. From her point of view, I was being moody and refusing to talk to her for something she didn't do. Imagine traveling with someone like this for a minute  yea, it would be horrible! I would get agitated at random things and complain as well. Im sure youve all been on a trip where someone was like this. Its not fun. I was too busy wallowing in my own insecurities and problems that I didnt think of the repercussions it would have on her, on our relationship. We eventually met her best friend who moved back to his home country  her experience with him was ruined as well  because of moody me. Her second vacation of the year was ruined. Even when I got home it didnt get any better. I focused on catching up with friends and family that when she was feeling her worst (work was VERY bad for her at the time and she needed someone to be there for her), I wasnt there for her. All she simply wanted was me to give her some time and perhaps just listen or talk to her. Instead I was too busy spending time with friends and family during the times she was free to talk -- I didnt consider her feelings. In a relationship you have to keep in mind that it isnt 1-player anymore  its 2-players. You have to consider your actions to your partner as well. I truly fucked up here. You know what the most ironic thing about this? Every since I got home I was so stressed for her as well. I had sleepless nights/ daily headaches worrying about her. Despite this, I wasnt there for her when she needed me. Do I even deserve to be stressed for her when I didn't make an effort to be there for her? God damn. I eventually met her one last time over Christmas. I flew to her and we spent a few days together in her city. It didnt get any better. I was still wallowing from my own insecurities from earlier and a lot of my actions were simply not boyfriend material. I wasnt as romantic as before and constantly having battles in my head when I shouldve have focused on having **good quality time** with her. She was giving me another chance. One thing I did that really stood out that hurt her tremendously was that I would take the last pieces of food when we ate together. It wasnt like a casual take but rather I knew she would want it but would take it anyway. While it might sound totally stupid me saying it now, I was not sure what was wrong with me at the time. I wasnt thinking straight. By worrying about my own insecurities, I put my own needs in front of hers. If I couldnt do something as simple as sharing food, imagine what I would be like a boyfriend? As the days ticked closer to my flight home, I forced a kind-of ultimatum on her. I wanted to know what our relationship was and was going to happen next. She suggested we start over as friends and grow to like each other in a more natural-way (keep in mind our relationship was weird and not normal in most circumstances, weve only met each other on the road while traveling). I would stay in my country and we can continue to talk and learn more about each other and let things play out naturally. **This was a realistic answer**. However, me being stubborn wanted a more clear-cut answer. It was either I move down to her city and we can continue our relationship or nothing. She was giving me a realistic option. She wasnt pushing me away, but rather a fair option. I didnt listen and kept being stubborn and eventually it lead to the final words she told me out of frustration: The more you chase me, the more Im going to push you away. That was the slap in my face I needed. The slap I needed to make me aware of everything I was doing ever since I met her again. For the first time in a while, I broke down, cried my heart out. Everything I did, my stubbornness, my constant worry about things I shouldnt be worried about, broke us apart. The past 5-6 weeks, I showed a very ugly, and rather pathetic, side of me. \--- &amp;#x200B; **(Im going to call her K from now on)** She truly did love me. And I didnt reciprocate. A lot of the things we did over the stretch of our time together, she kept me in mind. We would do the things I wanted, she made small efforts to make me happy. She learned the little things that made me happy and did them for me. And you know what? I never said thank you for them. Thank you K. She took the time to try to truly understand me, learn about me. I feel like I didnt do enough of that for her. Thank you K. She gave me multiple chances in numerous situations and pointed out the things I did, especially when we met again on my last 2 weeks. Chance after chance I blew it. I appreciate and thank you for the fair chances youve given me. Thank you K. She gave me realistic advice multiple times. The first was the most ironic of them all. It was when I met her again and she told me to stop worrying and simply enjoy the time we had together. The trip was meant for us to have some **quality time together**. However, I was too worried about the future. How is this ironic? Well I entered this \[long\] trip telling myself not to worry about what happens after. This trip was meant to just to have fun without a worry, and that I'll tackle real-life when I get back home. Instead what did I do? Go against what I stood for and pushed all that worry onto a girl I love even though I told myself (and even she did as well) not to stress and enjoy the moment. Im sorry K. She opened her heart and vulnerability to me. Her love. **She trusted me**. Told me personal things that she had never told anyone else. What I didnt mention is that she suffers from depression, especially from her past relationships and neglect from her parenting. All of these events have caused her to close her heart to others. The fact that **she opened up to me, and trusted me**, and I blew it all away, was ***despicable***. I hurt her dearly and Im sorry for that. &amp;#x200B; \--- January/February has been the hardest months of my life. The fact that I hurt her so much still haunts me even to this day. And I admit I still think about her everyday. She has completely blocked/ignored me on social media so there is no more contact anymore. The fact that Im unemployed hurts as well even worse Im struggling with interviews since its been a year since Ive last worked. &amp;#x200B; I learned the best way I can apologize to her is to prove that Ive grown as a person from this experience. Actions speak louder than words. Me saying sorry to her wont help. I need to take what I learned and make myself a better person. Whether its my mannerisms, or habits to my next relationship. &amp;#x200B; \--- &amp;#x200B; I learned to enjoy more things in the moment. The little things, even theyre mundane. I remember one time she was sitting in front of the laundry machine watching it spin. I thought it was silly and told her it was stupid (something along the lines of that). I shouldnt have judged her for doing that. She was fascinated and if she enjoyed it, then I shouldve sat down with her and enjoyed the moment rather than ridiculing her for it. This also extends to me enjoying things in daily life. I would always say things are rather average or meh all the time or be the guy who would one up people and say oh Ive had something better in \_\_\_\_ city. Imagine hanging out with this type of person, how irritating this would be? Some people are just thankful to experience what I deem as average. I need to enjoy more of the things in front of me and rethink my thought process. Whether it comes to food or new activities. As long as I enjoyed it, and not compare it to a previous experience, thats all the matters. Enjoy the moment. Good vibes all around  &amp;#x200B; Silence is ok, and sometimes very beautiful. Dont feel pressured to talk when you dont need to. &amp;#x200B; The problem with guys is that were hard-turned to be problem-fixers. When I first learned about her depression I thought maybe I potentially help fix it. It doesnt work that way. I admit, I do NOT know what depression truly feels like. Im not going to pretend K, I truly dont know. What I learned that I shouldve been there for you. Whether if its you lost something that seems miniscule to others, like a pen or water bottle you liked, or if a customer yelled at you at work, or even accidentally dropping things. I shouldve been the person you could voice your frustrations or hug when it feels like the world is totally against you. Or to hold your hand to keep you up when you trip. Making everyday life just a bit more happy, together. I learned dont try to be a problem-fixer all the time, sometimes all you need to do is to simply **make quality time** for her. &amp;#x200B; One of the advice she has given me was to consider trying dating people, see whats out there and learn more about my own needs and wants (also how to be a better boyfriend). Ive started to make an attempt to meeting people now via dating apps with a completely new perspective. Come in any meeting with no expectations and simply enjoy your time together (another advice she gave me). Let things play it out naturally (like she suggested we start over as friends) and things will slowly fall into place. Forcing explicit expectations or ultimatums (like I did before) does not help. &amp;#x200B; Its not you and its not me. Its us. Us as a couple. Us as a team. Will we be happy together? Can we have fun together? This is what I think when I think of meeting people via dating apps. Like I mentioned before, a relationship is no longer a 1-player situation. Its 2-players. Your actions affect your partner. Ive come to keep in mind my actions that I do now. &amp;#x200B; Nothing is simply black and white. This crazy world is just chaotic, anything could happen. This is what I learned from just traveling. Do you remember how we first met? All the coincidences that had to line up for our eventual meeting in a queue line in a VR game station in Tokyo? The end of one thing doesnt mean the end to all ends. It could lead to a beginning of a new beautiful journey. I need to be comfortable with ambiguity, sometimes we can't control what happens to us. It is what it is. &amp;#x200B; Ive always stuck to the same stuff I was comfortable with. How about trying new things? Try things youve always wanted to try? Ive recently tried to do new things. Some are bigger and some just sound silly but everyone moves at their own pace. No need to judge. Everyone has their own battles. I used to always watch only anime and never bothered to watch more popular non-anime shows that a lot of my friends/co-workers watched. Ive expanded out and Ive recently finished The Office and started on Parks and Rec. I wouldve never watched these shows before but I do like them! I never tried venturing beyond the music Im accustomed to, mostly BGM for video games and various Jpop Ive encountered from watching anime. I used to seek them out but anything beyond these 2 categories, Ive never really made an attempt. I recently got a Spotify subscription and will try to broaden my horizons to different music. Listen to a little bit everyday and form my broader music interests. So far I do like a little EDM with dance pop. Theyre catchy! Ive always wanted to try eating at all the new restaurants in my city. Whats stopping me? I should just go do it! Make an effort to! (which I have!) If I cant find anyone, thats ok  I do what I want to do. No judgement on doing things alone. I started going to the gym constantly which I havent done before (doesnt everyone do this after a breakup haha?). It isnt about gaining that sexy body but getting into good habits and routine. From my travels, one thing I desired that many other people had that I didnt  language. Learning my own mother tongue is a great place to start, especially when I have easy support from my parents. &amp;#x200B; But most of all, be happy with myself, and what I've accomplished. If I can't love myself, then I won't be able to love another person. This is all for now, I cant expect to do 10 things at once, its just unrealistic. One step at a time. &amp;#x200B; \--- &amp;#x200B; Of course Im not reinventing myself, but changing my perspective in life. Whats important is that I keep true to myself, and my own identity. Im just improving the rough edges , making myself more interesting as a person. Im not going to make a fake me to satisfy K. I see her as an equal and respect her. She loved me, and I have friends/family that still stick with me all these years. I have good qualities that I tend to keep. I still love K very much, even to this day. Im not afraid to admit it. I love you K. But I think this is time apart for me to focus on myself. Though I feel like utter shit these days (especially with no work!), Ive been trying to stay optimistic, but its very hard. However Im still alive and still standing. Tomorrow will be better. &amp;#x200B; I feel a lot better typing this out and I know I need to let go of the past. I can only look toward the future. Of course, I  need to let go of you too. It wont be easy, and Im impressed of how youve been through so many relationships and still manage to keep your head high. Its goddam hard. I know I may be romanticizing here, but I loved this quote from The Office since I know you love the show: I didnt find the perfect moment because I think today is about just having today. And I think were one of those couples wholl have a long story when people ask how we found each other. I will see her every now and then, and maybe one year shell be with somebody and the next year Ill be with somebody and its going to take a long time  and then its perfect. Im in no rush. &amp;#x200B; Keep watching me K."

Theyre constantly making new programs tor purchase, and theyre literally all the same while claiming to be getting closer to true spirit communication. If thats true, then why not just update the old ones? Nope, gotta extort more money from gullible people. Its like iPhones. When I was 15 I blew 80 dollars in two of those programs. Yes, TWO. 50 bucks for one, 30 for the other. The Impossible Box &amp; Ethereal. The Impossible Box plays reverbd reversed multilanguage radio sounds that vaguely sound like actual words. Ethereal is literally a bank of words behind said by recognizable text-to-speech voices. Anyways, back to Huff. He puts out videos CONSTANTLY. Theyre all the same. He asks questions to his overpriced speaker (called a portal) which I think he also sells stuff for (so even MORE scam-erific!) and then the pareidolia ensues. And when a celebrity dies, he takes advantage of their fans emotional vulnerability and puts out a video where he talks to that celebritys ghost. Him and Anthony Sanchez are major pieces of shit, and Im so surprised that no one has ever called them out on a large scale. URL URL"

Youre Now in Line. There are 62 people ahead of you. Im not exactly sure if I am a bonafide suicidal case, but theres definitely something wrong. I also spent a large chunk of my day in mild, detached panic about the possibility of also presently being in a coma, as after a hefty 8+ hour day of scrolling, it seemed my phone battery was stuck at 39% and surely, surely, this was an indication of a glitch in the matrix, in my matrix, and I would wake up shortly and be allowed to begin anew, loved ones I hardly remember gathered round in careful anticipation of my awakening. I did not entertain this fantasy for long, thankfully. There are now 54 people ahead of me in the queue. Time for a cigarette. 45 now. Best hurry. Come on, move. I made it. Now Im smoking a cigarette. Now Im worried about the approaching queue while Im out here crouched beneath the walkway of my apartment building, hiding from the rain with my cigarette and unwashed hair. Back in. 35 people. There was nothing to fret about all along. I think about sharing my vulnerability with someone, with multiple someones, with some sort of audience, and that my ability to admit to my expansive, perhaps shocking, defects of character would progress my art in ways that I couldnt presently fathom, and I would find myself fulfilled, able to surpass personal barriers, but the nature of such a fantasy alone is marred by a bravado I possess which invalidates the idea of vulnerability altogether. 33 people. This line is absolutely crawling. I will fetch a glass of water. I vacillate wildly between bouts of extreme discipline and progress, and days lost to smart phone addiction, the occasional crippling hangover, or pacing in righteous indignation about some injustice on the news or other. I am a very toxic person. I am often negative, but because my negatively is sometimes proven justifiable by an ability to assess a situation with pretty good clarity, I experience schadenfreude when proven right, even if the experiencer of the misfortune is myself. What Im trying to say is, my whole damn head is helplessly shoved up my own ass. 29 people. I hope all these people are getting the help they need.

When I was five, my uncle gave me his handgun and told me to shoot him. I tried to pull the trigger, but it was too heavy to be able to shoot. I met my dad again when I was seven, we moved to another country but it just didnt feel like I had a dad.

Most days I'm fine, it's when I go to bed and my sheets still smell like you or when I hear that song that I was obsessed with when I was obsessed with you or I think I saw you in the crowd because u always wore that grey beanie, those are the times my heart skips a beat. I realised my mind moved on but my heart was stagnate. Some twisted part of me is okay with it though because I think I can feel like this forever because I dont want to lose hope. But that's wrong and I know it. You want me to believe you dont have feeling for me anymore... but I catch you looking at me sometimes. No one knows what really happened that one night, but we do. That is something neither of us will forget. This game we play where we try and convince each other there's nothing between us is pointless, but I'll keep playing.

Her mom was controlling to the point of paranoia. Traumatic life that shes never worked on. Mom doesnt *try* to be the source of conflict and problems, but she ends up being so through passive-aggressive means. Her mental health symptoms dont help much either. Shes a hoarder, which pisses off Dad because while he, too, gathers things, his things are squared away and frequently used in fabrication or repair, while my moms junk is in chaotic messes that only get bigger. Dad hes utterly fucked up. He grew up in a hovel with a dirt floor without a father - that is, until he was 12, his dad suddenly appeared with airplane tickets and visas. He was never good enough for his father. He volunteered during Vietnam to get away from him - which failed epically when a military doctor administered the wrong medication and -poof- Dad has been permanently maimed without ever setting foot in theater. Dad was no saint, despite the sacrifices he made. He worked 100+ hour weeks, 51 weeks every year, for several decades. Dad was physically and verbally abusive towards everyone in the family. Mom abused us in the same way, Im guessing to lash out by punching down. Childhood sucks plenty when youre bullied incessantly at school, like I was basically from the day after I entered grade 1 to a couple months before grade 12s end. I can count the number of friends I had during those 12 years on two hands. When coming home just compounds the problems, how can anyone end up OK after that? I live my life either in terror or in the pursuit of avoiding confrontation of that terror. Comedy honestly saved my life more than once. I want companionship, but my childhood taught me that opening up and allowing yourself vulnerability is nothing but an invitation to be attacked. I want love, yet I cannot love myself because I got the message from all sides that I am worthless. I can barely socialize with people thanks to a light case of autism (PDA, to be specific). I want success, yet I am not able to fail safely because of a life of failing hard. When I try to find work, something about me instantly turns off recruiters. If they see me, I'm not sure whether it's my weight, my fugly face (nose and browbone have both been broken), or an air of despair. If they just see an application, once I'm rejected, my fucked up brain says it's because I cratered the crafting of the resume. Ive been diagnosed with an entire alphabets worth of mental health disorders. I take half a dozen head meds every day, and the best they can do is get me to a bare minimum level of function. (And before anyone says anything, fuck you, before I took the psych drugs I was suicidal enough to be committed.) I see a therapist every week, and a shrink twice a year, and the progress Im making is slower than tectonic plate activity. All I can do most nights is curl up in my bed, laptop on my leg or phone in my hand, and take weed to numb the physical and psychological pain. My mind is so troubled reading a book is a herculean task. Even typing THIS much has been painful. Damn it, Im tired of living this way. Im damn near tired of \_living\_. Not that I really do so - I simply *exist*. I know, youre trapped in a cage made of your past. Cages are designed *to* trap the occupants, prevent flight. As far as the cage in my head is concerned Ive been busted so often that I have stopped trying to escape. &amp;#x200B;"

I feel like I need a lot of people to know... because she; who we'll refer to as The Count, means that much to me. I met The Count nearly 2 decades ago, and my mom introduced us as one another's cousin. We were 10 at the time. We drifted in and out of each other's lives because we didn't live in the same area. During highschool we talked for a bit, but drama happened. Late fall 2014 rolled around and we started talking again. I remember coming across her on Facebook , and wondered what The Count was up to. I was genuinely curious, and so instead of lurking her profile, I reached to her. I reached out to The Count, and we started talking. We talked about what happened in highschool, and decided we both matured and didn't discuss any further. FYI, I was the one to cut ties at the time, and it was because of embarrassment over something I lied about. Over the course of several months, The Count and I would make plans to hang out with each other, but those plans were always falling through. I noticed it at one point, and wondered if it was me that was always calling the plans off and if I was actually that busy, but I concluded I wasn't. I didn't put much thought into after that. End of spring 2015 came and The Count and I finally hung out. I enjoyed her company. Over the course of the year, we spent a lot of time with one another and eventually labeled ourselves as best friends. Yes, we are cousins, but I think we identify as best friends before anything else. Back to expressing my gratitude for having The Count as my best friend. Summer 2017 came around and we were talking at a lookout we were sitting at, and The Count reminded me of the time we started talking again, and reminded me of how we never could follow through on our plans to hang out. The Count went onto explain that she was the one that purposely cancelled on me, until one day, a few months later, she decided she trusted me enough. After being told that her reason for doing this was to test me, to see if I'd stick around, I couldn't help but feel like a VIP.. I remember thinking to myself that this girl is my best friend because we both out our trust into eachother, and she made herself vulnerable enough to tell me what happened. That moment of vulnerability, like the many that we have shared, just added to our growing, twinkling string of sparkly lights. This girl, The Count, has literally seen me at my worst, where I have done some of the worst things, that hurt so many people, and she still stuck around to see me through it all. She has stuck by my side when I was sure I was going insane, when I ended up quite depressed, when I go through bouts of depression and when I see nothing but bleakness in my world. The Count stuck around for the shit storm that my life became August 2017, and despite everything that has happened since then, she is still here. Still rolling with the punches. I know she appreciates the support, love and kindness I give her, but I just hope she knows how much she means to me. The Count, if you come across this, I am grateful for your presence in my life and I appreciate you down the the tiny specks of star dust that make up the generously loving, wholehearted being that you are. Tldr: a fantastic person I met nearly two decades ago is my best friend, who's star dust (everything that makes, her, her) means everything to me. The Count has earned a permanent stop within my heart. "

Connecting with people on an emotional level is probably the most important thing you could do as an individual. However, I have a friend who takes the liberty to vent out a list of emotional baggage to me thru text. Without any sort of prompt or context. I am now faced with two scenarios: ignore the texts and feel guilty for not giving emotional support, or try to find the words to reply and become emotionally drained by the end of it. Vulnerability is a two-way street. While its great that my friend trusts me enough for them to unload their woes onto me, I am unfortunately caught off-guard. It just seems like an abuse of friendship. I cannot be an open-for-business therapeutic friend 24/7, regardless of how rewarding it feels to give grounding emotional support. It just has to be earned. My best advice I could give my friend is to seek a professional therapist to help them. However, I have received a cold response last time I tried to suggest that. Understandable I suppose, its not easy to submit like that. But therapy is not a last resort or a sign of weakness. Everybody alive today could benefit from counseling of some sort."

They may not know it and I cant show it well being 3 hours away from them but it really tore me apart not being able to help in some way today. But it really got me thinking about the vulnerability and impermanence of life and it just flat out scares me. How easily this can all be taken away. How our lives are so fragile and we play with them like toys even if we dont mean to. It scares me to know that in an instant I can be lifeless and broken and never even know what happened. Or worse that I know my end is coming and I just know I'd be in fear the entire time. I sent a text to my brother and his wife letting them know they are my best friends. I told my fraternity that I value everything they have done for me and I feel blessed to be surrounded by such wonderful people. I told my (fairly new) girlfriend that my day made me realize how much i care about my friends so I wanted to let her know that I cared a lot about her too. It has just been a surreal day and it reminded me how close that edge really is. "

Id like it if someone listened, even if its just once.",1,agh3fg,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/agh3fg/i_want_someone_to_know_who_i_was_before_i_die_id/,2019-01-16 14:42:12,"I was the youngest of four by far. An entire decade, a medical miracle. My mother had so many medical and fertility problems they thought she would never be able to get pregnantand there I was. From all the drugs she had been taking for her illnesses, unknowing she was pregnant, the doctors believed Id come out severely physically and mentally disabled if she didnt miscarry me in the first two months. They told her to abort me and she refused. If it dies, she said, then it diesbut as long as it lives I wont kill it. She fought for my life. She jogged a mile every morning. She pushed past the morning sickness and forced herself to keep living. Without going too far into detail, with all the sicknesses she had, she couldve easily given up and died along with me. No one wouldve blamed her. She suffered. She hated being pregnant, yet she put up with the tests. She was determined she would carry me to life. And then I was born. Physically whole. No deformities. The doctors were shocked and maybe a little disappointed (there went their prize-winning case study research papers.) But I grew up. No mental handicaps, as far as they could tell. In fact, they said, I would be a smart child. And I followed the smart child path. I did the GATE program in elementary. I skipped a grade and passed my classes with ease. I devoured books like nothing else. And then I was molested by a family friend. And then I had a tumble that caused damage to my frontal lobe. And then puberty hit, and my skin degraded into a mess of acne and oil. My secondary sex traits began developing, and I was horrified and disgusted with the changes. Unbeknowst to my family, I started seeking things that would help me cope with what had happened to me. I read sexual assault stories that had been romanticized, written for pleasure, even though they made me sick. I read things that children shouldnt read because they made me feel that maybe what had happened to me wasnt sick and wrong and disgusting. That maybe it was good. Maybe I was normal, and I could stay normal. Maybe it was perfectly healthy to see and hear and have things like that happen to you. I entered middle school. My mother, who had traumas of her own, began to turn violent. I still dont know what triggered it. Was it a new medication? A symptom of something I wasnt privy to? A silent grief that had sprung a leak? I still dont know. But she became physically abusive. She insisted on washing my groin for me, even though I cried and told her her fingernails hurt where they scraped me. She pulled my hair and beat my body with a hairbrush, then my face and my head. She told me she was ashamed of having me. She asked me why I wasnt more like my siblings. She told me I was a burden, that I wasnt the only one depressed, that there were people who had real reasons to be depressed and I wasnt one of them. My siblings had long since abandoned me to live their own lives in college, in the army, with a family. I was alone to suffer her. These were the worst years of my life. I began dissociating. I didnt care about my appearance, so I began to lapse. I started having delusions. I fantasized about killing myself everyday. I loathed having to come home. I flinched everytime I heard the squeak of her chair that meant she was getting up. I began failing my classes. Then came my second sexual assault. Thats when I began truly, really deteroriating. I started fantasizing that I was an angel in a past life that had sinned against God, and this was my punishment now. I mustve been an angel that made humans suffer, I thought, and so God incarnated me into a wrong, horrible body to show me what human suffering was. I was deep into psychosis. I confessed to a counselor that I wanted to kill myself and was escorted by a police officer to a hospital. I was terrified. I just wanted to go home. I wanted to take it all back and pretend I hadnt said it and that I was normal. I ended up staying three days in a shitty mental facility and it was truly awful. I felt like a different person there, a crazy among crazies. Our bedsheets were practically paper. Visiting days were once a week and I wasnt allowed a change of clothes, so I wore the same disgusting clothes for the three whole days. Every moment we werent allowed privacy. The nurses had to watch us shower and eat. The doctors wanted to diagnose us so they could profit off our prescriptions. I felt like I was truly going crazy, like I was suffocating. The walls in the outdoors area were too high. *I dont belong here,* I kept thinking frantically. *Im not like them. I didnt really want to kill myself. I just want to have some peace. That doesnt make me crazy. Please just let me leave.* I lied to the doctors and told them I was alright and they let me go home. I had missed three days of schoolwork and I fell far behind. My closest friend berated me for going there and told me she had a panic attack upon hearing I was taken. She said she had told everyone I was missing, and now what was she going to say? I had made her look stupid. Meekly, I apologized. She was my friend after all. I went to a psychiatrist afterwards, as mandated upon my release from the hospital, and she diagnosed me with a whole host of illnesses. PTSD explained the nightmares, the triggers, the avoidance, she said. BPD explained the mood swings, the unstable relationships, my attention seeking. OCD explained my ticks, my thought processes, my intrusive thoughts. A hesitant question of if I had ever been diagnosed with autism. I said no. She hmmd, tapped her pen against her clipboard. Well look into it more, she said. I stopped coming because I hit a plateau. For a while, I felt euphoric. I was telling her everything! Finally, someone who understood! Who could give a name to the things I had struggled with! But in the end, it meant nothing. The euphoria faded. I was still the same person with the same problems in the same cycles. I began to wonder if it was me, after all. If perhaps there was an innate problem with me that prevented me from being happy. I went through high school. I dont remember most of it. Then I went to college. I was forcibly detained for a unsuccessful suicide attempt and hospitalized for the second time. I dropped out and went back home to live with my parents like an abject failure. Something is wrong with me, Im sure. I want to be loved and touched and held, but I can never bring myself to ask for it. I justify it by thinking, *well, love must be voluntary, freely given*, but the other side of that is *and no one has given it to you, so you must not deserve it.* I am so touch starved it hurts me. My physical appearance is nothing to speak of. My friends, if you can call them that, are busy with their own lives. Busy away from me. We were only friends in high school, after all, because we were in close proximity. Now that were not, they no longer need me. Theyre busy with the newer, shinier progress and growth of their lives. I dont mean to make myself the victim in that either. People simply grow apart, and I dont fault them for it at all. Its just that I believe that I exist on a lower plane than most people. They are capable of becoming happy, of growing as people. They can love and confess and do things without becoming paralyzed with anxiety at the change in their life. They are normal and healthy and happy. They can bounce back. They can grow past things. I keep getting stuck in ruts. I used to love making art, writing stories and poems to match the colorful characters I churned out. I dont have that anymore. I cant draw. I cant write. My talent, wherever it went, either never existed or has jumped ship. I keep getting taken advantage of every time I show my vulnerability, or I am rejected. So then I withdraw all my vulnerability and act surprised when I am told I act like I dont care. When Im read as arrogant or cold. I want to love people and be loved and not be scared of it. I just want someone to tell me they love me and mean it, and not have to be obligated to do it. Love means nothing if you have to force it out of someone. But Im terrified of asking for it. I want to stop being apathetic and tired and feeling creatively drained. I want to stop being depressed. But simply the knowledge that I have to live with this forever, that there is something unfixable and broken and uncurable within me that I have to cope with forever that most others dont, makes me feel like its hopeless. One wrong tragedy could reverse years of therapy and counseling, and for what? Money and time and hope snatched away from you in a second. And then what did you spend all that time for? I just want to be loved. I just want to be able to love myself and believe in myself. I want somebody to tell me they would really miss me when Im gone and really mean it. Not just saying it to appease me or to feel better that theyve tended to the little sick weak link in society. I would rather someone directly and honestly tell me they wish I was dead if it meant I wouldnt have to suffer anymore than give me false, uncomfortable hope. But I feel the only way you can see when people will miss you, when they really miss you, is after you die and they cant use you anymore. Ive said my piece now, I think. Ive said enough. Ive opened myself to a veritable flood of internet strangers with questionable intentions and for what? Three and a half people to read this and comment that they feel sorry I was born. Ha. Sorry. I promise I try not to be negative when Im talking to people. In fact, nobody knows right now that Im considering swallowing a bucketful of cancer patient grade painkillers after this. Ironic, right? You struggle so much you think people must be able to tell. It must be obvious to everyone but yourself, you think. But when no one reaches out of their own will and no one asks you if youre okay, you start to think maybe they just dont care. And perhaps its more comforting to accept this then to hold onto a hope thatll never be fulfilled. I just wanted to get this off my chest before I died. Ha ha. Sorry. One last pun. If you read this whole thing, then Christ, congratulations. It must not have been easy to wade through my run-on sentences. Apologies to any grammar sticklers out thereI guarantee there will no more crimes for you to nitpick soon enough. Im just screaming, at this point, into the void. I dont know if any of you would know, but before you accept you die, theres this beautiful, crystal clear rush of joy and wonder that everything will be over soon. What am I saying? Of course none of you know, lol. Youre obviously alive if youre reading this. (Unless theres a computer ghost, in which case... get off of depressing reddit forums and scare some Ouija playing teenagers! Im sure itll be more entertaining.) I hope t gets better. I really do. It was nice talking to you."
415,vulnerability,offmychest,I hate it when people ignore the homeless simply because they feel guilty or uncomfortable.,1,ahixxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ahixxm/i_hate_it_when_people_ignore_the_homeless_simply/,2019-01-19 15:45:27,"I was walking out of a Detroit Tigers game. Let me start by saying Detroit is dying. Homeless people are **everywhere**. Most people who go to Tigers games arent from Detroit. Its a Michigan thing to Head to the tigers game! As if its a huge deal and worth driving 5 hours one way. So a lot of these people end up avoiding or ignoring the homeless people. I even did it for a time in my life. I felt this weird sense of guilt whenever I saw a homeless person. Was it because I grew up middle class? Or that I knew I wasnt able/Generous at the time in order to help them? I dont know. But that all changed when I met Marcus. Walking out of the Tigers game, there was a homeless person or group of homeless people around every 50 feet. We had to walk around a half mile to our car to get home. (I was with a group of friends) Every time I passed a homeless person, I felt an enormous source of guilt. And then I had an epiphany. When we dont help the people who need us most, we dont hold up our own belief in our goodness as a person. Most people would say they are a good person. But would a good person really ignore these desperate people? So the next homeless person I saw, I approached and talked to him. He was a skinny black man with tattered clothes. Hanging his head between his legs next to a lamp post. My friend instantly switched her purse to the other side. She said to keep going, but I decided to talk to the man. Marcus was his name. Ill never forget it. I could tell from the moment I met his eyes that this man was broken. The look on his face reminded me of the same look that I once saw when I struggled with depression and suicide years back. The eyes barely holding on to life. Just pleading for someone to love him. His own mortality hanging on a thin string, fragile enough to be cut by the slightest hint of scorn or hatred. I asked him what his story was. He told me. It was wild. His house burned to the ground because he left his stove on by accident. He lost everything. His car. His job. His home. He had nowhere else to go, and was on the street for around a month. He had been abused as a child, and had just started to see his life look up when it literally burnt to the ground. I asked him how he was doing, and he said that he didnt have the will to live anymore. He told me he was contemplating suicide that night. I asked him if I could share my story. He said yes and I gave him the entire journey I went though to climb out of depression and suicide. I told him that while we went through different experiences to get that low, we are both human and that I understand him. He mentioned how he found God a few months back. I am a Christian and I asked him If I could pray with him. The look in his eyes when I said this brings me to tears every time I think of it. It was as if I had cracked open the dark shell of a man he was and peered into his very soul. A person wanting love and affection, but without any at all. We prayed that night and I bought him dinner. I ended up talking with him for around an hour and a half. I told him that even if his parents didnt love him, he is still deserving of love and value. I told him that whether its the universe, God, or a person. Somewhere, on this big earth, there is something or someone that cares for Marcus. And that it was his job to go and find it. I gave him the address and numbers of resources for the homeless. He told me that if I had not come by and spoken with him that day, he would have left this earth only hours later. My point is this. **the homeless are the most human of all of us** they have nothing to distract them from their own fragility and vulnerability. They live in the very place we are all desperately afraid of. Its not a physical place, but a emotional state of complete openness without anything to hide. They are suffering for all the world to see. They wear no masks, they dont put up a facade. They know more of what life is capable of than all of us. We have a lot to learn from them. And we have a lot to give. Why not give a hello? "

I had problems connecting to people all my life. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I'm Now at some weird self doubt point I really don't want to be. I lost my self worth and through that the respect and interest of others as well as a girl I love. I can't belive I'm at such a point feeling so weak and can't keep up a steady positive attitude. Bad things aside I'm intelligent, loving, caring, compassionate, have a great humor also the humor thing got lost for a while and have a great personality when I open up. It's really interesting to be at this point as well.. I mean I think it started to get to this point because I didn't want to outshine others. Or I thought when I noticed my greatness that it's not good to be that way and rather be humble and stay small. Or I didn't want to take someone the girl away. Wtf it's self doubt disguised as wanting to help others or being 'good'. It's a self sabotaging mindset and destined to fail and achieving annihilation of dignity and worthyness. After that it just snowballed. I feel like all other people are on a different wave length. And to view my situation from a point of that it's just temporary : holy shit is it fucking scary down here guys. This is not a place I would wish my worst enemy. This path leads to loss of openeness, vulnerability, humor, assertiveness, happy Ness, relaxed mindset, your not standing up for urself and most important of all: it leads to a loss Of friends because a guy without selfworth is seen as worthless. It's like a self fulfilling prophecy. You can have worth or not. The power of us lies in not getting comfortable at this place. Not settling at this place as a destination. But rather as a short stop to learn stuff bout life and that it can be really painful to. Not have many or any meaningful and really deep connections to other humans. This path got me the worst feeling and self talk, war in my head you name it - I had in my whole life. It's really scary how much power thoughts have and at the same time it is importing to learn that. Choosing the words you use in your head wisely and carefully is so important I can't emphasis enough on it. Every little filling word or extra word in a sentence will bring a slightly different meaning and effect. It's simply magic taking place and unfolding right in front of us. Doubting myself was the worst decision of my life. But I made it. Conciously or not. With good intentions or not. I MADE THE DECISION. And the best thing : we are made to shine. We are made to be happy, relaxed, secure. It can snowball into your own greatness if you let it. I think I won't be on the level of self esteem And selfworth I know intuitively iam capable of in the next month. But I know I will get there at some stage of my life. If i really want to achieve it no matter what, I can make it. Dare to dream Dare to fantasize positively And invent your future with the gifts and tools you got If you made it so far. Thank you for reading. This was the first time I actually wrote down what's on my Mind on a bigger scheme in this life than I would usually do. "

Just to have someone - even if it's just one person - peek into the chaos of our own minds. There have been some massive changes in my life over the past few months that have left me in that very cliche black hole of self realization. My life is pretty fake. I figured out at a young age that there is a lot of truth to Life (the board game). If you have a clear destination/goal then it isn't that hard to map out a path to get there. Well, being in my early 20's I have arrived at my destination. Or at least I'm in the home-stretch. I don't know where to go from here. Life wise, career wise, and relationship wise. The proper place to go is most likely a psychiatrist. I've created such a foundation for myself, most likely a huge over-correction from things I've experienced in my childhood. But a foundation none the less, and it makes my family so proud. Their pride adds to the weight, along with the rest of my world and my never-silent brain. I can just feel cracks spreading in my being, and it's something I've never had to address because I was always trying to fix someone else. But now it is just me against myself.

Work made me come back two days later and within a week they put me on forced leave as I ""wasn't coping"" Month and a half later my life is just shit. I've been diagnosed with acute stress disorder with features of severe ptsd and anxiety. I can't function. My life is constant anxiety, stress and exhaustion. I've been put on a cocktail of medications that do nothing to help, just make me groggy. I feel so much anger towards my workplace as I later found out this person had had an extreme history of violence against animals and threats to hurt people. I was told they were meant to have at least one guard present at all times but work decided it was too expensive. I was given no debrief or counselling until 6 weeks post trauma from a third party. Some Work colleagues have been mocking me and basically stating I need to learn to cope and get over it. I wish I could. I hate what this has done to me. I've always been a strong person, I can't believe how much it's all changed from one event. I know it will get better with time. But I feel like something has been taken and no matter how good it gets, this trauma will always be there when it shouldn't have happened. Sorry for the long post, I just needed to get this off my chest. I don't feel like I can really talk to anyone, besides healthcare professionals, about it. "
420,vulnerability,offmychest,"I knew my online friend was catfishing, but I still met up and hooked up with him",1,ajkvci,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ajkvci/i_knew_my_online_friend_was_catfishing_but_i/,2019-01-25 14:29:47," Sorry if this sounds fucked up, it's hard to tell anyone about it. I'm a 20 year old guy who's part of a certain gaming community. I've had girlfriends, some of whom I've met from the same gaming circle. I also have a group of about 10 good friends I know from this game, and were extremely close. Some time ago, I started talking to a girl who Ill call Jamie. She was an okay person, seemed rather friendly and helpful towards our in-game guild, and she eventually joined our raids. I usually try to make friends with everyone I can, and listen to whatever problems they may have to get off their chest; since I used to grow up in a broken family where my parents were never around, and I had no friends. I had always wished that one day I would be able to help similar people get through difficult times. Jamie and I became close and she started sharing much of her personal problems with me, including social anxiety, frequent bullying during her school days, abusive parents many of which I relate to. She was, however, very emotionally unstable and occasionally abusive towards her friends. She frequently overthinked, was clingy as hell, and got upset over minor things and threatened to harm herself. After a few months together she seemed to have improved and I later found out she developed a crush on me. To be honest, Id be lying if I said I didnt have any feelings in return. (since youve already read the title, you can guess how this goes) See, Jamie was rather careless and once accidentally linked some identifying info in our discord chat. By asking friends and doing a little digging, I found out that Jamie was in fact a guy my age. She always wanted to meet me for lunch, and I finally obliged. Before that, I made sure to let her know that I found out she was actually a he. He was shocked but took it rather well. He admitted that the only thing he lied about was his gender, but everything else about him  his insecurities, his emotions and background  were all true. Surprisingly, nothing really changed between us. We became good friends, met up frequently for movies and coffee, and occasionally hung out at each others houses when nobody else was home. He was rather handsome, had a baby-ish face and high voice, and seemed more feminine than masculine to me, especially considering his online persona. One day when we were at his place, he told me that growing up being an outcast in school, he always had crushes on girls but never had the courage to approach any of them. Being a girl online made it much easier to make friends, but he slowly realized that he started developing feelings for the guys who treated him well. Apparently, I was Jamies closest friend and the only online friend hed ever met. He then confessed that he really loved me and felt really conflicted over having gay feelings. Up till that point I still cant really explain what was going through my head. It was an unexplicable affection I had for Jamie that made me move on my own. The next thing I knew, we were hugging and kissing and fondling each other. It led to us having sex later that night, and it felt weird but amazing. I felt guilty for many reasons. Up till that night I had never even considered the possibility that I wasnt straight. But I knew that I would never want to be in a long term relationship with a guy. But here I was, with a beautiful guy who I absolutely enjoyed sticking my penis in, and enjoying getting fucked in return. I felt like I was cheating his feelings and taking advantage of his vulnerability. Till today, I still feel that way. We eventually parted for reasons unrelated to sexuality (mainly arguments over petty stuff, and him being controlling and overly emotional). He was devastated and threatened suicide many times, and constantly accused me of raping him, robbing his virginity and taking advantage of him. I'm ashamed to admit it but I probably did, and I feel like a terrible person. We're no longer in contact now. He remains the only guy I've ever had a romantic and sexual relationship with, and also the only guy I've ever been attracted to; all other men turn me off sexually. To be honest, I still crave the sex with him sometimes. I'm now happily married to a girl I love very much and we have two beautiful children. I'm still struggling to come to terms that I've hurt another human being very much, and I probably willingly took advantage of him. I've done a horrible thing, and at least it's finally off my chest.

421,vulnerability,offmychest,I Used to Worry Way Too Much Over Everything and It's Gone to a Breaking Point,1,akodv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/akodv3/i_used_to_worry_way_too_much_over_everything_and/,2019-01-29 02:19:52,"Lately -- no, frequently for most of my life (up till I got over it recently), I would always feel accident prone towards my own thoughts and that would lead me to worry in an anxietec matter about the little things. These type of scenarios would tend to occur in social situations (in public areas, school, etc). I would worry over what people thought of me all the time which led me to be somewhat antisocial with a low self-esteem. I felt like that other people's opinions on me were way more important than what I even thought about myself somehow, and that actually left me vulnerable to bullying. People would manipulate me into being their friends just so they could conduct physical/verbal abuse upon me; people wouldn't notice because the manipulators would implement this fake scenario where we're really good and friends and we're just play-fighting for the sake of it. The worst part about it is the vulnerability of the certain individual going through this situation, because their mindset makes them think: ""Well, yeah, they definitely know how to fight, but at the end of the day, its play-fighting, so why should I care? We're friends anyway, so they wouldn't have any other reason to do what they did."" There was one scenario where it took me an entire year to realise this. Pathetic, I know, but another way of seeing it is that I trust people and expect them to be good people a lot of the time who are willing to respect people they befriend. Another problem I went through that shows a clear example of this is where I was aggressively peer-pressured into getting thrown in a dumpster (It's embarrassing, yes, but I feel like I can trust people in this subreddit to understand my problems respectably). It's a very long story so long story short, a guy that used to be my friend peer pressured me into letting him throw me into a dumpster. He started by saying reassuring things like: ""Oh, we're just messing around"", and ""Don't worry, we'll go with you."" Knowing that it was not a very good idea, I said no. That triggered physical threats. He was threatening to kick my balls really hard and he even punched me just before. Me being scared, I gave in and let him throw me in. Coming in contact with the dumpster, I gave myself a huge cut from my foot up to my knee and it was bleeding heavily. After that it turned into a teacher scene where the principle, for some reason, even called the police... That was 2 weeks ago. Later on in the situation, I found enough evidence to expose him to the principal, but that's not important now. Soon after, I slowly started to realise that I shouldn't care about what other people think because I know myself and I need to LOVE myself (something I wasn't really doing with the low self-esteem I used to have). I also shouldn't let other people take me down because of their biased thoughts and opinions about me (although some of you might find this part slowly beginning to get corny, I'm completely serious about it). I should believe in myself and not be afraid towards other people, because they don't matter. They're just trying to put me down; nonetheless, with all of this at hand, I still know the path I must take for my sake and I sure as hell will take it."

A friend called in for a welfare check. I left a suicide note on facebook and they saw it. My friend lived in a different time zone and called all the way across the US to try and get in touch with the police in my area. They also called the house but no one answered the phone. I also left a similar note on the dresser by the bed where I was laying. When the police came to do the welfare check, my ex husband went up to check on me, came back down and told the police I was just sleeping. He had to have seen the note. He walked right by it. He also walked by the bottle of pills I had taken. He also had, of course, access to my Facebook posts. After the police called my friend and told them what happened, My friend voiced concerns about my safety and the police actually came back, forced their way past my ex, found me unresponsive and took me to the hospital. I had one episode of consciousness and I recall being carried down the stairs. I remember hearing my ex husband crying ""it's not my fault"" and them telling him to get out of the way. When I woke up at the hospital, my ex was doing sternal rubs and trying to keep me awake. I had an NG tube. For some weird reason that I still don't understand his secretary was there. She is 20+ years younger than him. He had other mutual friends he could've called on for support. I feel that he was trying to cover his ass after the police basically saw that he'd left me for dead. I felt ashamed for a complete stranger to see me in this moment of utter vulnerability. I was out of it for a few days. When I finally came to, my hair and face were still covered with charcoal. My ex hadn't washed my face or even combed my hair. I think he hoped I'd die so he could get the insurance money to help him with his debts. I have been divorced from him for over 10 years now. Everyone thinks he is a great guy but I know in my heart (and this was confirmed by my friend who called the police) that he is an utter shitbag who saw me dying, lied to the police, and headed downstairs to play videogames while his wife died upstairs so he could collect the life insurance. I think he's an utter piece of shit. I was severely depressed. He did absolutely zero to support me and then when I attempted suicide he left me for dead and then tried to play up the supportive husband role when he got caught. I hope he does a horrible death. What an utter shit. I'm doing better now, but Jesus Christ, what the hell. "
423,vulnerability,offmychest,The truth to why I stopped drinking...,2,al2o7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/al2o7e/the_truth_to_why_i_stopped_drinking/,2019-01-30 05:00:15,"Only the person I was with that night and my therapist know the truth. Being in therapy Ive been learning even more about myself. I was still drinking nightly, with a month off this last year. After THAT NIGHT I learned just how much drinking (vodka) is a vulnerability for me. I wouldnt say I was addicted but the amount and consistency of my drinking was just bothersome for me. First off, I have not quit. I have simply stopped. And its like a flip switched. No urges, desires, nothing and I am so very grateful for that. I would usually drink beer with a couple of shots every night, I decided that I wanted to lose weight so the beer had to go and I welcomed my old friend Vodka back into my life with no carbs. A friend had mentioned/ asked me about doing coke with him once and I was buzzed on beer and shots at that time. I smoke pot but I dont do the harder stuff. And I told him, as I feel, I dont need coke to get high on life. Life is my high corny, I know, but its true. I do enjoy life without those nasty stimulating drugs. So a few weeks go by, I turned 35 and started walking 5 miles a day (for 30 days). We are hanging out one evening, Im buzzed on Vodka, and smoking weed and he asks me about doing coke. The Vodka in me says fuck it and we end up doing it, quite a bit, 4 hours worth. And OMG do I fucking hate those drugs. I was so damn uncomfortable and miserable, I hated how I felt. Yuck, yuck, yuck!!! YUCK. Im not placing the blame on the alcohol, (the Vodka rather) but I do know myself enough to know that Vodka is a major vulnerability for me. Life becomes a whole other adventure on it and I love it... until I wake up the next morning hating it all and what Ive done.... Doing my best to forgive myself as I learn on this journey. Because I was walking 5 miles a day at the time I used that as my ABRUPT reason to have stopped drinking saying the alcohol makes me fatigue the next day and Id rather have the energy for the walks and hit my goal. Which was true. Just not the whole truth. Ive been ZERO alcohol since December 10th. I did have a deep-seated intention to lessen my drinking, and truly believe this is why it played out as it did. Clearly I am not advocating people go out and do this in an effort to quit. Just wanted to tell the truth as to why my nightly drinking abruptly stopped. Thanks for reading. "

I held on for 9 months because I loved him and I wanted to have a lovely life we had planned together. Finally, I gave up because he never could commit to me that he wanted to be with me. It was a low point. I was depressed, I was drinking excessively, I was suicidal. I reached out to my family for the first time. I was always the strong one and it was hard to admit to those who loved me that I had nothing left and that I was so lost. I didnt know what to expect but it was the only way. I was surprised by how much they enveloped me in love and caring. They all talked behind my back ( my mom, sister, and brother) about how they could best lift me up. They listened for hours on the phone when I vented and cried and gave me advice to heal my soul. They took turns visiting me. They lifted me up out of this dark place into the light of community and positivity. I started seeing a counselor, I didnt like her and found another counselor that got me better. I started reaching out to people I worked with (I had previously had a strictly work relationship with) and started using bumble BFF to find friends who had the same interests as me. I got a roommate for my formerly lonely home. I am feeling really good about my life. I feel purpose and love and adventure. I never would have been able to get out of this pit of pain and self loathing and depression without that boost from my family. Im probably more healthy and happy than I have ever been because I finally learned to reach out to people. This is after the worst break up of my life and the symbolic loss of everything I wanted for myself. I learned two things from this experience. One is that reaching out and showing vulnerability is good and healthy and the right people want to lift you up. The second is that when someone reaches out to me I need to take it as a blessing that they have decided to reach out and be an uplifting force for them because it means a lot. I am lucky to have positive people surrounding me because it has taught me how to be a compassionate friend. I still dont want a relationship. I still dont trust men who want to be in a relationship with me. That is okay. What matters is that I am happy and i spend quality time with my friends."

Rather, I finally started on the road to get healthy after over a decade of misdiagnoses. So in a way, this is an open note about me being happy that I finally figured out what was wrong with me, and it finally got fixed. Ever since the time I was 8 years old, I got random cramps in my left side that migrated all throughout my abdomen. They were absolutely debilitating, and all I could do was tell my mom that ""my side hurt"", lay in bed with a cool rag on my forehead, and wait for it to pass. My family at that time had very little money, so going to the doctor wasn't our first choice - my parents said they would take me, but I always refused because I didn't want to be a financial burden. Call me stupid, but I saw how much they struggled - I didn't want to add unnecessary doctor bills if I didn't have to. The pain would never last more than 24 hours, so toughing it out seemed like the best option to me. After about a year and a half, my mom finally talked me into going to the doctor - and he told me exactly what I was afraid of: Nothing was *actually* wrong with me. The doctor said I had been through a lot of stress in the past few years, and sometimes people's bodies react to stress by signaling pain. He was right about the stress: My parents were divorced when I was 6, my oldest brother went off to the military and I was worried sick he'd never come back, those worries came to fruition when when he was KIA just 7 weeks after deployment, and my other brother got into constant trouble that caused my family to argue even further... All this made me feel like, at 9.5 years old, I had to take care of my mom, mend broken bonds between my family and rebellious brother, and be a shoulder to cry on for those who mourned my other brother. I had to be the man of the house. So that was it, he said. ***Just stress.*** This went on for over a decade. The cramps were not often, maybe 4-5x/year, but enough to be annoying. At this point, it's something I deal with. I've accepted it's something I'll live with the rest of my life. That is until one day where a series of unfortunate events finally led to an accurate diagnosis: I was working a lacrosse tournament at the score table, and was on a turf field for 13 hours where temperatures peaked at 108^(\*)F. Needless to say, I was drinking water constantly to try and stay ahead of the heat. A couple hours after my shift, and I was in the grocery store buying gatorade for the following day. The stabbing pain come back, worse than ever before, and I drag myself to the bathroom. I was lightheaded, nauseous, sweating, clammy, and so many more things - but, I just thought ""oh, it was hot today. I'll tough it out as I usually do with these cramps"". I drive home, feeling absolutely sick, and am lucky I made it that far without passing out *(yes I know this is dumb of me. I'm stubborn - never again).* An hour later, and I'm at a friend's house on the couch writhing in pain. I couldn't sit up straight because my gut felt like it would explode - I knew this had to be something different. This couldn't be stress. I finally give in, swallow my pride, and ask him to drive me to the hospital. I get there, and they tell me I have heat exhaustion. They give me a couple IVs to rehydrate me, but that makes the pain in my stomach worse. My guts literally feel like they are inflating as a balloon would. They stop giving me IVs and just let me sit - a few hours later, and the pain decreased a bit. A doctor tells me he thinks something is stopping me from processing all this liquid I've been taking in, and that is what's causing the cramps. Finally *SOMETHING* to start on... The next day I drive home, exhausted from the heat, but the cramps have gone down - I go into another doctor to get some imaging done. They tell me I have a blockage in my kidney, and therefore couldn't process all the liquid I had drank the day before. They said my kidney was draining at about 20% of the rate it should be... it all made sense now. My guts ballooned because I had nearly a gallon of liquid inside my kidney (I did some quick maths based on how much I drank that day and how fast they say my kidney should've processed it). That's why my kidney hurt! So long story short, my ureter (what drains the kidney) was too narrow. I was born with it this way. It made the liquid back up in the kidney and had been causing the cramps for all these years. But that's not where the story ends: I was going to school in 3 days and didn't want to miss any substantial time, so they put a stent in my kidney to keep the ureter open. The following semester was filled with bathroom breaks every 20-40 minutes because the stent tickles the inside of your bladder signaling you have to pee like a racehorse, and only a few drops come out. It was frustrating and inconvenient, but I got through a whole semester cramp free for the first time since I was 8. On December 19th, 2017, I had a laparoscopic pyeloplasty (for all you medical nerds) to get it fixed, and boom - I'm a new man. Today, my mom sent me a picture of my hand in the hospital with all the tubes and needles coming from my skin and said ""A year ago, today"". I hadn't marked this day on my calendar, been looking forward to it, or anything - but in hindsight, I'm so glad she sent me that picture. That picture made me reflect upon the past 11+ years of misdiagnoses that I've not only had with my kidney, but also with my chronic knee problems and a few other injuries. It made me feel like there's hope. In the past year, I've only had one repeat incident with the cramps, and it was because I drank a lot of water one day - I think I psyched myself into thinking I had cramps because I related lots of liquids with the cramps. It has been a long road to recovery - I lost 50lbs from the time I got my stent to the time I got surgery (from 215 to 165). My muscles atrophied, and I am nowhere near the athlete I used to be. I needed to find ways to exercise, so I started taking dance classes, and found a new passion of mine. I now have declared a Minor in Dance, and hope to get a certificate in Hip Hop Studies if the university approves the curriculum. I am still getting stronger every day. I am currently dealing with some tendinitis in my knee because I rejoined sports too quickly, and my muscles weren't strong enough to play at competitive levels, but nonetheless, a year later I can look back and be happy the cramps are gone. With some dedication and patience, I'll be in full health by the time I graduate college. So to sum this up, I am thankful for the doctor who finally told me I wasn't just stressed. I am thankful for the friend who drove me to the hospital - I'm stubborn and he probably saved me from much more severe health implications. I'm thankful for my mom for supporting me both emotionally and financially (she worked her butt off and just paid the final bill last week!). I'm thankful for all the friends, family, and teammates who supported me on the road to recovery. And finally, I'm thankful for everyone who has read this in its entirety. I'm not the greatest author, so I'm not sure how provoking/engaging this will be - but I have always been reserved when it comes to showing vulnerability and admitting that I have gratitude for certain things; opening up about my thankfulness for my surgery is a big step for me emotionally. So thank you, Redditors, for giving me a place to do so. **May you all have a lifetime of good health.** TLDR: A year ago I got kidney surgery due to a drainage problem, despite a decade of doctors telling me I got side cramps because I was stressed - now the cramps are gone and I can't wait to be back in full health."

Right away, I knew. I knew it was him. And he knew it was me. I got scared. I broke it off. My heart hurt for a long, long time. We came across each other again recently. Met up just to see how each other had been. And I fell, again. So has he. This is on the track to being that once in a lifetime thing. I love him more than I ever thought possible. But I have pretty severe issues with vulnerability. I grew up in an incredibly abusive home, and went on to abusive romantic relationships. I've healed a LOT but I still carry a lot of shame. And the fear of vulnerability coupled with the deep shame of my past makes me want to back away again, retreat back into my corner, leave him free to find someone better, save him from being involved with mess like me. When people dream of the one, and dream of their perfect person, they dont dream about someone like me. I carry so much with me. I still have nightmares, and the ptsd can be a lot some days. On the outside, I'm funny and charming and witty. I'm hard working. I'm raising 2 awesome kids successfully coparenting with my kids dad. I have tons of amazing friends and some cool hobbies. That's all fine and good. But dig deeper, bring up the past, and it's not good anymore. Its shameful and ugly and horrific. He can sense theres more going on. He knows I've cut out my family so hes aware some shit went down. Hes been so sweet in encouraging me to open up. But he doesnt understand the pandoras box hes asking me to open. I dont have issues talking about it. I speak about it freely with select friends. It's just...like I said, this isnt the kind of woman a guy imagines being with. I'm damaged goods, as it were. Every time I think of ending things with him I sob. It hurts so much. Idk what to do. No matter which option I pick, the outcome sucks. I should know better than to get involved with anyone. My heart is just heavy tonight and I had to get this off my chest. "

She taught me right from the beginning to build my entire behavior around what she expected from me. It likely was a core survival mechanism when I was a baby because having her taking care of me was literally vital to me. Then as a child and a teenager, I've always behaved inappropriately socially. I mean, around my mother it was fine, because I was fully adapted to her needs, and if I wasn't behaving correctly she would just yell at me to fix it. But around children and other adults, I would never be sincere, never stop talking, never had a sense of boundaries, never knew when what I was doing was inappropriate, I would never express how I feel, I would never care about anyone, I would be manipulative, I would never show vulnerability, would never stop bragging about how I was better and smarter than anyone else, I would never admit that I'm hurt, even though I was being bullied, I had no sense of dignity or self respect, I had close to no friends, only fake friends, certainly never fell in love. I knew I was being socially super weird and arrogant with everyone, but I didn't know any other way. Adults as much as children couldn't stand me, I was super awkward, would never shut up, and had no ability to create bound with anyone. When I see, or read about a child that can genuinely interact with adults, I am SO envious. Why didn't I get this chance? Fast forward, I'm 28, I'm a highly sensitive person, which is actually quite useful for art expression, I've been doing dancing and improv for 5 years now, I'm very social, very funny, quite sincere and vulnerable, people like me, still though this is mostly social adaptation. I'm unable to know what I want when I'm around people, because I've been taught to put other's expectations before my needs, and most people do have at least slight exceptions that I'm extremely good at sensing and that I intuitively use to guide me on how I should behave. In some cases I meet a person from whom I can't sense any expectations, if they are male, I will avoid them, and if they are female, I will burst into tears. I never was in a romantic relationship, never had sex, never fell in love. I actually feel neither able to love nor able to allow myself to be loved. I can't emotionally trust people. And more than ANYTHING else, I need to be genuinely touched by women. In proportions like nothing else. I'm CRAVING for it. I need to be touched more than I need oxygen. When I'm with people, I'm joyful, smart and funny, but beneath that thin layer of social adaptation, the truth is that my skin hunger is raging inside. If I were to be honest, I would never hold a conversation for more than 5 minutes without physical touch. Often times, not being touched hurts so bad that I cannot function properly. Tl;dr my mother never touched me and taught me not to listen to my needs. Now I'm 28, I never know what I want, I only adapt to expectations, and I'm highly touch starved."

Uh oh, I thought. Settling up is what friends do after ordering a pizza, or splitting a cab ride, or buying a round of drinks. Settling up doesnt mean a rehash of a four-year long, unhealthy relationship and unentangling finances and sending a bill to your ex for several thousand dollars. Or perhaps the definition could be stretched to include the aftermath of a relationship. I suppose by some new definition, I had spent four months settling up by healing a plethora of wounds from her venomous fangs, unentangling myself from her puppet strings, and stretching my own damaged and atrophied wings back towards the sun. === I left her in a hotel room while she was out for the day. I left her a note and more than half of the money we had left. A week or two before that, I had realized I was stuck in an emotionally abusive and manipulative relationship with her. I dont know why it took me so long to realize it. I had suffered worse, we had had worse arguments, but for some reason that day during some minor disagreement Id finally had enough. I tried to end it that night; she wouldnt let me. So I waited until we had a day apart to ensure we had the rest of our lives apart. There were moments of weakness during that time in-between when I questioned my decision to leave, when we fell back into familiar and comfortable patterns, when she was so sweet and caring how could I possibly think of leaving her. I reminded myself of all the times shed verbally abused me, gaslit me, taken unrelated anger out on me, and otherwise abused my emotional vulnerability to her, and steadied my resolve. I finally left, and I reached out to family and friends for support. She was emotionally abusive, I explained, mostly to remind myself why I hadnt already run back to the hotel and her. I spent the next four days in bed, and the next four months healing. We had minimal contact, little more than heres your mail, and I was scabbing up nicely. === Then that email arrived. She always prided herself on remembering important dates. The email arrived on the fifth anniversary of my moms death. I controlled myself long enough to respond with a factually and numerically correct fuck off, then called a friend. She had ripped off the scabs and injected a fresh dose of venom into my veins. I flushed her poison out with copious amounts of ethanol that night. Three weeks later she emailed again. I expected your entire response. Did I know that I was the manipulative, selfish, stubborn, dishonest one? Six months ago, I did. I knew exactly how horrible a person I was, because she kept illuminating the darkest corners of my soul with her gas lights. === Today? The scabs are finally scarring over, reminders of lessons learned, reminders that my skin and I arent actually too thick or too rough or too harsh, reminders of a past I dont regret but dont wish to repeat, reminders of the cost of growth. We may still need to unentangle more finances, but Ive settled up and am moving on. "
434,vulnerability,offmychest,To my so-called best friend who disposed of me like trash after using my body,1,ac28e7,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ac28e7/to_my_socalled_best_friend_who_disposed_of_me/,2019-01-03 16:03:52,"A letter to a thief: ""This is my attempt at finding closure and this will be the last thing I'll say to you unless something crazy happens. We can't meet in person, so this is my way of closing things between us. I would've much rather said this in person, but over text will do. I've been stupefied. I sought answers but my questions remain unanswered. So here I write all that I wanted to say to you but never got the chance to. I got into an accident recently. My car was towed and it could've been easily my last night on Earth. The crash is a fitting ending to my 2018 which felt like a wreck altogether. This moment was just another reason for me to not leave anything unsaid. You hurt me. I spent countless nights crying tears that shouldn't have been cried for you. I trusted you--you knew my fears, my ambitions, my complicated past, the issues with my father. I shared this information with you in moments of vulnerability because I trusted you. That's friendship. We were friends. Close friends. Best friends even. I let myself breathe around you when usually I hold my breath in. Our friendship meant a lot to me; I thought I had found someone with my appreciation for 80s music and shitty history memes and dumb films. But to you, I was just a body. I invested time into a friendship that soon filed for bankruptcy. I shouldn't have visited you. I got too drunk. It wasn't a good idea. But you insisted and, well, I cared too much for you, so I went along. You were my first and you knew it. You lied to me. You told me that it was over, that you were eyeing other girls, but it was never over. That was just something you said to get with me. It was a weird dynamic after we slept together, but I wanted to put that behind us. I wanted to put it in the past. Our friendship meant too much to me and I wanted to salvage it, even after you broke my trust. It meant nothing to you. I was just a body that made you realize the guilt of cheating on your girlfriend. Or ""ex"" as you told me. For you there was nothing to salvage; you got what you wanted. You didn't deserve me. You didn't deserve my vulnerability. You didn't deserve my care nor my friendship. I've reached out attempting to ""be the bigger person"" and hoping to finally find closure to a friendship that meant so much to me. After a while, I realized that my attempts were futile. You just didn't care. Hurting me seemed like second nature to you. I write this, as I cannot wrap my head around how a person is able to ""care"" so much for someone and hurt them just as easily. Your lack of response was a response in itself, a response of cowardice and shame. But I cannot let life continue without letting you know how I feel. Maybe you'll read this and empathize. Or maybe you'll delete it. Or maybe you'll decide to reach out and apologize. I don't know. I'm not writing this for you but rather for myself. I never got closure. I don't have a way to resolve the frustration I feel with you for fucking me over. This is my outlet for that; it is my way of attempting to get over a friendship that shouldn't have existed in the first place. It is not an attempt to get you to be in my life again; after seeing the way you have treated me, I don't want that. I don't have space for such pain in my life. I don't deserve such pain. I'm mad at you, and I probably always will be until I die, but I'm also mad at myself for putting myself in a situation where I got hurt. I could've prevented it. I could've never spoken to you those three years ago. I hope you'll never treat anyone the way you have treated me. I hope you'll be completely honest in the future. I hope you'll be able to confront issues that arise instead of running from and ignoring them. You don't deserve anything from me, but I deserve to do something that will make me feel content even if my something is unread and deleted. I just want to be at peace, closing this chapter behind me and starting 2019 without the dour cloud of a past friendship hanging over me. Happy new year."" I sent this to him. His response was ""I'm sorry for everything. I wish you the best"". Why do people like this fucking exist? He's still with the girl who he cheated on with me. He couldn't even give me a moment to ask why he disposed of me like trash after I texted him this letter. I know the answer, I just wanted to hear it from him. I promised to leave this in 2018... but here I am in 2019, followed by the ghost of last year's emotional breakdown. I'm still empty and still so so fucking hurt. When will I get over it?"

This comes with pros (loyalty, devotion, patience, etc) and cons (insecurity, vulnerability, weakness). Society often gives words of wisdom: * ""Love yourself first before loving another"" * ""You don't need a lover to be happy"". That advice may be good for some people, but not necessarily for everyone. Everyone is different. Some people can stand being alone and are strong, others just can't, it's not in their blood. But that's okay. Humans are social creatures and some need more validation than others, we all long for love. Many people are independent, some people are codependent.

I was physically removed from the house we had together by an old friend. That's the only reason why I got out of that relationship. I'd probably still be there. But later on I discovered she only got me out of there for selfish reasons and she was an abusive person herself. From then on, I've been dealing with the aftermath of all this on my own. The only person who acted like they cared was my mother but she couldn't comprehend what I actually went through. She would say things like ""F*ck him pop his tires"" ""he's just like your father"" (which isn't true). She just treats it as if I got cheated on. People don't seem to understand that narcissism is a disorder and not just a character trait. So my ex's behavior and actions were always excused and I just looked like the overemotional paranoid psycho. Ive been trying so hard to get through the mental and emotional abuse and I was doing well. I realize I'm not as healed as I thought. It's taking a toll on my current relationship. I have issues with sex or just being naked because my vulnerability was abused. Sometimes I act like a housewife/slave rather than a partner because thats what I was molded into. I have issues with trust because I was engaged but still cheated on with several women. I find it hard to say I love you anymore. I get irrational thoughts and feelings. I want to talk to my boyfriend about this but i don't think it's fair to vent about my ex fiance. I don't want him to feel like he has to be responsible for the mess another guy created. I don't want to think that I'm constantly thinking of my ex. The only people I can relate to are strangers on Reddit. Even then, I'm not getting help. I'm just reading the same stories I already lived or being told ""You shouldn't have done that."" I know I should probably see a therapist and im sure that's what everyone on here will tell me. Seeing a therapist will make me feel like my ex succeeded at ruining me. I don't want to pay someone a ton of money to tell me stuff I already know. Idk. I just feel alone. "

If you are wholly unwilling to give people a chance, then why do you even want them to change? I understand that there is a vulnerability to all of this that is wholly unfair to marginalized groups, but isn't it also unfair to marginalized groups to live according to this ""nothing will ever change"" mentality especially as things are slowly changing? Yes, it's not fast enough and not widespread enough but it is happening. I don't understand the insistence on ""\_\_\_\_ group of people will never get it"" ... they might be getting it right in front of us but unless we are open to that possibility then we will continue to harp on all the ways in which some of them still haven't gotten it. And while there is certainly a time and a space for that, I believe it's just as important for our own sakes (and theirs) to acknowledge and appreciate the strides that are being made. Otherwise, what are we all doing? To what end? Why are we devoting our energy to something if it's actually pointless? And what does it say about the people who are striving to change, not only because ""it is the right thing to do"" from a moral perspective but because they actually don't want to hurt you/me/us/them/etc.?

438,vulnerability,offmychest,Conflictions,1,adapny,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/adapny/conflictions/,2019-01-07 09:28:59,"**Conflictions** The date is January 5, 2018. On Monday, its back to the monotonous grind of our wonderfully flawed education system. Just got a drink from the Circle K down the street. The third one in as many nights, but Im out of money so I cant continue the habit. Damn. Honestly, it is just an excuse to get out of the house which I need to do more anyway. I also need to cut back on the sugars but ya know.. Fuck it. None of that is relevant to the reason for this brain dump. The idea of conflictions has been on my mind for a while Probably because I feel conflicted. In a number of ways. I feel conflicted about whether I should be spending more time with my mom, I feel conflicted about if I should be more outgoing and try to make some new friends. The only person I see on a regular basis is my girlfriend, and that kind of leads to the main focus of this. She and I have had a rough relationship to say the least. But not counting all of the breakups, we have been together for nearly two years. March 3rd, 2019 will be our two year anniversary. This December marked a year since I really broke her heart for the first time, by doing the dumbest thing I could do. I cheated. I dont like sharing that with people because it paints me in a bad light, rightfully so, and I am so fucking regretful for it. All of that is behind us now, so why do I feel so conflicted? Well, simply, I cant see into the future. I know that sounds like some basic ass b\*\*\*\* problem but let me explain. I have spent the last year trying my best to mend things with her, and at a point last May it was killing me. I was just so fucking tired, mentally speaking. So I broke up with her before school ended. Now, I could just leave it at that. I broke up with her because I was mentally exhausted right? Well no, thats not the complete picture. She thought it was because there was another girl, and I adamantly denied that. But there sort of was. I will say I was very tired mentally, and that did greatly contribute to my decisions, so when the idea of another girl finding me Hot or Sexy (I know this is weird cuz teenagers and shit but hey, I need to get this out) came up, it got me curious you know? I had spent over a year with one person, and maybe I wanted to explore a bit more. (This is something we will come back too, but not yet) The full story of how I discovered another girls interest in me goes as follows. I was smoking pot with a friend at the time Carson. Maybe we werent smoking. I don't fucking remember, all I know is that I was watching the Marvel movies in order and he just decided to come over. ANYWAYS, he snapped a picture of me with some dumb caption probably, and sent it to a girl named Alyssa (Remember her, she is an important character later on) I didn't pay any attention because I was too into my movies to give a shit. A little bit passes, probably like a minute or two, and then Alyssa responded. Carson showed me what was said, and it was her calling me Hot or Sexy I dont remember it verbatim, because who gives a fuck. There was literally no point in me making that a paragraph. I could have summed it up in a sentence. Oh well. Moving on. So flash back to May. I am tired, and there is a vague thought creeping in the back of my mind, that someone else is out there, and they are somewhat interested, and to be honest, I did find her objectively attractive. Objectively being the keyword. She is objectively STILL attractive, but now that I know her better, she is not attractive attractive. If that makes sense? So perhaps she did play a small role in the decisions that followed, and she definitely came around again later in the summer. And for all of that, I will make it brief. I started summer school. Damien (an old friend) started talking to me again. One night he is like, find some alcohol and drink with me. One night I drank half a bottle of vodka. And two nights, I drank two full bottles of vodka. One bottle per night, I just feel like I should clarify that. Also, the nights weren't one after the other. Anyways. The first time I drank a full bottle, I didn't wanna go to summer school the next day, so I messaged Iris (a friend), and was like aye, wanna chill? She was like sure, Alyssa is with me though, I said I didn't care. I also had some herb with me so yeet. So we all meet up, and go to some retention basin nearby, and light up. They were babysitting my pieces at the time. We all get fairly nice and toasted, and just chilled. As we were leaving, I think I brought up the Carson thing, and Alyssa was like wha? So I told her what she said, and she was just straight up, Well you are pretty hot. Or something like that. So that got the ball rolling. We started talking more, and feelings were being developed. Now, both of us were fresh out of relationships, so we were both emotionally vulnerable. I mean I say that, but I do think a part of me actually wanted something serious with her, but that obviously didnt work out. Anyways, We hang out a few times, get a little intimate, I sneak out to see her, yada yada yada, the usual. I eventually find out the type of people she likes to spend her time with, and I wasn't cool with her leading me on while still talking to other dudes (I was well aware she was doing this and we even talked about it sometimes, but I was being stupid. I think that is where the emotional vulnerability came in. I just wanted something to fill the loneliness), so I cut things off. Wow, I said I was gonna make that brief. Oops. I also keep getting sidetracked. Fuck my life. I guess it does provide some needed background information, so you can kinda get where my head has been at. Now there was some stuff that happened with another girl during the summer, and this is something my girlfriend does not know There was this girl I used to talk to named Sam. Completely fucking crazy but I talked to her because I knew she had an obsession with me. Kinda a low blow sweet talking too someone you know has a boyfriend, and you know will probably leave that guy for you. To be fair though, she was not happy with him anyway. Does that make it right? Of course not, but just thought I'd throw that in there. With her, we talked, she dumped the dude, and one day I thought it would be great to go and see her. So I skate their, we hang out, and it was fucking awful. Her little sisters were there, and those little shits are just the absolute fucking worst kids I have ever had the displeasure of meeting. My god. Anyways, as I am getting ready to leave. She goes for a kiss. I freeze. I wasnt really feeling it, and after that was when I kissed Alyssa for the first time, like a few days later. I haven't really talked to Sam since, and as far as I know, she has moved on. I never felt the need to tell my girlfriend, because nothing really happened, and if I tell her now, I feel like it will cause a huge fight and I might lose her. So with that, I am conflicted. Is it worth telling? I want to be honest, but at the same time, I don't want a fight, and I don't want to lose her. So yeah, ever since summer, we have gotten back together, and we have just been trying to move past it all. So yesterday, we got into a bit of a thing. There was a little argument about the summer (which happens quite a bit) and after that, she expressed her feelings of losing me again, because it was so easy for me to lose feelings last time. Which I completely understand. So we calmed down, and I said I loved her, and then I asked her you know Im not going anywhere right? And she like shrugged. So that kinda pissed me off you know? Like, I want her to believe me when I say that I am going to be there for her forever, because I do want that. But at the same time, what if something comes up? What if something does change again? I feel like I've dug myself into a bit of a hole, trying to convince her that I am not going to go anywhere, when in reality I have no fucking idea what the future holds. Like shit. I can't break up with her, and have her try to fucking kill herself again. Especially not later in life, because that would destroy her. Like if we got a place, and we were all settled, and then suddenly something just changed, and I leave. She would be fucking devastated. And don't take this like I am considering breaking up with her, because I'm not. All I'm saying is that, I don't know what the hell is going to happen, and after me like screaming that I'm not gonna leave, and that Ill always be there, I can't just leave if situations change ya know? Did I trap myself? Did I put all of my eggs into one basket? Is there a way out if one is needed? I don't fucking know. Should I tell her that I feel this way? Should I let her read this, and risk losing her because of what I've said in this? I have no fucking clue. On top of all of that, I've mentioned alcohol and drugs, and honestly, I've been feeling a want for intoxicants. Just something ya know? And believe me, I know how dangerous a want for something like that is. So I've been controlling it. It's not like I NEED it like an addict. I just want it. I want it to have it. I miss the feeling of a weed high. I can't drink alcohol anymore, because during the summer my body was just like nah dude. No more. But weed dude. I miss that shit. I've been considering getting a wax pen. I know those are riskier than just bud, but their more convenient, and that's the main appeal of them. Shit. I wouldn't be opposed to taking shrooms again either, but I know, if I just had access too that shit regularly, id probably abuse it. I like to think I am above getting addicted, and that I'm smart when it comes to drugs, (which I am. I realize that is kind of an oxymoron, but I'm more smart about it than most other kids my age) but addiction runs in my family so I know I have to be super careful about that shit. So there it is. My conflictions, or at least the ones I can think of right now. Im sort of glad I did this. What am I going to do with this now? Have no clue. Maybe it will just remain on my google docs forever untouched. Who knows. But what I do know is that I am conflicted, and I don't want to be anymore. \-A"

I gave a coworker my bank information after they posted on Snapchat looking for people to earn easy money. As a naive college student, I trusted this person so I went through with it. They explained to me that we could split $3200 if they could just deposit it in my account and send their half back. I gave them everything. They promised to have the funds in my account by a certain time. An hour after the promised time they told me to stand by. I waited but I began to worry. I knew it was a scam but I went through with it anyways because I trusted this person. They had a strong personality and I saw no signs of deception. I began to search the internet as to how I could be getting scammed and I came across check kiting. This type of fraud involves the scammer taking advantage of the banks action to make funds available before they are cleared. Once the check bounced, I would be left to pay $1600 back to the bank plus whatever part of my half I decided to spend and they would have free money. I began to text this person. They had given me a number that was different from the one I previously had which was a little suspicious but I hadnt texted them in over four months and I hadnt been at work to talk to them in about three months (more reason as to why I shouldnt have went through with it). I asked them to explain to me where the funds were coming from. They did not have speedy replies which made me worry even more. They told me it was from a grant account for student loans and college students. Scammer bullshit. I knew this because I had received a call of this nature from a person with an African (maybe) accent a few years back. I did my research then and did not fall victim to this. I began to question if I was even talking to the person I thought I was so I asked them to verify their identity. They sent me Snapchat photos which was a red flag. I asked them to send me a new photo with a spoon (Nev and Max level detective skills) and they made an excuse that they were out with friends. I quickly changed my account information and contacted my bank and all that jazz. I was left with this feeling of vulnerability and anxiety. But I learned a lot and I hope this will teach someone else that you cannot trust everyone or anyone. Protect yourself! Thousands of people get their identities, money, credit, etcetera stolen from people they know or dont know. Go to work and make your own money. Do not become a victim of someones pyramid scheme. Always do your research before you make any decisions. Use two factor authorization, secure your personal information in person, on paper, and online, change your passwords regularly, use VPNs. Theres so much you can do to protect yourself. Dont be a fool."
440,vulnerability,offmychest,I don't feel like my relationship problems are taken seriously,1,9wgm7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9wgm7m/i_dont_feel_like_my_relationship_problems_are/,2018-11-13 05:32:50,"I recently ran into a few issues with my partner. I won't get into the specific problems I've been having, but the short version is I made a mistake that seriously hurt my partner, and have been trying to get her trust back. I have apologized *ad nauseam* about this, acknowledge that I did something wrong, that what I did is my fault, and that I need to do a better job of making sure it won't happen again. However, for a long time, my partner believed that this was something I did deliberately to her. This is something that was absolutely not true, and hearing it was really hurtful for me. I messaged a member of a Facebook group centered around relationships, hoping that I would be able to post my side of the story anonymously and get some feedback. The mod I messaged was someone my partner had talked to previously, and had found extremely supportive and helpful. I sent the message I wanted posted, and was told in short order I was ""pushing blame away"" from myself (I wasn't), that I needed to focus on helping my partner heal (I already am), to not make excuses for my behavior (I wasn't), and that I need to understand that her trust isn't owed to me (I do understand that). Finally, I was told that ""this is something a lot of guys struggle to understand with women."" In essence, rather than addressing my own concerns, this person made the entire message about my partner, rather than me. I understand I did something wrong. I want to address it. But I have emotional needs too, and I feel like they're ignored because of my gender. When my partner accused me of deliberately hurting her, it scared and upset me, and I wanted emotional support. After that conversation, I felt like I was just another guy to this mod. I frankly don't think she cared what I felt. I felt like she saw me as some generic male entity, in need of correction and a stern talking to, rather than a human being with his own feelings. This is just one example, but it's representative of other experiences I've had. I don't feel like men's emotional needs are taken seriously. I feel like because men are so predominantly seen as the oppressors or the perpetrators of harm, that our own vulnerability is somehow negated. I have feelings of my own, and sometimes they're hurt. Is it that hard to believe I just want validation, and that I'm not trying to weasel my way out of responsibility for my mistakes? Whenever I bring this up, I feel like I'm thrown in with the dregs of the earth. Incels, sexists, misogynists, people with all kinds of terrible, backwards opinions about women, relationships, and sex. Why does seeking support as a man make me part of these groups? I don't want to be associated with any of them. I just want my feelings acknowledged, and to get some advice on how to get my own needs met... does that really make me that much of a monster?"
441,vulnerability,offmychest,My greatest desire is also my greatest fear. How messed up is that?,1,9wtern,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9wtern/my_greatest_desire_is_also_my_greatest_fear_how/,2018-11-14 08:37:25,"Something I've realized recently about myself is that whenever when I'm in a situation where I have to accept love or kindness from people, or even seeing displays of love &amp; affection irl or on TV &amp; movies (even now as I type this, I'm deeply reluctant, averse even, to use words like ""loving"" and other words that reference love when talking about myself) I become deeply uncomfortable, almost repelled, the reason why is because of my still prevalent feelings of shame &amp; fear when it comes to the idea of love. This became very clear when my therapist pointed out to me how my greatest most deepest desire is also my biggest fear, meaning I so deeply desire/need to be loved that I am afraid that I may never be loved, or even worse, be loved only to lose it &amp; become unloved again, if that makes sense. I'm afraid to be loved bc since it is my greatest desire, it is my greatest vulnerability, and the thought of the magnitude of that vulnerability &amp; its inherent risks &amp; potential for the ultimate &amp; final rejection, disappointment &amp; despair resounds with harrowing dread in my chest like a death sentence. So my emotional response to even hypothetical love I realize now is very polarized, simultaneously aversion &amp; desire, essentially conflicted. Even as I seek &amp; reach out towards love, my emotions are repelled by it in a backwards form of self-preservation, so trying to accept love or even the idea of love becomes a stressful &amp; overwhelming situation involving two opposing emotions &amp; desires. The closest thing I can compare it to is being violently allergic to your most favorite thing in the world, and the only way you can enjoy said favorite thing is by enduring acute illness &amp; pain, until you'd rather not go through that again &amp; decide you have to now forever avoid your most favorite thing rather than suffer. I'm not sure what this means with regards to healing, but at least now I know where my issues lay. Maybe I just have to put myself through it again and again until I get used to it, like systematic desensitization for treating phobias. (Sorry for all the excessive dramatic language btw. The majority of my childhood &amp; adolescent years were spent alone reading countless works of colorful fiction instead of relating to real people my own age, so now I talk like an epic fantasy audiobook &amp; don't know who Radiohead is haha )"

He hurts me and he doesn't seem to care enough, he still blows up in anger quite often and won't admit or apologize when something he did was wrong. Sometimes i feel used. He does little selfish things. Lately I've been in a bad financial situation (he knows it) and he likes to take the coins when i get change for his savings. Yesterday i got change, he inmediatly took a big coin and i got a little upset for it, then he gave it back to me and stopped being sweet for the rest of the day. (Trivial example cause it's fresh) He's very entitled. I sometimes get the feeling he sees this relationship as another way to fulfill his needs. He has always taken more than he gives. He always projects a feeling of superiority. He has said to me that he thinks I'm slow and dumb. I deeply feel he's taking advantage of me. In summary: i know he's really pushing his boundaries of love with me because he's just not used to give that much of himself to others and that i have a very special place in his heart and honestly I'm very grateful for it. But i still think that he's not ready for a relationship. If i continue a relationship with him i know he wouldn't love me as much as i do, and our relationship wouldn't be as important for him as it is for me. And now that i know his pride can make him harm me on purpose as he did when he broke up with me, i live in constant fear of that happening again. I love him, I really do. But I'm not sure i can be in a relationship with someone like him. "
444,vulnerability,offmychest,My grief counselor fell asleep during my exposure therapy session,1,9xb0o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9xb0o5/my_grief_counselor_fell_asleep_during_my_exposure/,2018-11-16 00:08:35,"I have been dealing with the suicide of my twin brother for almost a year and a half. I started exposure therapy a few months ago to help me with the trauma of finding his dead body. I have a long list of triggers that cause me distress, but most of the worst ones have been at work. I was hoping my therapist could help. On our last session together I was going through the details of finding his body, which you would do multiple times a session to help desensitize you to the trauma. You speak in the first person and keep you eyes closed. A big part of the therapist being there is to keep track of your subjective unit of distress(suds). If things get too emotional or intense they are supposed to help bring you back. They also debrief you at the end to make sure you dont leave in a bad state of mind. Your not going to be great after something like this, but they are supposed to help reset you back to life a little bit. The last session I had with him We talked about focusing more on my twins facial features and how to body looked since I seemed to of blacked it out. I got about 10 minutes into my trauma, about right where I found his body and heard some heavy breathing. I had just gotten to the room where I had found my twins body so I am not going to just stop. This time around I recalled a few more details about his face, the color, feeling of his body trying to induce CPR before EMS arrived. I finish at our agreed end point and call out a few times saying thats all I remember. I finally call my therapists name and open my eyes only to see him passed out in his chair. I was in shock, if it wasnt so unbeliever I would of kicked him out of his chair. I waited, about five minutes to see if maybe it was just a second, like he was sleepy and just closed his eyes for a moment. Five minutes later it was clear he was out for good. I woke him up, he apologized saying he was moving all weekend. He didnt even mention it after that, he asked if I remembered anything new. I said no, I wasnt about to tell him what he missed. We wrapped up and I left, partly still thinking about being in the room with my newly remembered twins face, and pissed off like I havent been since my twin died. I have issues with trusting people and vulnerability. Probably a combination of my twins suicide who I trusted more than anyone and being bullied as a kid. It was difficult to let him know I wouldnt be seeing him again. Partly because I needed him so much when my twin died, but also because I have felt so alone and needed the outlet so I didnt burden my family/friends with what goes on in my head on the daily. I found a new person but they dont like exposure, they seem more focused on me trying to move forward. I just had another nightmare with my twin in it, woke up in the middle of the night and Ive been awake for a few hours. Maybe writing this out will convince me to get a new therapist who I can trust to go through my story without them passing out. "

Just someone to dump your feelings on. I thought we were REALLY GOOD friends. I even thought we were best friends at one point because thats how much to talked to me, you talked to me all the time. I thought it was a friendship to you- But in the end you really thought nothing of me the entire time, I was just someone willing to give you attention. And you took advantage of that. I do not get angry easily. But after talking to you tonight... my stomach hurts my head hurts. I feel like Im going to throw up because of just how angry I am at you. Yes its true sometimes friendships are inequal. But I hadnt realized JUST HOW inequal our friendship was until today. It will hurt me too much if I blame myself for being unable to see it. So I am going to blame you. You selfish motherfucker. There is no way you did not know what you were doing, lapping up all the attention I gave you, only to throw our friendship away the moment it became inconvenient for you. I loved you. A lot. And all of that emotion which is so precious to me... was wasted on you because I thought our friendship was equal. I thought youd be there for me the same way I was for you. But I was nothing to you, just a convenient person, someone who you could turn to whenever your wounds needed licking but you *never* had any intentions of trying to understand. Call me naiive and stupid for not seeing it. I didnt deserve that from you or from anyone. You selfish asshole... People arent toys, they have feelings and they have emotions... How dare you say whatever in such a misleading way to make me think we were so close. It wouldnt hurt so much if youd just set boundaries from the beginning. If you do not like me, I will understand. But why do you get so close, act like you understand me, act like you like me, that I am a worthwhile friend to you - and then backtrack away with no warning. Is that your way of relating to people? Getting them open up their vulnerable hearts - and then ripping away the friendship, like taking a look at the vulnerability and saying nope, mm-mm, thats not my type? Seriously? Fuck you. Of course I wont say this to you but it hurts. And I hate to say you led me on but that is what it feels like. Man... youre just a jerk with no boundaries."

I was 20 when I met the 27 year old man who has taught me more lessons than any other person in the 20 years prior to him. 20 is easy. 20 is fast and impulsive and thrives off instant gratification and no desire for commitment. 20 is hey I dont mind spending time with you, maybe I will spend more time with you than other men 20 is freedom. 20 was easy. 21 isnt so bad either. It is waking up next him most Sunday mornings. 21 was dancing and drinking and fucking my way around the town. 21 was fun and wild. 21 was being hungover. 21 was doing my homework in dive bars and being so tired that I would end up in his bed many weekdays. 21 is feeling a ping of jealousy when he tells me about the dates he infrequently went on. 21 is blurry. 21 was messy. 22 is hard. 22 is waking up at 6am, working until 4pm and then going to school until 10pm then doing my homework in the same dive bars until 1am and doing it over and over again until the weekend comes. 22 was honest. It was telling him this hurts me and him telling me you knew it would be like this and me remembering when 20 year old me said she was okay with this set up and hating her for not knowing that it would hurt 22 year old me. 22 wasnt fun anymore because I wasnt drinking to relax, I was drinking to get by. It was drinking the night away with strangers who I used to fill the void. 22 was telling him I love you. I respect you but I cannot do this anymore 22 is depression and anxiety. 22 was leaving. 23 was constant change. It was him coming to me on hands in knees pleading for my return. It was a breakthough. It was we can try out monogamy. It was I love you and I will try. It was do you want to live together? It was waking up and going to sleep and grocery shopping and sweeping the bathroom and packing lunches and being normal. 23 was his phone dinging a little later than usual and telling myself not to look at his lit up screen. It was then peering over his shoulder when he was texting. It was him coming home only 15 minutes later than usual and me doing the math if that were enough time to get undressed than dressed again. It was me asking him if he is happy being monogamous. It was him saying this is hard and me nodding my head in agreement. It was finding out that he had lied to me. That I was scared to be alone. 23 was crying every single day for months because I didnt feel like I was enough and how can the one person who I knew was honest, wasnt? 23 was waking up one night to our bed shaking because he was getting off to a picture from a girl he knew in college. 23 was fighting. It was insecurity and back and forth and push and pull and finally, finally. It was me telling him you dont have to be with me and him saying I dont think I want to be. And that was that. Gone. And now, here I am. At 24. Trying not to punish myself. Trying not to feel bitterness to him. Realizing that I only agreed to an open relationship because I thought and still think. That having someone sleep with other people and being honest about it is a better alternative than my partner sleeping with someone else and not telling me. For 24 years I have avoided vulnerability and ruined my self esteem in the process. So here is to 24 and tripping over all my previously held beliefs in pursuit of loving myself again."
447,vulnerability,offmychest,Hot for Teacher - Very SFW,1,9z0o4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9z0o4f/hot_for_teacher_very_sfw/,2018-11-21 17:24:28,"I'm in university and have a huge crush on one of my professors. I usually consider myself a logical, measured person, but I wouldn't as of late. I'm hoping that unloading my confession on the internet will relieve some of the mental energy that's been working towards these fantasies. &amp;#x200B; My professor is young for a university teacher, I'm older than the average student at my school, so I think it works out to us being, roughly, the same age. I feel physically attracted to him, but apart from that, I'm thinking (hoping) most of this might be due to the situation. I don't remember being attracted to him when I first met him. I make a conscious effort to keep my interactions with men platonic. I attract a lot of attention from men, and if I don't dictate the temperament of our interactions they catch feelings. (I mean.. I don't have magical friend-zoning powers, sometimes they catch feelings anyway, but this usually stops them from vocalizing anything to me, and me having to deal with it). Meeting my teacher, I recall being cordial, and uninterested to begin with. Over time, even before the crush started, I found him interesting, simply because he's an interesting person, in an interesting profession. (However, I also tend to think everyone is relatively interesting). Because he's fairly new to teaching, he has a degree of vulnerability to him that.. Mmm.. Let's just say, I fuckswith. There's been scenarios where he's visibly nervous, for a presentation or what have you, everything goes well, and he probably feels successful or some kind of pride, I think just seeing that process, and the range of emotions associated with it, makes me respect him. Also, I find it attractive for some reason I can't figure out. Anyway, I would upgrade my behavior to.. friendly and jovial at this point, because while there's been some moments where, in retrospect, I feel really drawn to him, at the time I had more of an I-respect-you-as-a-person stance. &amp;#x200B; At some point, I don't remember when or why, but I suddenly felt like he had some heat in his interactions with me. I felt like he would stand closer to me than normal, more eye contact, more deliberate one-on-one contact, (this was around the time where one-on-one's begin to happen anyway due to the duration of the semester, so I could have been reading into that one too much). Since then my demeanor has changed, I wouldn't be surprised if I've already accidentally conveyed my crush. I'm definitely more relaxed and have been having more fun in class in general, which I don't actually think is crush related but I think behaviorally it must seem pretty suspect. I've also been more eager, requesting one-on-one time to discuss projects (which is not unusual for me, I request extra time with my instructors all the time). Basically, now I feel like every interaction we have has some kind of intensity to it. He's getting more brazen with me, and though I don't think he'd ever do anything unprofessional, I can't help but wonder and fantasize about what would happen if one of us did. I also try to see if he interacts with my classmates in the same kind of way, but honestly I get bored and never pay attention, I'm a busy person! &amp;#x200B; The other thing is, I'm in a happy relationship of 4 years. It's not like I'm bored or feel stifled in some way, and this is me living out my mental escape. I'm basically free to do what I want, bordering on open relationship territory, and I love that. I love my boyfriend and I think he's good for me, and yet my instructor is on my mind.. It's not the first time I've had a crush on someone, while being with my boyfriend. Usually, I get a crush on someone, I let my boyfriend know, I tell my crush, we hash it out platonically, and the crush itself dissipates. This time around, I don't feel like I can tell anyone, considering he's my teacher I definitely can't tell him, so my time honored solution won't work. Also, I'm pretty sure I recall my prof mentioning he has a girlfriend. He doesn't seem like the type to intentionally seek out other women, but then again I don't know him very well. &amp;#x200B; So can someone please weigh in, and tell me it's all in my head or tell me to maintain the secret because it's all just silly stuff of little-to-no magnitude and is not worth compromising.. anything in this situation? &amp;#x200B; PS. As I was writing this, including the 'in my defense' bracket statements, I realized it's possible that I'm just reading too much into EVERYTHING. If so please tell me so I can temper myself fully."
448,vulnerability,offmychest,I feel like being open about your mental health problems is much less stigmatized for women than it is for men.,1,9z3ynd,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9z3ynd/i_feel_like_being_open_about_your_mental_health/,2018-11-22 02:05:41,"First of all, I know this is a very delicate topic and I want to be clear: Everyone who suffers, suffers. I do not mean to belittle anyone and I am happy for everyone who finds a way to cope with their burden. This post is made after the experiences I made and in the mindset I am in, and I am fully aware that they might not represent the actual situation. Also English isn't my first language, so excuse any weird phrasing. As the title says, I feel like for men it's way harder to be accepted with mental illnesses as it is for women. I'll start with Social Media. On my instagram feed, there are so many women who are open about their depression/anxiety, some of whom make their whole account about it - and they get so much support, mostly from other women. (and I honestly am glad for them, their vulnerability being rewarded in this way.) It seems to me like the whole blogosphere about mental health is entirely dominated by women. So as a man suffering from Social Anxiety and Depression, I feel kind of.. underrepesented? It invokes the feeling as if talking about mental health is kind of a female thing, and so I am really afraid of doing it as a man, because I fear being perceived as weak or weird or unstable. I do not have the traditional image of masculinity, but nevertheless, I kind of just have this gut feeling that people won't be as supportive. Also in my social circles, I hear stories of some of my male friends, whose girlfriends suffer from panic attacks or eating disorders, how they try to support them, try to be there from them tirelessly, and the same from my female friends and their supportive boyfriends. Though I have never, ever heard this story the other way around. I cannot even imagine it, frankly. As progressive as we are becoming in terms of relationships, it still seems to me that a man with mental health issues is perceived as somewhat undesirable, that it still is like a norm for men to be the supportive, stable partner, while women are accepted to be more complex, ""flawed"" and in need of support - which in my opinion is also a kind of sexism. So please, I need some insights, some contrary or similar experiences, any input is really appreciated."

Moments of such intense and raw vulnerability, that Ive never shared with someone before. Do you remember in July when we were tripping together? We were in your bathroom, and we were just holding each other. I said, I love you, and you said, I love you too. And I felt it. I know you did too. But now youre gone. Youre not coming back, are you? All of it was for nothing. It didnt mean anything in the end. Almost 3 years that weve known each other now, and I dont know if Ill ever see you again. You say well never be together again. And I have no choice but to accept it, even though I still love you, so much. It makes me feel sick and empty inside. Like everything was a lie. I wish those moments had never happened. Because they keep me awake at night now. Wondering how you couldve been so close once, and now, so far. Only to get farther. I am so deeply unhappy. Im not sure what to do. Reliving these memories is slowly killing me."

First of all, I DONT ASK FOR YOUR PITY. I just want someone to listen so I dont feel like a fool talking to myself. I dont really ask for much, as they dont have to care! They can just be there and pretend theyre listening! I wouldnt care if theyd choose to forget, tbh Id rather they do. But just being there for me is extremely enough and I'm already so thankful. I mean, I know when I need to ask some input or something, but as the one who shares, I get to find that timing, otherwise, it'll just ruin my train of thought, and things would be more complex than ever. Its just simple. Just be there, really. No one really gets to choose their friends, its either forced or natural. But you can chose among them who you can trust.

Yet two lonely souls are impossible to actually end up together...it makes no sense. I feel like I'm not even allowed to have fun, like God is punishing me for even attempting to begin to confirm and have a happy life, and the happiness police from my past that scrutinized me for helping critically haunts me and decided that I've broken another rule in this Utopia of danger zone. Am I asking for it? Am I luring in bad things? Am I the crazy arswipe who let it all in in the first place by bringing back anything at all? Should I not have showed them my true self?

She's perfect. Literally just perfect. I have never ever met someone so compatible. It's so seriously spooky, and I thank heavens for letting me know this wonderful person. Although... Straight up, the second day we met, she said she wasn't looking for anything now. That she had a long distance relationship in the past and that's not what she wants. We live quite far away from each other, and it will take at least another 6 months for that to change. I kept on with little advances, flirting (I asked first, she said it was okay and even reciprocated a little). I used to think of myself as a pragmatic, level headed and rational individual but apparently that's not true. It has only been a week since I've met her, and I'm consumed by the thought of her (is this even normal?). Again, I did tell her that I think I might start having feelings, and she again made it clear that she isn't looking for a relationship and just wants to be friends with me. That she doesn't want to misinterpret friendship for romantic interest. She even suggested that we stop talking for a while. And that's all true. I keep telling myself, that it's all bullshit. How can you start falling for someone you've literally never met and that too so soon? She even had the courtesy to let me down slowly. Her position is most likely infallible, and I do understand. Everything she told me is valid. Long distance relationships don't work. I am consciously trying to distance myself from her. I don't tell her things that are personal to me. For me, vulnerability fosters intimacy. So I try my best to be as distant as I can. But it doesn't work that way anymore. I've become engrossed in my work, but she crosses my mind every passing second. But then there's the constant texting. And occasional calls. I falter. I ignored boundaries I thought I set in stone. I had promised myself that there'll be no pictures, so that all she remains is a faceless visage in my head. I didn't even think about it while looking at her beautiful face. I don't know why I'm like this. Is this normal? None of my previous relationships were like this. I don't even know if what I feel is what I think it is. Maybe she just finds me unattractive? Maybe she just sees me as a person and wants to keep things platonic? Maybe she just wants a best friend? I wish I could switch off the feelings in my brain. What bullshit."
453,vulnerability,offmychest,Bullies from the past,1,a1ues4,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/a1ues4/bullies_from_the_past/,2018-12-01 04:21:32,"Even though I'm at a better place in my life now, from time to time I remember them, and for a brief moment all those feelings of betrayal, embarrassment, inadequacy, and anger come flooding back. Especially the anger. I sometimes imagine all of the things I might do if I had them in a locked room with no consequences from the outside world. And then I get angry at myself. Not just for thinking such awful things, but the fact that I let myself be treated that way for so long. They say that the only person who can make you feel inadequate is you, so why did I let that happen? Why did I let it go on for so long? Why didn't I run away sooner? They say running away from a problem won't fix the problem, and sometimes I agree, but sometimes you need to find a better environment to foster that kind of change too. Sometimes sticking around in a toxic place out of some fear of being perceived as weak only feeds a cycle of paranoia and self-doubt. So I left, and I'm all the better for it. Despite all that, I still wonder what might happen if the people around me now found out that I use to feel this way. That I sometimes still feel this way. They treat me with respect now, but only because they didn't see me as I was then. Because I went in as a new face, with an attitude that I was worth something. And it worked. And I liked it. But now I wonder if maybe I haven't really been myself. Is the person they see really me, or just the persona I allow them to see? If they found out just how lost and scared I am now as I was then, would they respect my vulnerability, or see it as a weakness and exploit it like those from the past did? I find it helpful to remember that feelings are always fleeting, and this will all possibly be gone from my mind tomorrow, but for today it's nice to just write it out and get it off my mind. "

So, to start, I do love my mom, but shes the type of person that was never suited to be a parent. I think she had kids because she felt like she was supposed to. She loves us, but shes not motherly in the slightest. 5-ish years ago, I was a freshly graduated, penniless student living at home. I was in a very dark place at this time, dealing with an eventual autism diagnosis, beginning to realize I was transgender, and severe depression and anxiety. I was unemployed (but taking classes, and financial supported by my now-fianc), and just trying to sort my life out. I had just lost my insurance, IIRC because I aged out of qualifying for my parents insurance, but I didnt yet know how this would affect my prescriptions. I went to my pharmacy, and learned my antidepressant would cost ~$200 out of pocket. I was crushed. At the time, it was important for me to have those medications, and I came home and had a panic attack on my front step. My fianc came outside and found me, and came to comfort me. My mom happened to walk by and saw us, asked what was happening, and her response, while short and insignificant, taught me to not trust my mother with anything and to keep all information on a need-to-know basis... Then maybe you should get a job, with as much hatred and disgust as Ive ever heard from her. No, Im sorry. No, Can I do anything? Even just walking away without saying anything would have been acceptable. But it was more important for her at that time to remind me how much of a failure I was, and that what I was doing with my life was unacceptable in her eyes. Our relationship is better now, but I will never look at her the same way again. It sounds petty, but I cannot respect someone who willfully kicks their kid when they are down. TL;DR Mother used my vulnerability as an opportunity to hurt me further"
455,vulnerability,offmychest,Molested &amp; stalked by sociopathic ex-friend. Where do I go from here?,1,a34p6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/a34p6w/molested_stalked_by_sociopathic_exfriend_where_do/,2018-12-05 07:47:23,"I'll try to keep this as short and sweet and possible, sorry if it ends up being longer than intended - I guess I have a few things to get off my chest It would be safe to say that I was a late bloomer; In middle school the other guys at school were hitting puberty, sprouting in height, and muscle mass. Not to say that I was frail, but it did in some ways make me an easy target. This led to me being teased on, and in several cases corned into physical altercations to stand my ground. I am also regretful that in this period, I even bullied occasionally to 'fit in', and I've been working on reaching out to those individuals and severing what ever damage I might have caused - and I am in some ways thankful that this changed my perspective and gave me a little insight into myself. At some point my childhood friend, decided that I was no longer fit to be part of the group, and over night decided that I wasn't cool enough. Which eventually led me to being bullied by my own best-friends. That hurt, but f\*\*k it, that's how life goes and wish them all well (we were kids). I eventually found my groove with a new group of mates, and my balls finally dropped. This had become my little obsession in the summer before freshman year high school, and would be several years to come. Anyone who knows a thing or two about lifting, knows that the exponential increase of natural testosterone in puberty &amp; simultaneously lifting heavy, meant the gains were magical. I think I had gone from 5'6-6ft and put on about 17-21 lbs of muscle. Coming into high school, I was feeling very good about myself (still riddled with insecurities, and low self-esteem). It was the first time in a very long time, where I did not dread going to school. No longer an easy target, I didn't have any issues with bullies from than on, and the popular kids would should love. It just happens that this ex-best friend (lets call him Joe) had joined our school. I don't think it took him very long to be-friend the cool kids. To be honest not sure if people generally really loved him, or if he was just a very persistent and confident individual. I remember seeing him around the hallways, never had a real interaction with Joe. Never really cared to, I did not really care to hang around the old-group, just the occasional hi/bye. At some point I end up in a class with this guy. Don't remember how I ended up talking to him first, but first day out of that classroom we end up walking together in the hallway on our way to the next class. Something about Joe, just didn't feel right, and I remember feeling this way when I first met him. Something felt off, something made my stomach a little uneasy about him. Joe went on boasting about how influential his father was, and how he was thinking of buying a Lamborghini next year to drive to school in. I know what you're thinking - red flag. (to be fair I think his parents are extremely kind, and hardworking - not at the level of economic status that he would frequently remind me of). It felt almost like a sales pitch &amp; and just couldn't brush him off. He would cling on to me all the way through, and despite my best efforts to dodge him, he was persistent. I think I was also far too kind, and innocent to recognize this behavior. I though to myself, he's probably cool, a little insecure, but I'm sure with time he would be real with me. We end up becoming best friends. There are several elements of our friendship that I want to highlight: 1. His constant need to know my where about 2. Liked to control who I hung out with (this included him creating rumors and lies about my other group of friends, successfully building a gap between me and them). Even some how manipulating me into giving him my social media account passcodes, cuz you know 'we're brothers' we don't have secrets. Its me and you against the world 3. Constant criticism - I mean constant. He was a smart guy, and I would say I am smart myself, but his confidence always trumped my opinions, which led me to eventually believe that my thoughts/opinions didn't matter. If a girl came and hit on me it could go two ways; either he tried to push me to go for it, or (if he didn't like her - for me) he would almost instantly somehow infer that I am ugly, smelly, too dumb, in a joking manner ofcourse (to soften the punch lol). 4. If we argued, he would somehow get to my house and call me to tell me he's outside. He wouldn't stop calling till I came outside to speak to him. The arguments are always the same, somehow it is always my fault, and he would go on guilt tripping the shit out of me, till I felt like a piece of shit, like I should apologize regardless of what actually happened. I would walk away or avoid talking to him in some cases, but he would not leave it. If we fought over the phone, five minutes later he was under my house, and we had to solve right then and there. One of two times I told him off, he threatened to turn the whole school against me, bully me until the end of the year, and follow me for the rest of my life. I caved. 5. He liked to talk about himself a lot. Always patting himself on the back, even over some f\*\*ked up sh\*t ;About how he ejaculated into some girls drink at a party one time, or how he bullied so and so. How big his d\*ck is, and he seemed to very infatuated in his own body. The few times that we trained together, he would find a way to criticize my body, try and make me feel like being strong &amp; muscular was gay. Tried not to train with him as much as possible. 6. For some reason did not like to be over at my house, did not like interacting with my family, and in some cases insinuating some remark about them. He preferred if I was over, constantly inviting me to sleep over at his and meet his parents. Which I did nearly every other weekend. He always liked to be secretive in his home. If his parents were not home, I should be over. If were in his room the door is closed. This all normal stuff tbh, but considering what he was up to, I think I understand why he was like that. It started off with wanting to 'cross-swords' while peeing, because were bro's. Then to the occasional butt grab, which also seemed some what innocent to me, given that this is prevalent in any guys high school locker-room. but these weird requests slowly turned into, let me see your d\*\*k. You're like my younger brother, I just want to see it. I can't believe I was so blind, and he was so manipulative. It repulsed me to my very core, and I felt trapped and suffocated whenever I was around him. Sub-conciously I knew something was severely wrong with Joe, but I couldn't get myself to fully comprehend wtf was going on. Once I let him see it, it just turned fucking weird from there. He would ask about my previous sexual encounters, which is bro talk, but in away it seemed to arouse him. and of course the sleep over invitations persisted. If I made excuses or refused to come over, it was betrayal. he would be under my house yet again, to accuse me of lying to him, and betraying his trust. Long story short the guy ends up touching my d\*\*k a number of times after that, sometimes attempting to manually arouse me, so he could see the size of it. Just writing this makes my stomach churn. I can't believe that I ever reached such a place of vulnerability and did not take action. Why did allow such a thing to happen, even though I felt like the life was sucked out of me whenever he was around. Like a black hole sits between us and just vacuums all life into it. Thank god, we end up going to separate universities. Again, I felt that familiar feeling of being set free of whatever fear, anxiety I held. I was growing in university. Discovering the ropes, figuring out who I am. He would call/message me on a daily basis. A year passes by and were back home for the summer. It starts off fine, catching up or whatever. But I tell him that I have developed feelings for a girl, and was thinking of asking her out. I thought this is great, my friend would be happy for me. He looks at me and says, ""oh and kiss her too?"" ""yeah.."" this leads to an argument, and telling him to get out of my car (to be fair I was dropping him off, and I got him close enough to where he was going). An hour later, you guessed it he's under my house. Poking at me, calling me names, accusing my family of ruining me. I attempt to go back into my house, and I find him a couple minutes later walking into my house un-invited. Short story- I end up knocking him outside. When he comes to I get him some water and a chair, but he goes crazy. Spitting blood on the walls, calling his parents to pick me up and come see what I did to him, etc. Him calling my parents the next day to say I am a coward, and I started having panic attacks just thinking about talking to him or seeing him ever again. A semester after that I find out that he's moved to my college (a couple incidents there - one of which he attempted to get me expelled, and calls the police on me). After that he's moved countries to the city of my employment. And when I move again he's moved with me. Not really worried about him following me as I have not seen him in over a year now. I have told a handful of people about this, two of which went to the same school as me. Id love to hear some psychological advise that anyone might have. have you encountered something similar? Really sorry for long post. I think my ex best friend is a closet sociopathic gay, who molested, manipulated, and is currently stalking me. Advise is welcome."
456,vulnerability,offmychest,Some personal insight on what makes a great relationship,1,a351dy,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/a351dy/some_personal_insight_on_what_makes_a_great/,2018-12-05 08:22:05,"Im a 22-year-old man, as long as Ive been sexually active Ive been in relationships. Im just the kind of person who needs the companionship and trust that comes with a relationship, and after recently going through the longest single period of my life since starting dating (about a year), I discovered it wasnt for me. However, my first relationship (2 years) was a failure and my second (4 years) ended amicably after I realised that, although I loved her, I just wasnt happy for reasons I couldnt explain. I met a woman (21) some time ago, and despite horrible difficulties in the beginning of the relationship that had others telling me it would never work, I found myself drawn to her, something told me to push through it and fight, that there was something better on the other side. Now, Im absolutely in love, something Ive never been able to say about any of my other relationships, and I can see a future with her without feeling any of the anxieties that came up when I thought of my potential lives with the others. Im really into the humanities. Linguistics is my passion, and Im fascinated with culture, anthropology, history, psychology, philosophy, and basically anything to do with the way we as humans experience the world and express ourselves. My interest in the human experience has led me to a lot of pondering and self-reflection on what lies at the heart of truly loving someone. I found some answers in the ideas of Freud and Jung that I found insightful. Freud and Jungs theories were concerned with the subconscious. Elements of our psyche that we repress and reject due to the pressures of our environments. We are ashamed of them, we deny them, and we find it impossible to admit to their existence, lest we admit to being someone we never want to be. Because of this, they haunt us, and we are unable to address them. They are at the root of our crises of mind and identity. I think we all know that genuine love is built on respect and admiration. But less talked about is the source of that respect. I believe that we fall in love with people who we see as alternative versions of ourselves. People who display characteristics and traits that we openly identify with and value in ourselves, but also accept the elements of their psyche that we struggle to accept in ourselves. We admire and respect people who are strong enough to show the side of their personalities that we ourselves cannot. We also admire people who have traits that we aspire to, but do not have. We admire people who show discipline where we have none, we admire people who show vulnerability when we cannot. We admire people who are strong where we ourselves are weak. But this admiration can also give rise to insecurity. If this person can be what I cannot, then whats wrong with me? This has to be countered with the recognization of your own strengths in relation to the other. See where you thrive where the other doesnt, and use your strength to help the other with their own struggles. I believe that love is a balance between common values and traits, and contrasting strengths that are admired by each in the other. I believe a relationship thrives when partners use their strengths to teach each other how to overcome their weaknesses, and when each partner shows the other how to accept the elements of their identity that the other had struggled to come to terms with. In this way, I believe that true love is admiring and respecting your partner, being humbled by them and believing in their ability to help you grow as a person, and striving to help them do the same. True love is pushing your partner towards self-actualisation, helping them be the best person they can be, to be the person that they want to be, to be the person that they truly are, and trusting them to do the same for you. TL;DR Love is admiring the traits of someone that you value but lack or cannot accept. True love is respecting their strengths, humbling yourself to them and learning from them to be the best person you can be, and believing that you can do the same for them."

He quit because he said he didnt enjoy a desk job. And that was all the information he shared really. He was a quiet, to himself kind of guy. He loved teaching government and law, you could tell it was a passion. A couple weeks go by and I noticed that he would end every day with see you tomorrow... maybe! I assumed he meant that in a playful way acknowledging that students may skip class. One day I asked him why he ended every single class that way and he responded with (something along the lines of) I dont promise everyday because theres a chance I go missing. I asked him to elaborate and he said (I remember this part clearly) Ill share more tomorrow, just know that if on the news it says I committed suicide, know that I didnt. I was taken. He told me to have a good day and I awkwardly smirked and went to class. The next day- its like I unleashed something. He started off the class by addressing his see you tomorrow... maybe! quote. We were intrigued. The class that day became a story hour. He talked about how he was fascinated with government/unknown to others types of things. He would dig deep deep into websites he shouldnt be in using software he probably shouldnt be using. He said he went through several computers because coincidentally every single one of them would crash and wouldnt be usable whatsoever. Although most would take this as a warning sign, it gave him motive. Im not sure what he was looking for or why. I think we were a little scared to ask. It was just understood that was he saw or was looking for was not good. He then talked about cases where activists and movement leaders were eventually killed/taken to black sites. He also shared about Snowden and said that we need more people like him and that everyone deserves to know the truth and it needs to be shared. You should have seen the look in his face, it was fear and anger in one. He ended the talk with telling the class about if he ever commits suicide or disappears that it was them. I havent had this professor in over 2 years and I still think about him often. Im always uneasy thinking that I might hear about him on the news and honestly Ive held a heavy weight on my shoulders since. I appreciate his vulnerability and willingness to share but now all I can think about is if he is ok. "

You are a brave soul, and I wish you the best in life. I don't mean to target any particular group of people with this post, and hope it isn't taken that way. That being said, I can't understand what there is to be proud of. Personally speaking, I experience gender dysphoria on a daily basis, and it's driving me up a wall, but I feel absolutely no sense of pride in it and can't justify acting on them, much less make them known. Why is discovering that I'm something people will hate and abuse a good thing, what's the pride in that? I constantly hear people talking about how trans people are freaks and how they all deserve to die, and I don't understand why it's a good thing I should choose to be what they are talking about, and be proud of it. It's just another vulnerability that people will use against you to discriminate against you and demean your existence. I imagine the same is true for other people that fall under the LGBT+ spectrum, I'm not trying to contain this to trans people. I suppose it's good to feel good about your identity from time to time, I assume that's what the point of ""pride"" is, but the world we live in makes it seem so small and meaningless, I can't understand how people can take the message to heart.

461,vulnerability,offmychest,Every time I emotionally open up to someone in my life that person becomes distant before leaving for good and it's slowly breaking me.,1,9ohdt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9ohdt4/every_time_i_emotionally_open_up_to_someone_in_my/,2018-10-16 09:07:36,"Using a throwaway because I have people who know my account and do not want them to see this for above mentioned reason. I really feel like I have nowhere to go and it's slowly tearing me up inside. Every time, without fail, I open up in any emotional capacity it drives the person I open up to away. Friends, romantic partners, they all disappear the moment I make myself vulnerable and it just makes me hurt even more. With my ex of 6 months, everything was wonderful until I shared information about a past friend group I had, how I felt they were a negative influence in my life, and how I left them. It's was a formative experience in my life and deeply hurt and is one of the few things I get emotional about. Shortly after we have a ""lets talk"" discussion and it's over. One night I share with friends how important they are to me, how I typically feel I don't have anyone I can really talk to about my feelings and how I appreciate them and our friendship, and shortly after that it's over. The texts slow down. The invites out stop coming. The plans we have they back out of. They're gone. The straw that broke the camels back is last night. I started dating a beautiful, intelligent, funny, caring girl a month ago and the chemistry has been explosive. Since we matched on the dating app we had been chatting almost literally non-stop for the entire month we've been seeing each other. Our texts are always fun and exciting. She began opening up to me relatively quickly about past relationships, her emotions, her fears and all the other deep things that make a person vulnerable. Up to this point I had been holding back because I worry my vulnerability will drive her away, but last night she asked about my friends. We chatted about my current ones and she seemed excited and inquisitive as always. I decide to open up and mention my lost friend-group. I tell her a brief overview of the story and try and end it on a positive note in that, while it was a hard emotional experience at the time, I'm a better person now and I wouldn't be where I am without it having happened. And sure enough the texting slows. Each one becomes passionless and awkward. She specifically mentions that she's ""sorry she's being weird and doesn't want me to fret, that it's her."" I ask her what's bothering her and she dismisses the question. I try and change the subject by asking what she's up to and she shuts it down with a simple ""nothing too exciting."" Shortly after she says she's going to bed. Today is no better. I get no sleep all night because my anxiety over the events of last night. I get into work and one thing after another fails, adding to the stress. I send over a text to try and spark up a normal conversation and the responses are curt. When I get home I ask if she wants to relax and watch some TV, hoping a slow night cuddling on the couch will make things feel more normal. But it's ""not in the cards but I should do that on my own without her."" I realize it's possessive to have her at beck and call but I really hoped to have some emotional reassurance that things are ok. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't afford a therapist and don't really have family I can talk to. I'm scared to talk to my remaining friends about my problems as I don't want them to leave either. I feel so emotionally defeated and alone. In the short term I just want things to go back to how they were with her, but long term I really just need someone I can open up to. I'm tired of feeling alone. "

Im in so much pain, but I cant even think about it because Im so emotional (Im sure the concussion has a lot to do with that too) but I think the thing right thats getting to me is, I realized that I have no one to call to be here for me, besides my mom. If he person I want to be here wouldnt be here, even if I asked, and I dont have anyone else right now that hits me on that level of vulnerability and comfort. Im really lonely recently. I feel so abandoned, by everyone. My friends said they cant be in my life anymore, one without an explanation and the other because of our differing views on life. My (now ex) boyfriend said he cant be what I need right now and he didnt want to hold me down which really fucking sucked, and Im still trying to accept that. My mom has tried to be supportive, especially after I dropped a bomb on her about my sexual abuse history when I was in the hospital a few weeks ago for my psych evaluation. But shes not very good at being comforting. And I really need comfort. Idk. Ive never felt this intense of a need to be held. Or if I have I cant remember and probably jumped in bed with someone to elevate the sadness, but I dont want to be that person anymore. I dont find sex satisfying anymore without a deep connection. But Im not sure I want that connection with anyone anymore, so I really dont know what to do. I just feel like everyone leaves and Im emotionally exhausted from being let down. Ive been lonely for a long time, but right now, Ive never felt this heavy of loneliness. This realization that I dont want to let anyone in anymore is heavy. The fact that the man I love says he cant (not doesnt want to, but cant?) be there for me has really broken me down. Im tired of letting people in that just leave and break My heart. But I also feel like right now, I just need someone, you know? Maybe its this injury thats brought this all up and makes it feel this heavy. But idk, breathing is just so much harder these days. "

464,vulnerability,offmychest,"I used to be the guy who comforts my suicidal friends, but now...",1,9qtz74,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9qtz74/i_used_to_be_the_guy_who_comforts_my_suicidal/,2018-10-24 09:44:23,"I am this one step away from really writing my suicidal note today. But before anything else, let me give you a little backtrack. Yes, I used to be that guy who comforts my suicidal friends. As a matter of fact, I'm one of the people who looked out for my redditor friend after she tried killing herself. Stayed with her together with other redditors for a week (me for 2 days). I was the one telling her that she's going to be okay and that everyone will be there for her. Lucky for her, her mom was supportive and stayed with her. Her mom listened to her. And after a year, I found myself only a few steps away from her state. The helper was now someone who's secretly carrying this baggage. Now I do understand how a depressed, suicidal person thinks. And I wish this post could explain further their situation, coming from a person who commonly deals with them, and now suffers from it. &gt; Being a friend and telling that they are there is enough I'm going to be honest. This is not enough. It was never enough. In reality, friends could still be there but your problems ain't also going anywhere. Accept the bitter truth that your words won't solve the problem, unless you are that friend who is vital for the person's comfort. If he/she thinks that you are the only person who could he/she opens up with, then you gotta listen and tell something that could help him/her with the problem. Give solutions and not just a vague comforting feeling. Sometimes, we do already know the answers, we just want it to be worded by someone else. &gt; Family should reach out asap with members who suffer from depression. Nope. Let them think first. Stop ambushing them or forcing them to speak up because nagging will not make it any better. No matter how long the wait is, you have to let the person speak up naturally. Just tell them that they can open up if they're ready. Forcing them to speak up messes up with their vulnerability. Trust me, there are many times that I could've opened up, but you nagging or maybe even joking about it didn't make it any better. &gt; Not understanding the signs of depression I gained a lot of pounds because of my eating disorder, and not because I'm a pig. I got sleepless nights and tried dwelling myself by watching shows whole day and not giving a fuck, not because I'm a lazy bastard but because I want forget the fact that I'm depressed and my family can't even deal with such raw emotions in life. Don't be mistaken with the symptoms of depression. &gt; Getting people to open up and shortly after, talking shit about that person.. Last week, for almost 2 years. I have finally opened up about my depression and my anxiety from my previous job. My parents and I had the talk. We poured out hearts out, and encourage everyone to speak out and tell everything. After that, we decided to start fixing the problem and start moving on from our differences. But earlier today, I was pretending to be asleep when I heard my mom shit talk about me. That she was still insisting her side as the truth. She said that it wasn't really depression at all. She said that I was faking it because I was smiling, and having fun even before I told them I was depressed. And she said it all when I was asleep, when she couldve take advantage of it. Yes, I was the optimistic guy in my group of friends. Yes, I was the cheery, jokester that everyone knew. But deep inside, I am hurt. Deep inside, I am struggling to open up because I have this burden of being the guy with no vulnerabilities. But when I opened up and tried being vulnerable for the first time, after so many years, and then hearing the people you have admitted you depressive episodes dismiss you and your emotions. That hurts. It hurts a lot. And i feel cheated about it. How come I can't get the same acceptance from my family like the ones I have supported before? Which then lead me to my suicidal note. I knew which words should I put in it. I already knew the flow of the letter and how would it appear. But I never put it in an actual letter, afraid that writing it would lead to the next.. To be honest, I could've ended myself earlier. But guilt alway strike me. I know my death would deal pain to my father, to my friends who loved and trusted me. I know that if I ended myself, no amount of ""I'm sorry"" could ever replace the fact that I ended my life foolishly for these emotions. I couldve ended myself, but the fact that I'm hurting others through my death isn't really great. I want to die, but I don't want to ""kill"" others with my own burden. Sorry if it doesn't make any sense. I'm sleeepy right now. Must sleep. And dad, I know you will never be able to read this. But I'm really sorry for not hugging you or greeting you on your birthday yesterday. You are one of the reasons why I can't I kill myself, because I don't want to torment you for life.. "
465,vulnerability,offmychest,I'm tired of my walls.,1,9qy6io,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9qy6io/im_tired_of_my_walls/,2018-10-24 20:47:27,"No matter how hard I push them, though, they feel so ironclad, impenetrable even by my own strength. Many adult years spent feeling like a robot, because of the ridicule of feeling things too hard, too differently, too black-and-white-ly. I used to enjoy the brightness of anger and sadness, because I wouldn't feel happiness as hard, and I was grateful I felt things to begin with. As I approach the end of the third decade of my life, I'm still reminded of how my life was not mine for a majority of it. Choices existed for those I lived under; I was not deserving of choice, they said. The result of this lifestyle, once I tasted a hint of freedom, I did not know how to control my emotions. I hurt people left and right, because for so long I was not allowed to be selfish, and I finally had a chance to feed my own desires. It's odd to think about, though. The need to fulfill personal indulges that hurt others were for minor things, but as they piled they genuinely crushed the kindness of someone else. Someone who tried to make amends with me but ultimately decided life was better with me erased. I don't miss him in the sense of love or friendship or anything related to romance. I miss the ease of vulnerability I had, I miss the fleeting moments of the purity of emotions. I miss the innocence, I miss the simplicity. He represents the time in my life where I struggled to grasp the concept of adulthood. And though we were not fit for each other, though we did not complement each other, I miss that time of my life. It's because of that chapter that I built these walls. The walls where every time I allowed them to crumble, someone else would help me replaster them with his or her initials. Each crack had a name, and each was the shape of his or her soul in the size they allowed me to see them. I finally found a soul shaped hole I don't think I will ever need to close. It grows bigger each day, matched by the amount of love he helps me discover for him, for the beauty in struggle and life, and for myself. He enjoys the simplest things in life, and purifies each tastebud of my life's tongue. He places a window in every crack I've covered, and he's helping me realize that these cracks are to be respected and appreciated, not hidden. He does this all without expectation. He embodies everything I respect and hope to be. He is the most incredible human I've ever encountered, and I appreciate him and his existence with every ounce of my being. I set a stone down for each day I spend with him, but the stones are far less opaque. I'm rebuilding a new home to call my life. These stones all surround the wall I built about a decade ago, but I'm hoping one day those walls will become more of an open frame I can respect rather than this weird doorless steel factory I cultivated and hate so desperately. I am not a robot. I am a human. I deserve to breathe. I deserve to live. I deserve to love and respect who I am and what I've been through. I love you, S. With all of my heart and soul and farts and holes. I hope I give you what you give me, and I would do anything and everything in my power to support you, to give you what you deserve, which is no less than the very best life has to offer. I am so lucky you are a part of my life. Thank you for everything you do, everything you show, everything you are. I truly believe you are wholly destined to influence the world with positivity in a great way, and you are who the world needs. I hope one day you see yourself the way I see you. And every step of the way, I will do my absolute best to show you who you are."

I stopped waiting for people to make their words a reality. I forgot to feel foolish for all the times I gave affection and received nothing in return, all the while realizing that vulnerability is one of my strengths and I decided to save it for those worthy of it. I threw away the list of things I wanted to discuss with those around me, because I found people and places where my voice and ideas are valued. I didn't feel the need to walk backwards, because I found better places to go. I neglected to think about the past, because some moments don't carry on to the next, even though they once looked like they would have been able to. I ran out of resentment, because some things aren't worth holding on to. The last straw fell and I wasn't there to catch it because I didn't need it anymore."

So anyway Im hanging with them in the few minutes before school starts one of my friends grabs my phone and he knows my passcode, so he gets on my phone and hes all like what should I do and the dick said to check his recently deleted so they do and they find a picture of the girl I had a crush on and they start laughing and asking why its on there and they ask if I jerked off to it and I denied it at first but eventually I just couldnt keep up the lie and I said yeah and made a joke out of it to not show vulnerability. They then told her about it but she seemed to shrug it off kind of I wasnt really watching when it happened. I felt like my world was falling apart. I still had classes with her the rest of the semester we still talked but never about the picture or that day, and we barely talked the rest of the year. That was last year. I always wanted to apologize for if it made her feel bad, but I was scared. Now I want to apologize but every time I see her my stomach drops from nervousness. I thought about apologizing over text but that feels to impersonal and I asked my friend and he said I shouldnt because its been too long and it might just make things worse and I just dont know what to do."

but im just going to try to clear things out. clear things out inside me, clear the situation out. i want to get out of this. im scared. very scared. im scared of what i am feeling. i am scared of the anger that i have inside of me. im scared of what it all means, and what will i do and how it will affect the people around me. this is going to be just me being raw and truthful, first and foremost with myself. this is hard. um. i need to acknowledge the feelings i have inside of me. ok. i thought a lot. i have been thinking a lot about this. writing this out will be better for me. better for me to express what i feel. its a linear process and with my fast-enough typing speed, which almost matches my thinking speed. i type what im thinking without any interference in the middle. just literally streaming all of my thoughts from my head to the screen. i have been going through a lot of things. theres so many things inside of my head right now. my minds racing at just a million kilometers every second, and i dont know how to process things. ok. starting now. i felt pain. it hurt me when she would fight with me. i liked her. i really liked her. i loved her. my feelings for her have always been just so intense. ever since the first time i started talking to her. long before i even knew within me that i liked this girl. my feelings for her would always be at a hundred percent high whenever i would be around her. to talk to her. she gave me a high. seeing her, it would make things around me better. i felt a rush. she was just so beautiful in my eyes. i was fascinated by her. my mind would literally stop functioning when i would be around her. it wasnt like that with other people. when i first met her. i dont know. i just, it wasnt just awe. it was deep. even writing about it right now. i can close my eyes, and i see her face. i can hear her voice. i remember the day early january i was talking to her all the time i liked her so much i told her i liked her so much i would lie around and think about the cute things she would say there was flirting so much flirting i felt comfortable with her. it just stems from there my emotions my feelings i wasnt in control of what i would feel i couldnt understand it i couldnt place this new raw sensitivity inside of me it was always so intense within me. i do still care about her. i hate her. but i still care. the opposite of love is not hate. the opposite of love is apathy. the lack of care, lack of interest, or concern. its indifference to a human being. hate exists on the same spectrum and on the same side of the spectrum as love. its just as intense and it comes from the same care. i still have the same intensity of emotions for her. i have been thinking about this for a long time now. i cant acknowledge this feelings inside of me without also admitting to myself that i still have feelings for her. i dont know. i still care about her. when she told me. that we are done. that she doesnt want anything to do with me anymore. it hit me in a place that i never felt before. i dont know what it was. i dont know why it was. maybe i am just more mature. more capable of being hurt now than before. maybe i allowed myself to be hurt this way by allowing myself to love her this way. i wasnt sure what was happening. and i dont know what she wanted to me to feel or what she was expecting my reaction to be maybe she thought that it wasnt as serious as it was maybe she did not think about the immediate reaction but was only thinking about the future thinking about how the toxic relationship was impacting not only me but maybe also her maybe she thought it would get better after a while maybe she wanted only a break maybe she did not know or think about anything she acted out of impulse because of something that happened or something she was feeling. what i hate her for is for making me be this vulnerable i was soft and open and vulnerable and unguarded and so helplessly exposed to the possibility of being harmed emotionally. i hate her for getting inside of me. she either knew that leaving me at that point in time, when i needed her the most. when i had so many problems at home and in other parts of my life, she knew that it would hurt me. or she either didnt. she did not know that i would be in pain. i dont know which option is true. or which of these options is better. i hate for manipulating my brain. i was supposed to be strong. never before her did i ever think that a friend of mine leaving me this way would make me react like this. and me pushing her away, avoiding her, ignoring her doing everything that i want to do to her right now comes from wanting her to feel the same pain that i felt. i want her to hurt like i hurt. i cut myself on my stomach. 6 inches. it was long and slow and with a kitchen knife when my mom and dad and brother were outside the house. it was deep and it bled slowly around the knife as it passed my body. and it did not hurt. my brain did not register the pain. i closed my eyes to feel the pain and i could only hear her. her voice i could see the deep blacks of her hair. in front of my closed eyes and feel it whip my face. the blood felt warm as it dripped down my leg but it was never about harming me it was about harming the body that was owned by her. it was hurting the property of this girl to make her upset it was to make her sad it was to make her mad and angry. i did it because i wanted to hurt her. it was even then as i was permanently scarring my own body. about her. when i stood there underneath the shower, out of breath, trying to drown myself, as my lungs were screaming in pain, as my head was throbbing in pain. it was about wanting to hurt the body that belonged to her. when i tried to kill myself it was with the intention of haunting her. i wanted her to feel that pain. i wanted her to regret me. i wanted her to question herself, and to have that same self doubt that i had. the feeling that something went wrong. and to question herself for it. i hate her right now for making me lose myself. to be so irresponsible. i hate her not for leaving me but for being there in the first place. i dont blame her. when she left. things were tough. her parents. my parents. i had asked her for a break just a few days before too. it was the right thing. it should have been done. but she said no. she told me she loves me too much. she wouldn't be able to handle it. i couldnt do it to her. it was about her. and i fell for it. i fell for her manipulation. she manipulated my emotions. i hate her because after she left. i felt like i did something wrong. i felt like there was something wrong inside me. i felt like it was my fault that she broke up. she told me that she doesnt love me anymore. she told me that she stopped loving me a long time ago. she made me feel like i was a bad person. i was wrong and stupid and dumb and ugly and hateful and that no one should ever love me. what scares me is to think is that what if she never thought about me at all. to think that what if she doesn't care about me at all or that what if she thought that it wasnt a big deal. not a big deal. or what if she didnt even think about it at all and that she was just being simply selfish. maybe human. maybe irresponsible, maybe just a shitty person. but ultimately, just doing what she thought would be good for her and not thinking about me at all? it scares me because i couldnt do that to her. even at bad times, i thought about her. i always thought about her. i am not perfect. even when i did not think about her first and maybe prioritized myself over her. i still always eventually thought about her. and it would kill me to believe that what if she didnt. for my entire life. its never been hard for me to feel things and to express what im feeling. i have gone through shit in my life. fucked up. but when it came to what happened with her. i did not know what to feel. i felt something. but i couldnt understand it. i didnt understand what i felt. for the first time i was untethered to my own brain. my brain was split in half. my body was split in half. i wanted her. i did not want her. i love her. hate her. i didnt know. i did not know anything anymore. my brother. my family. i did not know who i could trust. i did not know who i could talk to anymore. i had no support. i had nothing. it was the most alone i ever felt in my life. i felt like i lost everything. the world everything that i knew everything that i was taught everything i was prepared for everything disappeared. i went down in a spiral. i felt betrayed. felt wronged. felt wrong. i felt weak. i felt disgusted. at myself. anger. at the world. at existence. i did not trust myself anymore. did not trust my own emotions. hated my own emotions. hated myself for wanting her. i started to push down my feelings. dont cry. felt weak. dont trust. felt weak. be strong. felt weak. forced myself. i wanted to protect her. not be mad at her. i pushed down the hatred for her inside me. i didnt want to hurt her hurt anyone. but at the same time i wanted someone to be hurt. i want anyone to be hurt but me. except me. and her. before the break up. when things were going wrong. i didnt confront her on anything. i did not want to confront anything. i couldnt. i didnt want to do anything that would make things bad. i was grasping. trying so hard to make things right. i was so desperate. so many things. i fucked up. things were fucked up. i have always fucked things up. i never want to fuck things up. but i always fuck things up. i did care about her a lot. but it just never appeared that way. i was always the fuckup. fifty fucking shades of fucked up. i dont like to me as a person i dont like to keep grudges. i have never stopped myself from forgiving people and i have always let people back into my life even when they have just been submoronic piece of shits. so many times even after forgiving. they would hurt me again. but i would always force myself to look the other way. the thousands of things that made me happy. because everyone fucks up. especially me. i am desperate to see the good in people. because it would allow me to see the good in me. my ex. letting myself go back to her. allowing myself that vulnerability to talk to her again knowing what she did. she fucked my bestfriend in front of me. literally. when we were dating. and she fucked my bestfriend. in front of me. told me to go downstairs. and locked her door. and fucked him. fuck. that affected me so much. she ripped me down my psyche. how everything she did affected me subpsychologically. i was devastated. and then slowly i lost my friends. my school friends. her. my other friends. everyone. and it was all happening because of her. it was one of the toughest times of my life. was she a bad person? yeah. definitely. does she deserve a second chance? probabaly not. did i give it to her? yes. so many times. she would everytime come back, settle in, burn me soft and then stab me back everytime. but this time. again. i forgave her. i allowed myself to open myself up to her. because i was desperate. for someone. anyone. if i didnt get her. i would have probably gone mad. done something crazy. i could have killed myself. but i didnt. i trusted her i told her everything opened myself up to be judged to be mocked made fun of she could have just called me a pathetic loser. she could have. but she did not. and it helped. at a moment when i didnt have anybody. i had her. she was there. and i allowed her to be. i want to believe that she is the same. people make mistakes. people improve. people are shitty. and then they get better. this girl. she was nice. i like her. this year. its been big. significant. and for the majority of the year. i have been happy. and i can say it has been because of her. she made me happy. really happy. this break up. it has been the worst moment of my life. but this shouldnt define my relationship. it shouldnt define my year. it shouldnt define me my life. ultimately from all of this. what really hurt was how it all went down. how she decided to handle everything. things could have been better. really better. and that is what hurts. this was all just handled in the wrong way. maybe it was impulses. maybe she is just immature and i shouldnt expect more from her. but i did. and i do. i expected more. more responsibility. maturity. i want everything to end. i want all of this to stop. i dont want to lose a friend. i dont want to lose a person i trusted. i dont want to lose her. i want to stop this toxicity inside me. and it starts with me forgiving myself. and it ends with me forgiving her. i dont know if we'll ever get back together. i dont know if that is even the correct thing to do. there is no correct thing. this is life. things happen. and ultimately the only thing that should matter is if we're all happy. i loved her. i still love her. i love her. i love her. i want all of this to stop. im just tired now. im really really tired. tired of this struggle inside me. the fight. living with this. i dont know what is going on inside of her. i dont know if she even knows whats going on inside of me. even after everything, i dont know if i want to quit. quit on her. quit on me. quit on love. give up on everything. everything happens. life happens. and whether its theology or philosophy, fate, destiny, religion, a higher purpose or whatever; everything happens for a reason. i want to believe. believe. this has been a great year for me. a big year. a significant year. i fell in love. i loved. really loved someone. and she loved me. i want to believe she did. i want to believe that she knows that she is really really really important to me. and whether will we ever talk again or not or whether will we ever resolve this or not. i want to believe she knows that she will always be a really really big part of my life. nothing in this world is ever just black and white. only when we paint the world that way do we lose the ability to understand each other. there is always a reason for things, that doesnt mean it is an excuse, but it shouldnt mean that we dont strive to always try to understand one another. i dont want to hurt anyone anymore. i want everything to stop. i am done. writing. i dont really know what i wrote. i dont know what this is. its probably been just all over the place, pure chaos. while writing this. over the last 3 hours. i have learned myself. i just wanted to write everything down. be truthful. with myself. acknowledge myself. acknowledge my own feelings. things that i have written down in this are things that i have said or even thought about for the first time ever. writing this has been a process of self evaluation. this is what i feel. what is in my head. how i connected with another human being for the first time in my life to let myself get affected like this when she left. even now after everything that has happened. i want to start over. i have thought over everything. and i am going to apologize to her. and regardless of if she ever forgives me. i will need to begin to start the process of forgiving myself. if i let this manipulate my life than i am just giving her what she wanted if i let this affect me and ruin my life and become depressed and sad about it then she won. and she can't. I want to trust in the world, and hope that it won't fuck me over. I want to believe that there is still good in the world. in her."

You lied to yourself for months- trying not to think about how poorly you were managing our relationship. It was so frustrating. And you, youdonthavetocalll, why couldnt you stop being so in your head about what was normal? Why couldnt you just accept the fact that sometimes you might be doing something weird or immature or embarrassing, or god forbid, clingy? You were too scared to be vulnerable and as a result, you led with anger. That was the wrong thing to do. You arent even an angry person. You should have been truly vulnerable and waited to show that vulnerability little by little. You should have been more patient, which would have naturally brought more prudence. You wouldnt have fallen from such great heights if you had stopped to take a breath."

My boyfriend and I officially started dating early this year but we have been friends for quite awhile before that. That being said, I have had a crush on him for about a year before we started dating, and those days were quite a pain to look back on. I've always been a private person and due to my inexperience in relationships, in my many crushes in my earlier life, I'd never take the initiative to confess my feelings. So as you may tell, the time when me and my boyfriend finally got together was when he finally reciprocated and told me about it. Those days when he hadn't shown any signs of reciprocation and when he was sometimes absent, god was I desperate and sometimes so lonely, and at some nights I would cry myself to sleep... Yes, I have a baffling degree of sentimentality. A hopeless romantic. I was very, very happy when we got together. The first few months of the relationship, those were the rosiest days of my life. Sure there were feelings of insecurity and vulnerability, but never jealousy and everything felt quite perfect. I'd have to say our personalities match very well and we largely get along fine. We have had lots of fun together on the most mundane Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. But up until the start of this semester (in September), when he moved out of the dormitory and began to go about living on his own and managing his own life, it seems everything began to fall apart. I've always known him as a careless person, but since then it has gotten so bad that he'd break something every now and then. At one point he even broke a handpainted mug of mine (needless to say I was mentally broken). We've had that conversation so many times and he seems to be willing to change, but god knows how and when? This morning he stepped on a book shelf when getting off his bunk bed (the living space is incredibly small because unforunately we live in one of the world's most crowded cities), and of course it broke off from the wall to which it was fixed. I had to unscrew the shelf for him this noon and we're going to buy some Polyfilla tomorrow to plaster the wall, and hopefully repair the shelf... Well, I'm still deeply in love with him, but some days life does get harder. tl;dr I thought love was all about rainbow unicorns, but growing up it really is about mundane Wednesdays and mending broken stuff."
472,vulnerability,offmychest,I feel....weird? long post warning.,1,9sq2bp,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9sq2bp/i_feelweird_long_post_warning/,2018-10-31 04:27:43,"i'm 25 years old. just went back to school at the community college in pursuit of a personal training certificate. i am one of three females in the program, the rest are males. needless to say, being around a bunch of dudes every single day, watching them work out, having them help me work out...i inevitably feel some attraction to a lot of them. the problem is, they're all quite young adults, the youngest being 18 years old. i don't know how i feel about myself having a crush on an eighteen year old. does that make me weird? there is one guy in particular who i was attracted to right off the bat, before we even started working out in class. the first day i saw him, i saw his face in profile view and i was enamored. i can get enamored quite easily by the mere shape of a guy's nose--i LOVE noses. if a guy has a cute nose it's the first thing i notice. well this guy, we'll call him Adam, has the cutest nose i've ever seen. and as i progressively get to know him, i learn new things each day that make me more enamored. for example, he is diabetic, has to wear one of those insulin things on his arm all the time. he checks it often to make sure his blood sugar levels are okay. it makes a small beep when he checks it. he does this in the middle of lecture and for some reason i find it all adorable. another thing i like about him is that he opens up to me more and more each day. the other day he asked me to study together for a quiz we had, and during that time we didn't do much studying but rather he revealed to me that his father was in prison for hitting and killing someone while driving drunk, something i don't think he tells a whole lot of people. he also expressed that he hates his father, and explained to me all the things his father had done to hurt him in his life. i sat there quite in awe of this young man's remarkable insight and ability to embrace his own vulnerability. i know men in their sixties, seventies and beyond who couldn't ever utter a word of emotional pain; they act as though it is their job to pretend that they don't get hurt by the words and actions of others. but Adam, he lets himself be vulnerable in that way, and i find that incredibly compelling. there are just so many things about this person that i genuinely *enjoy*. i don't just find him attractive, i find every single different part of his appearance to be pleasing in all differents kinds of ways. he's muscular, but not super cut like a lot of guys. he still has a bit of a softer look to him, which is the body type i am probably most attracted to. i find myself staring at his biceps *constantly*. he looks *extremely* good in long sleeve, tighter fitting workout shirts. i have to actively stop myself from staring at him when we're in the gym. he helped me with chin ups the other day and it was difficult to keep focus. just imagine this every day. but i know he'll never like me. i don't think most 18 year olds are really looking to date a 25 year old girl. i feel like i look desperate and weird or something. especially since one of his ex girlfriends, who is his age, is in one of our science classes with us and they flirt all the time. she also is always trying to make sure she hears what he and i talk about, if he and i have a conversation. she then inserts herself into the conversation and pretends to know what we're talking about. it's very strange. i just feel like a teenager in high school. i want to not like this guy. do you guys have any tips for getting over a crush, when the person is someone you have to see every single weekday for class? tips would be greatly appreciated. i'm posting on here because i truly have no one to talk to about stuff in my life. no real friends, really. i'm in a weird spot. that's why i don't really need to worry about dudes right now. i need to get some friends first.

I do get emotional sometimes, but it wasn't the same feeling and it was not as bad as what I feel nowadays. Right after college, I left to Vietnam to work. I was just 19, a young inexperienced girl going abroad by myself. It was an intimidating experience, although I never really told anyone that. I made it seems like I had the time of my life, which I kinda did, but I also went through emotional abuse, which I could never tell anyone.. You see, I was really scared deep beneath and from there I got really close with this person. He saw how I really felt, and took advantage of my vulnerability. I was made to feel like I was useless and worthless, like I was weak, like I am nothing without him. And he broke me. I was too weak and scared to walk away. I thought he is my backbone and I completely depended on him. He controlled me, and I stupidly thought that he was right. When he walked away after 9 months, I was left helpless and even more broken. Thankfully, slowly, slowly, slowly, and with the help of one amazing new friend, I got back on my feet again and started enjoying myself. I was free, I am independent, I am starting to feel happy and confident again. After a year has passed, I had to leave Vietnam and come home to my country. Suddenly I feel like I have lost my purpose, I had no job, and when I got a job, I felt like I am starting all over again. I felt like I've lost my friends, and that I've lost my life. I am miserable living here in the city, I am stuck with burdens I didn't use to have, and I have no personal space. I feel tired. I miss my carefree island life. I hate this rat race I'm in. It's been a year and I still feel like don't belong here, and worse, I feel like I belong nowhere at all....Not even if I went back to the island life. It feels lost to me now. Everything feels like a blur of gray, and I just wish I don't have to go through all these..."

I'm starting my second year in a university abroad at a notoriously unfriendly institution, so while I've got some friends I'm only in the process of really getting intimate with them, and term hasn't started yet so most people aren't around. I had three good friends last year--one of whom is a flake and has ghosted, one of whom has taken the brunt of my woes and is tired of it, and one was my ex, who loved me and who I love but we broke off because of the distance and now aren't talking. It's the breakup that's making me really upset, and although I haven't done anything drastic, it has made me feel crazy and do some kind of stupid things. Not only do I miss my ex a lot as a friend, I'm a little jealous of him because he's on his last year and even though he's miserable he has a support system. I'm just by myself ninety percent of the time, I don't even have a functioning computer. &amp;#x200B; Everything will be fine. I have reason to be optimistic about the future. I'm not that upset about being alone, it's just very hard right now while I'm going through this. Yesterday I did something that prompted overt mockery by dozens of people, and I haven't taken it too hard because it's unlikely (not impossible) to be traced to me and I can definitely see how it's worthy of mockery, though I think they're all really ungenerous. It's my own personal episode of sex and the city, lessons learned, whatever, everyone does stupid crazy shit sometimes and I didn't even hurt anyone, just typed out some embarrassingly melodramatic confessions. But I mean it's really hard, not having anyone around in this moment of hurt and vulnerability. I just want someone to say they accept me so I can laugh about it with anybody other than myself."

I was visiting Bend, while on a solo road trip in an effort to find myself. You had been working your ass off for months without a break and finally had a night on the town with a good friend. You opened a dating app and saw me nearby. You messaged me, and we hit it off. That night you told me I took your breath away. You in turn, too away mine. We had decided to meet for a drink, with your friend in tow, to keep a safe distance from the ever negative forces that could either drive a wedge between us, or drive us into each others pants too soon. We talked, and we laughed. We drank and we flirted. We went on an adventure through the buildings and streets. When the night came to a close, your friend gave an approving nod. We walked and we talked. We found ourselves in my hotel room. We kissed and my world stopped. I couldnt see the thick blackness that has hung over my head, seeping onto my neck and body for the past 5 years. The anger, resentment, sadness, anxieties, and terror I have experienced melted away. I have been in similar situations, and never felt this kind of cleansing rain feeling before. We moved to the bed without a sound, you held my head at my neck and looked in my eyes. You told me I was beautiful. I looked back into your sad eyes and told you I was smitten by you. I broke the walls I had built around vulnerability in an instant and told you everything I had been through. You told me your pain too. Instead of wallowing in it, we held one another like spoons, all night. Kissing, caressing, touching, exploring, and giving one another sensations we havent experienced in a long time. I feel asleep with you wrapped around me. I have been terrified and on alert since I was 15. It slowly faded over the years but came back full force 2 years ago. You understood me and held on tight. I have slept terribly almost half of my entire life, yet this night I slept better than I ever have before. You told me I was safe with you always, that you would never hurt me, nor let anyone or anything ever hurt me. We spent the weekend shirking responsibilities, going on more adventures, and fucking like rabbits. I ultimately had to leave to start a new job. We kissed and hugged, and told each other how happy we were together. How different this was from anything else. I left. You called me and we talked for a while, chatting like old lovers about philosophy. The next day you told me you missed me. I returned the feeling. It was too short of a time to be love. But I have never felt about anyone, the way I feel about you. I want to be with you so badly that I cried when I drove away. I cried on and off for almost an hour. You treated me better in a weekend than I was treated by any ex boyfriend over years of dating. You saw right through me and accepted me, completely. You are an amazing man and I want more with you. So much more. I am so worried that if I tell you how strong my feelings are that I will be rejected by you. Just like my real feelings have been rejected by entire life. This is why I say that Im in lust with you. Because saying Im in love, seems too crazy. I hope I am with you soon. But if I never see you again. Please know you have me the best feelings of completeness and peace Ive felt in my entire life. Especially after a life of being bullied, abused, raped, belittled, and especially manipulated. You erased all that pain in a weekend. I want the best for you, so even if that means you wont be with me, then so be it. But I think we are damn worth it to try. "

You were radiant and funny, someone who supported me and I had fun with. We almost dated, but you tore that to pieces because you were afraid. We didnt talk for a year before reconnecting. It was like nothing ever happened and I was glad to have my friend back. The true you started showing as the years went on. You alone were responsible for your successes but the failures were everyone elses fault. You were opportunistic. You were never kind just to be kind. You were nice if it mean getting what you wanted. You were manipulative. Self-centered. When I talked about my relationship troubles you decided to reminisce on what couldve been if we dated preying on my vulnerability to give yourself a confidence boost. When I told you I was depressed, your tone told me how inconvenient that was for you. I immediately regretted telling you anything to begin with. I even picked up parts of your personality. I wasnt a good person. Our hangouts became one-sided. You talked, I listened without speaking out of fear of you gossiping about me or making me regret opening up. You would even text me afterwards saying you forgot to ask about parts of my life. How was my research going? How was that concert? I began to pull away. We texted sometimes but rarely. It was draining. I felt worse after we hung out. We talked less and less, no longer in person, unless it was about you. You never wished me happy birthday. I still told you Happy Birthday. Today you messaged me asking how I was, only to talk about yourself. I let you know how I felt and that I needed honesty and kindness. I wished you the best. How did you respond? That you were honestly waiting to hear that. That you knew something was off, but anyway best of luck. Apparently your methods of reaching out were short conversations where you bragged and bragged. You knew something was up, but never asked. I didnt say anything because I thought Id get over it and I was being a jerk. No. You didnt say anything, and I did. So its no longer your fault, but mine. It took every bit of me to not respond to that. You are still the center of your universe. I hope you take some time to reflect on why I couldnt be friends with you any longer. I hope you reflect on your motives and goals. I sincerely wish you the best and I hope that you grow into your best self and achieve your dreams. Im sorry I cant be there for it without compromising my best self. "

The best I can do for these people is treat them nicely, the way I would treat anyone else, and dont entertain them further. Then, continue to surround myself with positivity. Thats all I can do, until they learn how to strive for love themselves. If/when they are capable of respect, honesty, and vulnerability, I will consider letting that person into my life. For now, I ignore them and their toxicity. Instead I pay attention to those who want to collaborate, understand, learn, and grow. "

So though I've fallen in love but broke others and broken myself in relationships due to my indifference towards sex, I never labeled myself as an asexual. But a couple of years ago, after a former love passed away, I fell into a dark place. And it just got worse from there. I thought I had to compromise myself and do the things I don't enjoy. And then, after I feel distraught and frustration of being unable to reciprocate, I realized that I just Heber had any wants or desire to have sex nor I've ever got sexually aroused by physique. In the moment of a sadness, vulnerability and broken state, and hitting rock bottom. I've come to accept me asexuality. And I had promised myself never to compromise myself for anyone, not anymore."

This is the story of someone who still doesnt have the nerve to come out about what happened to them. The story of a girl; no, a child who was molested by her stepdad one night when my mom went to his mothers house to care for her while she was sick. My stepfather fingered me in my sleep, I awoke and he stopped and I turn to see him sniffing his fingers. I rolled over, closed my eyes and prayed that he couldnt hear my heart beating a million miles a minute. This is the story of a girl who had grown up in a bar full of perverted men with stares you refuse to make eye contact with. The story of a girl who lived in poverty but kept quiet because we finally had hope of coming out of it, but only because my mom was with this man. This child molester. This monster whom I still hate to this day but have to hug goodbye every time I visit or else he will hold it against my mom and trap her in that house. This is the story of a girl who cant save her mom because she doesnt have the money and my mom refuses to believe my sisters accusations or else she loses all security if he leaves. This is the story of a girl who was again molested by a coworker of my stepdads, again I fell asleep and woke up with his hand down my pants but that time I ran, fast. To the other side of my neighborhood where my mom and stepdad were wasted and didnt believe me. I ran and had to hide in the woods as he drove up and down the road hunting for me. I ran and cried and ran and cried. As he drove by in his white truck. I can still see his taillights. I still remember my drunk mom not listening and kept yelling what?! What happened?! And wouldnt listen to me until she sobered up the next day. I couldnt sleep, all I did was cry. This is the story of a teen who wanted to lose it to someone special but didnt, she was too scared when it came to her first love and backed out. Who instead lost it to a boy who wasnt attracted to her and turned her around so he wouldnt have to see her face and come to find out, gave her hpv. This is the story of a teen who now looks at sex like a person looks at an arcade game, *seems fun, Ill give it a go on this one* This is the story of a teen who became numb and used sex as a show of attraction, not love; power, not vulnerability. This is the story of a woman who is still a child on the inside. Who will not open up, who embraces building walls and relishes in hurt. Who has no one to talk to that will understand that what she cant do, is say something. Or else her mothers entire life falls apart. This is my story. "

I'm sorry for being as insecure as I am because of the position I put myself in without making any self-improvement. I am sorry for acting pessimistic and adding onto things that you have going on in your life, I'm sorry for getting into a relationship with you when I was in the shittest time in my life, and kind of still am however I'm trying my best to pick myself up. Not a single day goes by where I don't regret taking you for granted, I think about you and I think about the fact that I took you for granted and it almost brings me to tears every time, instead I feel so utterly shit and so utterly insecure that it prevents me from sleeping because I'm scared that I would see you in my dreams. However my love, you are also at fault in multiple circumstances. There are 3 reasons as to why you treated me like shit. You accused me of blackmail, thinking that I would blackmail you because you broke up with me, with all the stuff you sent me and I sent you. I never reacted badly towards you, instead i understood why you wanted to break up and I know that mental health is a serious issue. I've never showed anything explicit nor have I shared anything that is confidential between me and you, I respect you and I always will. You accused me of manipulating you into being a ""hoe"". You initiated the whole ""sexual"" subject by asking me to send you nudes, I complied because it was confidential and it was between us. You had a full folder on your phone containing my explicit ""pictures"" and not once did I ever ask you for nudes. We never had sex with each other, you never gave me blowjob and you never gave me a handjob, the most that you have done was just grope and jerk me for 2-3 seconds and that is that, then you gave me consent to feel you up. I gave you consent to feel me up all because you wanted to. I didn't feel comfortable at first because I knew the type of person you were when it came to stuff like this, and I saw this coming from a mile away, however I confided and I trusted you and I consented for you to ""touch"" me. I don't let anyone I don't trust touch me and I barely trust anyone at all, and that's saying something. How does that make you a hoe? You don't believe that I loved you because you thought I was doing it all for revenge because of what you did to me two years ago by playing with my feelings and admitting it to my face. You ruined my self-esteem, you ruined my confidence, you ruined my ability to do social things like I used to, I gave up and let myself go. I fucking loathed you. And you repeated it again when you decided to rub the fact that you have a relationship into my face but you know what that tells me baby? You still have something for me, otherwise if you truly had ""moved on"" after telling me that you wanted me to let you ""fix yourself"" you genuinely wouldn't have bothered bringing how your new guy ""makes you feel better"" and ""shows you love"". If you want to feel better, self-improvement is the medication, not another person because you're basically using them as a crutch. I barely trust anyone.. I forgave you after you apologized to me, you told me you had feelings for me and realized that you did right after I left your life. I then let myself get involved with you, I let myself feel vulnerable for the first time in years and I took a leap of faith, I risked getting out of my comfort zone and i decided to **TRUST** you, to grow **FEELINGS FOR YOU.** I decided to trust the very person who ruined me completely 2 years ago, and you're telling me I don't love you? How dare you have the audacity to make such a statement, how fucking dare you. You needed eye-candy by needing to see ""hot bodies"" and ""hot guys"" while the only eye candy I needed was you and only you, no other woman ever took my gaze away from you. I don't like clubbing, actually I genuinely hated it however I decided that time to time I would go clubbing with you, only for you to tell me ""No don't come you won't enjoy it"". I'm not going there for the venue, I'm going there for you, because I want to be with you.. Or are you trying to be shady trying to hide something? You spoke to your friends, which i genuinely don't have a problem with, I'm not possessive however when you talk to philanderers (fuckboys) and I tell you that I know them and know exactly how they are and I tell you that it bothers me when you speak to those types of people and you don't do it, with your new boyfriend, please grow some fucking respect and NOT talk to guys that only slide into your DM's asking for a date after 3 messages. You clearly didn't respect me enough however on the other hand I completely blocked out females that I didn't have a good connection with, all because I wanted to be focused on you because I genuinely saw myself living out my life with you. I had unrequited love for you for 2 years prior to when you ruined me, I stood by your side and was there for you every single fucking time you felt down, every single fucking time you felt shit. Don't get me wrong you were there for me at my shittest time and I am very, VERY grateful for that. My love, you are the first woman I fell in love with.. this isn't lust, this isn't anything but love. It stings me every fucking DAY knowing that you're with someone else. I respect you and your relationship, I respect your space and I respect the fact that you don't want to talk to an ex when you're with someone else. I love you silently and all I want for you is to be happy because I love you, even though you're probably going through a phase or if you're just insecure, I care for your happiness, your well-being even if you don't want me there now, if you don't want me there forever, I will always love you. My love will never die out, my love towards you is unconditional. I hope maybe in the future when we're two grown and improved people, we can start things over again.. Please be happy, please be safe and please live your days out with a smile. You're the only person I could ever live with knowing that my vulnerability is in your hands and my entire strength being at your mercy even though we are not in each others lives. You are my rock, you are my world, I trust you with my life and I trust you with everything. I love you more than you could possibly ever imagine. Please be happy. I love you."
483,vulnerability,offmychest,My boyfriend is working really hard to make things better for me.....and this morning we had sex,1,9lgz4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9lgz4d/my_boyfriend_is_working_really_hard_to_make/,2018-10-05 09:15:35,"So we had a rough couple months. Id say July and August were quite tumultuous for us. There was fighting and snapping at one another and just general dissatisfaction between us both. No sex. Rare I love yous. Minimal kisses, usually pecks. We were not communicating our thoughts and feelings to one another. Weve been together for a bit over a year, and for the majority of the time we were so smitten with each other and prepared to spend forever together. I really thought wed break up during those two months. We almost did a couple times. We both said things we never meant. Made mistakes. But then we had this one very important conversation. One where we agreed on a perspective of how to problem solve, and how teamwork is more important than our egos. We realized how we both let ego and pride cloud our judgment and we both make bad decisions. So we agreed to tread lightly and to be extra kind and try to make sense of everything at hand before we assume or get upset at the other, because the other deserves patience and understanding. One thing thats always, ALWAYS bothered me is our sex life. Weve usually had sex 1 time per week, sometimes more, sometimes less. But I was never really taken care of. He shows me his love in a lot of ways, but not with sex. It took him a while to understand me on this concept. So he loves time with me, I know Im often on his mind. Im not insecure about being the only woman for him. But I did notice he became a lazy and selfish lover. He never went down on me, or even touched me. He loves to rub and play with my breasts and thighs casually, but for his own pleasure. Not to get me off. So I talked to him. I told him a few weeks ago how I felt. I also talked to him about his laziness (reframed it to be more sympathetic toward him but to be concise here Ill use lazy) in doing chores and how I recently became soooo busy (school full time and work full time) that he needs to really hold up him end up chores so we can work as a unit efficiently. Well, since these conversations, hes been a model fucking boyfriend. He takes care of me sexually (and more often!), which I love. He talks dirty, touches me, and even got me off before initiating sex one of the times. This has happened twice now in the past couple weeks, where hes made a move and prioritized me. And throughout the week, hes been flirting much much harder (weve always been very physical and very snuggly; just not organically sexual with one another, and hes been incorporating that and its been sooooo nice). Make out sessions in the kitchen, going down on me during our normal TV+dinner time, kissing and biting my neck while rubbing me just to show he wants me and make me feel good. He also has been cooking dinner, going grocery shopping, helping me study for school (got a 100 on a test today because of his help!) and just being an incredibly supportive and kind partner. Ive never doubted he loved me, but Ive doubted his desire to put more effort into my happiness in this relationship. Now that Ive had such productive conversations with him, full of honesty and vulnerability, I can see some big changes that makes me see so much more long term with him. And hes demonstrating similar feelings toward me. I feel really lucky and cared for, and Im glad for these changes. "
484,vulnerability,offmychest,My husband is not there for me when I need him the most,1,9lhmbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9lhmbp/my_husband_is_not_there_for_me_when_i_need_him/,2018-10-05 10:41:39,"I've been on antidepressants since December last year and my god did I struggle beforehand. I've always suffered on and off with anxiety. When I first met my now husband, I was a single mum for 4 years. We worked together and we were friends for a full year before anything happened. When we finally got together it escalated quickly because there was no getting to know each other, we just flourished into a full on relationship. We talked about our future, moving in together, we were inseparable. Then he started to become mean to me. Insulting me, my body, talking about other women in front of me. Completely disrespecting me. I didn't know why it was happening and I couldn't understand it. He had been the most loving person I knew and suddenly he was hurting me deliberately and the pain was far deeper than hurt inflicted by anyone else. He knew my scars, my worries, my difficult past. It got to a point where the friends we were out with pulled me aside and asked me why was I with him when he was being so nasty to me. We got home and I told him this. He said 'they're right, I can't do this. I can't be who you want me to be'. He took everything of his from my apartment, even his key off my keychain and his clothes that were still in the washing machine. He left around 2 am. This was Saturday night / Sunday morning. I went to work on Monday after no sleep and a whole lot of vomiting and valium. Then one of my friends told me that he had put up a Snapchat of him and his ex. Literally hours after he left me in my bed. Noting, just to add to my vulnerability he had stripped me naked before leaving me. He slept with her. The girl who he said treated him terribly. Let me comfort him over the terrible things she had done, like tell him she aborted his baby when she hadn't, insulted his body, put him down constantly etc. Yep he went and called her. Spent the week acting like a couple together. Then he came to my house. Cried. Said he was sorry and had made a mistake. I asked had they slept together, he swore no. We slept together, and he told me how he loved me and wanted to be together. Then I got it out of him that they had in fact been together. I spent the next year trying to accept and move on. I went to counselling. So did he. He said he had seasonal depression and had become scared and run back to a familiarity (her) but was focused on getting better. We agreed to put us first and move on. But I was left with crippling anxiety. Constantly afraid he would up and leave me again. Afraid every time his phone beeped that it was her or another girl. I kept reminding myself that chose him and I chose to trust him, however difficult it was. A year later we got engaged. My anxiety was still through the roof. I was really struggling to the point where suicide was entering my mind too often. He took me to the doctor. He wiped my tears and he held my hand. He minded me and cared for me. He loved me. He said we would go through this together. I went onto medication, which changed my life. I felt me again. I could laugh and joke and not worry about every single thing in my life. Fast forward a year, the best year of my life. Happy and planning our wedding. Everything wonderful. Wedding day comes and it's the best day ever. He's the best man I could have ever hoped for. Then we decide to try for a baby. My doctor recommends that I come off my medication. I begin the weaning process. One of my side effects has always been vivid dreams, its very common with SSRI medication. Apparently it is worse when you begin or are weaning. My dreams are horrendous. He knows I'm coming down and it's for us, our family, our future, but he gives out to me and gets angry when I tell him about a dream. Like it's my fault. The angrier he gets the more worried I become and I'm dreaming that he's leaving me. It feels so real, you wake up with emotions through the roof, everything feels so real. Instead of a cuddle and some reassurance he's angry that I could even dream this. I try to explain that given the past I know how it feels, and when I dream about it, it's not made up emotions, I really FEEL it. He's had enough. He says I'm not thinking about him in this relationship, just myself. He's been to the doctor with me, he knows the side effects and he knows I'm weaning. Yet he's lashing out at me and calling me selfish. I'm worried. Scared that I've chosen someone who is only loving when it suits. A man who can't be there to embrace his wife's mental illness and help her as she comes down on her dosage to try for a baby. Have I fucked it all up? Should I never have gotten back together with him? I'm lost. TL;DR my husband hurt me before we married. I have extreme anxiety. We worked through it all and got married. Now we are trying for a baby and I'm coming off my medication. I'm struggling a bit and he's not coping or trying to cope. I'm scared he won't be there for me long term if shit gets rough. "

Like from the movies. We lived together for a year and planned to get married. Then things went south, he kicked me out of the house with 0 closure. I was homeless for 2 weeks until I told a friend and she gave me shelter. Me and him broke up. He came back, tried to mend things, and then broke up again saying he can't commit. I had a rebound relationship. The rebound turned out to be a great guy and became my bf. But I wasn't and still am not over my ex. I have cheated on my bf with my ex several times. I hate myself. I despise myself. I still have some hope left that he will come back and give me back my fairytale relationship. But he only wants to have sex. And I let him, even though I'm in another relationship. I told my ex I want to still give us another chance, but he told me he doesn't want us to be in a relationship. I asked him today what am I to him. He said I'm his friend; 'with benefits' was left unsaid yet obvious. I hate myself. I am disgusted with myself for letting him do this to me. For letting ME do this to me. I hate that I only get sexually turned on by him. I hate what I am doing to my current bf. I hate that I still seek comfort in my ex while he uses my vulnerability and soft corner towards him to just fuck me. To literally just fuck me. I hate that he has to always 'go' somewhere right after we finish. I hate it that he always remembers me at midnight. I hate that I still love him and remember the beautiful times we had. I hate him.

488,vulnerability,offmychest,I'm having a lot of trouble seeing the point in anything,1,9mb75d,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9mb75d/im_having_a_lot_of_trouble_seeing_the_point_in/,2018-10-08 13:53:56,"Hi. I didn't know which subreddit to post this to but since its just me venting I felt this place was suitable. First off, trigger warning I guess. This is probably going to be at least a little hard for some people to read, so if you cant deal with stuff relating to suicide and depression and so on, I advise you not to read this. I have severe depression, and have had it for around 4 years, since I was 14. I might have had some form of it before then, but I tend to view it as starting at 14 as that is when i began to want to kill myself. My plan was always to wait a few years, until I had a job, an apartment, and basically until I was self-dependant. At this point, I had always planned to cut myself off from the world and all of my friends and family, and eventually kill myself (probably through the use of a helium mask or some other suicidal apparatus that would take me quietly and painlessly.) Of course, no one knew I felt this way since I avoided telling people. This was a mistake, as I very obviously needed psychological help and probably some form of medication. However, things took a turn last year, when I was 17. A fellow student, who had a reputation for being one of the kindest people in the grade, the ""nice guy"" that eveyone was friends with, started bullying me severely. He would tell me I was repulsive and worthless, tell me to kill myself, send long essays about how horrible I was to people I'd never met, when as far I could tell I had done nothing to attract his ire. It wasn't until earlier this year that I realised he was almost definitely a sociopath (he loves watching videos of children being hurt and willingly fucks over his so-called friends as soon as they stop being of use to him.) and that he had probably chosen me as his target because of my emotional vulnerability. I have autism, although I am incredibly high-functioning to the point that most people are surprised to learn that I have it, but because of this I have always tended to wear my emotions on my face and generally be a lot more gullible and manipulable than other people. Also the student who bullied apparently hates people with autism and I've always been very open about having the disorder, so that probably fucked me over. Either way, eventually it reached a point last year where I tried to kill myself, and was hospitalised. Thankfully I had severely underestimated the amount of chemicals that I would need to ingest in order to die, so although my liver is probably going to be a lot weaker in the future, I at the very least lived. I was put on therapy, and eventually I was given antidepressants. I moved on from the incident and cut connections with my more toxic friendships. However this is where I reach my current predicament. Compared to last year I realise that I am in a far better position. I have a large and incredibly supportive new group of friends, I have a support network, a dedicated psych and a working prescription. And yet I'm not happy. The meds have been incredibly useful, of course. They make it so that I can feign happiness, at the very least, and that in itself is incredibly useful. I guess the issue is that I just dont feel anything. The depression has reached a point where I'm having trouble caring about anything or feeling any emotion other than a formless lump of dread in my gut. And I'm only 18. I know some people would say ""Oh but you have a whole life ahead of you! Things could change!"" but that's bullshit. My depression is built into me, and it isn't going anywhere. Sure I can treat it, and put myself in situations where my mood has room to improve, but the thing about genuine, severe depression, that people without depression don't get, is that it doesn't give a shit. It eats away at you until you're left a hollow fucking shell with next to no personality or will. I've seen this happen again and again and I can feel it happening to me. Basically i'm just struggling to see the point cause what's the point of a fucking lifetime of this? To slog my way through another 20, 40, even potentially 80 years while I feel like this? When I sleep, I dream, and my dreams are the best part of life right now, because in my dreams i'm happy. In my dreams I hang out with my friends, enjoy myself, all the while not feeling like trash. But in real life I go through the motions of life, wearing a mask as if I'm happy when really I feel like a cold slab of lifeless meat. In real life I feel nothing, and have even lost the will to be suicidal. I simply lie there wishing I could cease to exist. Go into some other plane of existence, where I could either return to oblivion or dream forever. Anyway, I think that's all I can really think to say at the moment. There were issues I have that I didn't touch on, but I don't want to take up too much of your time. This is a throwaway account, obviously, but I might use it to vent about this shit again some time, idk. I'm incredibly sorry for wasting however many minutes it took for you guys to read this with my edgy bullshit, I just really needed to vent about this somewhere. Thank you for hearing me out, and I hope you all have great days ahead of you. It would be helpful if someone could tell me what the point is, but again I dont expect you guys to have to answer, as that would be selfish. I apologize for the terrible formatting as I'm also currently incredibly sleep-deprived and too lazy to edit it to look better. Again, thank you, and so long."
489,vulnerability,offmychest,How do you feel?,1,9mpguo,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9mpguo/how_do_you_feel/,2018-10-10 01:11:09,"It's been a while since I've posted anything on here but writing has always been therapeutic and things have been difficult recently, so I figured I'd have another go at it. &amp;#x200B; It's been 4 months since the breakup and I don't really know if I can say I've moved on. I don't really have feelings for him anymore but I still worry. I often wonder if he's okay (mentally and physically) and I hope his friends are looking out for him and supporting him - I'm sure they are but I also know that he often keeps a lot to himself so he might not necessarily turn to them despite feeling pretty low. I know this because I'm exactly like that - I tend to detach myself and withdraw from people, and seeing as how I was often surprised by how alike the two of us were (in that our reactions to situations were often identical), chances are he might be doing exactly the same thing I would do in his shoes. I hope he's eating well and looking after himself too; he was close to being underweight when we were together so I'd often sneak extra food on his plate or say I'm not interested in my dessert so that he could have it. I don't know if he ever noticed and it doesn't really matter anymore, but I still hope he's eating properly at least. &amp;#x200B; I guess I do miss him still and I miss the companionship. I miss having someone I could talk to about anything and everything, and I miss those long FaceTime calls (which didn't really feel long at all because it always ended with us wondering where all the time had gone). I miss going to sleep together every night (we would leave the FaceTime call going), and honestly, I still find it difficult to go to sleep on my own every night; it's also weird waking up in the middle of the night and finding myself in the middle of the bed after having got so used to having to battle for half of it (he definitely hogged the blanket). He had to wake up at 5:30am for work so I'd set my alarm for the same time so I could wish him good morning - I even miss that too. &amp;#x200B; But there really is no point in dwelling on these happier memories because all it does is hurt me, and I'm hurting enough already. &amp;#x200B; Ever since the breakup, I feel... broken. I go to therapy once a week and I didn't realise I had a problem until my counsellor asked me how I actually felt, and I blanked completely. It's like some very fundamental part in my brain just stopped working and now I feel emotionless. I can't even tell if I'm happy or sad anymore, all I am is just \*hurt\*. &amp;#x200B; The hurt even affects different facets of my life. Since the breakup, I have become completely averse to any kind of vulnerability, and it's so unlike me. After my first breakup (with the ex who compared me to an old car), I was ready to love again within a couple of months. I was still hurt after all that I had gone through with that ex but it didn't stop me from being optimistic about love and relationships and I was completely ready to accept a new person in my life. I don't feel like that now; these days, I've completely ruled out the possibility of a future relationship because it's just completely inconceivable to me. &amp;#x200B; I used to love planning gifts and surprises for my SOs. Two months before my ex's birthday, I was planning his birthday surprise (a treasure hunt) and researching different fountain pens and inks because he liked to collect them and I wanted to get him a really special one for his birthday. With my previous ex, it was always the latest video game or a parcel of his favourite foods and drinks (Gatorade). That's what I \*used\* to be like - now it feels like I can't even bring myself to be invested enough in a future partner to want to spend all that time thinking of things I can do to show them I love them, if that makes sense. &amp;#x200B; The thought of being close to someone terrifies me. I don't want to open up to someone and be vulnerable and emotional, to fall in love and trust them. Emotional intimacy is a big \*no\* for me at the moment , and so is physical intimacy now that I come to think of it - I've got no libido whatsoever? I'm very much aware that it's the hurt that drives this, it's like a massive barrier that I've constructed to keep everyone else out and keep my emotions locked in. &amp;#x200B; It even affects my friendships because the degree of vulnerability you need to maintain good friendships (such as by sharing a part of yourself with your friends) isn't something I can maintain, so I've detached myself from them. I don't mind if my friends share their thoughts or feelings with me - if anything, that makes me happy that they've chosen to share something with me - but I absolutely cannot reciprocate that. &amp;#x200B; It's also more complicated because all of my friends are either in relationships or dating, and that tends to be the main thing they talk to me about. I think it's because I've always been a firm believer in relationships so I often advocate trying to work things out together rather than fighting over things. Thing is, saying stuff like that often makes me feel like a complete fraud because my ex didn't want to work things out. He just left at the first sign of trouble - there was no argument, no fight, no chance for me to redeem myself, nothing. He wanted out. &amp;#x200B; Because of that I have no self-esteem now, no sense of self-worth. I spent a lot of time entertaining thoughts like ""if I was prettier, he would've stayed"" - and maybe that's why I'm forcing myself to eat less than 1000 calories a day so I can be skinny in 6 months' time. I've often said that the way he left made me feel like a piece of trash because he just threw me away without any consideration towards my feelings. I was left feeling like I didn't matter because he \*knew\* I was hurting and I needed to talk to him, but he didn't want to do anything about it. &amp;#x200B; Honestly, I feel like a shell. I'm just going through the motions of each day but I don't \*feel\* anything except this sense of being broken. &amp;#x200B; How do you begin to explain all this to someone? You don't. So whenever I get asked ""How do you feel?"", I always ready a smile and say ""Not too bad, you?"""

491,vulnerability,offmychest,Severe mental health problems are only getting worse,1,9nbnwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9nbnwc/severe_mental_health_problems_are_only_getting/,2018-10-12 03:50:19,"I'm new to this subreddit, and I've always been scared to post anything online because it seemed to require too much openness and vulnerability. But lately I feel like I've run out of options to talk to people in real life, and I'm scared that I've been holding too much in. So here goes. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for a while, but it's been much worse recently. I was diagnosed with depression four years ago, but at the time I thought it was just because of stress. It lessened after I finished the obligations that stressed me out, but it quickly reemerged after a breakup about a year later. For a while, I would go through a cycle of blaming my mental health on recent traumas, and then ""being fine"" again. I was severely suicidal for a time about two years ago, writing notes and calculating dosages, and then backing out. Then, a year and a half ago, my mentor committed suicide. I had lost loved ones before, but nothing had ever hurt like this. I worked at a summer camp with many very supportive people for a few months after that, but then it was back to school and the depression was back worse then ever. However, I wasn't suicidal. I knew what it felt like to lose a loved one to suicide. I developed anxiety in this time, started skipping classes, failed every course my last semester, and wasn't sharing the severity of my mental health with anybody in my life. I didn't share until I felt I didn't have a choice. I was driving back to school for finals, already knowing that I was going to fail every class, and I had a panic attack going 65 on a highway with no median. I was light headed, my hands were numb, and I started to black out. I called my sister who has anxiety, but she didn't answer. So I kept driving. She eventually called back and I pulled over and talked through it. She convinced me to tell my parents. I worked at the camp again this summer, but it wasn't a shield from the depression and anxiety anymore. I'm now taking a semester off. I'm working two part-time jobs, taking a class at a nearby school, am involved with a high school ministry, and am attending therapy while living with my parents. I thought this would be better for me, being able to go to therapy and take time away from the school that I've come to resent. But even with ""therapy"", my mental health is still on the decline. I've been skipping one of my jobs for the past three weeks, I fight with my parents, I don't sleep when I should, and I've been turning back to escapism as much as I can. Worst of all, the suicidal thoughts have been returning. I don't see much of a future in the fields I want to work in, I have maybe three or four friends that I talk to semi-regularly, and I don't think I can make it through school (which my parents fully expect). I like to think of myself as a skeptically religious person (I was raised in a Christian family), and I'm worried about the effect religion has had on my development. It's not the issue, but I feel like it may be a negative contributing factor. I bring this up because my parents were pretty insistent that I go to a Christian counseling service, and my counselor is a middle-aged man who is still a student, so I'm not really getting advice and feel like I'm not being heard by an unbiased therapist. I love my family and my friends, but I hate myself and don't know what they see in me. I'm incredibly unproductive without my ADHD medication, but I'm scared to try medication for my depression because like.... what if this is just who I am? What if the meds just bring the side effects and don't help my actual problems? In my work with high school kids I advise them on mental health, I'm very open about my general struggles. But I think I downplay the recent severity of my condition. I guess I don't really know what this post is, but I needed to write it out because I'm scared of myself at the moment and I think my friends aren't as receptive about these things because I use humor as a coping mechanism. Maybe it seems like I don't take it seriously. But I'm terrified, and I don't know what to do."

I think Im especially pissed today. My mother in law had a visit today with her estranged sister dying of brain cancer. It seemed to go well, although it was incredibly hard. My partner said that it was good to be able to see her when she was on her way out, of only to have an opportunity for personal closure. He said that it was something that felt difficult for him, purely in terms of when friends of his had died (a few suicides and one poor guy in the Oakland fire). She said it was different because they were never mean to him. His dad interjected sharply to tell her that it was a weird thing to say. Shes been trying to pull him aside a few times tonight to tell him how vulnerable this situation makes her feel. She has serious PTSD from being in a Soviet orphanage. Both of our families have a parent that fled a military conflict in their native countries. I think its great when a parent can be honest with their kid about their traumas, but Im sick of it being an excuse to belittle the kids sorrow, because your own grief is so immense. It happened with me when a friend of mine died several years ago from an injury and my mom dragged me to the place I always used to see him and told me that his soul was there and I fucking hated her for it. I just needed my space to let the existential horror of the tragedy be what it was so I could mourn my friend how I needed to. My partner was completely fucked up for years after these friends died and Im so angry that his mom talked about it as though it didnt matter. I get that if you have serious trauma, other peoples sadness may seem trivial, it it also doesnt entitle you to their emotional vulnerability if you will trivialize it. Just because hes your kid and he loves you and is as kind as he can be, it doesnt mean he can fix it and doesnt give you the right to demand he understand you. He cant. He can only love you and try to see you through this. Im sorry, Im livid. "

For a while I was happy that this incident was able to make me distinguish between who really cares and who doesn't. I thought life would get better but I guess I was wrong. Life never really gets better. I still cry alone everyday not letting my parents know my sorrows. I keep having imaginary thoughts of slitting my own throat in public with a kitchen knife or sometimes imagine myself eating a bullet. The only person I care about in this entire world is my girlfriend. Now she's engaged to somebody else and doesn't wish to be my friend either. Yesterday I had an awful time begging her to stay in my life but she seemed pretty scared to talk since I tried to kill myself. She was the only person I always felt comfortable to vent out and now I'm a nobody. My parents consider me as a junkie after I confessed to them about my drug addiction. Everyday I wake up to them accusing me of being a burden and making me cry of guilt. They're holding me back from going to college and now I'm just home all day surrounded by four fuckin' walls and nobody to talk to. I text random people expecting to find someone to talk to. But nah, everybody is busy with their own life that they'd ask you to rant and leave in the middle before you finish. Sometimes I even tell them straight forwardly that I wanna kill myself, but I don't think it really bothers them despite my vulnerability. Everybody's really good at faking that they ask you to vent out to them, but deep inside they don't give a fuck and it's just out of sympathy. Nobody's worth trusting not even my therapist who promised to maintain confidentiality which probably is why I had to confess about my drug abuse to my parents in the first place. Part of me really wish I died that night. I regret sending close ones a goodbye message which triggered an emergency call. All I wished for was peace but no, I can't have that either. "
494,vulnerability,offmychest,My mother disgusts me,3,97yyvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/97yyvp/my_mother_disgusts_me/,2018-08-17 13:33:11,"# This is going to be long, so apologies in advance. My mother and I have never had an easy relationship. It's been antagonistic for as long as I can actually remember, but I need to get it all off my chest now. I was emotionally closer to my paternal grandparents growing up. My dad wasn't there emotionally, and my mother... well, she was my mother. She threw me out of the house at 6 years old and told me to walk to my grandparents, making me walk halfway up the street whilst crying, before calling me back. She made me feel ugly from an early age by trying to conceal a birthmark I have on my face, and calling it ""ugly"". From the age of 7 onwards it just got worse. My parents split and we moved out with my mother. We moved to a shitty area with shitty kids that were bullies so I ended up with no friends. She didn't take the split well, because she was a stay-at-home mother and now my dad wasn't paying for everything, so suddenly she had money worries. Within 6 months my paternal grandparents had died. I wasn't allowed to mourn for them, I couldn't talk about it without her screaming at me ""they're dead and gone, move on! they're in the past! You're fucking *morbid*."" I still remember shortly after my grandmother dying, that I lay in bed and prayed to God that he would bring my grandmother back and take me instead. I was 8 and it was the first time I wished I was dead. She constantly used my brother and I against each other, trying to manipulate us to basically spy on our dad and tell her everything he said/did over the course of a weekend. This went on for ten years. This meant my brother and I were constantly at loggerheads because we were competing for her very conditional ""love"". It wasn't till we stopped living together that we realised what the fuck she had been doing to us. I don't remember the first time she hit me, but I do remember early-ish incidents. She mistakenly thought I had put glitter on my bedroom wall (it had been a kid she was babysitting), so as punishment she punched me (9 years old) in the face and then grabbed me by the hair and shoved my face into the wall, into the glitter, so I could see close up what I'd apparently done. I remember her trying to punch me in the face and getting angrier and angrier when I put my arms up in front of my face to cover it, she was trying to wrench my arms away and she was just hitting me wherever she could. I was cowering on the floor, around 12 years old, and my brother saw it all. She would throw things at me, TV remote, gigantic Polly Pocket set (the heavy 90s variety) whatever she could. Grabbing me by the hair as I lay on the carpet to get a smack in. Dragging me from my bedroom into the hallway by my arm and then proceeding to punch me. And she always denied any of this happening. I was making it up. I was a lunatic. I belonged in an asylum. If I didn't watch myself, the men in white coats would come and lock me up. And sometimes I almost believed her when she said I was making it up. I really had to cling onto it. I finally had proof of it though when I was about 20, finding childish notes amongst my belongings detailing the assaults, and my brother backing me up with what he saw. She told all of her friends that my brother and I were ""bad"". That we lied all the time and nothing we said could be believed. And we'd get dirty looks off them all the time. I even once overheard her on the phone telling someone that she was scared of me because I had been hitting her - completely untrue, in case you hadn't guessed. So she carried out character assassination on us to make sure that if we ever told, we'd never be believed. I was sexually abused as a teenager by a ""family friend"", an old man in his 60s who had deliberately gotten close to our family just so he could take advantage of my obvious vulnerability - when you're treated like shit every day of your life, and starved of love, you end up looking for it from other adult figures. I had thought of him as a kind of replacement grandfather and he just betrayed my trust in the worst way. He had my mother completely fooled. She was thrilled to have any chance she could of palming my brother and I off on people so she'd have free time to do whatever the fuck it was she was doing, so my brother would go off to friends and I would end up in the clutches of my abuser every Sunday. And because she was stingy about giving me bus fare to and from school, he ended up picking me up after school and bringing me home, abusing me on the way. I was only free of him two days a week. I don't blame her for the abuse, that was his fault and nobody else's, but I do blame her for being a negligent enough parent that she was happy to palm me off on him as much as she did. She was also very careful about her appearance but didn't care how my brother and I looked. She didn't get my hair cut for years and even my uncles were complaining about my hair (seriously, how many guys have you ever known that look at a kid and go 'they seriously need a haircut'). She also made me wear old clothes. I wore the same school shirt for three years of primary (elementary) school, even after they changed the uniform. My primary school called a meeting with her because they'd found I was seriously underweight - at 11 years old, I weighed 56 lbs (apparently that's the weight of 36 iPads according to [weightandthings.com](URL In high school I wore the same trousers for years, even though they were falling to bits, and was made to wear a pair of brown boots that were her castoffs. I had to wear three pairs of socks to deal with them because the nails had come up through the sole and were cutting my feet. Oh, and I got in trouble for wearing them to school because they broke the dress code, so I got to feel ashamed over it as well. I previously mentioned that she'd made me feel ugly from a young age. Her verbal attacks got worse as I got older, making me feel ugly, unwanted and a burden. She'd tell me I was ugly, why couldn't I be a ""normal teenage girl"", how could someone like her have a daughter as ugly as me, that I was ""so repulsive no man would ever want to marry"" me, complaining that I had bigger breasts than her but she had the better butt, because mine was ""saggy"". Telling me that I would never be prettier, sexier or smarter than her, that I would never surpass her, that I would never be better than her. She told me that my friends weren't really my friends, they just put up with me because they felt sorry for me. She'd called me baggage years before, claiming that ""another man's baggage"" was the reason she couldn't get a boyfriend. And when it comes to men, that's another story. She emptied my savings bank account when I was 8 so she could spend the money on a holiday with her new boyfriend. The money had been put in my bank by my late grandfather. She dated a string of guys, I honestly wouldn't be able to remember all their names. One guy, I'll call him Shrek because if you dipped him in green paint would actually look like Shrek, was the worst though. He lived with us for a couple of years. He assaulted my younger brother, and my mother stayed with him. That was when my brother and I fully understood how much of a shitty parent she was. Despite everything I guess we'd hoped that when the chips were down, she'd stand up for us. Nope. Shrek controlled the household with an iron fist. Everything we saw on the TV was chosen by him, and it was always some variety of sport. My brother and I had to sit on the hard floor all the time because he took up the entire three-man sofa by himself. He and my mother would argue *every* weekend. Two scenarios would occur. Scenario 1 would be, she stayed at home drinking by herself till he came in at 1am and she started screaming at him about how she'd been left in the house all evening and he'd been out enjoying himself. Scenario 2, they'd both go out and come home at 1am screaming because she was upset at apparently having been ignored all evening whilst he talked to his friends. And she drank almost constantly whilst she was with him. Another thing Shrek controlled was food. If any snack food appeared in the cupboards we weren't allowed it because it was his. She'd make his breakfast in the morning and leave nothing for us to eat. We weren't allowed to cook either so we were basically screwed. There was almost nothing in the cupboards. My brother and I would go to our father's house once a week and stuff ourselves with everything we could get our hands on. Then any pocket money that we got went straight on food. I would eat and eat until I felt like I was going to be sick, then I'd give it some time to pass and start stuffing my face again, and repeat till all the food I'd bought was gone. It's a habit I've really struggled to kick as an adult, this ability to just gorge. I can't just eat one packet of crisps and let it go. I end up eating the whole multipack in one sitting along with other stuff. So yay, thanks mother, for my habits! As well as the heavy drinking, her behaviours for other things were just downright fucking weird. If they were in the middle of having sex (and didn't care if we were awake or anything), and she needed to grab something, she was perfectly happy walking around the house dressed as a french maid or almost entirely naked save for knickers. It really didn't faze her, in fact she got angry if my brother and I asked her to cover up. She accused me of wanting to steal Shrek from him - utterly yucky thought, I was 16/17 and I hated him. And she made a few comments to my brother that were really weird to us both, even at the time - like when he was 12/13, she started asking him if his penis was growing properly and asked to look. He said no obviously and she stopped there. I've no fucking clue what that was about. Some weird Jocasta shit, probably. Shrek's step-father (late 60s) also started trying to groom me. He would send me love letters, gifts, money, that sort of thing. I didn't return the feelings at all, but I felt like I couldn't talk about it. I was already being sexually abused by one old man and I hadn't been able to talk about that either. Anyway, she eventually found his letters to me. And if you think she is the type of person to blame a teenager for creepy old men hitting on them, then you've got it in one. Both she and Shrek blamed me. His step-father then tried to get me to run away with him as some sort of weird happy ever after. I said no and he told me to do the world a favour and kill myself. The treatment I was already dealing with - emotional neglect, verbal and physical abuse - was bad enough but it actually got worse. From that point on, I was no longer called by my given name. I was *It* and *That Thing*. Shrek physically assaulted me, grabbing me by the throat and throwing me down the hallway, because I tried to intervene when he argued with my mother. Mother also told me she wished she'd aborted me when she had the chance. I stopped going home early from college. I would stay out as long as I possibly could. She stopped cooking my meals altogether so I started eating from takeaways. Because I ate from the same place 3 times in one week, my mother actually accused me, a 17 year old virgin, of ""gangbanging"" all the employees of the takeaway. Then the week before my 18th birthday, she was shouting at me over something, I don't recall what, and she drew her fist back. I told her that I would hit her back if she went through with it. Next thing I know, she'd punched me, obviously not taking my warning seriously enough. But everyone has their breaking point. This was mine. I punched her right in the face, and I was still holding back from seriously hurting her because *she was my mother and I didn't want to actually hurt her*. So then she threw me out with just under 3 to my name. I lived in a shop for the next few months. She took me back in December but I lasted a week before she decided to throw me out again. I wouldn't quit my new job as she'd wanted me to, so I could stay home and clean for her. After another couple of years, Shrek was gone (had cheated on her), and I had shitty luck - a landlord wanting me to sleep with him, and then a stalker - so I ended up moving back in with her. Another fucking nightmare. She was careful not to physically assault me (except for one time where she dug her nails into my hand so hard that my palm bled and left marks for a week), but she was just as shitty verbally as usual. This time though I argued back. Didn't help because she would just scream even louder over the top of me. Then a woman came to the door with official looking letters for both of us. They outlined that we were being taken to court for failure to pay rent (I gave my money to her every month). Mother hadn't paid for 6 months. And when I challenged her on it, she got angry, thinking I'd opened her mail. She'd started taking out payday loans and had gotten herself into debt, so I settled the debts for her, made her arrange a rent payback plan, and paid for her car repairs (never even drove the car after that) and bought a new washing machine when hers packed in, all under the promise of ""I'll pay you back"". Five years down the line and I've had about 20 of nearly 1K back. Recently she asked if I wanted to go on holiday with her, and when I asked if she could afford to pay me some of the money she owes back, and she just laughed at me. God, that makes me mad just thinking about it. She also told me I was a ""terrible daughter"" at one point for refusing to take out a 2K loan with the bank and giving her all of the money. During the period I had moved back in with her, I'd finally reported my abuse to the police. One day during an argument with her I lost it when she told me she could read me like a book and knew everything about me. I shot back that she didn't, and then I said I had been sexually abused as a teenager. She got right in my face and told me ""*You are a sick and twisted little liar*"", thinking I was about to accuse Shrek. She didn't believe me until I showed her a letter from the police with info relating to my case. Then, against my wishes, she went and told my brother and father about it. My brother came to see me to ask if I was okay and she started wigging out, ""Why aren't you asking how I'm feeling? *I'M UPSET!!""* This also leads to my struggles with depression. I have probably actually been suffering from depression for longer than anyone realised, probably since I was in my teens, but nobody picked up on it. I first attempted suicide when I was 18. Tried to hang myself with a bedsheet. Finally confiding in my mother about it afterwards, she laughed and said ""You're supposed to use a rope"". It wasn't the last time I attempted. I also took to self-harm whenever I got angry. I would tear my hair out and punch myself. For the most part I've stopped doing that. She is one of those people who have everything worse than you though. You got a sore back? Well she's got sore knees. You feel depressed? Not as badly as she does! And now, she's dating a married guy - after years and years of hating on my dad for cheating on her, after telling us how disgusting it is. Her married guy's wife has multiple sclerosis, and even though she's not even old, my mother said that once his wife dies they can be together. Just so callous and unfeeling. But it's okay because she and this guy love each other and want to get married. I'm engaged. I don't even know if I really want her at the wedding. I can't stand being around her for long but the problem is that unlike her complete lack of maternal feelings towards me, I still have that weird natural pull of ""she's my mother"" (as everyone loves to remind me) and I'm worried I'll regret not having her there. Or that I'll feel guilty further down the line when she's dead. Another thing that makes me sad is all those birthday/christmas/mothers day cards and all the lovely things people say about how their mother is their best friend, because I've never had that. Anyway, sorry, this went on longer than I expected. TL;DR, my mother is a bitch."

I don't think most people know I have feelings at all. I am very guarded and come across as very even headed via years and years of therapy and anxiety and overthinking, and I don't really have anyone to talk to as a result. I've struggled with mental health for a long time and people often don't take me seriously when I talk about it. I'm depressed, or anxious, or what have you all the time, but even I get sick of listening to myself whine about it so I never talk about any of it until I have a reason that can't just be misconstrued as me being dramatic, which works when I have friends who kind of Get Me in that way, which I don't anymore. Many of my friends will ask how I am, and I'll answer, and they'll just kind of move on. When I do make a big enough scene that it's clear I need help, maybe four times in my life has the response I needed actually come through and more often than not the response is just ""wow that sucks."" This makes me even more guarded because it seems like there's no point at all in even talking about it. Outwardly, I am a very no-nonsense person who doesn't very often show emotion or vulnerability. Sometimes, when I do show it, sometimes people don't help at all, but DO seem to instantaneously decide that because I'm not bulletproof they can treat me in ways I've historically refused to put up with or something. I'm rambling. All I want from life is to go to college and get a job in my field of choice (which does require degrees) and I can't afford it, and even when I could go, there were some classes I simply couldn't pass. I have been told I'm 'smart' all my life but I can't even prove it. Now, I feel too old to go back (27) but so unbelievably useless that there's no point in trying in the first place. I don't even know how to get into the exact field I'm interested in, and I don't have many friends who are similarly excited about it. I wish anyone kind of really even gave a shit about how much I want that but it doesn't really seem like anyone does. Sometimes I get really motivated and start trying to do all the work for grants and scholarships, but I'm not sure I can handle the probable truth that I'm just not smart, special, or worthwhile enough to win any, so I give up. My partner right now and for the past several years seemingly has a reactive libido, which is not his fault, but it makes me feel so unbelievably unsexy. He insists that he finds me attractive, but it's been a mess. I had an eating disorder for a long time, and have been moderately ill and looking very dumpy and haggard lately, and I can't bring myself to give a shit to fix it or try because this was a problem before that. I also don't like valuing my own attractiveness so much because it seems like it's destined to fail if you base your self worth on how attractive you are. A lot of my internet friends spend a lot of time at places where the entire point is basically to pick people up and not only do I not want to watch my friends try and get other people hard, I also just don't care to even try to do it myself. It is to the point that now being sexual at all is just nauseating because all I can imagine is how disgusted I would be if I were watching as a third party. &amp;#x200B; I have some serious illnesses of the physical type as well, and they have been back lately. They destroy my skin and face and make it even harder to look in the mirror. I also recently lost a very important family member and haven't really had anyone who cares about or talks to me about that, either. I don't really know how to find friends and I don't know that even if I tried I'd have the energy or strength to go through them until I find ones who are after the same things as me and need what I have to offer. I'm just really alone, which is fine, I guess, but I don't really see the point in maintaining this anymore? I don't know. I wouldn't say I'm suicidal, but I would say I'm kind of out of reasons to keep going. If it's going to be a constant losing battle to have people give a shit about how I feel, but I don't know how to fix it without other people, I don't know what I can do. I feel like I just needed to say this somewhere. Thank you if you read all that. I'm sorry for wasting your time, haha. "

Insensitive as in I had almost no emotional maturity. I scoffed at the concept of love and used to think how could two people consider each other so important. I was scared too that if some day I accidentally ended up doing it myself, someone can break my heart and trust and move on like it was nothing. So I never showed anyone my vulnerability. Scroll past a few years and I met this girl. Not exactly met, I knew her for a while, but it was only then that we actually started talking properly. I was still alien to the concept of love or even liking for that matter. A few months passed and we grew really close. Some stuff happened one day that made me realize I had fallen for her. I was still scared of exposing my emotional side and vulnerabilities. But I had made up my mind that my time as an insensitive little shit is over. That I would confess to this girl and do my best to be with her. As fate would have it, she liked me too. So we got into a relationship. The first few months were beautiful. Mind you, it was a totally new experience to share yourself with. I was still not used to it. A few months later, she suddenly broke up with me citing some BS reasons. I pretended to understand as I did love her a lot and did not want to end up hurting her. While many of you may say that it was just a silly first breakup, trust me that's what I used to reason too. But it actually took away a part of me and left me exposed. I had finally come to terms that I could in fact love a person and can rely on them, and maybe I wasn't as insensitive as I thought I was. This breakup left me highly vulnerable. Not just that, but she led me on for another couple of years. I finally got over her when I met this another girl. She was such a smart person and honestly way out of my league. Somehow we fell for each other and I thought, well, maybe this is the time I end up with someone who loves me and treats me the way I would want them too. A couple of weeks later after making me sure that it was all but official, she got back with her ex. Once again, I was left vulnerable, while only hoping to have someone love me as much as I loved them. I am not desperate, but my transition from the kind of person I was and the kind of person I was supposed to be was halted abruptly. My self esteem fell to the ground. It's been almost an year since and I have been unable to even remotely like anyone. All I can think of is how I am due for another heartbreak without even getting to experience love properly. "

Of course there are a lot of different scenarios, but this is a repeating theme. I just don't want to be taken advantage of and keep compromising how I feel, because I look at it as a whole instead of an action. My feelings and emotions are important to me, and they are key to my mentality, if I have to surpress my belief in what I think is right, and take in their offense and apologize, then I don't feel I'm standing up for anything. Okay, for example. I was telling someone I thought it was rude to be sarcastic and coarse to people because you're in a bad mood, that you shouldn't put other people in a bad mood simply because something happened you don't like - they took offense to this because I guess I was using it as a way to say that it hurts when they're rude to me when they're in a bad mood - in my mind I thought I was being right since it was an opinion. Then a few days later they were telling me how they're tired of my drama and I apologized. While talking about how they feel, I saw a vulnerability and a genuine hurtfulness from what I was saying, so I said I was sorry. We're continuing to talk. I guess it's a problem with *what* exactly I say when I'm trying to convey how I feel and the timing. At the same time though, whenever I message the person from the example, I only get short snap responses and declin when I want to socialize with them. But when they ask how I am, I don't see it as sincere but simply convenient for them. I'm seeing a therapist for the first time soon, I think it would be good for me."
500,vulnerability,offmychest,Vulnerability is what makes life so beautiful,9,9dzac3,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9dzac3/vulnerability_is_what_makes_life_so_beautiful/,2018-09-08 08:38:16,"I spent the last 3 days in Fukuoka Japan to acquire a work visa. I thought I was going to just be grabbing some paperwork and then bolting back, spending all my time in my hotel room with a book. But I allowed myself to be vulnerable and open enough to let the trip become more than some days away from the 9-5...And they became what will surely be lifelong memories. &amp;#x200B; It happened on my last night there- I was walking down a street looking for a bar to grab some drinks in to sort of cap off my time in Japan when i caught a whiff of some indian food. I decided why not, turned down an alley with a graveyard on one side and decrepit high-rises on the other-- the restaurant nestled into the 1st floor of one of these buildings covered in cracked storm drains and trellises of electrical wiring. I was greeted by a man in traditional Indian head dress and the magic began. The restaurant was tiny, having just enough room for a 4 person booth by the door, and then long bar-style counter that could fit another 5 chairs and nothing more. At that counter, 4 people were all sitting and enjoying drinks. Before I could even sit down, they deduced that I was from the US and insisted I join them. Fast forward 3 hours, and I've had some of the most simple, genuine, wholesome laughs that I've had in a long time. There's something to be said for being able to connect with others even when language isn't an option. It reduces you to a much purer form of smile and humor-- because half of the merriment is rooted in the fact that you're sort of cheering for each other as they try to express themselves to you. It's an encouraging laughter, on top of whatever funny thing that you can piece together. &amp;#x200B; Fast forward, and by the end of the night, I not only realized that the man to my right owned the restaurant that was famous country wide, but I also shook hands with two native Japanese moguls of sorts and met a famous traditional Indian answer! I also got far too many generous gifts ""on the house"" and shared joy with people who I will never see again. &amp;#x200B; I went to sleep that night with laugh lines that wouldn't go away. &amp;#x200B; And the next day? I ran into a woman who was on a similar visa trip and we ended up sharing a taxi to the airport- turns out we were from within 45 minutes away from each other and went to affiliate churches growing up. She is give or take 10 years older and we end up having a huge, in-depth life talk that spans the full spectrum of our experiences and she just drenches me in wisdom for nearly 3 hours... &amp;#x200B; I boarded that plane thinking to myself ""what have I done to deserve any of this???"" &amp;#x200B; The answer: nothing... nothing at all. &amp;#x200B; And that's the most beautiful part-- it just happened anyway. And I'm just happy that I was vulnerable enough to receive it. "

But I think, after several years, I'm ready to let someone into my life. Let me explain (On mobile, sorry for any format errors). I was diagnosed with type II bipolar disorder at 15. I was fortunate to be put on medication that works for me early, and was able to see a therapist as well. The episodes were first brought on with the divorce of my parents after 16 years of marriage, and it was ugly. During and afterwards, I felt as if my foundation was suddenly swept out from under me, and I was going to spiral downward with what felt like a death sentence to my mental health. I knew the stories of people who live with BPD, I watched my father drive my mother away, I've woken up feeling like a different person surrounded by dampened colors only to end the day feeling like a million bucks, afraid to fall asleep, fearing to lose my happiness in only a few short hours of dreamless sleep. I spent a great deal of my time asking questions rather than providing answers, dodging any kind of vulnerability, curious only with how to become a me I can live with. After several years, things finally began to take root, and I felt I could move a little forward. But it became a game of knowing versus practicing. I knew what to do, I knew who I once was and began finally answering the question of who I wanted to be. But still I had no self in the present; no man I could live with, but a man I had accepted as who brought me here, and a man I wanted to be. I knew after my time in therapy that in order to have a thriving relationship with others, I first had to have one with myself. I needed to learn what love meant; how to love myself and love others as an extension of that love. Ultimately, I realized I needed to create a life for myself worth sharing, worth bringing someone else into where I could build something lasting, powerful, and fulfilling. Tonight, I think I finally answered that question: to Love is to wish and act in such a way as to promote the needs of another, motivated by a strong emotional connection, even to the detriment of your wants and desires. I think this definition can apply to not only to others, but to yourself too. To love yourself is to put your needs over your wants, the necessary over the fancies. It's accepting that loving myself necessarily involves sacrifice, involves growth, involves charity, involves failures, successes, and time. It's a process, who I am in the now is a point in the never ending spectrum that is myself, which can be cultivated and enjoyed and reminisced. I think, if I can continue accepting this and living in this kind of love, I'll be creating a person who can love others correctly, healthily, and to help others grow in love for themselves too. I think my struggles with myself have given me a unique view of the world; a thing about myself that I feared used instead as a force to grow this love for myself and others. I think I'm beginning to accept this. I feel I'm finally a person with a life I'm proud to begin to really share with others, and actively search for someone to intimately share it with. And it feels truly magnificent. "

I cried all the time and my hair still falls out. Youd think I should be empathetic, but Im not. I feel horrible about it. A friend recently was dumped out of the blue by his long term girlfriend, and wanted my support. He cried a lot and expressed some dark feelings. All I could feel was anger, not nurturing like I would have felt in the past. The vulnerability disgusted me. I think its because I hate myself, and I am a sensitive person. Anybody I feel is similar to me pathologically and situationally repulses me. I am filled with hatred and disgust. Happiness lasts only a week or so. I honestly wish someone would kill me in an attempted robbery or something. I would love nothing more than to bring back someone loved, and replace their spot in wherever we go when we die. I am horrible and toxic to everyone and everything around me. My bones ache. I cant express this to anybody out of fear that I will cause them not to trust me. "

That just fucking broke my heart for some reason. I dont feel worthy of that kind of support or care. I have isolated myself so far from emotional vulnerability that the idea is just so foreign to me, almost to the point of frustration. I realize how shitty of a friend, daughter, sister I am. I'm negative and cynical, and I blame others for my becoming this way. Yes, my emotional growth is stunted, but that's the result of an overly-dependent relationship that shut me out for years. Yes, I have debilitating trust issues, but those stem from years of emotional negligence from the people in my household. I never blame myself. But I almost understand why I just can't take that. I am already hard on myself for so many other things, I don't think I could handle that kind of responsibility. But now that I know, *I have to try* to change."
506,vulnerability,offmychest,Abused as a child,2,93r6vz,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/93r6vz/abused_as_a_child/,2018-08-02 03:44:17,"I was physically and emotionally abused by my older sister. She would grow her nails out long so that she could scratch me. My mom confesses that she once had to hold her down and cut forcefully cut her nails to keep her from scratching me. I have scars on my arms from the scratches. She would slap me. I think her favorite time to slap me was in the Summer when I was sunburned. I would cry and she would say, I forgot she was sunburned like that was somehow better. Like slapping me around is okay as long as Im not sunburned. Not that I ever believed that she forgot anyway. She wanted it to hurt worse. She used to tell me that I was fat and ugly and stupid. I can remember one time, sitting in my room, I saw my face in a mirror on the floor. I cried because I hated myself so much. I hated that I was the ugly one. That I was the fat one. Objectively, I know that I wasnt fat. My BMI was firmly in the normal category. But I was the fat one. I was the ugly one. I dont know that Ive ever heard her call me by my actual name. My little brother used to call me Sassy because he couldnt say my name. So my older sister called me Sasquatch and if she felt that wasnt enough, I was Oaf. She would tell me, Youre such a big oaf. Then it just became my nickname. I was Sasquatch. I was Oaf. I knew from the very start that I didnt do anything to deserve it. I was just there. And the hopelessness of knowing that there was nothing I did to start it so there was nothing I could do to stop it was crippling. It was terrifying to be home with her. I never knew what was going to set her off. I never knew how to make her stop. I can remember sitting in the kitchen one day, crying because she had been calling me ugly. I said, Sticks and stones can only break bones, but words can shatter the soul. She laughed and repeated it back in that voice that she always used to use when she would mock me. That special voice that she saved just for me. Her laugh is something that I will never forget. Even now, if she laughs at something else, I feel that same despair and vulnerability and weakness. Im back in the kitchen crying, wishing someone would help and knowing that no one was coming to help me. Summer was the worst. During the school year, at least I got to go to school. I could escape for 6 hours a day. But Summer was when I was stuck with her. Im not sure when my mom started working during the day, but my sister was in charge while she was gone. She would torment me and then my mom would come home and I would tell her what had happened while she was gone. But she would say that she was too tired and she couldnt deal with it and it had happened while she was at work so there wasnt anything she could do about it. My mom told me that she didnt know what to do. She tried spanking her and putting her in time out but nothing ever worked. She said that raising my sister was difficult and that if she could do things over she would do them differently. That she tried to stop her. She says that my grandma told her that my sister needed be sent somewhere else- to go live somewhere else. I remember my mom fighting and shouting with my sister one day and her picking up the phone telling her that she was going to call someone and put her up for adoption because she just couldnt take it anymore. I was crying, my younger sister was crying, and I remember thinking that it was because of me. That if I could just be stronger, be less annoying to her, just stay out of her way and ignore her, that I could keep my family together. I felt so guilty that I was the reason my family was falling apart. I remember doing my homework at the kitchen table and crying about what had happened earlier that day. I dont remember what it was, but I remember putting my head down on my paper, letting the tears fall onto my homework. I circled in and wrote out next to the smeared splotches, Sorry, I was crying. I turned it in, hoping that my teacher would ask me about it so I could finally tell somebody what was going on. Somebody who might have been able to stop it. There was a week in 7th grade where I was out of school for ear infections. I went back on Friday and didnt realize that it was Manners Day and I was supposed to wear a skirt instead of jeans. I got upset because everyone was dressed up except me and I started crying. My teacher sent me to the guidance counselor and on a whim, I spilled my guts to the guidance counselor about what was going on at home. I didnt know she was going to tell my mom, but I overheard my mom shouting at my sister that she was the reason I ended up in the guidance counselors office. I felt betrayed that my guidance counselor had called my mom and I felt guilty that I was stressing out my mom and giving her more that she had to deal with. I didnt like being the reason that people got mad. I didnt want to make everyones life worse by complaining about what my sister was doing. So I stopped talking about it. I just lied and said I was fine so that no one would be angry. That was one thing that has dragged on well into adulthood. If I thought people are going to be angry with me, I lied. I lied to avoid fights all the time, and it caused a lot of problems with my family and in my relationships. Im finally with a partner who insists on honesty and has taught me that its ok to fight. That not fighting means that theres a lot going left unsaid. When I was 14, I got into an arm wrestling contest with my sister and I won. That was when the physical abuse stopped. When she realized that I was stronger than she was. I thought that was it, that it was over, but it just made the emotional abuse that much worse. Looking back and talking about it, my younger sister has admitted that she often sided with my older sister. She didnt want a piece of what I was getting. She left my brother out of it, but there were a lot of times, with my younger sister at her side, that it was two against one. I was ganged up on and there was no one on my side. I was so totally and utterly alone. I didnt understand how I could have a big family and be so lonely. I figured I was just the weirdo in the family, the one who never really fit in. The first time I admitted that I was abused, was at church to my bishop. I went and told him that I was having trouble forgiving my sister for abusing me for most of my childhood. By this time, my sister was married and had moved out. He told me to read a book on forgiveness and to try to move on. I remember thinking that it was so useless. No one had any help to give me. No one understood. And I felt like no one believed me. That I had to prove it was bad enough for someone to take it seriously. My whole life, my family has said that she I didnt get along or had a strained relationship. Like this was just a sibling rivalry. Just once, I would like someone to admit that what happened to me was more than just not getting along. I wish I could feel validated or at the very least that someone cared. But then one the flip side of that, a few months ago my mother told my ex-husband some of what I went through. He came to me with that pity look in his eyes, apologizing, saying that no kid should have to go through what I went through. I hated the pity in his eyes. I hated that it put me in the position of being someone who should be pitied. For so long I had gotten through by thinking that it couldnt have been as bad as I thought. Not thinking about it, pretending I was exaggerating- telling myself that we really did just have a strained relationship. But then there he was, reminding me that it really was as bad as I thought it was. And now its Pandoras box. The door is open, the truth is out there, and I cant deal with it. I cant put it back in and pretend it wasnt that bad. But I cant keep being a slave to it, either. I have no idea how badly screwed up I am. I dont know the extent that this is damaging the way I view myself, the way I view the world, how I relate to people, romantically or otherwise, and who I am underneath all that. And now Ive gotten a divorce and my whole family disapproves and it has opened the door to my older sister abusing me all over again. Shes 1000 miles away and between texting and calling and emailing, she has been extremely malicious. Telling me, amongst many other things, that she will pay me to give up my rights to my kids so that my ex-husband never has to deal with me again, and how disgusting I am. All under the guise of admonishing me for not treating me ex-husband with more respect. I sent her an email asking her to please stop contacting me so that if it continues, and I suspect it will, I can stand up for myself legally. I am tired of not being listened to, of having all of her actions swept under the rug or minimized. All those years, no one stood up for me, so now Im standing up for myself. If she contacts me again, Im filing for harassment. But that doesnt help me to heal and it doesnt make people understand. Hell, it doesnt even help me understand. I dont know how deep this wound goes and Im getting tired of bleeding. And this has been on my mind all day and I just needed to put it out there somewhere in the world. Just to keep from feeling alone, even if its just for a moment."

It was online. I wanted to see him. He delayed it, and delayed it, and delayed it. It was never going to happen, so in the end, nothing really resulted. I cut it off a week or two ago. He's nice. He's a good person. But fuck if I don't wanna smack him. I'm 17. He is 19. Not really a big difference. I, however, had been in a few relationships, and he had experience with approximately 0. I have an awful habit of picking inexperienced guys for some god-forsaken reason. I initiated the first form of sexual intimacy. I regret that. I wake up and regret it, go to bed and regret it. If I could never do it, maybe I would. I feel like it taught me a well-needed lesson. We kept it going for a few months and then it dwindled down. I'm a girl. I eventually learned that I don't like sex through screens; I want intimacy. I wanted to be the cool girl, though. The girl who's totally down for sex any time. The girl who sends nudes at random. The girl who thinks anything sexual is awesome. He liked that and his friends were jealous, so hey, I was the cool girl. I broke boundaries I had for someone I'll never meet. I shaved for the first time in 2 or 3 years. I broke the law and sent pictures and videos. By the time I deleted everything, it was over 200 files. I wanted to vomit. He did the same in regards to sending things, and I deleted those a few weeks before I broke up with him. I remember in the end how he'd nudge me towards it. How his new apartment was gonna be all to himself, so we could do whatever we want. How *it's been so long* and *I miss your p---y* (fucking come on, why is that banned) and whatever fucking else. I actually partially fell in love because he cared about women more than most boys I knew at this age. He wasn't outright misogynistic and was always willing to listen when I talked about anything related to feminism. His friends were misogynistic, but he insisted that he wasn't like that and that they were just stupid teenage guys who were too afraid of vulnerability. Funnily enough, I skimmed some social media of his and found that he was told to get a ""big booty white bith."" He replied saying that's exactly what he lost. It's very weird seeing that. It's weird going through seven or eight months of romance, being this man's goddamn therapist, and seeing every pet name he applied to me get boiled down to that. Big booty white bith. He sent me a message a few days ago, saying that he was lonely without me and that he missed me. I can't say the feeling is mutual. I do not miss him, nor do I miss the idea of him that I once had. P.S. he wore fucking cargo shorts, unironically liked that Kevin James mall cop movie, and sent nudes at the same angle most of the time. The bar was set at the fucking ground, evidently."

I was yelled at by my parents for bringing it up immediately after it happened, therefore I struggled with it alone for years. There's a lot more to it but it's not really necessary to go into. I've done my very best to deal with my past traumas in the past roughly 5 years with 0 family support, including counselling among other things. I'm far from recovered or perfect but I'm proud of how far I've come. However, I really.. really struggle with relationships. I think it's much worse than I've thought it was over the years and I'm feeling so so so defeated. Every relationship goes the same: things begin great, but I feel like I'm almost keeping a secret from him. I try my best not to share this side of me until we're a little deeper into dating, but when the time comes where we have sex... it really shows. I'm extremely ashamed of my sexuality. I'm really great actually \*having\* sex but foreplay, blowjobs, handjobs... I have panic attacks. I don't know exactly why those specifically are a trigger but I generally struggle with fearing I'm disappointing them because I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing with a dick. I'm usually clear that I don't give head, but the rest is expected... and really difficult to avoid. It's been years since I found myself liking someone but just recently I really fell fast. We had a great night recently and ended up having sex.. but it was the worst, most disappointing sex I've ever had - and absolutely for sure he's ever had. I felt completely to blame and I told him about my past. Not ideal timing but I was in tears so I kind of had to. Since then, he's absolutely distanced himself and I'm proooobably ghosted. I've honestly been a wreck these past few days though because I feel completely to blame. I'm so angry and so sad and fucking broken when it comes to intimacy. I'm GREAT otherwise, but I struggle so so hard with this. I can't help but ask myself who I would be if my trauma hadn't happened.. if I would be GOOD in bed... I just need to let this out. I'm too embarassed to tell anyone close to me, and I'm just feeling so defeated. I feel like I'm not going to find anyone patient enough to be with me. I am so fucking lonely I'm nearly talking to the walls. It hurts so fucking badly. Those two people have ruined so many things in my life and they're out there, living their own lives with no repercussions. And here I am, so alone. Feeling so at fault for it. I really fucking liked him. I hoped he'd be different. I guess let this be a PSA to all of those out there with little experience in this: sexual abuse strips you of everything. If someone opens up to you, please, please make them feel heard. Make them feel safe. They will be petrified and if they're anything like me, the vulnerability and the fear lingers for days after talking about it. just make it fucking stop"

So I'm not even really sure if this fits here, and this meanders a lot, but all of these things are sort of combined into this ball of tension in the pit of my stomach. Really I just can't tell anyone I know this like...at all. I need to tell someone this or I'm going to explode. First some background: so I have a friend let's call her Janet. Growing up Janet and I were always very friendly, and always really enjoyed talking to each other. Literally every guy I knew was in love with Janet following her around like fucking puppy dogs though. So also I was obsessed with a girl (I mean I AM a Redditor..) who wasn't particularly interested, and thus I kept Janet at arms' length. I grew up in in one of the worst places in America....I don't wanna say where, but suffice to say it's bad. Because of this I don't show people vulnerability (I'm getting better) and have always been seen a very cold person. One of the first people I ever showed any shred of vulnerability was Janet when we were drunk a few times. This wasn't many times, but I had a lot of horrible shit happen to me until I was 14, and went to live with my other family members in a better place where I met her. Even after that a couple exceptionally bad tragedies happened. Again it was only a few times while drunk, but her and I...that was a safe space. So then everyone goes off to college. Not me for reasons that would make me reaaally identifiable if I told them. I end up working this awful job and living in the hood again until I was like 23. So like I spend 6 years working a horrible mindless job, living with 3 other people, and doing...some really awful shit. Both as a result of my environment and alcoholism which the hood is fucking great at giving people. I've used a level of violence no one I know would ever think I was capable of. Even for the hood I was the wrong button to push. This bit is just kind of showing you where my mind was for a long time. Because of all this my friends and I develop entirely different mindsets, incompatible friends, etc. Every once in awhile I come home at the insistence of a few very good friends. A few of those times I see Janet, and it's so fucking great to see her every time. Somehow no matter how long it's been we're just...close. Out of our friend group of maybe 20 people there are maybe 3 people I could still connect with on a meaningful level...but 2 of them I talked to a lot. Her I never talked to outside of these times. Later on I get a really good job which springboarded me into a really great industry, and I'm relatively happy now. Lonely though just...really lonely. I'm not an attractive man, but I don't have much trouble with women. I guess I have some kind of superficial charm or I'm just fun and confident whatever. Finding someone I have an actual connection with that I want to be with long term...yeah no. There have been a couple of very close relationships, and each time it's been...failure. Some failures (like professional) are just learning opportunities from your mistakes or whatever. The only failure there is simply not trying. These were not those kinds of failures. It's that kind of failure where shit is simply over with no second chance. I assume most of us have been there. Anyways back on track: she does something similarly great except at a much, much higher level than me, and in a different industry. Basically we're just uh both STEM professionals, and our profession is a HUGE part of our respective lives, it's part of our identities in a major way. One of our mutual friends has a party, and we both show up. She's there with her bf of..honestly I don't know how long. I think a pretty long time. I've tried to completely avoid bringing him up like at all for reasons that will be super obvious in a minute. He's actually a super nice guy, and I really like him. On to the uh ""juicy"" part. This is a really big place, and at some point everyone is gone but me and her on an errand or some shit. So we're talking and I don't think we're particularly intoxicated at this point. Maybe a uh 2/10 or something we're a lil buzzed and feeling good. We've been talking for like 4 hours just about various things. Turns out we have a fucking ridiculous amount in common now, and the conversation is just SO GOOD. Anyways I look over at her and I tell you know you're really amazing. I want to emphasize I did not mean anything like I was in love with her or something. It was just great conversation, booze, and affection, she IS amazing. So she looks at me kind of seriously kind of playfully and asks me if I l'm in love with her. I did not think so at the time. I told her naw just everyone needs to hear that sometimes. This was as completely sincere as it was awkward. She just laughed it off. A couple minutes later (and don't ask I don't know why I said this) I said ""wellll maybe in high school a lil bit, but yknow everyone was in love with you."" I think I just wanted to see what she thought about that. She says kind of playfully kind of angrily ""why the hell didn't you tell me"" and says she would have really liked that. So I kind of brushed it off like ""I'm a big boy you don't have to say that for my confidence"" and she lists off like 20 reasons. So internally I'm thinking ""well shit she's thought about this more than a minute"" so anyways we start talking about how weird and different things would be if we had gotten together then. Mostly just lighthearted shit, laughing about it, whatever. I kind of try to shut down the conversation at this point, because I'm starting to feel some shit. So I say ""yknow doesn't really matter that much we'd probably have broken up by now HS relationships don't have the best track record of lasting haha."" Without missing a beat she says ""haha no we're really compatible I doubt it."" So alright we're in the rabbit hole now I guess it's time to see the limits of this shit. So I mention we'd probably be married by now, and maybe even have kids. J: ""Yeah that'd be a pretty great life"" OP: ""You know babies means babymaking right haha?"" J: ""Yeah that's the best part"" and she smiles at me. At that point I make the decision that there is no possible way this going further is going to end well. I tell her we should probably get on another subject before this shit gets awkward. The conversation somehow really hadn't been very awkward (thank you wizard of booze) it was playful and we were kinda laughing about it. That last thing though that was skating on some fuckin lines. In fact when I heard that I internally had like...for anyone who has seen DBZA and Vegeta is screaming in S2 and like there are people in the future hearing the yell? That was essentially my internal monologue. So if things had ended here this would just be a nice little confidence booster. A special little thing that was a new layer of closeness to our relationship. Things did not end here, because of fucking course they wouldn't. Later on we're like 5/10 maybe 6/10 fucked up. We're still talking about some pretty technical shit though, so I guess we weren't THAT fucked up. We're both really enjoying the party and all that. We end up alone again, and I don't know what fucking bug I got up my butt that compelled me to say this. I guess I had been thinking about this all night without realizing it. I look at her and tell her ""yknow you were right"" I get a ""huh?"" back and tell her I meant about asking if I was in love with her earlier. After that I walked up to her, and looked her dead in the eyes. Honestly it uncomfortably resembled squaring up with a dude, and that exact thought was in my head for some reason. Anyways I tell her ""Janet I fucking love you"" with a level of confidence and just feeling in general I did not know I was capable of. I'm a confident guy, and these days I can show some emotion. This was more than that this was like George Bush in 2001 telling the terrorists we will not falter, we will not fail...except like in a good way. You've read the title so you know she said she loved me too...equally emotionally, and we're still like idk 6 inches apart from each other if that. We're uh just kind of looking at each others faces and then looking each other in the eyes at this point. I don't think either of us really has any idea what to do. I tell her this is the part where I'd normally kiss you and she laughs (and the tension is defused) and says well I guess we can at least hug. So we do, and she's resting her head on my chest, and I'm kind of resting my face in her hair, and she looks up and I'm looking into her eyes and she just has this huge smile on her face. I did that cheesy thing where I brush her head to the side, and we're just standing there grinning like dopes. That whole embrace lasted probably like 10 minutes, and I think at this point every single endorphin in my body is active. I've never done heroin, but I can only imagine it feels similar. I've told people I loved them, and had them say they do too, but nothing like this. This is...motherfucking intense. Looking down into her eyes though I thought about just kind of who I had become. All the maybe not ""horrible"" given the context but...I've done some really bad things. Nothing like sexual assault or anything like that but as I said earlier violence. Stealing. Drugs. Apathy. All kinds of horrible traits I don't think I ever stopped and thought about. My egocentricity in general, etc. Anyways we break apart and we see our reflection in a window both our cheeks are just bright red which we kind of giggled about. I honestly was doubting this could be real, and that sort of drove it home like yeah she's feeling exactly what I'm feeling right now. So we talk for...I have no idea how long. Awhile. About shit like what we do about this, blah blah blah. We keep drinking, and end up 6/10-6.5/10 drunk. We're not black out drunk, but we're way past buzzed we are full on drunk. I end up being a bit drunker than her and I'm telling her how I want her and shit. I've got my arms kind of uh around her hips like we're dancing or something and we're whispering shit into each others ears so no one can hear. We end up saying really really graphic shit to each other about stuff we want to do to each other for like 10 minutes. Like things I never in a million years expected to hear come out of her mouth. It was like uh cybering in person which is as stupid as it sounds, but I really didn't give a shit at the time. I went a wee bit far and I say this sarcastically ""crossed the line"" and tried to grab her ass. I say sarcastically because at this point we're pretty far on the other side of the line. She gently pushed me away and I apologized and she said it's cool I get it. I think I asked her if we could do various things which she shut down and got a little annoyed at. That part I'm pretty embarrassed about, but at that point only the caveman part of my brain was online. I think she actually thought it was kind of hilarious to tease me like that idk I certainly got a little cringey. What pisses me off about that is it's kind of like I cheapened something that's well...I mean love that shit's beautiful. The next day everyone hung out and had a great time, and she apparently wasn't mad about it. By not just chance, but generally because I liked the guy a lot I talked to her boyfriend a shitload of the next day. I talked to her quite a bit but not about that just about yknow regular shit. So now it's been a bit since then, and we're reconnecting. I'm not keeping her at arms' length anymore. I'm going to get to know her on a deeper level I never did before because well...she deserves it. I was really egocentric growing up. I don't know if I'm even going to ever bring this up with her. Easiest way to ruin a friendship is to make it only about pursuing some romantic bullshit. I feel like shit though to be honest. I feel horribly guilty about all this for a lot of super obvious reasons. We didn't exactly cheat, but like if I was her bf I'd definitely call that shit cheating. I also feel regret like I never thought I'd feel. I feel regret for keeping her at arms' length and not discovering this. I had no idea I've been in love with her this whole time. Literally no idea, but looking back it's painfully obvious that we had a special connection. I think I dismissed it because I was depressed. I feel regret for waiting so long...I guess because the other thing. Honestly though I just hate that she's with some other dude and not me. I also hate that I actually like the guy quite a bit, and I can't be mad about it. I'm not being righteous or trying to steal her away from some guy who's a piece of shit as far as I know. I'm just an asshole in this situation. I hate that I can't tell my friends because her BF and several of my friends are all really good friends. So here I am posting this one Reddit and hoping she doesn't read this...I'm pretty sure she's on Reddit. I mean I don't think she'd be mad if she saw this, because she's awesome. But there's still some anxiety. Guys don't let love suffer in the dark. Fuck everybody else if you need to tell someone something tell them. Otherwise you might miss something special, and that shit is tragic. Not only YOU might miss something special BOTH OF YOU might miss something special. Then stupid ass shit like this happens. Unless you might get shot or something for it that's like the only exception. If you might get shot keep that shit to yourself. To everyone who read this thanks. This isn't the worst thing anyone's ever done, but it sure isn't very good. "
511,vulnerability,offmychest,"2,172 days homeless (older brother of six, college student)",1,8r8up7,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8r8up7/2172_days_homeless_older_brother_of_six_college/,2018-06-15 16:32:34,"c/w--effects of homelessness, ptsd I have been homeless, as the oldest of my six younger siblings, since 2012. We have lived in hotels and shelters for that period, and nothing has seemed to improve. I have such a weight on my shoulders to support my family and to be more than what poverty inflicts on its victims. For this reason, I threw myself into education/work/sports, and am now in college. However, nothing concrete to have changed-- my parents blockaded by a state shelter system that has placed us hours from our town of origin, limiting our ability to supersede our financial reality-- and the weight on my shoulders still persists. I over-extenuate myself in school as I am trying to forget all that my family has lost, and the traumatizing situations that live in my memory and during my sleep. I know things could be worse, and I am immensely grateful for the opportunities that I have in front of me. But it never feels like I am doing enough... I feel guilty when I take breaks, as I know my siblings/parents are suffering as I am living at school (and when I am back with them, but being away amplifies the feeling), with limited food access/health problems/ educational opportunity (the state shelter representatives can just walk into our apartment shelter whenever they feel for random checks.. talk about degrading/dehumanizing). I am overly involved on my campus from this, as I try to advocate for those impoverished like myself in an institution lacking economic/racial diversity as I myself feel alone. But, to do this, I am always sharing my story-- always reliving the trauma, whether that be in public speaking/journalism/government avenues, or even having to explain myself in something as personal as ""I am sorry professor, I cannot afford this book as I cannot afford food and...) I am doing what I can to try to change my family's life, but it does not go unbeknownst to me that the problem is systemic and extends beyond the individual. I try to be an advocate, but it has begun to drain me emotionally.. I want to do something to really change the societal perspective regarding those experiencing homelessness, but I have trouble finding how. And a part of me questions whether I am only doing all of this to save myself. I am writing a memoir and want to run for political office to do so... but, it pains me to know that I have too much baggage and a complete lack of financial resources to bring that dream to reality (hence why I am pursuing a STEM degree along with a degree in polisci/creative writing-- the latter two my real passion, despite my vested interest in medical school). I also fear building my life path or career off of this one traumatic period, as then I don't think I would ever truly leave it. I have so much in front of me I want to accomplish, but I feel as if my past and financial reality/mental stability is holding me back. Having missed out on so many opportunities, I haven't experienced many ""milestones"" that others cherish in their younger years.. I could not allow myself to love anyone, and did not want to burden them with my responsibility and that of my family-- so I didn't. I basked in the ability to live my own life, but looking back-- as I am about to turn 21-- it pains me to wonder what that first kiss truly feels like (having not had one) or what having a stable family life &amp; network of hometown friendships brings. At the same time, I am bisexual... but haven't told anyone, until now. Being homeless, poor, a first-gen/low-income student, has affected so much of my life and made myself and my family a target of classism/discrimination, so I fear that extra layer of unfortunate vulnerability that coming out would create-- even though I want to. Not that I am fit for a relationship anyhow, as I can't trust anyone. My close net of college friends/peers/ immediate family (in their own ways) always tell me that I am strong, and that they are supporting me every step of the way. Previous ""friends"" far less so--both hs and college friends-- many who ghosted me for my baggage or just walked away, and weigh on my mind. Was there anything I could have done to keep them from leaving?? However.. I just play the game, nod and smile until no one asks questions about how broken I truly am inside. I want my siblings to have what I couldn't, and my parents to be happy and stable with a future. But I am only one person, navigating a unknown world without much support. I would give up everything for them to thrive. I consistently tell myself that no one is too far gone, and I want to believe it. I need to to survive. I don't know if anyone will ever read this nor how long I will keep this up, but I thank you if you do. Just getting all of this out is therapeutic in some form. "
512,vulnerability,offmychest,A letter to the other woman (girl),3,8roc92,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8roc92/a_letter_to_the_other_woman_girl/,2018-06-17 13:07:19,"Here's the letter I want to send but never will. Dear A. B., I found you on Facebook today. I finally got him to tell me the whole story last night. Not just that he cheated but with whom. His roommate's 21 year old younger sister (over a decade younger than him and I.) I spent a while looking at your pictures. You look so young and ignorant. Surprisingly, you actually look a lot like I did when I was your age. He and I had been together ten years. I supported him through the worst times, stayed by his side through medical school. You are too inexperienced, too immature to even understand a tiny bit of what you've just aided in destroying. I blame him completely, but you had a role. You approached him. You asked him to fly to Florida. You preyed on his vulnerability. You knew about our relationship, and probably got a thrill out of being the ""wanted"" one. Here's what you can't possibly know: he's a sad, messed up man. He's sick. He doesn't want you or even lust after you. You were an escape for him from his problems, an outlet for him to release his frustrations. You can't save him or change him (not that you want to, I wouldn't know either way) I know this because I have been his confidant for ten years. I know him more deeply than you ever will. Which makes it so unbearably ironic that I'm the one getting completely shit over in this situation. My life, my dreams, my plans, the person I thought was my loyal partner, all have been shattered before my eyes. He told me he'd been planning to propose. All this has happened for what? So that you could have a few nights of mediocre, fucked up s&amp;m role-play? My dear, you don't know what you're doing or what you're getting into. You don't know me, your conscience probably still feels pretty clean. But you will regret your involvement with him. You will regret the type of sex you've had with him (rape role play) When I googled your name, I found the obituary of your mother, died when you were probably just a little kid. Do you think your dead mother would be proud of you right now? I wanted to say all of this to you directly, but I realized I don't need to. You and him will continue down your pathetic, messed up paths. You don't need to hear from me- you will realize at some point how dirty, despicable, and ashamed you should feel. And I hope that feeling never leaves you."
513,vulnerability,offmychest,24 hours later...,3,8sfm16,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8sfm16/24_hours_later/,2018-06-20 14:57:35," I still need time to figure out my part in it. I did get angry. I did feel angry. Maybe I do have anger issues. Maybe I do not over communicate. I feel like our relationship lacks closeness. I feel unsatisfied with the amount of time you spend with your current hobby. I feel annoyed that we can't come to a compromise on the amount of hobby stuff in the home. I feel overwhelmed with the sense that I don't want to move back in to a situation where I feel overly crowded by your stuff and alone. I feel like instead of doing your current hobby stuff you could sell some of your old hobby stuff and have space and more savings. It would be like two weeks of effort or a little more and then two problems are lessened. I feel like you reject my advances for closeness. I feel rejected by your rejection of my want for closeness. I feel like when I think about having a future with you it is all clouded with nonsense and bullshit. I feel at times like we don't have the sort of relationship I would want to have forever. I feel like you are never open about your feelings. I feel like the only vulnerability I see from you is when we have arguments and you get angry. I feel like sometimes the only entertainment I can offer you is sex. I feel like what you probably consider ""sweet nothings"" are words that put a smile on my face and I feel like it would be nice to hear them more often. I feel like you have a ton of amazing qualities. I feel like when I make you laugh my whole body has butterflies. I feel like even with the nonsense and the bullshit, you are my favorite person. I feel like we should be able to reach compromise but the progress feels more similar to erosion than change. I feel like sometimes I get impatient and push too hard on all the wrong buttons. I feel like sometimes typing words is easier than saying them because not having to watch the person's reactions makes it easier to keep clear thoughts (and typing lets you edit things.) I feel like there's always a million things I want to say to you but I often feel like I am bothering you. I feel like I get anxious when I think about my life without you in it. I feel like sometimes there's a pedestal I hold you on but I made it too high. I feel like I am fairly shitty at relationships and don't have the ""skills"" to have a healthy one. I feel like our lack of closeness makes me miss you. I feel like its too difficult to get your attention sometimes. I feel disheartened when my attempts go unnoticed. I feel like I spend time worrying if this relationship will ever lead to a future where we are both proud of ourselves and each other. I feel like if you were less stoic it might be easier for me. I feel like maybe one day I'll be able to say this out loud. I feel like there's an equal possibility I don't. "
514,vulnerability,offmychest,I was molested by an older brother and never told my family,8,8t4jlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8t4jlt/i_was_molested_by_an_older_brother_and_never_told/,2018-06-23 06:28:31,"Let me start off, i'm 24 now but at the time of the abuse I was 6. It was fairly traumatic and was done by an older brother who I absolutely adored and trusted very much. I would say I struggled alone with it for a long time, but I think I turned into a pretty cool adult and there aren't many negative effects that I retained from the abuse. The biggest negative effect I still have is that I have a hard time when my significant other wants sex and starts to physically come on to me. I clam up and get anxious and instantly get turned off. I think it stems from not being in control of the sexual situation which takes me back to being 6 again at the hands of my 16 year old older brother. I'm not 100&amp;#37; sure why i'm writing this. I guess I just need to tell people? The abuser moved away in 2001 after becoming estranged from my family (for un-related reasons) so I never have to face him and have maybe spoken to him 3-4 times since I was 6. He's reached out a few times on Facebook to check in with me and the last time we spoke he reached out to congratulate me on getting my degree. I ""grey rock"" him because he doesn't deserve to know how i'm doing and it's infuriating that he thinks he can strike up a casual conversation with me. When it happened, I didn't know it was wrong because I had no grasp over what sexuality was. I mean, fuck. I was 6. He was my older brother and best friend and I just assumed this is what brothers do. He told me that we couldn't tell our parents, and instead he wanted me to tell them we've been playing ""cops &amp; robbers."" I remember running to my mom after she returned home and being super excited to tell her about me and my favorite older brother playing cops and robbers while they were gone. I don't really know how many times it happened. I know of one for sure that was a pretty traumatic and I get bits and pieces of what could be other times. Maybe I could be repressing the other times? Maybe it was just the one time? I'm not sure i'll ever know for sure. I was about 12 when I realized the severity of what happened, and it fucked me up really bad for a while. I struggled with my sexual identity for a long time because my only ever sexual experience came from an older brother. Was I gay? I'd only ever been sexual with a man, so that makes me gay right? While I still don't really conform to a sexuality, I would categorize myself as straight these days. I don't really know why I never told my parents. I guess there are a lot of reasons. I didn't tell when I was super young because I didn't realize it was wrong. I didn't feel dirty. I didn't feel taken advantage of. When I realized what had happened (between 12 and 13), I was terrified my friends at school would find out and think that I was gay. As I got older, I didn't tell because I couldn't bear putting my mother through that. The realization that your son was sexually abused is heavy, and I never wanted her to have to take on that burden so I carried it for her. She is an angel and an immaculate spirit and I couldn't make myself tell her. Now, I don't tell so I don't ""rock the boat."" It's been close to 20 years and it would ultimately be my word vs. his. He lives across the country and has never came to a family event. He's never been to a marriage, graduation or birthday and keeps himself scarce from the family. But, recently my father was speaking about him and said something along the lines of ""Even though he's never really wanted anything to do with us, he's still my son and I love him very much."" For some reason hearing that brought back every emotion i've experienced about the situation. Helplessness, vulnerability, embarrassment, the whole package. I've started to lose sleep though. The anxiety and the guilt about letting him get away with it burns me to my core. I lay in bed at night and think that I may be the reason he could be doing this to other kids. There could be other kids in the world who had their innocence stolen and their lives fucked up because I was too afraid and selfish to tell anyone. I'm dealing with this, and I don't know that i'll ever truly be able to handle the guilt. Thanks for listening and reading. Even if no one responds, i'm glad I got the chance to say all of this. I've told a few close friends and a few girlfriends but never anyone in my family. I'm terrified of being labeled a liar. I'm terrified of being told ""it was 20 years ago let it go."" I'm terrified of being told that i'm a grown man and I need to suck it up. But what terrifies me more than all of this is that there could be other kids this happened to, and the only reason is that I never had the courage to speak up. I suffered in silence and possibly doomed other kids to my same fate."
515,vulnerability,offmychest,"I still think about you everyday, and I'm breaking-All over again",1,8tyith,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8tyith/i_still_think_about_you_everyday_and_im/,2018-06-26 19:01:51," I think back. As I write this, I am moved to tears. You taught me what it meant to really, really love someone. To care so deeply for someone that it redefined what I knew about love, especially on a personal level. Even on that night of terror-as I laid there on the bed, with death itself hanging over my head, I brought myself to the moment of truth. I told them to spare your life and take mine. So for I to die, that you may live. It was my moment of truth, and I remember it so vividly. I never meant to hurt you-but I do know that I was just bad for you. The baggage I carried with me was my curse, and you didn't want to go down with that ship, and yet-you did. You went through so much, and the worst part of it all was that we could never reach out to eachother-to reconcile. To sit there and be able to hold each other and to tell each other that it was going to be O.K.-Even if it wasn't. I remember your old boyfriend, that had passed away so long ago, bless his soul. I had not known him very much, if at all. I remember talking to him in the hall one day-He was a cool guy. He treated me with respect when I walked up to him, and I was honored to have met him. So when our group of friends were at his side, they came and asked me for solace. And I gave that to them-with nothing but empathy and love in my heart. I related to them before he died, and in the middle of my childhood, and of being drugged so badly I couldn't even attend school, I tried to give them peace in their hardest of times. Maybe it was because I knew what losing someone so close to me felt like. I was so, so young, and when my father died and I gave him a final embrace, the last words that man ever heard was 'I love you, dad'. And then, as the preacher for my friend Trevor's funeral said, the body was merely a vessel for the soul. I had felt his soul leave this world, and there was nothing I could to. I broke down into a river of tears, and my brother Scott held me while the innocence of my childhood died in front of me, in my living room, in hospice care. But then, one day, long down the road-I met you. To me, you were just another person. Until you mentioned Kam-and you broke down in front of me. I sit here and hate myself, because of how you must feel so bad for showing your vulnerability like that, and letting down your guard. I got you a napkin to cry onto, and made you mac and cheese. Still, to this day, I remember the good times we had together. The thing is, that day was the day I really fell for you. I wasn't trying to take advantage of your pain, and I should have known you were not ready for another relationship. I was being foolish-and selfish. But as the bible says, "" Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. . . And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."" The next day-or at least not long after, it had turned out you had stolen something from me. Nothing worth fighting over, looking back on it. It was odd though-even though you took something from me I gave you the benefit of the doubt, and it was because I chose to forgive you for stealing from me-because I knew that deep down you were hurting from losing Kam. Because soon enough I found out what it was like to lose you. The worst way to lose someone is to know that they're still alive, but that there was nothing you could do- To save the relationship, or otherwise. I made a horrible, horrible mistake the next night we hungout. I messed up, so bad. If I could go back and not fall victim to that, I would have just abstained from the drugs. You told me that it was bad for me, and that I shouldn't do it. In a way, I wonder if that was god's punishment. Trying to make myself look cool to someone who had already accepted me, because I thought that was a shot at love. But I blame the devil and evil in this world for tearing us apart. And still, to this day, I can only remember how I felt my heart quite literally break under my chest as you left my condo to go home, when it was a surprise when I showed up there, that you were there. I fully expected to never see you again, and yet...I started to ask. I wanted to know what was wrong, so I could do something. Instead, you left. And I would get to see you again, but barely, over the next 4 years. I cried, and I cried, and I went to bed and woke up in pain, for a long time after that. People, very bad people took advantage of my situation when it happened, and when I had gone psychotic from the drugs it turned my love for you into something else. It was embarrassing to both of us, and it made a mockery of how much I cared for you. I remember trying to talk to you and you wanted nothing to do with me. It was at that point, that I felt so much hate, even just from the way you typed your messages to me. It burned into my brain. I knew what was love, and what wasn't, though. I had told you that I would always care for you, and I always did, and to this day still do(as evidenced by the fact that I'm typing this now, at 2 in the morning.). When our mutual friend saw me break down some time after all this occured, and I explained to him what happened, it was by some miracle of god that I would get a text message from him about how he had talked to you, and how you said you wanted to be friends again. That was more than I could have ever asked for, and I learned that if I really did love you, to let that part of the story go. To at least be your friend, because then I would at least be at home, in my heart. And for a small time, we did hang out. And it was good-but one day, for some reason-it stopped. Out of nowhere.. I just felt like I did something wrong. That was all I knew. I think that gets most of my hardship out. But now-here is the redeeming part. The single thing that gives me the strength to go on-and the reason why I still believe in god, and that Lord Jesus did die on the cross for our sins. On that day at the state fair that I had went with my family, I had smoked earlier in the day a cigar. I got it from the tobacco store. On it, it was emblazened 'Romeo and Juliet'. A fitting descriptor of a fancy tobacco cigar. I went to the fair, and it was a grand time. Soon, the day would wind down, and as I was winding through the crowds, I felt like I blended in, and I could feel love in the summer air. As it was, you would come from nowhere-in a place of crowded and various faces, even with me blending in, you found me. And it was at that point in time, you spun me around, and grabbed me;and you kissed me. And I remember not much, except that for a moment-and it was magic, it seemed-for a moment, that I had found truth in plain sight. In front of the people at the state fair, we kissed, and it was my first. The sad, unfortunate thing is I didn't know how to react. A bittersweet truth, I walked away and smiled, saying, 'What was that?' in a laughing style. I was so confused, you came out of nowhere and I had lived my life up until that point fully expecting to never see you again. But by faith-we kissed, and when we did...I felt nothing but joy. I had never felt such a unique thing in my life. Something worth defending with my life. Something that people would sacrifice themselves for, time and time throughout history. Now I knew why. I knew truth;I knew love. It had set me free, if only for a certain time. But that time could feed a thirsty soul for a lifetime. Without the love I had known for you, I would not be here today. If all the things that had happened to me had happened without you by my side, at least at some point, or at some period in time, then I would not have had the strength to make it. You gave me the greatest gift anyone could ever provide another person-what had died so long ago in front of me, had came back, in the form of love for another person. I could feel my father's spirit in this endeavor, and it was like his spirit could finally come to rest. After the chaos of my childhood after he died, his spirit could rest easy. Much like you gave me that, I hope that I helped bring peace to Kam's soul in the afterlife. I remember praying on the night before he died, even as being as an atheist at the time. I prayed that his/our friends would be strong, and that he would be granted access into heaven. Funny, I think of it, and Kam and my dad are both up there...Maybe once you get to the afterlife, and the pearly gates open-it becomes a family. We're all god's children, right? I hope that holds true in the end. I could not imagine an afterlife where I am not reunited with my family, or my friends, or you and your family. For that would not be much of a heaven at all. The events of the past are over now though. I never meant to come off as a creep, or to make you feel like I was stalking you-that was completely the drugs, at the time. I did, however, love you, even sober. I still do, but I've come to accept certain things, or so I tell myself. You have a home now, in a different state, you and your husband have made it-and are successful, and have a child. My love is not selfish nor is it greedy, so just know that I am nothing but purely happy for you when I hear that. Even though I may have my own problems, you deserve peace and joy. If I couldn't give you that, then at least by the grace of god, someone else could give you that, and they did. I was blessed to have you as a part of my life, and no one should ever have to go through the things we did. No one deserves that, and it just tells me that the devil is alive in this world-but the lord won in the end...Even though all you may remember of me is the arguments we ended up getting into after all that stuff(just talking about the majority of the time, how we would argue whenever we would try to talk, excluding a couple of times)-I remember the good times, and the things you taught me. But I'm not going to settle for anything less than what I felt for you, and what I know you felt for me-because that was the one thing I did right in this world. If there was one thing that I ever did right, it was loving you, and if I had to go back and repeat the same mistakes to learn the same lessons, be that of god, life, or of love or liberty, then I would do that. And if I could go back and learn those same vital things without us having been pushed to those extremes, I would in a heartbeat. Maybe, if by some stroke of luck, you ever come across this, then you will know instantly that it was meant for you, and you'll know(if only some) of the things I wanted to tell you, but never got time to. In my dreams, you are there often. And on the nights I do dream of you, it is nothing but positive love and vibes in those dreams. It's us, holding each other and telling eachother that it'll be okay, regardless of the hardships we face in those dreams. we are together in those dreams. If you ever read this, just know that Travis loves you, dearly and unselfishly, without anything from you. That is unconditional love, and through our hardships, seperate or together, I learned the meaning of those two words being together. Love can be one thing, but when it does not operate on previous pretenses, and takes a more human element, and becomes unconditional-then it becomes a love that can move mountains, and shake the earth, and bring rulers of men to their knees in awe of love itself, and of god. You made me belief in a god again for the first time in so many years. You gave back to me what was taken by the devil-and I can only view you as an angel for that. Never forget that you were and are my friend first, but that I will always love you, and by extension your family, and your friends, We were both led astray plenty, but I could never look at you as doing me wrong. When I hear your name, I think of love. And when I think of love, I hear your name. \-T, to his first true love I really had to get that off my chest. It's been far too long holding it in."

I woke up with a bad burn on one of my fingers, my left hand is badly bruised and hurts when I try to pick up anything, both of my knees are badly scraped, and I have no idea how I got home. I remember meeting someone on the street and I think he helped me get home. Thankfully it was someone who wasn't trying to take advantage of my intoxicated state. Someone else could have easily gained access to my home as I woke up with the door unlocked. I could have been seriously injured, my home robbed or worse, someone could have injured my cat (I'd never forgive myself if that had happened). I don't remember much after a certain point. I can't find any evidence of how I got home (I don't own a car so I know I didn't drink and drive), did I walk? Take the bus? Did someone get me a cab or a ride share? I don't know and it's so upsetting. My job is getting ready to change which requires more physical activity. I can't be injured. If I'm injured I can't work. I risked so much by getting to that point. I can't believe I allowed myself to get so out of control. I used to have a problem with this behavior and have since calmed and never get to that state anymore. The vulnerability, the recklessness, so many things could have gone badly. I'm thankful I am ok minus my minor injuries and I'm thankful I didn't break anything or bust my head open. I'm thankful to whoever it was that got me home. I'm detoxing now and won't be drinking a drop for at least 21 days. I refuse to allow alcohol to have that kind of control over me. Ugh, makes me so mad at myself."

I cant believe I fell for it. I knew something was off. You seemed way too understanding and accepting of my back and forth behavior. I know I was wrong for straddling the fence with you. I did have feelings, sometimes thought it was love, but was scared because of my past. I told you this. You knew I was fresh off an abusive fucked up situation. A almost killed me. I was on the verge of suicide when we finally parted ways. I told you some of my darkest secrets C and you told me a lot of yours OR maybe that was all fake too? ...but There were signs....You were super inconsistent with contact and seeing me. Every time I asked about it, you always gave me this laundry list of things you had going on. You own a small business, have kids and a bunch of other side projects, so took you at your word. I trusted you. I wonder how long you have had a girlfriend. The whole time? Looks like you've been in each others lives since before we met. I could find social media posts going back to at least April, but stopped digging after that. That trip you took to Austin and Denver, looks like were with her. Did you at least show her the fire nudes I sent you when you were in Denver? That deep intense connection you felt with me that you wanted nurture, huh? You wanted our kids to meet, huh? You met my dad and some of my friends...they all liked you. You introduced me to your daughter....You held me when I cried that night and promised to be gentle with me. You told me I could tell you anything. You told me I meant the world to you? You told me you hadnt quit on us and you promised you wouldn't. Fuck you. Fuck you for taking advantage of my vulnerability and my genuine feelings. Fuck you for lying to my face. Im sorry I gave you so much credit. The thing is, Im an ethical non-monogamist. You could have just told the truth, but thats the difference between you and me. Im an ethical person. You're just a player who wants to see what he can get away with and how many women you can fuck. I blocked you, deleted you, etc. Dont ever try to contact me again unless you're ready to tell the truth. "

519,vulnerability,offmychest,Kind of flatlined after a very intense month.,1,8uwxok,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8uwxok/kind_of_flatlined_after_a_very_intense_month/,2018-06-30 07:40:24,"I'm scared of this apathy. The past week and overall month has been intense and my anxiety's accumulated for a while now. Yesterday I felt as if things boiled over, and then I started to feel very low and highly apathetic. I was already anxious and worried and aware that I had a lot of issues within me to address, but right now I feel so passive. The anxious me is in some far away corner and this apathetic version's taken over. At least a few days ago, I'd dwell and get anxious and obsessive but come down from it all and know that they were unrealistic thoughts; basically, I'd hit a conclusion and learn from it. Right now, though, I feel pretty damn empty and dismissive. The overthinking isn't driven by anxiety at this moment; rather, all the parameters are gone and I'm not making efforts to get myself back to surface level. I just feel very ambivalent right now. It's been an intense few weeks with a lot of events and factors (school, relationship stuff, and how I reacted to both). I've realized that my anxiety and perfectionism are inhibiting me, and I also have low self-esteem and a lack of inner security/validation that I've supressed for so long. The best visual I can give is the kettle has stopped shrieking and the water has boiled over. My anxious self is in the closed bedroom down the hall, quiet and isolated away. She's taken the vulnerability and emotions with her. (This reminds me of my mom a few years ago; I was having school and mental health issues but everyone was so confused and we were all at a loss. She broke down one morning and I remember my dad went to console her.) My intuitive self that knows what's best out of all the clutter shut the stove off, but she's faded right back into my heart. And now I'm sitting at the kitchen table, tapping my fingers to some background noise and filling up space. I don't care about the hours that passed and unfortunately I can't devote genuine time to my loved ones. I'm blocking myself off from my parents and sibling and it's a nasty mechanism I've held for too many years now. I just don't care about stuff right now. Ironically, I'm still dwelling about the past and I'm oddly settled into this low point. I hear the radio or look out to an overcast afternoon and I'm surprisingly okay with it. I'm thinking, *wow, let's keep ruminating about things that I didn't do and events or fantasies that won't happen. You should be miserable for a while, because right now you're very miserable. But don't worry: we can throw a blanket over all the shame and fear and emotions, just like the old times.* What keeps me concerned and wanting to move forward is exactly that kind of feeling. My intuition and internal voice (not that self depreciating one) knows this apathy is harmful and I don't truly want to be here forever. I don't know if I'll get to work or finish tasks right away, because I procrastinate and especially when I am anxious or feeling very low. But I know that this is temporary, because I really don't want this to last. I have some doctor appointments coming up and I want to see a psychiatrist to check up on my anxiety and update from my diagnosis a few years ago. I've accomplished a lot but my anxiety and perfectionism have gotten intense as life demands got higher, too, and I want to explore other measures. (For context, I see a counsellor and community support, but I stopped medication for other conflicting health problems). I'm frustrated and tired and deep inside, I'm terrified. It's going to be a weird long weekend, but I have next week to look forward to."
520,vulnerability,offmychest,I don't want to lose anyone else.,1,8vxmiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8vxmiv/i_dont_want_to_lose_anyone_else/,2018-07-04 11:19:54,"So, to set the stage, I met this guy in college back in early October. Let's call him Reed. We met on a whim. My roommate had a crush on a guy down the hall, but didn't have the balls to invite him to hang out or even send a general invite to our hall's group chat to come watch Bill Wurtz videos, so I ended up sending the general invite. Her crush didn't respond, but some other guy did and brought us Doritos as well! He and I got along so well. It was pretty much instant friendship, especially once we found out both of us smoke (bad habit, I know). We were inseparable since, and I even moved in with him in early November. We joked that God put us in each other's lives with how well we went together. Both of us are very private people who don't like opening up, but within a month, we knew each other so well. There was even one night where we stayed up late in a common room, swapping stories and jokes while he played me songs. And as the sun rose, we both ended up crying on each other's shoulder for the people we lost to death. I've never experienced this kind of emotional intimacy before, especially to the point where I didn't hate myself for the vulnerability I showed. To say I fell in love with him is a bit dramatic, but not too far off. It's definitely a thought I entertained, but he had a girlfriend (now fiance). She's long distance and has an irritating personality, but I've always had the mind set that whatever makes him happy is ultimately good. I never tried to antagonize her or their relationship, but I also didn't go out of my way to be besties with his girl. We had vastly different interests (her an aspiring MUA, while I never touched the stuff for example), and I don't like the pressure of feeling like I \_must\_ be friends with someone just because we share an important person in our lives. This didn't really become an issue until recently, but there's more to happen until then. Something changed over Christmas break. Things weren't great with him because of distance and his girlfriend coming to town. Things were even worse with my family, as my mother's boyfriend's drug habit was out of control. To the point where our Christmas New Orleans trip was cut short on Christmas eve. My mother, my two sisters, and I made several hour trip back to our home after he yelled without end and threw beer on my mother. Things were shitty, but I can't really blame anyone but myself for starving myself. So I went back to school the next semester. Reed and I, the unstoppable team, back together. He and I against the world. I should've seen it coming, but he clocked my unhealthy eating habits pretty much immediately. I don't know why I thought he wouldn't notice; I knew he has and currently is struggling with his own eating disorder. I just didn't see myself as sick. I still don't most days. I don't know if these habits are what were the definite change, but he got really distant since then. From there, things got... better. Ish. I ate more, but that doesn't necessarily mean I kept it down. He clocked me on that too. At first, it was just to prove to people that I was eating, but retain as little of the calories as possible. It eventually turned into binges and purges once I moved back home. I had to take the semester off for financial reasons, and it killed my mental state even more. My mom's boyfriend was still in the house, and he was getting even worse. I felt unsafe, as he had threatened my family, stole my mother's car, and even physically hurt my mother. I asked Reed to stay the night with me a lot. Both when my mother's boyfriend was still in the house and when he moved out. He had a gun and a car, two things I didn't and would provide options if shit happened. He was also a comforting presence, and I thought it wasn't a big deal. I never pushed him to stay over or anything. Summer came, and I stayed with him and his brother for the first two weeks. I don't enjoy being home, but eventually I went back. My mother gave New Orleans back there abusive man in a trip while I was at Reed's place, so home was slightly more bearable. I haven't seen Reed since I came back, but we were still talking. My family ended up moving houses, which was exciting. This new place is smaller, but nicer. It was still within reasonable walking distance to stores, but also had more woodsy area around. I also felt safer knowing that my mom's boyfriend didn't know where this was. Too bad that didn't last long because she drove \_my\_ car to go get him, as hers got repo'd. I felt so unsafe. I was angry at her for putting her cure for loneliness above our safety. This was a man who brought hard drugs into a home with children in it. This was a man who brought a gun to threaten her with. I had so many sleepless nights at the last house because I was so scared. It took two days after his return before I left home and started sleeping on a recliner at my grandmother's. My mother decided that telling him to not to speak to me (after he spoke to me) was so rude and pushed me out of the room we were in. So I packed my stuff immediately and walked to the nearest gas station. I had called Reed during this to rant, and that was the last time I have heard his voice. He decided to tell this whole situation to his girlfriend. Now, if you've been paying attention, you would know that (a) I am a private person and (b) I am not friends with his girlfriend. How I found out that he had told his girlfriend isn't that he asked or mentioned it to me. It was that she texted me to tell me how she knew I was \_soooooo\_ strong and could make it through this. Kind words, yes, but empty. I said thank you, and then texted him to ask that he just don't air my dirty laundry to other people. I didn't need an apology for what he had already told her or anything. I just didn't want my problems to be told to other people. He justified it with saying that she could provide advice and all, but I never asked for advice on my shitty home situation. Not from him, and especially not from someone I only make small talk with. All I wanted was for my best friend to listen. After that night, we barely texted. I occasionally sent him things, but I could tell that something was much different. Not like what was different between before and after Christmas break. Something much more drastic. And I hate it. The shittiest thing is that night he had told me that my problems aren't mine alone after I said they are. And months ago, I remember crying outside our dorm building, so scared that he would abandon me like every important man ever has in my life. He told me I had nothing to worry about. I texted him yesterday. The first thing he asks is about my car situation (my mom is still using it) and if I've gotten a job yet (can't really without my car). And, of course, he tries to offer solutions. He's always trying to fix things that no one ever asked him to fix. And I finally addressed this tension, because what the fuck. We haven't spoken in over a month, and you have nothing else to say? He got fucking \_engaged\_ in this past month, and he never even sent me a quick update text about that even. So I asked what was wrong yesterday, around 7pm. He responded around 11pm (after I fell asleep), telling me that he is still upset about the fact that I didn't want him to share my business with his fiance, and he's put off by how I allegedly act about her. I told him since I really tried having a conversation with her that I don't think she and I click well, but moving on. Something else that was bothering him is that he feels a need to fix my problems and take care of me. I never asked for that. I'd ask him to come over, sure, but I'd never push the subject if he said no. He always told me that he wants to see me as much as I want to see him. And I definitely never asked him to fix my problems. Listen to them, sure. Offer advice? If he had insight, great. But expecting him to have advice, let alone solutions, was something I never asked from him. Thirdly, apparently I haven't been happy enough for him. I don't know what this means, because the only example he gave was about his recent engagement. The engagement happened while we weren't speaking. I found out about it through social media instead of ever receiving a word from my best friend. I was angry about this, so I held my congratulations. I am happy for them, but I couldn't send much word of that when he's not fucking speaking to me, now can I? And finally, of course, the eating disorder. I've had my fluctuations, but it really feels all or nothing with him. I know that my eating habits can hurt him too, because his have hurt me. I've tried my best to, at the very least, not engage with my shitty behaviors when around him. Even that attempt isn't fucking good enough though. Over these last four or five weeks, I've lost my close family because I felt I had to leave the house. My sisters, my mother, and pathetically and most importantly, my dog. I haven't seen my dog (Prissy) since I left. My dog is what kept me from suicide throughout high school. And I'm losing him too. And I'm angry that he lied to me. And I'm angry that I let myself be this vulnerable, because I've never liked being vulnerable. But mostly, I'm sad. I'm so sad that someone I felt like I could be so open with is rejecting me and pushing me out. I texted him at 5am this morning in response, and it's 8pm now. Still no response."
521,vulnerability,offmychest,Hardest year of my life,1,8xsgf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8xsgf8/hardest_year_of_my_life/,2018-07-11 05:28:13,"I graduated high school in 2016. I started off the year underweight due to a high stress, very emotionally abusive relationship (my SO would tell me constantly I was a terrible person and he would also check how skinny I was like wrapping his fingers around my wrist) He broke up with me at the actually graduation ceremony. But we got back together some time after. I found out the my grandma had aggressive lung cancer. She was dying fast and god it hurt me so bad. We were so close and she was so strong but getting so weak. I started having nightmares about her leaving where I would die too. I was leaving for a date with my SO and my dad told me the cancer spread to her second lung already! It was only a month. She was going to die so soon. I tried to act normal on the date but I couldnt. I was upset so the food tasted bad and I couldnt eat. He was upset because I ruined the date and his family problems were much worse. I broke up with him right then and there. I felt so free. I got to see my friends again and eat when I wanted. I did yoga and painted and partied. Everything was perfect for awhile until my best friend said I need to lose some weight after I gained 10 pounds! I was like I dont see what you mean I look fine and I did look great! I was no longer underweight?! I had abs! But whatever it didnt get to me. We were drinking all the time and I started to get more and more promiscuous. My ex found out I slept with someone else and he freaked out and told me he would kill himself and Calling me names and all that. It escalated so much that I went over with a friend because I was scared and he almost punched me but my friend jumped in front of me. Everything after that involved his friends yelling and crying and his grandpa coming in with a gulf club to hit him. I fell on the floor in a panic attack. I lost more weight after that too. So my grandma got worse as I started my first year of college in August. It was hard, I had a long drive and early classes. I was still partying and drink to cope. My best friend had left for college so I was stuck with a friend from work(A). She would encourage me to stay out late and drink. And heck with all the drama at home from my grandma dying that was fine! I gained more weight from drinking but about 20 pounds which was totally healthy. My best friend and I started fighting a lot. A was there for me which was cool. Around that time my grandma died and I was in the middle of a class I couldnt leave so I shoved down those feelings. Then I did it again and again until I didnt care. I partied more and started being more out with my sexuality since I realized and accepted that I was a lesbian. I had to hear about how people thought that my ex ruined me so much that I hated men. I came out to A one time when I was drunk and she was really supportive. I actually started going on a couple dates with a girl but I was nervous to have sex with her and I told A that. She said we could experiment together and I laughed at the thought of it and she insisted. I was like were friends and you have a boyfriend and then the subject changed. When I saw her a again we were drinking and she kept making my drinks strong. I told her I felt like the room was spinning and I didnt know what to do. She told me to drink more. Her boyfriend was there too so I really wasnt worried about her still wanting to hook up with me. I went to low down in the guest room and she came in and asked to watch a movie with me so we did but I was too tired and said I was going to sleep. She called me lame and whatever. She left and her boyfriend was asleep so she came back and hugged me good night in the bed then she kissed me and stuck her hand down my pants and she raped me. I cried afterward and she made me show her my vagina. I left in the morning hungrier than Ive ever been. Thats were the binge eating disorder started I think. I fought it, became underweight again and all that then I found out my mom had breast cancer. I said screw it and binged the whole day and havent really stopped until a few months ago. My mom lived my parents were always crying and busy trying to sell my grandmas house and I was alone. I started purging and using laxatives. Then in my vulnerability I got into a relationship with my boss who then sexually assaulted me on several occasions. But her place was a way to escape my house. And it was hard to find other lesbians so it worked. I gained about 20 pounds in the time. And god she didnt let it go either and always said I ate so much. I had to quit my job and then the binging got so much worse. My parents always were upset with me it seemed because I was never home. And New Years eve that year I was almost raped again at a party by an ex of mine. There it is. Ive never been to get all of that off my chest. Im doing much better now but still fighting bulimia, the best coping method I have right now. Its so hard to get over all of that and Im still fighting it everyday. "
522,vulnerability,offmychest,Chairing a meeting-AA style,2,8jh71f,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8jh71f/chairing_a_meetingaa_style/,2018-05-15 10:13:44,"Just got back from the gym after I chaired an AA meeting. For those who are unfamiliar to chair a meeting basically means you have been asked by the secretary of the meeting(the person in charge) to share your story. As we like to say, our experience,strength, and hope. Last week I was asked to do it and I kind if just fell into it. I was making conversation with the secretary and asked ""who is going to chair next week?"" He had nobody lined up yet so he asked me. I didn't really want to do it but it is a principle that you should say ""yes"" to the program. So I kind of begrudgingly said ok. Why was I hesitant? Well, a certain part of me, the part that likes to make excuses says it was because I don't want to make a big deal out of my life. That the whole point of recovery is to realize that whatever you went through is not that big of a deal, that you, are not that big of a deal. We need to focus more on other people and less on ourselves. Well, this sounds fine and dandy but the reality is that I was nervous. I was not really comfortable being very open with my life. Chairing a meeting requires honesty and vulnerability. It requires looking into your past and acknowledging where you went wrong. It requires sharing your struggles. It gets very personal and can leave you feeling very exposed. If you are not comfortable with yourself, with your journey it is overwhelming. Luckily, I have done this before and I have the experience to draw on. I knew what parts to leave out. There are some parts, like for example, my sexual history that if shared would have a tendency to get people stuck on that aspect of my life. They might walk away focusing on some juicy sexual exploits and while I have some tabloid worthy exploits that's not what I want to leave people with, so I left out some details. I did focus on my struggles in relationships, however. I got vulnerable and talked about how fearful I was in relationships. How I was dysfunctional in relationships, how I used to be very angry and yelled a lot. How I couldn't hold along term relationship, basically out of fear. I was never honest about my fear back in the days, I just basically turned my fear into anger and directed it at the women I dated. It was very childish and very toxic. I also talked openly about my social anxiety growing up. I talked about how I focused on my challenges and this made me angry and I learned anger from my father, who is a ragealholic. I learned to walk on eggshells and became very fearful of expressing discontent socially because I didn't know that people could have disagreements without it being taken to a very volatile level. In my relationships, I became volatile, it seemed like a safe place to vent, I suppose. It was learned behavior. I also talked about being able to acknowledge the good in my life. I am gifted in some areas. I have an excellent recall of detail. I am awesome at naming people who were in movies or tv shows. I also scored in the top 1% in the nation in math in highschool although I rarely studied. I was a C student in most of my math classes but when the sat's came I would score in the top 1% in the nation. Also because of my anxieties I developed a twisted sense of discipline and that discipline led to me being a somewhat accomplished long distance runner earlier in my adult life. I have ran a marathon, 3 half marathons and took part in several races ranging some 5k some 10k a very well known 12k a few times, a 10 miler etc. I always did well because of that ability to endure and the discipline I had developed in an attempt to control my life. ANyhow I guess I just needed to be open and honest and tap into the better me today. I needed to tap into the me that comes from a place of acceptance, a place of gratitude, a place of emotional honesty, a place of vulnerability in the hopes that perhaps I was being of service to another alcoholic, there were like 15 in the room. Anyhow, glad I did it."
523,vulnerability,offmychest,Went too far with a girl. I feel disgusted and disappointed with myself [NSFW].,2,8jsc24,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8jsc24/went_too_far_with_a_girl_i_feel_disgusted_and/,2018-05-16 14:56:37,"To provide some background information, were both in our mid-twenties and met on a dating app. Weve have been talking for the last few weeks and have met up once previously where we both had an enjoyable time. Last week, I convinced her to take the train to an area near me so we can meet up after work. Its a little far for her so I promised to drive her home afterwards. It began as a repeat of our first date with food and conversation (but with a little more physical chemistry). After about two hours, we get into my car and I kiss her. We start making out and I reach under her clothes. Theres some hesitation on her part when I put my hand down her pants and between her legs, but she was enjoying it (or at least aroused) based on her verbal and physical reaction over a few minutes. I asked if she wanted to go further and she said it was too soon. She tells me to drive her home, but we can stop by a lake near her apartment with a nice view on the way there. We get to the lake. We walk around briefly, but it was cold and breezy so we ended up just cuddling for a bit before going back to my car. She sits on my lap and I put my hand between her legs again. Theres a lot of moaning and squirming. I try to take her pants off, but she stops me. We start kissing again and I guide her hand down my pants. She goes along with it and even tells me Im a soft kisser. I push her head down a little and she stops me. Ill never forget the vulnerability in her large brown eyes as she told me it was too much, too soon and she didnt feel comfortable. I stop. I feel guilty. I feel like I violated her. I asked if this was it between us and she said I think you know the answer already. I start to drive her home. On the way back to her apartment, she told me not to feel bad about it. She told me about her previous boyfriends who cheated on her and abused her physically/emotionally. She told me Im sweet, good looking and adorable. She mades me get out of the car and hug her. We kiss each other on the cheek and say goodbye. She texted me afterwards to make sure I got home safely. I told her we wont talk again, but Im grateful for the time we spent together and how amazing of a person she is. She said we can still be friends and I can text her whenever were in the same area. I didnt respond. Its been almost a week and Im not sure if its forgiveness or closure, but something is missing. "

525,vulnerability,offmychest,Today I got friend-zoned for the first time.,2,8kx08t,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8kx08t/today_i_got_friendzoned_for_the_first_time/,2018-05-21 10:58:07,"Today, I got friend-zoned for the first time. Let's call the 'zoner' Andy. I met Andy on Bumble and we had a very slow and steady build to our relationship. Each of us were divorced with children. He's 32. I'm 26. He is a genuinely wonderful man. Polite, intelligent, hard working, respectful, and most of all - a great father. I adored him. I do adore him. This weekend he spent the evening with me and we became intimate for the first time. We proceeded to be intimate three more times. The forth time we were laying in bed in post orgasmic bliss and I could tell he was thinking. Andy's a quiet guy. He doesn't share his emotions and is overall a man of few words when it comes to feelings. I questioned what was on his mind and to my surprise he opened up. His ex... she was on his mind. And he still cared. Tears filled his eyes and the pain he'd kept hidden for two years after his divorce came pouring through. She had left him after cheating and his heart was still broken. I sat and listened as he broke through his silent demeanor and allowed me to be with him in all of his vulnerability. I held him as he cried, laid with him as he gathered his thoughts and put them into words. It was one of the hardest things I've done; to lay in the presence of a man I'd fallen for and listen to him explain to me how he was still in love with someone else. Selfishly I didn't want him to feel that way. But I had felt that way before. I have had a broken heart. And I knew in that moment he no longer needed me as a partner, but rather as a friend. So that's what I became. I swallowed my pride and selfish desires and realized that his friendship and overall happiness meant more to me than our potential relationship. I managed to hold back tears until he left. I somehow found the strength to smile and reassure him that I was in no way upset with him for feeling the way he did. I'm truly not mad at all. I'm sad only for myself- because I feel jealous that another woman gets his love and she's taking it for granted. I hugged him goodbye, wished him well, and promised him my arms, door, and ears are always open. Then I cried. I cried over the loss of what could have been. I cried over unmeant potential. I cried because I liked him and my selfish heart hurt a little. And when I was finished feeling how I felt, I dried my eyes and realized I was still okay. I have a lovely home, a great job, a healthy beautiful child, and now - a new friend. The only thing I lost today was a hypothetical 'what could have been'. What I gained today was someone's trust, an important friendship, and the strength and maturity to find that a bruised heart is not a broken heart - and it's completely okay to trip and fall without someone catching you. The heart is such a funny thing. It can be self-serving or self-sacrificing. It can fuel anger, jealousy, sadness, patience, empathy, and incomparable happiness. It is ever changing, evolving with each experience it's used within. A heart, like a mind and body will mature with time. I discovered today that my heart is willing to accept pain at the expense of someone else's needs. My heart can give me strength in times when I, quite literally, feel weak. My heart is evolved enough to realize holding someone within it is a selfless act. Affection, in any form, is not a payment. No one owes you anything simply because you care about them. They do not owe you their time, their presence, and most of all - their equal adoration of you. You don't get to demand affection from someone simply because you have a fondness for them. It is not easy to allow a friendship to blossom where the seeds of a relationship were first planted. It's tempting to rip the friendship away, like a weed, and wait patiently hoping the relationship will still take root and bloom. As an avid gardener, I am fully aware that the plant with the strongest roots will always be the one that eventually takes the light. When you step back with patience and acceptance of nature's way- you'll find the blessing of discovering which of the two seeds was truly the strongest. And either way, something will grow - something beautiful and strong. Something that earned it's place in your garden. Simply because a relationship died does not mean you should hate the friendship that grew in its place. Those strong roots are likely to produce much more than the weaker roots of the relationship ever could have. So, today I got friend-zoned, but I also discovered a brand new seedling growing where my hopes of a blossoming relationship were planted. I don't view my lack of a relationship as misfortune. The only misfortune would have been if I ripped up and threw out the friendship - and was left with a bare plot of dirt instead. So, I'll let myself feel sad over the loss of a relationship, but I will also let myself feel grateful for a new friendship. Life is much too short to live without a full garden."
526,vulnerability,offmychest,I don't think I am deserving of love,1,8m2kfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8m2kfa/i_dont_think_i_am_deserving_of_love/,2018-05-26 01:21:09,"TW: mention of sexual assault I kind of suck at interpersonal relationships and only really noticed it relatively recently. I'm a decently attractive nineteen year old girl who has never been in a relationship and who has a habit of making new friends and then having a falling out with said friends; I only really have 2 good friends I've stayed friends with for a long period of time. Recently, I recognized this pattern and I had an epiphany that the reason that I'm so bad at keeping friends/relationships is that I put up these walls around myself, hate to show true vulnerability, and have a tendency to sabotage any healthy relationships I do manage to form. I think part of it has to do with my relationship with my dad; I admittedly have some pretty complex daddy issues that I worked on in therapy for years. My parents never really loved each other and only got married because my mom was pregnant with my brother; I can't remember ever seeing my parents kiss or even act affectionately towards one another. My parents separated when I was eleven and divorced when I was twelve. My father, at the very least, had an emotional affair with a vile woman he started dating shortly after the separation, but I have my suspicions that it may have been more than just an emotional affair. He moved an hour away from home and built a new life for himself that didn't involve my brothers and I. He had weekend visitation every other weekend and was emotionally abusive towards me. I absolutely hated seeing him and stopped going when I was fifteen. I still maintain contact with my father (he's better now), but it's minimal and on some level, I still resent him for how he treated me. I went to therapy my junior and senior years of high school for a variety of reasons and I thought it was helping and I was better, but my freshmen year of college, I realized that this wasn't the case. In high school, I had been extremely shy around boys- I didn't even have my first kiss until the end of my senior year of high school. I lost my virginity in the back seat of a car to a guy I met off tinder 2.5 weeks before going off to college just because I wanted to get it over with and because I didn't want to be a virgin in college. When I went off to college, I kind of lost myself- I think I was trying to fill this emptiness I felt inside because I thought that what I was doing would make me happy. I started drinking heavily, going to frat parties, smoking a considerate amount of weed, and fucking/fooling around with guys I met at parties. I didn't have any real friends; the first friend group I made at school did some questionable things, but they weren't bad people. I hooked up with a guy who was friends with my friends and he ghosted me shortly after. I wound up alienating myself from them when I got drunk and talked shit about my one friend behind her back. I also told a guy friend who was friends with the guy who ghosted me that I wished I had never slept with his friend. They phased me out and it hurt, but I moved on. I quickly became very good friends with this one girl who's in a club I'm in. I was constantly terrified of fucking up our friendship because I'm not good with other people's feelings and I'm honestly not that good at being a good friend. Our friendship lasted five months. I could tell it was doomed when second semester, this one girl (who none of my other friends like) transferred to our college second semester and our duo became a trio; I've never really been someone who was good at being friends with in a friend group and I could tell that the dynamic between the three of us wasn't a good one. The new girl was a fake, braggy person who my friend idolized. We wound up having a falling out after my friend and I had a fight because I got mad at them for wanting to ditch me to go to this one frat party;a month prior to this, I had been been sexually assaulted (not raped) while drunk by a member of this frat and did not want to go to this party because I knew he would be there and I didn't want to be anywhere near him. I've gotten closer to a group of good quality friends I've been friends for a while, but I'm terrified of fucking up and having a falling out with them too; I've noticed that I have a tendency to burn through friends and find reasons not to be friends with someone and I think part of it has to do with me subconsciously thinking that I am not deserving of friendship. That I am not deserving of people who care about me. When it comes to guys, I fear commitment and being vulnerable. I instinctively don't view myself as a person deserving of someone who loves them. I have had plenty of one-night stands and I feel more comfortable fucking guys than going on a date with a guy. In fact, I have never been on a date. In fact, I am fucking terrified of going on a date with someone. I've been asked out before and I always say no or make an excuse. I've been talking to the same cute guy I met off of tinder since February via snapchat and hooked up with him in April, but I don't even have this guy's fucking number. I think I'm too scared to ask for it because I fear rejection. Our conversations are superficial at best and I don't even really know why I'm still in contact with him. We only ever hit each other up at 2 AM on weekends/ when one of us was drunk, bored, or a combination of both. I can tell he's phasing me out; this last week or so, he's cut back on how much he snapchats me and I can honestly say that deep down, I'm kind of relieved because I didn't want to get too invested. I want to change. I want to open myself up to people. I feel like I'm always faking it with friends and like whenever I get close to someone, there's a piece of me missing in how I interact with them and they see it. I just feel so lonely and I don't know what to do or where to even start."
527,vulnerability,offmychest,I left a guy because he reminded me of my ex.,1,8mgd33,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8mgd33/i_left_a_guy_because_he_reminded_me_of_my_ex/,2018-05-27 17:39:12,"My last relationship was about six months ago. It broke my heart. My biggest issue was the fact that he had a hard time communicating his feelings with me; he had put up a guard and struggled to be vulnerable. In turn, I was always an emotional mess during conflict, complaining that I wasn't being understood, while he'd remain cold. I need a partner that is emotionally compatible. I recently met a guy that I really enjoy being around. He was perfect, aside from the fact that I'd spot a trait or two that resembled my earlier issues. He was definitely not as mean or cold as my last boyfriend, but he had difficulty in understanding my anxious manner or lows of insecurity. He thought logically and without emotion most times. Though we hadn't gotten into any serious fights, we had one argument about a relationship I had in the past. He responded with hostility at first, but then showed vulnerability and understanding at the end. He said all the right things but that really reminded my of my last boyfriend. After a few days I broke it off- he was confused. I told him the truth and he was upset. I find myself doubting my decision every now and then since I broke things off. He was really cool, and I know I'm emotional and fragile as hell. It's not a flaw to not understand my emotional tendencies, nothing was really wrong with him, but I probably need someone who understands and relates just a little bit. For general harmony and concord within my relationship. I hate how I'm so attracted to this very type but find myself seeing later that it never works out. "
528,vulnerability,offmychest,I still have feelings(?) for someone who screwed me over.,2,8ng7ue,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8ng7ue/i_still_have_feelings_for_someone_who_screwed_me/,2018-05-31 16:33:35,"I'm just going to tell the entire story start to finish and finally be honest about it. A while ago I became very close friends with a guy, we'll call him J. It was during our 3 month break at the end of the year from school, so we essentially had no responsibilities and had endless free time. As you can imagine, we became very close, and I eventually developed feelings for him and loved him a lot. I knew he didn't have a great reputation with girls, but obviously as I had not been subjected to that side of him, it was easy to brush off. Now would be a good time to mention that I have never, ever liked someone before. Not even a crush, nothing, nada, zilch. It became a running joke that I would be single forever among my friends, and I honestly didn't really have a problem with it because the idea of romance and all that honestly repulsed me a little. But fast forward, and here I am in love with this guy. As all good things must come to an end, when the break was over, we found out we were going to universities across the country from each other. He had told me he had feelings for me too and I cried a lot when I moved away. The first two months were hell, I constantly cried and we still talked a lot, but it was getting so bad because I was scared about a lot of things. I was living alone for the first time, I didn't love the city I moved to, I had no friends, no family. And I struggled a lot with J because I still loved him but we obviously could not date and I would have to come to terms with that. When we were back home for the mid semester break, I found out that he had been flirting a little with my best friend who told me, and there were just other not great things. We blew up at each other because we obviously had different ideas about what was okay or not. He claimed we were never dating, which we never were, so it wasn't that bad, but eventually apologised and said it was wrong. He's done a lot of shady shit like that, skirting lines because we aren't ""technically anything"". He has admitted he hurts girls and he is sorry for it, but just ends up doing shit because he isn't committed, so if a girl has feelings for him (which many do), he always hurts them by not reciprocating or when he eventually hooks up with other people because he is not interested in dating. I stopped talking to him for a while, but we started talking again because we always seem drawn back to each other. We've tried so many times to cut contact but we never can. As of now, I do not have feelings per se, but I have a soft spot for him. We are very close friends, even though I know it's probably a bad idea. He tells me about girls at his uni and his hookups and I don't really care what he does with girls, but I am scared that when he does date, it will still hurt me. Yesterday night he told me that back when I first moved and was doing pretty badly and was still in love with him, he hooked up with a girl I knew and lied to me about it. And I've just been feeling so shit about it because while if it happened now, I wouldn't care so much, but the fact that it was back then just stings pretty bad. I know he doesn't like hearing about me hookup and about guys, and we kind of feel that way about each other. Now to get a little more personal. I've always been afraid of failure, since as young as I can remember. I've always cared about coming first, it wasn't about a personal best, it was about being THE best. I came first in everything when I was a child, I was the smartest, the brightest. I was the best. I got into one of the top high schools in the country, and when I was accepted, I started slacking because I couldn't deal with the pressure of winning all the time anymore. When it came to my final year of high school, I didn't try. I was so fucking afraid of trying and failing that it paralysed me. I slacked pretty damn badly, but by some miracle, I scraped into medical school (Not USA so there are undergraduate pathways), and to give an example of how much I hate failure, I didn't for a SECOND celebrate making it in, I just immediately felt self hatred for not making it into J's school, or a school where I lived so I didn't have to move away. I fucking got into medicine without really trying too much and I still berated myself for months for not making it into a ""more convenient one"". So to bring this back to J, I feel like I failed. I feel like I've been trying my whole life to be the best, to win, to attain what I want. And him being the sole person I've ever had feelings for him, hearing the shit he pulled makes me feel like I failed. And that even all of the vulnerability I poured out to him, and to no one else before him, was just not good enough. And it wasn't enough to stop him hooking up, fucking around. It wasn't enough to make him care and I don't know how to deal with it. We've talked and he has apologised, and I don't really care about his apologies. I try to keep an emotional distance and keep our conversation pretty lighthearted and jokey, but theres something deeper between us and I'm not sure if it always will be there. I just feel shit today after finding out he hooked up during that time where I still had feelings, and it keeps reinforcing in my head that I wasn't good enough or that I wasn't the girl that was worth it. It feels like I've been losing my whole life, and finally when I was vulnerable enough with another human in a romantic way, I lost again. And it fucking hurts."
529,vulnerability,offmychest,I have never really felt lonely in my life,1,8nu9uh,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8nu9uh/i_have_never_really_felt_lonely_in_my_life/,2018-06-02 04:31:05,"I assume that's not normal. I'm an introvert and I really enjoy spending my time alone. I've been alone most of my life, and I think I've become emotionally immune to loneliness. I have truly, honestly never felt or thought to myself ""I wish I wasn't alone. I wish someone was here with me right now."" Because I'm at peace being alone, with no one to disturb me. I'm not socially inept, mind you - I'm a bit awkward on bad days, yes, but I can generally act social and hold conversations, since that's necessary for work and all that. Occasionally I even enjoy such social interactions. But I get drained quite quickly and retreat into myself. When I can finally hole myself up at home, ignore all my texts (not that I get many) and relax, I am truly at peace. Never once have I desired to have people around me. In fact, I suspect I would find that rather frustrating and irritating. I've been in love maybe once in my life, a long time ago. Even then I suspect it was just a silly infatuation. Once things started to get serious I realised I wasn't able to handle it and broke things off. From time to time I wish I could experience intimacy but I realise it's futile and often empty. I'd much rather be alone than hurt someone else, and hurt myself. I'm a little scared. I feel like if I carry down this path it might lead me to a very dark place. I suspect that it's unnatural and unhealthy. But it's too late now. Between my fear of intimacy and vulnerability and my inabilty to feel loneliness I've resigned myself to a life (and death) of solitude. It's a bit sad but hey, what can I do. That's me."

They seem so supremely over-reassuring and way too expensive and how the heck should a celebration with invitations for people I barely even know be made? I don't want one. I like watching the vulnerability of the people involved and I am sincerely happy for those who do the tradition if they find it fitting to let the entire world know of their love involving governments and bowing down to regime and money and currency and standards beauty (even the makeup process is filmed, making all brides look the same). Why should there be a white dress involved? I am not a virgin. I barely understand my own family members and they do not all get along with one another...why should I have to torture them with an event that could legally intertwine me as well as legally erase me from the man's life altogether as well? Especially since I fall in love with such unlikely characters who have no interest in knowing me...what would be proven irrelevent when I am constantly called a boring and phony individual? I fell in love with a gay man at one point in my life and fell out of love with him entirely ,and now a married older individual---at least he was when I met him four years ago--- so now I can't even have the slightest interest in anyone else. What is ever going to make my way of being normal and acceptable? I want to be naked at all costs. I want to not have to ever worry. I want to not be attached. I want to be loved unconditionally and for neither of us to have to work for any form of government. I want solace with a partner. So, in which case if I ever do end up finding myself in the arms of The One, why would I ever want to let anyone know? For it to all be taken away? I would only want my parents there. His parents, perhaps siblings and now as I am writing this I realize just how many people have entered my life since my conception. Most of the relationships are short-lasting and headache-inducing. There is no open land here. I live in a world where a wedding would be a statement of riches flowing from the garden of barbaric selfishness. I do not come from such sort of roots, although the more I learn about my bloodline from grandparents the more I realize that there actually ARE reasons why I am here. Let's head back to my original reasoning. Why would I want to have a wedding if I fall in love in a shameful and selfish way? I have no control over the lower half of my body in love, so what would make a man think that I would want this tragedy of my inability to stay in one place an exhibited convention for all to enjoy? They are embarrassing to be in, hard to properly participate in, devouring of all forces for survival, and unnatural glory of powerful money-gods who have to show off their kingdoms. I do not want this fake carp. I need a real love, a suit-thrower-awayer. I hate formal looks and stupid ties. I do not want to get married. I just want an eternal love. "

Either somebody is going to snap and there will be domestic violence charges and a divorce, or those kids are going to continue to grow up enduring an abusive mother and an absentee father. Either way, I don't want to get involved because I'd rather avoid being bludgeoned to death with a hammer or screamed at. Put it this way, I got involved once and I'd never go there again. I feel as if it's a constant blaring reminder of why I should never settle down and start a family. I think it's truly awful what can happen when things go wrong in a relationship, especially when finances and kids are involved, and it seems they so often do. Is it worth even risking that happening in the first place? For what ultimate reward, and why would any sane person strive to be in that position of vulnerability? These are the questions that run through my mind when I think: Maybe I should meet a girl, give it a go. Yeah, right. TLDR - Neighbor's abusive and avoidant relationship problems beginning to affect morale. Not sure how well they or their kids must be doing in comparison."

We live together, weve been through nearly everything with one another except having kids. He offers a type of comfort and wholeness that I thought was impossible. I didnt believe in soul mates until him. Its a bond that is forged by so much more than young infatuation. He is my rock and I am his. He is a thousand miles away for two months. We speak often, but cant see each other. Ive made it a month, keeping myself busy. Im starting to panic when Im alone now. It feels as though my entire heart is out in the open and vulnerable. If anything were to happen to him it would alter my life forever. I dont want to sound melodramatic. Everyone around usdespite our agesays our relationship is something most people never experience. When we let people in to see us as a couple they are astounded by our trust, communication, and adoration of each other. I know that our love is deep and real, I know that I want spend the rest of my life with this man. I want to struggle, fail, succeed, laugh, everything with this man. It makes me feel so vulnerable. I fear being able to function if he were gone. We have separate lives. We arent codependent, so its not as though I dont have things that make me happy outside of him. He is what makes me happiest though, Im afraid of that vulnerabilityas is he. "

Im so over being alive, I have no desire to continue. If there was an off button Id have pressed it a long time ago. Im not suicidal on account of the fact that I dont want to chance worsening a situation that I already dont like but goddamn I wish I could just pass from this world. I dont want to know what happens tomorrow, I dont want to know whats around the corner. The fact that it could always be worse is purely oppressive. This has been me for at least 5-6 years now but the recent passing of my grandmother has really done a number on any desire I had left. Not because I cant deal with the idea of death but because of how she treated people and how she ended up being treated in the end, it represents something about the world that is deeply upsetting to me. Long story short, I have an uncle who she extended every kindness to. He slandered her, he stole from her, he damaged her property etc. repeatedly and right up until she passed away. She was never anything but there for him and all he ever did was take advantage of it. The thing that bothers me about this is that he is completely shielded from the guilt that he should -by any right measure- feel, on account of the fact that he never had any moral scruples to begin with. WHAT KIND OF FUCKED UP BULLSHIT IS THAT? YOU GET TO STEAL AND CHEAT AND LIE AND YOU ALSO GET TO BE DELUDED ENOUGH TO NEVER HAVE TO PAY FOR IT? WHAT THE FUCK CAN BE SAID TO SOMEONE WHO DOESNT ALREADY CARE TO MAKE THEM CARE? IT IS FUCKING PERVERTED. On the flip side, any commitment to being basically ethical of necessity leaves you open to be taken advantage of constantly and with no recourse. Ethical people are patient and considerate, they give the benefit of the doubt and extend a helping hand. Every part of ethical behavior requires vulnerability and leaves you open to endless exploitation. I dont want to participate in this fucking garbage ass life. "
536,vulnerability,offmychest,My boyfriend pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography,3,8cqlbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8cqlbf/my_boyfriend_pleaded_guilty_to_possession_of/,2018-04-17 06:08:43,"I love my boyfriend dearly, and he (from what I can tell) has been nothing but open and honest with me throughout our entire relationship. The court case has been an ongoing ordeal, that we have talked about in great length. Although be has plead guilty to this crime, I don't think he is a bad person. I guess the easiest way to explain why is to tell you the whole story, as it was told to me. When my bf was younger (16~ years old) he had an unusual friendship with his friend's younger sister. Unusual in the fact that there was such an age gap between them, and how close they were. According to him nothing physical/ sexual ever happened between them, but they were very close. During this time he began to worry that he was some kind of a pedophile, because he was so interested in his friend, and not girls his own age. This really upset him. He grew apart from his friend and over the next few years he spent a lot of time thinking about this, kept a journal about his feelings, discussed it with close friends, and tried to distance himself from being around young girls. He was in a couple of relationships (with women his own age), but although he was attracted to women, he was still worried that he was still attracted to girls, and that something was wrong with him. This went on for a couple of years, but at a certain point he felt that he knew himself well enough to trust himself. He was attracted to women, and would never act on any attraction to an underage girl. He also told me that he was much less attracted to underage girls that he was when he was younger. A few years ago, after coming to this realization, he started a relationship with with someone I will call B. The first couple of years of their relationship were happy, but then things changed. They were in a long distance relationship, and when my bf got busy with work and school, and as he put it ""did not put enough time into his relationship"" B assumed that he was cheating on her. This led to a year of her surveiling him, and trying to find evidence of his cheating. Although she never found evidence of that, she did find old emails between bf and close friends, about these unsettling feelings that he had. Also, when he was out of town, he let her stay in his apartment, and she found hand written letters containing the same, as well as the old journal, and an old hard drive from a family computer. These hard drives were given to my bf by his brother after they junked the old family pc, and as per bf he used the computer when he lived with his family, but didn't do anything with the hard drive. It (actually there were several old drives) were sitting in a drawer and he had never looked at what was on them. After finding all of these things B thought that bf was a pedophile, and was molesting children. She took all of these things, the letters, emails, hard drive etc, and gave them to the police. And he was arrested (there was a ~6 month gap between when B trashed his apartment, took his things, gave them to the police, and broke off all contact with him and when he got arrested, we started dating during that time). They never found any evidence of him molesting children, or any of the other the other thins she accused him of, but the old hard drive from his family computer contained CP. He says that they were old internet cache files. He says that although he doesn't remember the files, he may have seen them back when he was questioning his sexuality. So he is arrested for this, hires a lawyer, pays the lawyer a TON of money. After I heard his version of what happened I, naively maybe, thought that the case would be dropped, once the police had gone through his possessions (they took his phone computer, etc, and found no illegal pictures). At his lawyer's advice he's gone to support groups, and to see a psychiatrist, to try to prove that he is not a danger to anyone. At his lawyer's urging my bf has plead guilty to possession of CP. If he had gone to court, and was convicted of possession of CP, bf would have gone to jail for at least 6 months, and would have been put on the sex offenders registry. Because he has plead guilty, the judge can decide on what he will be sentenced with, because he has not been convicted of anything. Best case scenario he gets some probation, and a record that will be removed after a few years. Worst case, jail and the registry. And the judge is going to decide this based on the psychologists report, the evidence, B's victim impact statement, and bf's apology. I plan on going to the sentencing, to be there to morally support my bf, but also to see the evidence presented against him, to make sure that it lines up with what he has told me. Although I knew about the court case, I guess I didn't think things would go this far, or that he would actually end up getting punished for this. The files on the harddrive are over 10 years old. I guess I thought at most he'd have to see a court appointed therapist or something, not end up in prison. Maybe he's been lying to me. Maybe he is some sort of dangerous person, and I'm just too stupid to realize it. But I really don't think so. I feel so scared and alone. I've told a couple of friends about everything that's happening, but not many. After seeing that post a couple of days ago on TwoXChromosones about the woman who's boyfriend was just arrested for CP, and seeing all of the responses telling her that she should break up with him, and how she could never trust him, I kept trying to convince myself that my case was different. It is in some ways, but in a lot of ways it's not. Building a life together is going to be very difficult. If he ends up being put on the registry, finding a job or a place to live is going to be very difficult. He'll probably have to work dead end minimum wage jobs for the rest of his life. He went to school for something in the medical field, and regardless of what his sentence is he won't be able to do what he was trained to, there's no way he could pass the vulnerability sector screening. But he's really smart and motivated, I was prepared for years of paying off the lawyer debt, and him finding a new career path, and taking a while to get established, but I don't know how to process something that is never going to go away. And I know that I will have to explain things to my friends and family, especially before I bring him around any friends who have children. But it just seems so much worse now that he's plead guilty. I guess I never considered how many friends I could potentially lose. I guess it's just becoming clear to me how much I might have to give up by staying with him, and I know that that makes me a horrible person. I feel so bad for him, and I want nothing more for all of this to just okay away, and to be able to start a life with him. But what if it doesn't, and what if we can't?"

but i never just viewed you as someone i have romantic/sexual interest in. as i'd explain it to anybody else, i love you as my friend, but if you and i were at the right time in our lives to be together, i wouldn't say no. i've told you as much. these past 5 years have told me as much. you are incredibly important to me. remember when we first became friends and you actually asked me upfront instead of gradually getting closer? or remember when you first liked that guy who turned out to be a creep? remember when i first kissed you and another girl, then when i first kissed a guy and pondered for some time if i might be a lesbian? remember when you comforted me as i cried about the first person to leave me, instead of me leaving? i've seen you grow from somebody so awkward and cringey (i was the same, but instead of awkward, maybe over-confident? haha) to somebody who is full of kindness and compassion and beauty and wisdom. but it's happened again - somebody i love leaving me instead of me leaving. truth be told, you already left a long time ago. we both just chose (maybe subconsciously) to ignore it. back in december, this february, and for sure, this april. and now that i've waited this long, i think i'm ready to leave too. when i told you i was, your boyfriend told me you were hurting and it was my fault, along with other people. but you told me you couldn't blame me, that i had the right to feel what i feel. yet somehow, as pathetic as it may seem, i expected you to fight a little harder for our friendship. you said you thought we were different, right? that i wouldn't leave like the others did. but i think you've always given me too much credit. because while i love you and my loyalty hardly wavers, the thing is, i have always loved myself more. i feel stupid waiting for you to come around, after i've watched you pick someone else over all your friends who have been here longer and through more than him. i feel stupid loving somebody who claims to love me and yet can't return my texts for days on end, can't talk to me until 2 weeks are past, can't even go to my birthday. i would've understood, you know, if i was the only one with these hurt feelings. but your ex boyfriend hurt your other friends, and has hurt you continuously, and it took THIS LONG for you to break up with him. after everything's been done, been said, and it's too late for me to say i'm over my sadness and disappointment with the choices you've made. seriously. i would've understood you taking him back if you and him were the only ones involved in this story, but it isn't. there were so many more people. you often tell these people it's not their business, but he involved them, so. they have every right to speak, honestly. i guess my words on the relationship has no value anymore, after all, you're broken up. but i can't look past the decisions you've both made while you were in it, effectively losing so many of us along the way. please just know that i love you and i will keep loving you until i run out of it. and if i still love you when i get over all my feelings of being betrayed, and if you also still love me by then, then maybe we can be friends again. but no dead flower can grow back again the same way it did before. and PS, i know you know my reddit account. so if you've come across this and you wanna talk, it's okay. please talk to your mom and your sister a lot, they love and care for you unconditionally. i know it's been hard believing that lately, but i've known them for as long as ive known you, and from what ive seen they mean the best for you. you've got a wonderful family, and you've got a wholesome heart. and i'm sorry."

I dont know why my mind is wanting to focus on good things when theres the bigger picture, reality at that. Of course, why would the mind want to focus on the brutal truth when the nicer things are much easier to consume. Gotta be the stronger person like always, put on a straight face, but, oh, dont you cry or let those powerful emotions consume you. Dont have time for that nor is it productive! Not like they kick in that often, fairly rarely until the past week. You cant be that person who legitimately experiences emotions, now can you? Thatd be against your brick\-wall image that you constantly project. All seriousness, no emotions, just pure, realistic, brutal, logic being shoved down everyones throats, even your own. When you come off as that realistic and optimistic, it surely blindsides people when you uncover more and more of yourself, the real troubles and then theyre shocked. Like, Holy fuck, didnt realize you have THAT many problems. Yeah, I do a pretty fine ass job at concealing it, dont I? Shame that what I just opened up to you about isnt even all of it! Hell, even going for peoples jugulars once you get that kick of random adrenaline and anger, being part of the suppressed emotions and numbness. No fuck mentality, yep, thats what I call it. AKA, I have no mercy, so for the love of God, dont you even try to pull shit and this is time to shove your own shit in your face and down your throat, so you cant fuck with people and think you can get away with it. Sure, sure, sureeeee. Moms concerned at this point from what I opened up about certain thoughts and since when Ive cried lately \[and whenever really for the last couple of years\], its just a straight face, not even wincing because if Im going to cry, I cant show anymore vulnerability than what is already revealed. Which, now in retrospect, is lowkey disturbing. But itll be fine. Psychiatrist on Tuesday, going to get answers, hopefully, in that small span of 30 minutes. Writing down notes, and boy theres quite a bit of them. At least Ill be organized. To have that legitimate feeling where you feel like you cant open up to people or even go to anyone about your stuff is pretty isolating. Whats even worse is when you actually cant understand your own mind! So then, youre just sitting there trying to figure out whether or not you have something that is undiagnosed or its shit overlapping. I didn't pull Vixen out of my ass, it was chosen for a reason back then. I really am a spiteful and quarrelsome woman."

I have these moments where I have an epiphany, and words just spew out of me. Truth spews everywhere. And so I write. My intention was to post this on social media, but I know most people can't handle it. I shared it with a few close friend and my therapist, but it's been sitting in my phone waiting to be read and understood. Still to scared to actually share with the people in my circle my true story, so here it is: Loneliness is a funny concept. Usually, when one thinks someone is lonely, it must be because they're alone. As an introvert, this way of thinking is unnatural to me. When I'm alone, I'm at my prime - I can do anything I want, whenever I want, without judgement. I can be as loud or as quiet as I want to be. I can choose to read, paint, go outside, dance in my living room, watch bad tv, work out (or not work out), eat whatever I want, and say whatever I want. The possibilities are endless, when I'm alone. I belong to myself, when I'm alone. During some of the loneliest moments of my life, I was surrounded by people. I felt different - isolated with my thoughts and feelings, no longer free to express my truth. I experienced loss and grief at a young age. Actually, I experienced three years of loss and grief at a young age, which lead to a domino affect for the rest of my adolescent chapter. My mom went through three miscarriages. I lost three baby siblings. I lost my friends. I watched my family crumble. I lost an entire future. I've been working with a therapist since last summer, deconstructing my behavior patterns and their roots. She specializes in EMDR therapy, a type of therapy created to help those who've experienced past trauma and move through those traumas. But we haven't made it through an entire EMDR session yet, because the pain is too overwhelming. Pain, that I've been carrying with me since I was 12 years old. Pain, that I've pushed down and swallowed repeatedly. Pain, that was so uncomfortable for everyone else, I burdened myself by swallowing all of that pain down in the presence of others. That's when I felt lonely. With my friends at school, who's response to my experience was silence. Or meaningless words. Friends, who complained about cute boys not liking them or popular girls saying mean things. I remember reaching a point in middle school when I could no longer sit through lunch with my ""friends,"" because I no longer felt I could relate to their problems. I didn't care if Jimmy kissed Lucy when he was talking to Katie at the time. I didn't care about Maddie's desire to lose just 5 more pounds. I just didn't care. I knew there were bigger problems in the world to care about, and the more I listened to my friend's problems, the lonelier I felt. The school counselor, who called me into her office because I was literally making 0s in all of my classes. When she asked why and I told her - again, shocked silence. I told her I didn't care about my grades. She moved me from honors classes to regulars. I eventually got my grades up just so she'd stop calling me into her office. I knew if I made her happy, she'd leave me alone. And if I was alone, I was safe to express my pain. I was told by several adults, some familial, to not even tell people what happened. That it would make them too sad to hear about my loss. That my grief, my pain, my loss, made them uncomfortable. I remember thinking, ""my loss and pain, makes THEM feel too uncomfortable to be around ME? Fuck them then."" Because fuck you if you have ever made someone feel like less than a person because they're in a vulnerable place. Vulnerability is NOT a weakness. I remember being criticized and questioned for my feelings - ""I don't understand why that would effect you. They're not even your real siblings"" (they were my half siblings, technically). At some point in high school, I set the intention to be a pathological liar, but it didn't start out that way. It started with the intention of making everyone in my circle around me happy - by telling people what they want to hear, not what they need to hear or what I really wanted to say. Because I just wanted to be left alone, where I can actually be myself. I made good grades. I exchanged in pleasant small talk. I answered my teachers when they called on me in class. If I wasn't with my circle trying to please people, I was sitting in the corner, hiding. Trying to disappear, trying to hide all of my pain. Eventually, the desire to please everyone around me manifested itself in pathological lies. I started experimenting with my diet, interested in a vegetarianism or paleo lifestyle. I was genuinely interested in eating healthy, which isn't usual for a teenager. So, I straight up lied, claiming to have an allergy to this or that all because I didn't want to DEAL with other people's criticisms of MY choices. Can't get mad at someone that won't eat bacon, because they claim it makes them sick. Can't tease someone for not eating a cupcake, if you think it'll make them sick. I hate myself for this, but I carried lies about my eating habits up until a couple of years ago. Going so far as to regurgitate stories of being in the hospital from [gluten/meat/starches] making me sick, which were all true stories, but not my stories. Not my truth. I would convince myself it was the truth, because it happened to somebody I know, so it could happen to me too, right? I like to think I was honest with those closest to me, and only did this with people further from my inner circle - but the lines are blurred between the truth and the lies. I would lie to get out of doing things, because simply saying I didn't want to do something wasn't ""good enough."" My boundaries were weak. My boundaries are still weak, and I'm learning to strengthen them. If you're someone I lied to, please know that I am deeply sorry. I'm sorry I could not show you who I really am. I'm sorry I've been hiding from the world. I'm sorry I wasn't strong enough to be honest with you, or myself. I'm posting this to open myself to all of the pain I've been holding in. Pain I've been holding in since middle school. Pain that has presented itself throughout my life, returning for long stretches of time that make me feel ""stuck."" I tried to be happy on my own, I did all the things you're told to do to feel happy - I exercised regularly (but not too much), I ate healthy (but still enjoyed myself), I made sure I got enough sleep and socialized when I felt like it. But none of it helped. It only made me feel more broken, like I'm doing all the right things to feel happy, but I still feel stuck here.. so something must be wrong with me. My pain has manifested itself in the form of self worth. Consuming my confidence everytime I don't stand up for myself, or don't say what I really think and feel, or don't say no when I don't want to do something. The weight of this pain would pin me down for months at a time, I became so hopeless of ever getting out. There were times I purposefully hurt myself, just to feel something, anything else at all to make me feel alive again. Since my dog passed, my therapist tells me I've ""cracked"" open, like a seed, and now I can truly grow into myself (yeah, like a tree!). A tree can bend and sway, but is deeply rooted into the ground and will not be moved. I want to be like the tree - flexible enough to listen, to hear and see you, but strong enough to stand for what I believe in. To be able to have clear healthy boundaries in ALL of my relationships. To know what I stand for and stay true to that knowledge. We can't avoid conflict. We can't make everyone like us. And that's okay. Because conflict and pain are real, and I'd rather feel something real than pretend to be anything else. So here I am. Vulnerable? Yes. Brave? Maybe. Whether or not you like it, here I am. Most importantly, real. "

The only person who gets to see the real me is me, and this realization just makes my existence feel so lonely.... I just feel this is one of those risks I cannot do, because I will never recover from such a risk. I hope to the lord God that one day, I will just accept the inevitable pain and be able to actually have PHYSICAL BONDS with people.... I have achieved vulnerability through online friends, but it will never be as satisfying to me like reality."
542,vulnerability,offmychest,A slew of nonsensical public oversharing idk help,4,8jglh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8jglh5/a_slew_of_nonsensical_public_oversharing_idk_help/,2018-05-15 08:43:10,"This is so long and so detailed and its crazy to even post this on the internet like someone will understand or help. But there has to be someone out there who relates to these feelings I have all the time. Please tell me how you fixed yourself, if you take the time to read this. Because some screw must be loose inside my head that is making this all feel so difficult. - First and foremost, my life feels stagnant. I feel stuck inside this tiny town, suffocating in the ceaseless routine I follow each and every day. It doesnt seem to mean anything. Why should something so devoid of purpose even matter to me? Sometimes it doesnt. I had potential once. Now I dont. - At the same time, it feels overwhelming. I know to avoid stagnationor reverse itI have to move. I just cant seem to snap out of this fog. I let everything pressing sit until it festers. I let every task, minimal as it is, delay until it lapses. Small things are so much bigger, once you ignore them for so long. It is so much easier to feel afraid of them, once theyve become unmanageable. - I am lost. All around. I have no idea what I want or how to achieve it. Even things I THINK I want feel fleeting and emptymisguided fillers for something deeper or more meaningful. I want to move but everything is so daunting and I am so confused. Half of me is poised to runit is the only thing Ive ever known to incite changebut that change always seems to be reckless and bad. The other half is coiled around itself in one lethargic, defeated loop. The fault line within me is tornat a loss at how to undo the damage done. - My existence is chaos. Everything has spiraled out of my control. Every facet of my life is a mess. I am a landfill poltergeist, and havoc manifests wherever I step. I feel just as dirty as my environment. But I am too many emotions and too little motivationto scrub either one of us clean. - I am depressed...I think. But I havent found a medication that makes it better. Ever since I was a little girl, Ive suffered from derealizationa feeling that Im in a dream, or not quite in my own body. Most medications they give you for depression and anxiety seem to make this feeling 10x worse, or simply make you so tired you cant function. - My brain only seems to operate in extremes. I seem incapable of processing gradual changes or long-term growth. I cant tidy up, I am only able to register deep cleaning. I cant simply improve facets of myself Im unhappy withI am compelled to undress and rebrand myself entirely. Drastic changes only add to my sense of suffocation and internal conflict. Minor changes dont add or subtract anything at all. - I cant understand how I am self-aware when my behavior seems compulsory. I am sick. I say. I cant help it. I remind myself. But this pretty face will not always be enough, for people to sympathize with me. This tortured diatribe will not always suffice, to incite patience and understanding in the people around me. - I am self-deprecating. I hate myself so intensely that sometimes it feels like my skin is trying to tear itself away from the spiteful prison of this skeleton. I could not count the number of instances in which I have considered a barter of these green eyes, for a mind that is less wasteland and more rainforest. I could only venture a guess at how many times I thought I might trade a slim waist for a sense of purpose. - Im lying, of course. Because if I was telling the truth, my first question when confronted with a potential new antidepressant would not be, Will it make me gain weight? Will it sully my porcelain complexion? Will it turn my libido to soot in the chimney of my own desirability? Will it make me less appealing to the opposite sex? Will being happy make me infinitely less fuckable? I need validation, the way a sunburn needs the shade; the way a guillotine needs a politicians head. - I dont manage stressors in a healthy form. Minor inconveniences that most people can just compartmentalize take an unnecessarily major emotional toll on me. For example, someone being rude to meor something small like being late to workwill effectively ruin my entire day. - I seem to have no control over my emotional state. I cycle drastically between dissociated and detached, to angry, to sad, to happy, to excited. These individual emotions can last days or weeks or hoursthere is no rhyme or reason, no predictability to what triggers their onset or duration. - I care massively about what other people think of me. To a debilitating degree. I shape my entire life around seeming like I dont give a fuck, but I care so pathetically much about how I look to the world around me. If a stranger criticizes me on the internet, it will torment me internally for days, normally triggering another obsessive desire to rewire my personality and redress my persona. If a friend or relative enlightens me to a certain unfavorable behavior I am displaying, it will stick with me forever, bringing heat to my cheeks months or years after it is said. This only seems to apply to negative criticism, however. Positive statements from others slide off my shoulders like water. - I feel a lot of guilt for the way my emotional state affects the people around me. A lot of times I overreact or say spiteful things to my boyfriend, and then spend hours in the aftermath feeling terrible about them. I have a way with words, and I know how to make them wound. Sometimes they slip out of my mouth unchecked, and they leave bloody lacerations on the people I direct them to. I formulate thoughtful, heartfelt apologies after the fact. Still, I know it cant always repair the wrong Ive done. I remember similar scenarios with my father, as a child. I struggle with the immense guilt I feel, for ever having torn someone down, when they deserved to be built up. - I cycle between two extremes: zero impulse control and zero ability to make decisions. No matter which polarity my brain lands on, it contributes to my recurrent feelings of guilt and despair. For example, going onto a website to buy one pair of shoes leads to me being torn between five pairs. I will be entirely incapable of choosing between them, and will consequently buy all five. I will then spiral directly into a panic-induced state of distress, over the amount of money I spent. Some days, I wont even give myself time to choose. Ill just sporadically make purchases, and will be immediately consumed with guilt and anger at myself after. - A lot of times, I feel that there simply arent enough hours in the day to do everything I need to do. - When my medication wears off, I am rendered lethargic. This is a natural norm for me, but when my medication wears off, it is exacerbated tenfold. I spend my days at work, somehow simultaneously doing a massive amount of work while and daydreaming about getting my shit together in the process. But by the time I get home at the end of the day, I am burnt out. Theres no room to fit in a transformation as major as the one I want and need. - I cant seem to stick with anything. I make dozens of plans and goals and visions. I make to-do lists and work up budgets and assign myself tasks to unscrew this giant screwy existence I call a life. I start writing a poem or a novel or an essay. I start organizing my wardrobe by outfit or I clean out the infinite reject dumpster I call the floorboard of my car. But I call it quits for a day or a week or an hour and I call it quits forever. I will remember whatever it is, weeks or months later, and repeat the same exhausting process of trying and failing to see it through to completion. I crave consistency...I just cant seem to apply it. - I am irrational, in so many areas. My fears are irrational. My goals are irrational. My expectations are irrational. My reactions are irrational. The way I handle challenges are irrational. - I think of my behavior in terms of spirals. I am very much a spiral, in every aspect. As a child, I developed a bad case of hypochondria, which brought on an associated fear of doctors and medical environments in general. I would spend hours, searching my symptoms on the internet and coming up with life-ending or chronic disorders I was certain that I suffered from but was absolutely stoic in my refusal to get tested for. It would begin innocently enoughnoticing a bruise or feeling a bit lightheaded. Hours later, I would be crying in a corner because painful death was imminent. This is representative of every facet of my life, today. Small things spiral so quickly into big things, in my head. - Socially, Im a train-wreck. I have a huge fear of rejection that is so debilitating I would rather avoid certain social situations altogether than work on improving them. Dating/flirting/parties/hookups involve pre-meditated inebriation on my part, to even consider approaching. My online persona is so drastically different from the meek and quiet creature I am in real life that Im genuinely ashamed to claim the up-close-and-personal version of who I am. - I have an accompanying fear of authority figures. Small things such as requesting a day off of work or asking a supervisor for a favor literally fills me with an illogical fear that can plague me for hours. I will find myself distracted, trying to find how exactly to word/approach such topics, in order to avoid being told no or being viewed as strange or unjustified. Men in general or attractive women seem to exacerbate this fearI suppose it is ingrained in my way of thinking to see such people as superior to me much the same as an employer. - This fear controls me to a point that it runs my life. I am stuck in a job where I work far harder than I am compensated for. My management pawns jobs they are asked to do off on me, and then present my work as their own when I am done. I make the same amount of money as the people my management brings in and instructs me to train. I do 3x the expected production amount in any given day, and after two years of striving for perfection, I have received nothing but a 19 cent raise as reward. Because I work so hard, I have a certain amount of job security. I singlehandedly keep up with three programs by myself, each day. I am 100% certain that if I threatened to leave because another employer offered me a position, they would counter-offer. But the mere idea of having to face the awkwardness of telling my management that I was given an offer from another job is so panic-inducing for me that I would rather accept what I make now, than leave or talk my way into a better situation. - Let me give an example of exactly how bad this social anxiety is. When I stand up and walk down a hallway at work, I think everyone is looking at me. My every move is dictated by how it might look, what someone might think. I KNOW no one cares. No one is scrutinizing me as I walk. But the thought wont stop plaguing me, either way. One day, last summer, I overheard my supervisor speaking with my shift lead about someone. They were talking about a mistake that this person had made, and how to handle their punishment. I was filled with an enormous, illogical fear. I was so absolutely certain that they had been talking about me that I planned to quit my job. I was going to quit my job, to avoid being confronted about a possible mistake. Except I was so absolutely terrified of having to tell my management, even over the phone, that I quit my job, that I simply did not show up to work. I did not call in. I did not respond to their calls. Five days passed. They called me from my shift leads cell phone, and I was dumb enough to pick up, because I didnt recognize the number. If it is any indicator of just how good I am at my job and how hard I work on a day-to-day, they asked me to come back to work that next Monday, and they would waive every attendance point I incurred (which would have been termination after an entire week). I resumed work the next Monday, only to find out that the conversation I had overheard was not about me at all. - I tend to be obsessive, emotionally. This is why someone being rude to me or awkward social situations are so extreme for me. Same with impulse control. I will get an idea for something I want to do or buy and it will literally torture me internally until I get it. Part of me knows I probably dont even want it that badly, or that it will cause more harm than good. It doesnt change the fact that I have to have it just to calm the impulse in my head. But the moment I have it, I feel awful about it. I wrestle with guilt and self-depreciation about it, but I know I had to appease the impulse. - A lot of times, I feel this weird emotional disconnect that makes me want to die. I cant even describe it. Like...I dont know. When I was a little girl my mom used to tell me that I didnt care about anyone but myself, and that I was literally so self-driven that no one around me mattered. And I guess its not true but...it feels true. My relationship with the people around me is driven by my own selfish needs. I dont think I love people. I love what they do for me. I love how they help me satisfy my needs, emotionally or sexually or financially or otherwise. I need to feel wanted, to feel validated, I need sex and affection and gestures that say I love you but theyre relegated to how they make me feel. And I feel this terrifying sense of, does anyone actually matter to you or are you just this empty needy emotional vampire, draining the people around you for your own sick hunger? But I dont know if thats even true. Like...when people leave or insult me or act distant, it hurts me. It bothers me. It sticks with me. But again, I cant help but wonder if its just the blow to my ego, or the way I feel lost and helpless and lesser than before. Even when I do good things for people...I buy people gifts or say something thoughtful or do my good deed for the day, whatever...I cant help but wonder if Im doing it because I want those people to feel good or I want myself to feel good, I want myself to look good, I want myself to gain validation from how others perceive my good will. I dont know. - Im secretive, sort of. Closed off. Detached-ish. This novella of self-destruction is all shit I should have no problem saying to my therapist, considering I see one on a regular basis, but I cant seem to do that. She asks me how I am and Im driven to lie. I dont know why. Im motivated to cover up all the chaos and madness inside of me because it feels safer or more rational than admitting that Im falling apart. I want to seem stronger than I am, both emotionally and physically, and mentally. She gives me antidepressant after antidepressant after mood stabilizer after antipsychotic and each one in turn makes me feel worse or groggy or like Im even less in this shell of a body than I already always feel, and it reaches a point where I feel driven to settle and say, You fixed me. Im fine. Im better. It seems easier than saying None of this works. Im miserable. Im worse than before. - Lying, much like being cynical or snide, is my self-defense mechanism. I will do anything to hide my own vulnerability. To everyone. Doctors. Friends. Family. Coworkers. Strangers on the sidewalk. Employees at the gas station. And no matter how poorly executed it seems in my head, it works enough that 99% of the time people believe it. I dont know whats wrong with me. I dont know how to fix it. I dont know how to make life worth living again. I dont know how to even begin explaining to my therapist of almost three years that Ive been lying or grossly understating my feelings and that my life is now entirely unraveled. "

Our romance was a whirlwind, but I eventually broke things off because, long story short, he started treating me like dirt. I still love him and miss him every day. Around the time of our breakup last year, I stopped seeing the psychiatrist I had seen for quite some time and had had a crush on basically since I met him. The vulnerability that comes with breakups make me so flirty and even hypersexual at times that I didnt want to ruin things. But then, a few months later, I found out that in a relationship with a person I greatly admired several years ago, I got seriously used. Preyed upon, honestly. I got triggered and acted like an idiot, sending the psychiatrist an email telling him of my feelings. I told him I understood if he didnt reply, but really I just didnt want to be a bother and was devastated when he didnt. I mean, hed get in trouble for doing anything but rejecting me on his work email, but I thought we had something respectful between us, romantic or not. He treated me like a normal, respectful human being, not a crazy person. So here I am, all this time later, with none of these men probably thinking about me at all. I dont trust anyone anymore. Id go to a therapist and/or psychiatrist, but I trust them least of all now. Thanks to anybody who actually read this. "
544,vulnerability,offmychest,Coming to terms with how twisted my family was.,1,86m0l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/86m0l8/coming_to_terms_with_how_twisted_my_family_was/,2018-03-24 03:34:36,"Hard life lesson learnt, but learnt it is. Story-time. My sisters, twins, perpetually had each other, to rely on for agreement, back up, everything. They never experienced vulnerability in the same way most people do, and it may be the confirmation bias, but I think that had an effect on their personality development. My brother, the oldest, took on a fairly bossy, controlling role - our dad was only partially in the picture, being as it was, that he was married to a different woman - I guess my mum didn't get involved in the increasingly toxic dynamic that was developing between her kids because she was depressed/overwhelmed by the situation. In the vacuum Dad left, Tom took on the male dominance of the house. He's arrogant, short-tempered and glowering. He shows a remarkable lack of sensitivity on any subject, including when our mother was dying, the type of funeral she was to have (argued with my clearly very upset aunt that it didn't matter what mum would have wanted). I have been mulling over memories I'd completely forgotten. As I know a lot of abused people do, I've been torturing myself over why my siblings think it is ok to treat me like they did, and why the adults let them get away with it. I came to the same sore point lots do: ""is it me?"" Is it something I've done, maybe I'm really that antagonistic (even though I started the practice of saying as little as possible around them), or I really am that oversensitive? If everyone else in the family is still friendly with them, and even want me to reconcile, maybe it is true? Then I remember a few bits here and there, examples of the sisters taking unusually angry, aggressive stances at a stranger cos they didn't hold the door open for them, took to long in their questions, or trying to get an airport employee fired if they made (an admittedly costly) mistake. Little things here and there. Then I remembered a pretty severe situation where my sisters, forever in their twosome, bullied a guy in a village near us for a good few nights. They encouraged other kids to get involved, mobbing him with insults and the odd kick. This went on every evening for about a week. Part of the humiliation, I think, was that most of the kids were much smaller and younger than him. Admittedly, I was involved too. They wanted to dump some water on him, and I filled the bucket and carried it back. I'm so sorry to that guy - he was 16ish, which seemed like adult age to me at the time (I was 11ish), but it was still wrong. He still obviously was on the receiving end of a very intense spate of abuse and hounding, perhaps not started by, but definitely massively exacerbated and pursued by my sisters. Another memory came to me, of my sisters hanging around with their friends. They always made friends with really nasty girls, who they'd end up feuding with like mad soon after. But while the friendship lasted, their activities seemed to consist of hanging out at the side of the road, spitting on the ground and saying horrible things to anyone walking past. Me, being the annoying little sister, would tag along. One time sticks in my mind - they laughed like mad, with evident scorn, at a boy who tried to ride his bike up a steep hill. They didn't know him. But they still shouted at him that he was sad, how any one else could cycle up the hill, he was sad, pathetic, a gobshite etc. The boy was walking his bike up the hill with his head down, and I remember knowing exactly how he felt. Humilation and burning rage, but unable to do anything as the shouts and laughter went on and on. These are the examples I can remember. I might be forgetting some, and of course the majority of the time, I was not with them. But I suppose their defense could be that this is when they were kids, and everyone has done silly things when they were younger. I don't talk to the siblings anymore. Any of them. I steadily realised, in my late teen years, and then adult life, that they were, at best, not my sort of people, and at worst, actually foul human beings who were actually harmful to be around. The guillotine for contact finally came down when one sister punched me 3 times in the face for telling her to stop asking my mother a question that was obviously distressing her (she was dying from a brain tumour), and when my brother exploded at me, telling me how much he hated me and what a c&amp;@t I was for asking him an innocuous question about leftovers. My memory may be another example of confirmation bias. Maybe they aren't complete or altered. But I can't help think this fits the pattern for the personality type I've witnessed from them. It may be just empty hope, and maybe I am a horrendously flawed, immature and self-centred person, but maybe it's not down to me, why they act like that."
545,vulnerability,offmychest,"Have never been crazy about my wife, thinking about divorce",0,879rji,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/879rji/have_never_been_crazy_about_my_wife_thinking/,2018-03-27 02:00:58,"We started dating over 15 years ago (as teenagers), and have been married for about half of it, no kids, we own a house together. When we started dating, I was about a month out of a very emotionally abusive relationship. It was difficult then to realize how much that actually affected me, I had (and still have) massive vulnerability issues. This was her first real relationship, so maybe that's why she never really questioned why I was so closed off, but our relationship has been built on top of a huge mountain of emotional insecurity. We've both been pretty successful, so there has never been much to stress about in our relationship, making it easy for us to float along all these years. But as my life has become more stressful (see below), it's becoming more and more obvious to me that I've never felt close to her at all, and now this all feels like a huge mistake. **HER** * Very sweet, kind, caring, highly intelligent, but emotionally unintelligent and inexperienced (I was her first everything) * Craves affection, she's very attracted to me * Objectively attractive (though I don't find myself that attracted to her) * Very obsessive, anxious, and worrisome, to the point of affecting her life daily sometimes * Very unwilling to accept any criticism or admit fault * Professionally successful * Messy, lazy, unmotivated. Barely any pre-relationship friends left, she only talks to me and her mother on a regular basis * Almost no hobbies. **ME** * Emotionally cut off, intelligent, attractive * Affection makes me uncomfortable * Selfish, stubborn, also have issues with criticism and admitting fault, a bit cynical and narcissistic at times. Lacking empathy. * Professionally successful * Complacent, have problems with change (I've never ended a relationship) * Lots of hobbies and friends **INFERTILITY** We have tried for years to conceive, unsuccessfully. We've done fertility treatment for a long time and It's taken a pretty big emotional toll on her. For a lot of that time I've questioned whether this relationship was really what I wanted, but have been very afraid to just come out and say I wanted to stop treatment without her thinking I wanted to leave her (though I recently told her I wanted to take a break from treatment). **PROFESSIONAL LIFE** A few years ago, I decided to leave my job to start my own company. It has by far been the most stressful thing I've ever done and is the main source of stress in my life. It takes up a lot of my free time (we haven't vacationed since), which has affected her, but the business has been relatively successful so far, and I'm committed to seeing this through. In my corporate life, I had always worked on small teams, didn't have any customer facing roles, so it was rare for me to establish any new relationships or friends. At my business, it's the complete opposite. Seeing how easily I can talk to others about my emotions with others has been pretty eye opening because I don't feel comfortable at all doing that with my wife. **INFIDELITY** We've never had a very active sex life, maybe 2-4 times a month the entire time we've been together. After trying to conceive for so long, it has really lost its luster and we rarely have sex for the fun of it. We definitely don't communicate well about it. Up until about a year and a half ago, I had remained completely faithful. About once a month, I started sleeping with this woman that I've known even longer than my wife. We had always been pretty good friends and still are. That went on for about half a year before I thought she was getting too close so I ended it. Again, it was a lot easier to be open with her about intimacy and emotion than it was with my wife, which was very liberating. **SUMMARY** I guess it really boils down to our lack of closeness and communication, and our lack of compatibility (we have very different personalities). The idea of trying to get closer to her actually terrifies me, and I feel awful saying this, but I find myself not *wanting* to be close to her. I just feel like this marriage was convenient for me, and as long as things were going well in life, it was enough. With all this added stress in my life, I don't feel like I can turn to her, and I think there's a chance I could be happier with somebody else. My biggest fear of leaving her is how crushed she would be, and that she may never recover from it, so there's no way I could just walk out on her one day. I have to tell her how I feel, but I feel paralyzed by the thought of that. Fuck. "

She suggested that I start dating again as ""feeling loved by someone will make you feel better."" Sure thing my friend. Most people have an innocent, foolish first love like in the movies. I wish that were the case. It has been 2 years since my first relationship, I've got over most of it but a part of me remains bitter. My ex reached out but I shut him down immediately. I couldn't stand him after everything he had done. I should have been skeptical from the start. Our first encounter was suspiciously sweet like some lame cheesy teenage movie. We met at a school club interview and he got my number from one of the interviewers. A few weeks later, we started dating. I didn't know that he didn't love me lol. I broke up with him because something felt wrong and it turned out to be the best decision I've ever made. Less than a week later, he was already dating my friend. What a jerk. Needless to say, my self-esteem was severely damaged. Was I not good enough? Why did you cheat on me with my friend? That depressed narcissist loves to manipulate people. He couldn't resist bragging about being hit on while he was with me. He couldn't isolate me like what he did to another ex so he often disappeared online/avoided me in real life. Saying that he was having another depressive episode. Thinking about it makes me laugh. No, he was guilt tripping me while spending time flirting with girls. I have friends suffering from depression and NOBODY uses suicidal thoughts to manipulate their SO. I was sooooo stupid. One day I stayed up all night, he was on vacation and he threatened to get hit by a car if I didn't go to bed. Another day he was on the verge of self-harming at home. And another day he sliced his wrist with a broken piece of glass at school. The point is he deliberately let me know that he was planning it. It wasn't impulsively done. He wanted my attention. I was so devastated that day, I needed some comfort but he half-heartedly replied my messages. Go to sleep, he said, you would feel better, he said. Just go. THANKS A BUNCH. Oh wow, he told me to go away because he was busy hitting on my friend. He was only 17 and his mind was already this twisted. How many people will he continue to damage? I heard that his current girlfriend spoke ill of my friend at a poetry reading lol. He ruined everything for me. Everything I've felt was one-sided, he acted so well. I'm terrified to let anyone see and take advantage of my vulnerability again. Why am I so weak, why am I still bitter about this whole thing. He has moved on, my friend (broke up with him last year) has also moved on. So has the girl he dated before me. Why can't I completely move on??? I hate myself and I just want to hurt him as much as he hurt me. I envy what Elio and Oliver share in Call Me By Your Name, a genuine love in its purest form. My close friends have been in and out of love the couple last years. They seem content with their partners. And here I am, the single loser with issues. I'm nothing special, nobody would notice me anyway. (Sorry for any grammar mistakes.)"

I'm old now. All this started 40 years ago. I was raped in 2nd grade and then the cover up began. 1st, another man attacked me and sexually assaulted me, one who had a better reputation than the first rapist. It was the second one who got their family to lie to mine. Once the lie was told, there were other things they did to destroy my reputation, like they used to watch me very closely and point out things that I did throughout the day. Meaningless things. Childish things. Every mistake. Every look of confusion. Selfish things, like not offering to help clean up like the older girls were doing. Then they'd link the little things together, constructing an image of me being a selfish, self centered, stupid, brat. People started saying things to me about it, you should have thought about that before you... Or you should have considered how we feel, now we don't care how you feel. I was alienated within the week. When I got home, I tried to tell my grandma what happened, but my dad cut me off and told her to trust him... He'd already been through this and he knew I was lying. So she didn't listen to me and I was afraid to tell her anything else. Dad was getting mad at me. He was so convinced that I was lying about rape just to drive a wedge between him and his family. When I told grandma he accused me of trying to hurt his relationship with his own mother. I told my teacher, my minister, my doctor, my neighbor, a social worker who went to our church. My mom took care of my teacher, doctor and minister. She lied to them. She threw shade on me. She accused them of jumping to conclusions and threatened legal action... Granted they had jumped to conclusions. They didn't have the full story before they intervened. The neighbor and social worker were mainly concerned about whether or not I was safe in my own home. Since my father and brother weren't raping me, they decided I was safer at home than in any foster care situation. Such is life for girls in a man's world. Eventually I subconsciously realized that I could survive easier in my father's world of denial. Even though, in that world, I was a lowly, lying, brat who would likely end up on drugs, fucking everything that moved and my father would have to provide for me forever... Because he was the unfortunate soul who brought me into this world. (That is my understanding of my father's worldview). I ended up replacing my own interpretation of my experiences with my father's. If dad wouldn't likely believe something happened to me, then I didn't believe it either. It had to be proved to me and no one could say, you just experienced it! Or, why do you think you're bleeding? I mean, there had to be enough evidence to convince my dad without me testifying or else I wouldn't testify, because I couldn't stand dad hating me, blaming me, being ashamed of me. I had to live in his house. It was the safest place for me. I didn't want to give him anymore fuel. I still thought my dad was a good guy who had been tricked by bad people. I grew up like this. 10+ rapists tried to rape me, many succeeded more than once. I was unable to recognize my own vulnerability. Unable to remember the faces of those who raped me. I married a decent, intelligent, successful man who would stand by me in an argument with my father, and whom my father would respect. Then, we had kids and when the kids were young, I began to have memories of what my parents taught me as a child, about myself. I began sitting and thinking about the relationship I have with my parents now, and then just asking myself... When did that start? Like, they don't trust me to report the news of the day... I have to produce a source... But my husband can just tell them and they'll believe him. Is it the way I say it? And then I'd ask myself, would my life make sense if they had never believed me? And suddenly the memories were flooding back. All the times in childhood when there was no reason not to trust me, but they wouldn't trust me. It went on like that for a few years. I stopped speaking to my family to protect them. I was unable to speak in a quiet, rational voice. I could only scream at them. So I imposed a no contact rule. Now I understand my childhood and their parenting. I can speak calmly and rationally about it. My kids are almost grown. I haven't been able to hold down a job. Despite having control over the memories, I'm still triggered emotionally by everything around me. It's not about the rapes, it's about the ruined reputation. It's about being blamed as a child for tearing apart the family, and for making my dad choose between me and his loved ones... And about being blamed as an adult for tearing apart the family by raising my kids without seeing my family. It's about my parents and brother saying that I was the only one hurt, and that my pain is what hurt them... Like I should have kept it all to myself and protected them from my pain. But, I didn't tell them about the gun to my head, the close calls with death, any of the rapes after the age of 13. I kept it all away from my dad, but my mom had to hear about it sometimes. That wasn't enough for them. They wanted me to behave like it wasn't happening at all. I couldn't do that for them. I couldn't even do that for my kids and the abuse had ended by then. Every time we went on a family fun outing, I'd become teary eyed, sullen, and all joy was clearly being forced. I could not embrace happiness for my procreated family, and that made me sadder and sadder until I would be weeping. I want to confront my childhood community before everyone involved dies. What do I stand to gain? What is at stake? I can't seem to move on. I wasn't allowed to tell my side of the story when I was a kid, and now that I am old enough to understand and articulate my side... No one thinks it's worth it to bring it up again. Everyone's like, ""great! You got it worked out! Leave those people in the past and move forward in life!"" A step forward would be a job. How do I account for my time all these years? What was I doing? Just fucking around. Got a degree, didn't want to use it. Spent 20 years at home. What about all the effort and hard work that went into piecing my life back together? Fuck that. It's not worth anything to society. Just be yourself in an interview but don't tell them about the major life project you've been working on. I didn't end up addicted to drugs. So. Yea. Oh and some of my memories have been confirmed by others. Enough of them for me to decide that my parents and community members knew enough to intervene to protect me and chose not to. My dad sobbed one day, ""We didn't know..."" but the truth is that they didn't know ""for sure"" because they didn't want to believe it. And that's not good enough for parenting. *Edited spelling error"

I really did, and Im proud of how I handled it as it all went down. At the end, I tried to prove that I could adapt to what you needed but still be gracious and hold onto my self-respect if it didnt work out. This is hard and embarrassing to admit, but you were right: I was too dependent on you; I made you my happiness. So this break was really good for me, because from it, I found my sense of self again. I took notes and tried to make sure I came out on the other side with growth to show for it. However, I just wish you were more open to communicating. And after reflecting, I think Im able to articulate the kind of communication I wanted. Again, you were right. I didnt show you an independent s/o though I insisted I was, but at the same time you didnt talk to me like a partner. When you made the executive decision to split, it seems you talked to everyone BUT meour personalities, the future, our wantsand I absolutely believe I shouldve been the first person you came to. Whatever you were afraid of, Im never here to stifle or judge you. And just so you know I loved you for you and the laughs we shared, not your education or upbringing. I loved the times about the shonen-garbage 5 leaf clover demon, backne bunny tail, petty-ass minigolfing and hot lava Indian food diarrhea blasting in my toilet you. Anyway, you said before you liked how I always piped up when I had a problem instead of being passive-aggressive, but you didnt do the same. So as I felt you pull away, I confused texting everyday and forcing intimacy and closeness with true emotional vulnerability. If you cant let yourself be emotionally available, you need some soul searching to do to finally be happy with yourself, and I need to find someone whos already at peace with their identity because I deserve a guy who can reciprocate love without fear."

I took a Xanax because my anxiety and depression has been off the roof lately but I can't stop remembering what my ex husband did. I supressed it for so long I need to get this out, even though I'm fucking exhausted When I was 16, I met a 24 year old online. We started dating, he seemed so emotionally intelligent and was so committed to me right off the back. He told me he loved me the first night we met in person. He prided himself and always talked about his integrity, genuineness, vulnerability etc. He was intense. I had an extremely abusive childhood and I was in high school living with a toxic parent in a toxic environment when we met. We were long distance for 6 months then we got married when I was still a minor. We had only seen each other in person 12 times when we got married and I moved in with him. A week or two after we got married and I was living with him in a different state, he told me he looked at child porn. He said the youngest was only 12 and he liked the sweetness and innocence of it. I feel so disgusted writing this. I made him delete it off his computer that night. I didn't look at it, I just closed my eyes until he said it was all gone. I literally had no other place to go, I was newly fucking married, still in high school, no job experience of any kind and I was still a minor. I felt so unsettled so I tried to block it out. It was such a bait and switch from how he presented himself. We never talked about it again after that night and I stayed with him for 3 more years. Every time I thought about it I'd just think ""no no no"" until it stopped. I never told anyone. Now we're broken up and I feel so sick. I even feel a little traumatized. When he left he told me not to villianize him"

I wanted to talk to somebody, anybody about something I cant seem to talk to anybody else about. Im a pretty good student, 18 years old, and I have plenty of friends. My family is put together well, my parents are still together, and weve taken in some foster babies. Ive got two natural siblings and two adopted siblings, and Im the oldest. Ive got a close circle of friends, Ive dated some, and I have a far-reaching influence in my school and community. But Im so lonely. I feel like in every area of my life, I look and appear successful and like Im doing well. Ive known real happiness before and seen the wonderful joy life can hold. Truthfully, I am a happy person, and I enjoy my life. I am beyond blessed to have this life. But theres not a single person in my life I can be real, or vulnerable with. I know Im still crazy young and Ive got my whole life ahead of me, I dont want to jump to conclusions, but I feel like I cant confide in anybody. Is this okay? Its so weird to be feel so alone with so many people around me. Whenever Ive really tried to be vulnerable with somebody, I catch myself and stop myself, because I dont want to seem clingy or desperate, but is my aversion to vulnerability keeping me from having deep relationships? I love having somebody close to me who I can share everything with, and love and care and dote on. I like to make people happy, and I love to see others smile. Human beings are beautiful, every one of them in one way or another. We all think and feel the same way, and at the end of the day, have the same needs. I love people. But I feel like I have all of this love, and nobody to give it to. I dont really have anybody to share my life with. Is that alright? Even my parents dont have a really serious connection with me. Just looking for some guidance, I guess. If this is the wrong sub for this, let me know, and maybe suggest somewhere else I can go. Thanks, love you all. "
551,vulnerability,offmychest,Something that I've been going through recently,15,8ah5xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8ah5xj/something_that_ive_been_going_through_recently/,2018-04-07 20:09:52,"It's currently 3:33 AM, I know it almost sounds like I made up that time but that's what it is. In the bathroom besides my bedroom is my roommate and his girlfriend. She's drunk, and crying and puking and going through some things, and he's there beside her, comforting her, helping her through it even if she doesn't want to. And it's hard for me to experience this. It's not because they woke me up. It's not because I have an important day tomorrow for my job, and need to prove myself. It's because recently I've been feeling incredibly lonely. And I feel bad saying it. I feel bad intruding on this deeply personal and kind of beautiful moment between them and only thinking of myself, and how I don't have that. But here I am anyway. It is now 3:49 AM. I've been thinking a little more about what I want to say. The kind of loneliness I'm feeling isn't the one where you don't think you have connections with people, because I do. My mother, as fucked as our relationship may be, loves me and supports whatever decisions I make in life. I have a friend in Seattle who also loves me, and supports me, and is great to talk to about things. The kind of loneliness I'm talking about is the one where you feel like no one really understands you. And it really hurts. I've been trying to branch out more, and to a little bit of success. Hanging out with people in the underground punk scene and techno people and spiritual people and coffee people. But all these relationships are hard to maintain, because I'm always the one to ask people if they want to spend time together, and so, so many times people flake or don't respond. That hurts too. It's very isolating. Hearing the scene in the bathroom just reminds me of the kind of connection I want to have, how so badly I want to be there for someone and have someone be there for me. It's something I've never had, and I blame myself. Here I am, 22 years old and totally inexperienced with relationships! So, why? I'm adventurous, I put myself out there, I don't have strong social anxiety. I think maybe I'm just open with people too fast, maybe that vulnerability is a red flag indicating crazy person. It's also pretty easy to look at my own family and see the near absolute vacuum of meaningful relationships any of them have had. Maybe it's just a part of me. Maybe everyone feels lonely like this at times, even with significant others. Now it's 4:10 AM. I guess the best I can do is be present with people, listen to them and joke around and be kind. But man can that be hard sometimes. Thanks for reading."

Ever since my family became ""broken up"", I realize that I have such a lonely soul. I'm 28 now and have gotten over the struggles of my adolescence, teenage rebellion &amp; all. But the feeling that never left my heart, is loneliness &amp; isolation. I've been self-reliant, for a really long time because I've had to. When your father is suffering from PTSD from being a military veteran, and your mother decides to ditch the family and divorce dad, I never had much of a support system as a small child. &amp; well, I'm not 28 yet, until one more month. I've been doing soul-searching, and just want to better myself to have a successful future. What made me think about my state of ""loneliness"" is that, I recently got into a new relationship and well see on his end, he likes to take his space. Me? on the other hand, basically, I want the attentive man. &amp; I mean I can understand that sometimes, a man just wants to be alone. But for me, it's just hard because, I've been a lonely soul since I was a small child. &amp; the feeling never leaves. Never. No matter what I do. &amp; you know it's not like he doesn't give me love &amp; affection when we are together. But when I am alone with my own thoughts, I just have a feeling of loneliness, isolation, and emptiness. I just wish that, there was a way to re-wire my thought process, into not feeling so empty. I also just contradict myself too, honestly. 'Cause the type of person I am, introvert. I realize that there is a difference between being alone, &amp; being lonely. I guess, I have this never ending feeling of loneliness because, I went from having a difficult adolescence, to having difficult relationships. (platonic &amp; non-platonic). I was never truly appreciated, or even acknowledged, always feeling invisible to everyone I cared about. But I digress, being a strong and independent person; I don't open up to people easily, &amp; I just handle my own problems. But the downside is that, no one really knows what I go through. They don't see my hurt, or vulnerability. No one sees me for the person I truly am, they just see the finished product. The happy, loving, and fulfilled girl. &amp; you know, I mean I guess it isn't THAT bad that I can handle my own shit pretty well, but.. deep down, sometimes the feeling of being lonely overwhelms me. It's been a constant in my life, for as long as I can remember. :( "

I was holding onto my stun gun the whole ride to the restaurant because I was scared to trust a stranger off the interwebs, yet I got into your car and we were joking and laughing as if we had met in another life on the way to the restaurant. You were shy and a little awkward; this vulnerability was endearing and made me feel as if Ive broken through the smooth exterior + the facade most people hide behind. Afterwards, we walked around and ended up at an arcade where you spectacularly lost to two games of air hockey. Your smile and laughter brightened your whole demeanor, you looked less tired and worn. We left the place with your arm respectively around me, bantering about your air hockey skills. You dropped me off, and I noticed you looking at me in a new light. Your eyes were bright and it looked as if you were holding something back. I leaned over and kissed you on the cheek. Your relief was palpable with your hand turning my cheek so you could kiss me back on the lips. It was electric, I was ironically struck by Cupid. Our foreheads touched afterwards. It felt like time stopped. We stared into each others eyes. I lost myself in yours. Our foreheads were touching and I felt this was the most intimate moment where you had destroyed the walls surrounding my heart without my noticing. The next day you came by to bring me a burger as an excuse to see me again. We ended up making out in front of my house and while holding both my hands you asked, What are we? You fell hard and fast for me and have been so honest about it. I am scared. of love. I love the affection, the heartfelt emotions, and intimate moments where our foreheads touch and our hearts soften. However, the men that have fallen for me have fallen too fast, too quick. I have all this love and affection but this fear of what could come next haunts me. But mostly, Im afraid of falling hard and fast for you too. "

Truthfully, you lost that right the moment you walked out the door. I've told you things I rarely say aloud, confided in you about the past I've tried so hard to forget. I showed you a side of me, raw and primal, breath and kiss and whisper, that had never had the chance to see the light of day before you came along. I pushed through the fear of rejection and let you inside my carefully constructed facade, trembling the entire time. Want to know the kicker? I didn't get a chance to show you the half of it. And now you have the gall to repay that vulnerability with vague explanations, half honest misdirects and lithe dodges of showing anything real. You wanted to stay friends, doll, and I wanted that too... but you don't get to pull away and act as if nothing happened, like everything would go back to the way it was before.

No matter here or there, you will always just be you. An abusive, manipulative ..just. Ugh. Words diminish how shitty you are. Youre a fuckton of problems rolled into a person who refuses to see it. Like, do you really not remember how bad you treated me? How can you wake up every morning and live with yourself? Oh right. Because you think that I'm a worse person who has done worse, andd deserved to be hit and called names, and insulted and made to feel like nothing. You are the judge, jury and executioner of that. I DIDN'T DO SHIT TO YOU. I remember once, you tried to make me recite ""I deserve this"" Oh my god. You are fucked up. I almost hope you burn in hell. But, I really cant bring myself to care anymore what the fuck happens to you. *sigh. Just like how you couldnt/cant forget all the shit Ive done (with 95% of it happening before I even fucking met you), I dont think Ill be able to forget and forgive you for what youve done. The last breakup we had. For the first time, we actually didnt contact each other for a good 2 days. I didnt message you or anything. In my mind, that was the last and final fight we had. I was single. No, not sleeping with other guys but with the feeling that I was done with you. I was happy, a weight was lifted off me, all the while you were still emailing me and calling me a whore and a bitch. From that point on, me going back with you is going backwards. And like you said, you dont go backwards. You just have to move forwards. And because I have no idea what exactly is bullshit that came from you, I have to assume that you meant and mean everything you said. All the super negative insults as well as your fake I love yous A future together? Marriage? Kids? dogs? hahah. What a fucking joke. Maybe in another universe. Even then, the thought of us together makes me want to time travel and shot other dimension me. More. I still cant believe that youve insulted every single aspect of my life. Youve made me feel like NOTHING. Like if I killed myself, no one would give a fuck. You told me to go kill myself. You told me to go jump off the bridge. You said Id make your life easier and better if I did that. You told me my single mother who raised my brother and I that she was a Chinese whore who tried to whore out and marry a white guy. You told me that Ill fuck whoever gave me attention. You told me youd beat me, that youd drag me out of work by my hair. How much hair do I want to lose? You constantly bring up my past over and over and over and over, assuming that Im trying to sleep with someone else. My god. I didnt even fucking know you. Youre the one who went around and threw my trust away. And yeah, I think betraying someones trust is just as bad as cheating. Ugh. anyway. Youve threatened me so many times. Youve blackmailed me. I even went to the police about you. You told me I was worthless. Youve let me cry and cry, and not even blink twice about it. Youve left me with so many bruises, mentally and physically. You told me I deserved to be treated like shit. Youve insulted me beyond measure. I dont think I could ever forgive myself if I went back with you. I will not grow with you. I will not change or become anything more than what you think I am. Like, I loved you but youre not worth the risk for more pain. I cant give you another chance. You tell yourself that you can do better, that youll treat me better. That youll try. I know you believe that. The only this is, Ive heard this many times before and I dont think you can change overnight. I As much as Id want to believe and hope you can be what I wanted you to be, Im a realist. I dont honestly think you can. I think what youve shown me for the months that weve been together is just who you are. I mean, sure you can say that about me being a whore. Actually no. You called me a whore for sleeping with guys I didnt really know, but youve done the exact same thing! The only difference is, I dont know about every single one of them. Oh, and the fact that youre male. EITHER WAY. I know itll take a loooonngg time for you to become the person I need you to be. I guess it was pointless how pathetic I felt trying to make you believe me that I wasnt screwing around. Ive never felt so small, worthless and helpless in my entire life. You made me feel that way. I dont think any amount of apologies is going to make me forget that feeling. I dont even think a miracle will help. I dont want to risk spending the rest of my life who has the ability to make me feel that way. I dont want that feeling EVER again. Ever. Like, sure its nice to have someone who has the ability to do that, but Id rather live a plain, boring life alone than feel like I dont mean anything to anyone. Maybe we had the possibility for a life of adventure. But weve gone so far away from that. That phrase was said a lifetime ago, before inner you came out. Every time you walked away, I loved you less. And believe me, the amount of times weve broken up because you got pissy over something small, man. The fact I still had any amount of affection for you is a testament to what kind of person I am. I could go either way with that one. How big of a heart I have/had or now naive I was about how much worse you could get. I will be deeply sorry for any girl who you manage to end up dating. Truly. I almost feel bad for letting you loose and risk some other girl going through what I did. But. Who knows, maybe they'll all see the red flags and run away like I should have done. Maybe you'll change and treat women like people and not things. I dont know. All I know, is that I need some me time. I need to be alone. I need to find out who I am and what I want. I dont want to go backward and try again. I need a fresh start without constant reminders of ..negativity. Like. You had me. I gave you me. I was vulnerable with you. You took my vulnerability and insecurities and threw it back in my face. I had to tiptoe around things I said, things I looked at, things I shared to not risk having you blow up over something. My own thoughts werent safe from you. You have reduced me to nothing and now you want to ..what? bring me back up? Eh. Daniel. Im not running away from my problems. This was suppose to be a year. An easy year to be on my own and grow. Not a year of being under someone elses control. I want to go home. I want to see my friends and not have to worry about anything else that I dont have to. Im sorry. I dont think we can go back to the way things are. And theres no point in being half of what we were. I dont want to drag this out and have it hurt more in the end. Or have it where I stay here longer and stay because I dont want to hurt you. I highly doubt youd do the same for me. Anyway. I need to do this for me. I need to be selfish. I need to be strong on my own. I will forge my own way in life, and go on my own path. If I fail, then I will bring myself back up and try again. I will live my own life and make my own decisions. I will go where I want to go, talk to who I want to talk to and yeah, sleep with whoever the fuck I want. I am done wasting my time and being treated like shit. Because right now I swear to myself and to the reddit universe, I am FINISHED WITH YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE. Thanks for reading. "

maybe i really started to think about this about 2 years ago... when i found somebody who i felt deeply connected to and who i began to fall for. but for some reason i couldn't shake this fear that he would fall for my best friend instead. in my warped, insecure mind, they were perfect for each other. and i was the one in the way. anyway, that was a long time ago. i broke up with him only after a few months of dating partly because of my best friend (who still doesn't know about this) but mostly because i clearly wasn't ready for a relationship and had some work to do on my self-worth and confidence. i did that work. now in the present, i feel the best i ever felt. i shed myself of bad relationship habits. i made new, healthier friendships. i invested additional love and time and vulnerability into strengthening current ones. i resolved the issues i had with my family members. i have a job that i love and friends i truly adore. i stopped comparing myself to others (and to my best friend --what a horrible habit!) i'm genuinely enjoying my single status. i know more clearly who i am and i wholeheartedly believe in that person. i like myself... i love myself. and i was never able to say that before. throughout this transformation, my ""best friend"" was... yea, she was there. but i noticed that... that's it. she was there. we shared laughs, we went out to parties, we shared meals, long convos... like friends do, right? but she was not there FOR me. we've been friends for a LONG time... since we were kids. these days we don't use the BFF label or any label but we did for a majority of those years... however, during a dark time when we were teenagers, whenever i needed her, she simply wasn't there. i stopped calling her years ago because i knew she wouldn't pick up that phone. i was SO sick of getting a call or lazy text back 3 days later. i am aware that during this stage of my life, i was a needy, emotional mess. but i needed a friend. and she was it. and i would seriously drop everything i was doing if she ever called or needed me (she rarely did). but she was never there when i needed her. those were some tough times that i had to go through alone... she was my only friend. i confronted her about it, and she admitted she was in the wrong and apologized, and we remained friends. i tried to understand the best that i can that nobody is perfect and set my anger/disappointment in her aside. we shared better times, good times, okay times, but that dark period of our friendship really scarred me emotionally (there were other really shitty things she did that i won't go in to detail about). i was scarred by her selfishness and yes it's been years and years but i think deep down i still haven't fully forgiven her and i don't know if i can. i believe over time, that grudge has sort of bled through its proper boundaries and permeated into my perception of her in general. i don't really find her to be a respectable person anymore? we are adults now and in retrospect, i realize she was battling her own demons in her own imperfect way and maybe i was imposing my needs on her. and i wonder if it's fair? to still hold it against her? i was so hurt by her actions. my heart just hurts thinking about it. these days, i hate the person i become around her. only her. because around her, i want revenge. this might be the longest, most drawn out episode of passive-aggression in history. because to be honest, i don't want what's best for her. i don't want to see her happy or succeed. in fact, i kind of want the opposite. it makes me feel like a terrible person. because in real life, we still hang out and message each other and share personal details of our lives. no, i don't think we're as close as we used to be and i definitely have purposely distanced myself as of lately because i simply find that i don't need her or the negative feelings she brings out in me. as i build my own confidence, my tolerance for her gets lower. and i believe she is the final thing i need to distance myself from. i don't like who i am around her, the thoughts i get. she does not contribute to my well-being. the more sure of myself i get, the less tolerance i have for her and our toxic friendship. i feel guilty. i feel like i am being petty for holding a grudge against an immature/past version of my best friend and refusing to give her credit for who she is currently (it turns into jealousy at times). we both have/had our demons. very similar ones. i've battled mine. i put up a TOUGH fight. we are both on our paths to better ourselves and love ourselves. but is it possible to reach my goals before her and now find her personality too abrasive, too negative, too opinionated, too... everything for me? i'm over it. we just don't click. and my boundaries are stronger... she's only going to pull me back down with her negativity. does that make me a bad person?"

Im so tired of this feeling that most days Id rather feel nothing at all. I hate my fake surface level friendships. I hate that people just dump their emotional baggage at my feet but if I give a hint of vulnerability or a hint of, Im not okay they get immediately repulsed. Youre gonna tell me to go to therapy, right? They dont make therapy for poor people, as it happens. My life is a mixture of school work, retail work, trying to better myself, then realizing its all pointless and no one cares. I hate myself. But in a few hours Ill have to get up and put on a fake smile because if I dont people are scared of me. Imagine just trying to make it through life but unless youre smiling and laughing, people are scared of you because of how you look. Its fucking miserable. Youre just sitting there minding your own business but people say you have a mean mug. Well fucking thank you for reminding my face is scary.

January started with me receiving a text from my girlfriend on new years day that made me realize I was going to have to break up with her, more for her sake than mine. Ten days later we had a very clean breakup which both of us hoping that after some time we could fall back into being friends fairly easily. I found it really hard to get over her, because she was the first person I've ever actually dated, so while I have a lot of experience with girls, I've never had to deal with the emotional fallout of a breakup. Since I wasn't over her I decided it would be best if we cut off contact for a while, because seeing her was super hard for me, which also made life significantly harder for me, because she is one of the two people that I would consider myself close to in the city where I go to school. A few days after we broke up I was up for most of the night on the phone with a friend from my hometown trying to help him because he was feeling suicidal, which I did gladly, but made me about as stressed as I've ever been. Within the next few days I had gotten incredibly sick, which made me miss a whole week of lectures and labs at school, putting me way behind, during a semester that I have to use to bring my gpa up significantly in order to stay in my program. Being sick also kept me from being social, because I didn't want to get anyone else sick, which, when combined with my breakup made me feel incredibly isolated and kind of depressed. At the end of that week I had to deal with the same friend again, which once again, I was glad to do but considerably increased my stress level. The week after I learned that one of my ex's closest friends had spent a significant amount of time trying to get her to break up with me. I'm fairly convinced that her friend had a lot to do with creating the circumstances surrounding my decision to break up with my ex, despite her assurances that it didn't have anything to do with her friend. This was made worse by the fact that I'd always tried my hardest to be nice to the friend, even though I really didn't like her, because I knew she and my ex were close. Things started to look up this weekend, when I was able to spend time with my ex and some other friends, until my friend texted me saying he was suicidal again, then stopped responding to my texts and calls. While I was trying my best to help him from where I live my ex comforted me. By the end of the night, once I knew my friend was going to be fine for the time being, it had started to look like my ex and I were close to being good friends again. I had one day where I was feeling hopeful for the next few weeks, until today, when I learned that two weeks after we broke up my ex slept with one of my floor mates from my residence, a guy who I wasn't super close to but considered to be a friend, someone I thought I could trust. Everything I've mentioned so far has been incredibly hard to deal with, but it was all stuff I could handle, until this. This broke me. I feel so angry and betrayed and I don't know what to do. I'm also unbelievably conflicted with regards to my ex. Even though what she did hurt me worse than anything I've ever experienced, I still have strong feelings for her and really want to stay friends, but I don't know if I can after this. I can't bring myself to be mad at her, I'm just hurt. Despite the fact that her friendship is unimaginably important to me I honestly don't know if I can trust her after this, and I have no idea how to move forward with this. I'm mad at the world right now, and I know myself well enough to know that I'm going to hate the person I'll become if I can't move past all of this but I can't think of a good option for how to move forward. I've also been drinking way too much since all of this began, and I'm worried that it could easily become a problem. All I want to do right now is drink and fight, which I know is not a healthy outlet, but I can't think of any better options. I'm considering seeing a therapist, but I hate showing my emotions or vulnerability so I don't know if thats a good idea."

I just want to push pause on life so I can step back and catch my breath. Last year, I moved from NY to Los Angeles. It was not easy and my savings are nonexistent, but it was the best decision I've ever made. It feels incredible to finally be pursuing the life I've always wanted. One with balance and open spaces. Where I can be active on the weekends, spend time with my husband and dog during the week, and gain some distance from (and hopefully, perspective on) my family's issues. But ""nothing gold can stay"" as they say and I've heard that my mother's alcoholism has hit new lows. As a result, my siblings and I (five of us total) are moving forward in planning an intervention. We've been on a few calls to work out how to go about this, and it's raising all kinds of interpersonal issues among us. Brother 1 is recovering from substance abuse issues himself, so his limitations are understandable. More troubling is Brother 2, who seems to see this moment of vulnerability for my mother as the stage he's been waiting for his whole life to finally unleash every grudge he's been dutifully tending to all these years. Sisters, 1 and 2, are on the same page as I am. Aware of our brothers' situations, primary witnesses to our mother's problems, and seeking the most empathic way to move forward in getting her help. However, us ladies may still harbor some grudges of our own. Growing up with an alcoholic father, our older brothers' primary method of coping was avoidance, which left the three of us (young and unable to drive) to witness and tend to the fallout of our parents drunk fighting night after night. They are since divorced. Compounding my stress, I'm currently seeking a new job. My current one is...OK. The pay is more than I've ever made (though that's not saying much as a 26-year-old in media), the job is flexible enough that I get to work from home on occasion, and the expectations are well below what I'm capable of. But the politics are draining and the micromanaging is out of control. Most of the higher-ups started within the company and moved on up the ladder. As a result, there are *huge* knowledge gaps in leadership that would be no-brainers in any real production facility and the issues trickle on down the ladder. My coworkers are alright; smart, competent, and funny, but they're looking for their next gigs and can't offer much support to me at this job in its current state. It short, it's not hard for me to coast at this company and look like an all-star employee. But that's not who I am. I'm a hard worker and I want to apply my skills, not let them wither away unused. At the same time, I'm incredibly stressed out by the interview and hiring process. I have a third interview tomorrow (first time in-person) for a job at a well respected marketing agency. This would be a fast-paced, high stakes role where I would have to travel 25% of the time and likely be on email most weekends/after hours. But the work they do is innovative, and honestly, really cool. It's a fantastic opportunity. I guess right now I'm just scared. It's not that I can't do this job that I'm up for. I know I can. I'm just afraid I'm going to walk myself into a nightmare job where I hate my life after walking out of a job that was ""just OK"" because of some frustrating office politics. On the other hand, I'm equally afraid of not getting an offer because it will cement my current path of mediocre status quo and underachieving. **sigh** I'm stressed and anxious and rundown and scared. I guess I just want to know (and believe in my heart) that everything will be OK. tldr: I'm feeling stuck at this job, and all the extra energy reserves that I had been putting into finding a new one are being sapped by the emotional demands of my family problems.

I am currently 29 and back living at my parent's to apparently get myself together but my mental state keeps unraveling. Last December (the 17th) I attempted suicide, and was kept in the Mental Health Unit (for the second time in my life) until after Christmas. I was no longer in classes, couldn't work because of the anxiety attacks, and thus couldn't afford to pay my credit card bills, phone bill, rent, etc. While I was inside the Unit, I quickly began to remember my previous stay there and a fellow patient I got along with. I resolved to find her when I got out (she had given me her info already and I kept it). Inside, I met with my Dean who said he'd try to help me get back into classes and have my Fall classes retroactively withdrawn, and the Unit set me up with my school Psychiatrist and Therapist. So, I leave and immediately find my old friend's info she gave me two and half years before. I find her Facebook and message her. She doesn't answer. Whatever. I eagerly await her response and things were going okay. I meet with the Dean in early January and talk to the Registrar's office. They say they're still trying to get a hold of one of my professors and once they do, I can sign up for the Spring semester. So I wait. One day, I logged back onto Facebook to look at my old patient-friend's page. Through some comments on her pictures, I discover she had passed away the December before. I was crushed. The obituary didn't say why and I still have no idea on what happened. However, eventually all my classes are withdrawn, but it was too late to get back into any for the semester. I go to see my Psychiatrist who tells me that that would be our last meeting because I no longer had my school's (my only) insurance. I tell this to my school therapist, who tells me the same. She runs a suicide awareness questionnaire thing on me then tries to give me options but I had tunnel vision at this point. One night I got really drunk and went to kill myself again. I had posted a message on my ""friends"" group chat and before I knew it the cops were at my door and took me back to the Mental Health Unit. Being inside those first few days were the worst. Everywhere I looked, Dawn was there. I could see her during our group therapy sessions or at the dinner or just walking down the hallways. Eventually, I got out and my parents wanted me to move back home and I agreed. At first I was happy and hopeful because I'd be back in town with many of my good friends but after a while it became quite apparent that their lives have moved on without me. They're all getting married or have moved away. It has been terrible here. I have no friends and I am certain I am Manic Bipolar. The psychiatrist I saw here is suspecting that, too. My mood swings are severe and I am always in my head and I can't escape. I want to scream, but someone would hear and then ask me what is wrong. I both want that question and shirk from answering it for fear of exposing that such a vulnerability exists in the first place. I have come to realize that this is no longer my home. It is some sick, soulless, lonely purgatory sapping me of any and all energy. I lie in my bed until two or three sleeping, or trying to sleep, or wishing I was asleep. I have no purpose, and I see no point in everything. I can't work. I am no longer myself, and I just want it to be over. I just want to die. I do not want to live this life. It's not even that I want to die; it's that I no longer desire to live. I do not want this life. I reject it. I am not the man I was. I am some feeble mess of a life - a lurid and distorted semblance of the man I am supposed to be. I can't take it. My mind is always clouded and groggy. I feel as if my being here (or wherever I am) is a blight upon an otherwise congruent plane. I go through bouts of mania and depression. I do not think clearly during these. It's as if I am a completely different person obsessed with a particular point or thing. These same friends who called the cops on me and texted me and called me and worried about me have since been silent and absent. I have come back within their vicinity and nothing. No one invites me anywhere (save for two official get-togethers ). No one calls me, texts me; no one is my friend. I have none. One of my best friends is my neighbor and I have seen him about once a month. Friends who take comfort in being worried, but are otherwise too busy to be my friend. Everyday I get five to ten calls from my credit card companies and my college wanting their money I owe but I have no answer. I am buried in debt now. Student loans for a degree I did not complete and credit card bills detailing the life I used to live. I want it back. This is not me. I am inside this vestige, human's mind, watching in disgust and apprehension as this decaying avatar fumbles around and destroys what's left of the life I had. Edit: Sorry about all the tense shifts. Edit: And I couldn't talk to anyone about Dawn either. Before heading back to the Mental Health Unit, I told one person who knew about her that she passed away. It was met with a ""That sucks."" It was of a tone akin to a missed appointment and not the death of a human being, the bond we had that I failed to pursue enough. I couldn't tell my school's therapist about her because she wouldn't have understood. That was one nice thing about going back to the hospital; the Therapist there knew her, and I had someone to talk to; someone who knew her sense of humor, her smile, her laugh, the death stare she'd give you if you pissed her off. I want to go back. Edit: words"
567,vulnerability,offmychest,To the person who thinks sexual assault is a form of flattery/a joke/not a big deal,3,7k6cyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7k6cyu/to_the_person_who_thinks_sexual_assault_is_a_form/,2017-12-16 21:24:51,"It is assault if it was not wanted and not welcomed. One may feel flattered by a sudden kiss on the cheek for example. It may not have been them wanting a kiss on the cheek, but welcomed (gladly accepted) it if they didnt feel any discomfort afterwards. It is also rude to ask a victim (whether its a young girl or a grown ass man) if they felt pleasure from sexual assault. Especially after they put themselves in a state of vulnerability, clearly stating their experience in sexual assault. It should be obvious enough that one did not enjoy it (mentally or physically). Your way of wording and how you decide to react to a victims story can be powerful. I was raped by my ex-boyfriend, but he convinced me for a year that it was not rape because he called it a drunken mistake. He locked us in the bathroom to talk about our breakup during a party, then proceeded to kiss/touch me. He forced himself on me on the tile floor, ignoring my crying face as I repeat it hurts during the rape. I passed out afterwards, he continued to party with other girls. I didnt call the incident rape to anyone or even myself, because of how he reacted so calmly to it. It fucked me up for a long time. Sorry for the rant."
568,vulnerability,offmychest,I wish someone knew why our friendship actually ended instead of the version you came up with,0,7l8az0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7l8az0/i_wish_someone_knew_why_our_friendship_actually/,2017-12-21 20:00:40,"Since no one knows, I might as well tell the story here. Our friendship began to deteriorate in May, possibly the tail-end of April, 2014. This is when you noticed that I was serious about pursuing your boyfriend's best friend. Not just me, that *both* of us were serious about each other. This is what caused the first fracturing of trust. You had your boyfriend, and yet you needed to have your claws in his friend as well. It ruined you to watch us, it ruined you to see the way our faces lit up when we saw each other, the way he'd blush with pleasure when he made me laugh. It was jealousy, but was it jealousy caused by a desire to have him, or was it jealousy that you did not have what we had, that your boyfriend sparked no passion in you, that your relationship was dying as our was bursting into life? I tried to ask you once. I say ask, but what I really did was lure you into saying it. You admitted you were attracted to him. I told you he would not want to hear that from his best friend's girlfriend, that it would make him uncomfortable. The truth. You flew into a rage, swore at me, stormed out of the apartment and didn't come back for days. This was a new thing for you, this ""not coming back."" You would often be absent for days at a time. Somewhere in my subconscious, it registered that this was your way of showing anger at me, but it was childish anger, and it was misplaced. It wasn't my fault you no longer loved your boyfriend. It wasn't my fault that the man you found attractive wanted me. We were both single. We'd been attracted at first glance. There was nothing wrong with us wanting each other. You started to lash out verbally. Slyly. Suddenly you were H's confidante, and lo and behold, according to you, he hated me! This man, who looked at me with so much tenderness? Get real. He didn't hate me, you were spreading rumors. I kept them to myself out of compassion for your boyfriend. How would he feel, knowing that you displayed such possessiveness towards his best friend? How would H feel, blaming himself for the inevitable demise of your relationship, should your boyfriend even find out about your secret passion for him? No. No. I wasn't going to tell anyone. It was between you and me. The insults too, the sudden hatred towards any woman who shared my characteristics. Suddenly you hated black hair, large eyes, caramel skin, high cheekbones. My figure made you angry. You couldn't get yourself to compliment me, even when others were telling me I looked divine. You would just quietly maintain composure, carefully trying to avoid looking at me. Pretending to be engrossed in something else. Pretending was something you did a lot during those end-days. I mostly pity your boyfriend. He didn't know you cheated on him with that guy from your high school, the one who you said you had an amazing connection with, a connection you had never felt before. Your boyfriend still doesn't know. God, do I feel sorry for him. I regret never telling him. You broke up with him soon after, so I let it be. But things are different now. You went back, always quick to pick up a person you had thrown away as long as it proved advantageous to you. That's the fundamental flaw with you, isn't it? You operate as if your actions have no consequences. In the interim of your relationship, I made the mortal mistake of continuing my friendship with him, staying over at his house during a time when my personal life and living situation was in so much turmoil that I was not safe in my own home. I had nowhere else to go, so I stayed there. He slept elsewhere. I took refuge in an empty house. When you found out, you exploded. You knew my situation, and yet you told me that the abuse I was suffering through, the abuse that had forced me to leave my house and travel to a city an hour away just so I could get space to breathe, a moment's rest between panic attacks, was not an ""excuse"" to justify ""insulting"" you. My trust in you shattered then. Three years out, and all I have to say to you is the same thing I wanted to say to you then: Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. You are inhuman. I don't know what happened after that. I was under the impression that our mutual friends were drawing away from me, but was it because of you, or was it because of me? Was I drawing away? I certainly couldn't cope with my life at that moment. I was undergoing a social amputation. Too much negativity had invaded my life, made me ill, made me want to crawl under my sheets and never emerge again. There seemed to always be wet shadows of tears upon my pillow. I had no energy to carry on meaningless pleasantries with friends who were fast becoming acquaintances. So I cut the deadweight. Kept only what was vital. Vital was not very much. Two years passed. You sent a text. It wasn't an apology. I wasn't interested. I sent you something that was vaguely polite and impersonal. Went about my life, my life that was now free of wet pillowcases and pills. Forgot about you. A year passed, and you tried again. This time you apologized. This time, I considered forgiving you. I thought about the friendship we had had. At one point, I had treasured that relationship. At one point, it had filled me with joy. I responded in a warmer manner, intending to address the hurt you had caused, and to elicit the reason behind the sudden, three-year-late apology. Instead, you told me your mother had died one year ago. That threw all my caution out the window. I felt genuine grief for you. And in a moment of compassion and vulnerability, I agreed to meet with you. I thought the meeting would be fine. Over text, you appeared to have changed. In person, you oscillated between friendliness and unfriendliness, clearly still harboring a grudge against me. I looked at you, looked at how changed you were, the bleached hair, the lack of makeup, the extra pounds. Heard your voice, the angry, bitter edge, the way you cut over me anytime I tried to speak, the way you tried to undermine and one-up anything I said. I could hardly recognize you. Because of the altered appearance and behavior, it took me a little while to understand on what level this lack of recognition was occurring. It wasn't just physical. It was emotional. I had looked at you sitting across from me as we caught up, and my brain had not registered a ""friend"". You were simply a stranger. Whatever bond we had had was no longer there for me. The friendship was gone. And I am glad that it is gone. I do not want you in my life. We cannot have a functional relationship together. I still do not know why you reached out to me so many years too late. I don't know why you're angry at me. I don't know how you justify cheating on a man who loved you, and how you can feel so little remorse that you would date him again. I don't know why you went into such a jealous fit of rage all those years ago. I don't want to know. Because the conclusion is the same: you have been a bad friend to me. And I don't need you in my life. If you've read all of this, thank you."

These are relative attributes to foist upon me; my financial residence is in a somewhat impoverished area, the epitome of working-class mediocrity, comprising of uneducated but well-meaning immigrants. I wonder if these epithets can be considered viable and legitimate when amplified to a global scale, not just confined to this narrow strait. This fear has evolved from a benign nuisance to an existential horror, where I contemplate over the breadth of my opportunities in accordance to my socio-economic position and my ""intelligence"". Case in point: the SAT, whose very thought is marred by an incident occurring a few months prior. The SAT is supposedly correlated to IQ and correlated with future triumphs in terms of academia and the general field of contribution. The root of my apprehension, which relates to that aforementioned incident. I'm a sophomore, took the PSAT -- canceled the score in sorrow. I was genuinely afraid; if I did badly on this exam, what does that say about myself? That I won't contribute to anything? That, in reality, my intelligence was nothing but a fickle illusion, engendered by the naivete of my peers? That I am doomed to failure, to dwell in this destitution, accomplishing nothing, left to rot like offal and then evaporate, my corpse decomposing into sand. Will nothing be left of my remains? I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. How can I say whether I'm an idiot or not if I lack a proper point of reference? Just bringing up the SAT brings up distress. Just bringing up IQ in general penetrates the very blemishing vulnerability my soul exhibits, that of immense insecurity, a chasm widening and widening until it tears the entire vessel by the seams! Whenever anyone on Reddit speaks of ""idiots"", how do I know he isn't speaking ill of my ""ilk""? Do I even belong to that maligned cohort? Those doomed to perdition? I'm repeating myself, but maybe I just don't want to know the truth of my prospects. Keeping it dark doesn't seem wise, but it's comforting although wrong."

I thought you were a dumb jock obsessed with popularity, you thought I was a stuck up nerd who tried too hard to stand out. We used to have explosive arguments in your parent's kitchen: about politics, about how sports are dumb, about privilege, about our friends... Somehow the friction wore us down. We got older. I helped you with your college essays. You used to invite me to your place while you watched football and I would curl up on your couch and read. We kissed a few times over the years; drunk in the hallway, against the wall in your bedroom...one time we had sex. No one knows. We pretended it never happened. We are so different externally, but inside we are similar. Your brother described us as ""madly in love, in denial and both terrified of emotional intimacy."" I never talked with him about you again. Perhaps he was right. Once, you tried to make it work; I ruined it. You were 25 and I was 21, struggling with an eating disorder, trying to get into a grad school across the county and so fucking ashamed. So fucking ashamed of myself, so terrified of what you would think if you knew the truth, knew about my issues, knew about my instability. You took me out on dates. You told me I was beautiful, you told me I was brilliant, you called me everyday. You opened up about yourself but I couldn't do the same. I couldn't handle vulnerability, so I pushed you away. When I broke down and told you we needed to stop, you kissed me one last time and told me I was a weirdo. Again, we pretended like it never happened. It's been 3 years. I moved to a few different cities and am now halfway through grad school. Tried to date around but nothing ever stuck. You have a girlfriend, you seem like you love her. Your brother says it won't last, but still, I am happy for you. Last night, I saw you. You gave me a big hug and kissed me on the cheek. All I wanted to do was cry in your arms and tell you everything I was too cowardly and stupid to say for the past 10 years. Of course, that would not be appropriate. I regret pushing you away in my early 20s. I have loved you since I was that little girl on the debate team falling for her best friend's obnoxious older brother. I never knew how to tell you. I feel like a such a fucking fool. I'm tired of being afraid of vulnerability. Right now I'm finally ready to love you, but you are not ready to love me. I guess that is life. All I can say is that next time, if there is ever a next time, I won't be such a coward. I will apologize. I will let you see my cry. I will be honest, painfully, painfully honest. I will tell you everything. Everything. Everything. Fucking hell, I really love you. I hope one day we can give us a shot. "

However there is one huge thing about everything I'm freaking out about. How my parents and friends may react if they discover she's trans. My mom and dad are both conservative(dad has already met her due to a car battery mishap and remarked by asking me ""who that guy I was with's name was"" I simply replied with ""Danielle"" and brushed it off as a joke when he made a comment about her hands being too big, mom lives in another state), plus they want grandkids, and I'm seriously concerned about a good portion of my friends casting me away if they find out. Thing is, I've already talked with her about my concerns and Dad's remarks; we agreed to hardass through it if the subject comes up. But to be honest, my mind is still murky about this. I broke down crying in my driveway for a minute after getting home from work.

Somebody was particularly pessimistic about relationships and marriage because he believes most relationships don't go well and most couples are usually unhappy. I agreed with him partially, being A person whose parents fought like frogs and dogs at A young age and whose mother and father were divorced. I also understand that divorce is only 40% of marriages, but still success wise ? Marriages get A D. I got called an incel for saying : ""Divorce rates don't lie."" I talked about the divorce rate because 1.) 2 things happen when 2 people who are dating don't understand each other emotionally, either divorce or cheating. 2.) My parents got divorced, I needed knowledge to dominate that fact to make my peace with it, so fuck off. 3.) We live in A society where the people growing up value status, being right, and being better than other people , at our core that is what our values are as A whole in society, sorry but that's just the way it is .There are VERY few people who actually just want to help just for the sake of helping or doing good, and its DISTURBING how many people want to do good so they can feel better about themselves or feel superior to people around them. But that aside. . . . Here is the thing. . . .This isn't the first time I've been called that. . . . . I've also been called an incel back when I had troubles with girls and was talking about how angry and frustrated I was with them. No gendered slurs, no bigotry, yet admittedly A bit of objectification, and more importantly? An understanding that I could do better and the problem was me. You know what one girl said? ""You're still on the slippery slope to becoming an incel."" A slippery slope is A fallacy. . . . .And she says : ""Yeah but still."" NO. You don't ignore the fact that what you said Is LITERALLY incorrect factually and then try to defend it, that's bullshit. And you know what? I've met actual incels on this site, those people HATE women. You know what they do? They use terms like: "" THOT."" or talk about women only like ""money"" or ""tall guys"" or ""good looking guys."" Fuck, one guy frustrated me SO much with his b/s, he thinks women are shallow and vain and only want tall handsome guys. Otherwise, why is no one dating? Because, women don't tolerate social inadequacy anymore. Neediness, objectifying, and A lack of grace, honesty, refusal to show vulnerability and a lack of style is unappealing in A society full of guys who have ALL of those things and don't want to bother getting rid of them. I figured this out and I got better. Fuck, I went out for new years last night and had SUCH A good time, I danced with A bunch of girls and A bunch of guys and flirted with a bunch of girls and A bunch of guys(Tee hee!) You know how many girls rejected me? Lots. You know how many guys rejected me? All of them. you know how many fucks I gave? 0, because I just wanted to have fun, and have fun I did. Even shared my new years kiss with A stranger. So you know what? Before you have the BALLS to call me an incel? You had BETTER be having A better time with women and friends than I am right now, because unless you are? I don't wanna hear shit from you. I'm not an incel. I don't blame my previous or future women problems on women, I blame them on me. I don't justify said blame with clever ""facts"" about the gynocentric elements of our society brought up by A patriarchal upbringing in A status obsessed world. I don't use words like :""Thot"", I mean FUCK that's usually A person I unfriend on facebook within days! This is not meant to correct anyone's thought processes, the people who are going to call me an incel made up their minds already. This isn't meant to sway anyone's opinion on me, as I don't need approval from figurative objects. This is not A post to make me feel better about myself, I'm doing fine and I'm happy, but I wanted the catharsis of telling people who use the word ""incel"" like the word ""fuck"" how much they suck.

I could never verify anything, because we had dated long distance. This is the last of those mails, after ""Alexa"" tells me that Taylor has passed away, and her last words were my name. I let this email fester unopened for years, and I'm finally typing a reply to get this off my chest.** **Taylor, by the way, is definitely alive and well. I saw her in her brother's wedding pictures.** **The email is quoted, interspersed with my responses.** ------------------------- &gt;Tue 9/1/2015 &gt;It's human nature to justify every choice we make so we can live with ourselves, despite having said that I can't leave what you said undisputed. I'm fully aware of the fact that it might not even get through to you and perhaps you might not even read it but it's not fair to Taylor for me to remain silent and not come to her defense. Youve every right to defend yourself, Taylor. No need to fake your death to do so. &gt;I know why you bothered with Taylor, the reasons are probably very similar to why I did. Taylor was always very charming, intelligent, attractive, passionate, romantic, determined and inspiring. (I could obviously go on and on.) Having lived an ugly life she remained beautiful in every aspect. Holy shit youre full of yourself. Instead of accepting a break-up for what it is, youre here trying to convince me of what I missed out on. I broke up with you on very clear terms, and even on friendly terms. My great mistake, and its mostly one of inexperience, was letting the shitshow after the breakup drag on. I should have cut contact immediately. Instead I spent nights consoling you, trying not to hurt your feelings as you flipped back and forth between begging to stay in touch as friends, and begging for me to take you back. I went along with your bullshit cancer story. And trust me, I knew it was bullshit. The part of me that didnt want to accept that you were a spiteful liar kept me invested for far too long. So here you are, after your bullshit cancer story didnt suck me back in, and even your bullshit resurfacing ex didnt make me want you back. Now youre here acting the martyr, trying to impress on me what I let go of. Well, heres my perspective of all the things you were to me: Overwhelming, aggressive, emotional, controlling, jealous, vengeful, dishonest, and unreasonable. I dumped you for a fucking reason, and I wish I had sooner. &gt;Perhaps the relationship may have been an escape for you but I don't think it was that way for her. The micocosm you lived in was to appease you. Hah, is that why I got yelled at if I wasnt available on Skype every free second that I had? Is that why you got jealous of every friend I made? I remember scrambling to make myself available to you despite my busy schedule in Shenyang, calling you after breakfast, messaging you between classes, calling you after class, after work, at night. It was never enough. I remember getting yelled at for drinking a cup of tea with a colleague after work. I remember getting yelled at because I didnt always have internet in Turkey. I remember getting yelled at because I didnt work to come be with you as soon as possible, even though you never even entertained the option of contributing, or coming to visit yourself. You selfish abusive fuck. Youre right, microcosm was the wrong word. It was classic isolation. &gt;From my understanding of what I learned was that you have a history of being malnourished in terms of love, affection and attention which was why Taylor seemed to be so compelled to make herself available to you at all times to give you whatever you needed and wanted. Taylor was the first one who paid attention to you and fought to get through to you, the first one who said she would always be there and I believe she was. Yes, I was. I had a great big history of depression, isolation, and a shit childhood. You came along and told me I was worthy of being loved. I still thank you for that, but your love isnt the unconditional thing youre claiming it was. You idealised me, you were ridiculously possessive of me. And I was a doormat because I thought this was what a relationship should be. But hey, let me turn this thing around. Lets take a look at you, Taylor. You felt out of control of your life. You had a sexually abusive and crazy ex who still bothered you, who made you feel dirty, you had a suffocating home situation, you had an unbearably painful past. I wont name specifics, because I dont know which things were true, and which ones you lied about - but boy, you came from some shit. Then you meet me. Im the first person who looks at you, and tells you with conviction that youre a good person, that your circumstances were shit, and that you are worth something. You see me as vulnerable, so you feel like you can protect me - it makes you feel good about yourself. You see me as pure, and for my love of you to be worth anything, I must remain pure and sweet and beautiful in your eyes. You treat me like Im redemption. I become your escape from hell. You put all of that burden on me. &gt;The email I chose was one that surprised me because you expressed an intense remorse for causing Taylor any pain, the fact that you caused her pain made you distraught and heartbroken. Oh yeah, theres that. The endless cycles of blowups that I had to grovel for. I felt so fucking guilty all the time. I remember crying and apologising one day because you got mad at me for saying the time wrong: half past four instead of four thirty. So, that email. What was that about again? I think its one of these three catastrophic sins I committed: -Not callously condemning my friend as a manipulator when she (RELUCTANTLY) confessed having developed feelings for me. Because clearly, she was a predator, out to break us up. (In retrospect, man I should have dumped you and gone with Ryo. I doubt the long distance would have worked out, but she was intelligent, beautiful, funny, and sane.) Poor fucking Ryo. I wish I could apologise to her. I still think about her. -Going to China to study. You were never once proud of me - going abroad to learn a language, see the world, and work. Instead, you became a resentful jerk. -Going to Turkey after China. A sin because: A) I wasnt back at my dead-end job, saving up to visit you while you made no such effort yourself. B) I sometimes had a poor internet connection, and was therefore abandoning you. I honestly have no idea how you got me to feel so hysterically guilty about that one. Oh wait, I do. Four years of gaslighting, lol. &gt;It surprised me because whatever you did then seems like nothing in comparison to the ugly things that transpired between the two of you in the end You mean breaking up, remaining broken up despite your bests efforts at pleading and manipulating, and even daring to ask for my stuff back? Yeah, I guess thats worse than going to university or visiting my father. &gt;yet right now you seem so unapologetic and practically nonchalant. You could actually be feeling justified and at peace, perhaps in time it'll change or maybe not. I know things may not be what they seem and maybe you just don't want to show your pain or vulnerability to me. Because I am finally free. No, I no longer feel guilty for your issues, and I am not in any pain. &gt;The false hope that you speak of...is more complicated than you let on. (Oh, go choke on your false intellectualism will you.) &gt;I saw the conversations and I'm fully aware of what transpired, (By the way, I dont know if Alexa ever existed, but this is so obviously you, its hilarious.) &gt;that false hope didn't seem so false whenever you confessed your love or fed your ego at the expense of her heart. I understand that it's easier to wash your hands and act like it wasn't because of you, I understand your burning desire to free yourself from all responsibility and blame but that doesn't make it right and it doesn't make it true. What are you even talking about here? I remember I was damned if I did, and damned if I didnt. Yes, there were feelings. Those didnt burst and disappear after I dumped you, but I was pretty clear that I wasnt going to date you again. And if I said anything after your incessant pushing and probing, perhaps the pressure was somewhat of a factor, man. Just throwing the possibility out there. &gt;I will admit that Taylor's episodes of hysteria can't be blamed solely on your actions and words. I also was to blame by driving her over the edge at times as was her condition both physically and emotionally by default. There has to be some consideration that she had multiple brain tumors, was suffering extreme amounts of stress and coping with trauma from the rape, death of family members and the little boy Zack. However, you shouldn't have kicked her while she was already down, there is no need for me to repeat or list all the things you've done, you know what you said, you know your own actions. Still dont know if all of those were lies. The cancer definitely was, though. I dont know if there was a way I could have broken up with you without setting off your crazy in full, but I think any kicking I did (such as not dating you again, I guess) pales in comparison to your bullshit. &gt;Whatever sins you feel Taylor committed against you weren't her fault. It isn't fair to say that neither of you sinned more than the other considering your sins were by your own choice and hers weren't. Lets be frank here: YOU FAKED YOUR OWN DEATH TO MAKE ME FEEL BAD FOR DUMPING YOU. YOU ARE NUTS. &gt;You can't hold that against her, her own body turned against her. You are absolutely right I did want you to stop talking to you because it was hurting her but that was before circumstances changed. Once the false hopes weren't in Taylor's mind but instead a reality with you saying you considered the possibility of marrying her, once the false hopes started to seem like something to happen, once you crossed that line and got involved with her in that way there was no excuse to leave her like that. You say you still loved her but when you love someone you do not leave it to others to show love to your beloved while you sit back in the shadows. You show the love you have, you take things into your own hands especially when the stakes are high. Luckily the stakes here were pretty low. This is delusional reasoning. First, you fake an illness to keep me emotionally involved. You keep pounding on the fact that you need me to be there for you. Man, I did crack a few times. I didnt want you to have a terminal disease, nor did I want you to be a liar. I still loved and trusted you to some extent, and I said some dumb shit - like entertaining the notion of interrupting university to go take care of my ex in America. I wonder what would have happened if I did. Were you going to fake cancer when I was there in person? Or magically be in remission? &gt;You say that you did it so she wouldn't suffer and have negative feelings but Taylor felt things so deeply that once you crossed that line it was impossible. Thats not what I said. What I said was, word for word: - *Im sorry this is so painful. I just know that I finally needed to stop taking the path of least resistance. I really needed to be firm in this decision to be alone, like I should've been from the beginning. I know this is the right thing for both of us, even if it's unbearable right now. You will be able to evaluate your perspective and your feelings as well. Some distance from me is going to ultimately do you good, Taylor, even if you don't believe me right now. I am proud of you, I know you're a fighter. I know you're going to keep being awesome, and I wish for only the best. This is the last message I will send.*  This was when I was still playing along with the cancer story, and the resurfacing of Alexa the ex. So to put that paragraph in even simpler language: I stopped talking to you because it was unhealthy and unproductive. You said you wanted to be friends, but you were having constant breakdowns because I wouldnt date you again. It was fucking draining the life out of me, and it was clearly unhealthy for you. I hoped you would finally move on, because talking to you was clearly giving you the wrong idea. I hope you finally did move on and find some peace after your dramatic symbolic death to me. You went as far as to fake your disease and your death to mutual friends (of which we had like two. You didnt really like people taking my attention away from you.) &gt;Your words, your actions would haunt her in her dreams and she could not rid herself of the turmoil she felt. She loved you unconditionally despite everything you ever said or did. Despite everything I did like saying the time wrong, and falling asleep at 3 am because I was six timezones ahead of you and trying to keep you company on Skype despite my exhaustion. Im so glad I no longer have to wake up to did you fall asleep on me again?? Seriously?! [Taylor signed off]. Abusive, demanding, unreasonable jerk. &gt;No matter how angry that made me I couldn't help but think it was beautiful. It made me so angry sometimes I felt like those asians in the horror movies Taylor loved so much and wanted to give you a grudge like curse. Yes, because you are Alexa, Taylors asian ex, and not Taylor, the fat Puerto Rican who kept telling me about this ex that she picked me over because she looooooves me, and not Alexa - even though *Alexaaahhh* is pretty like a model, a professional ballerina, singer, violinist, outgoing and popular, and skinnier than me. *Alexaaaa* may be all that, but you love *me* because Im kind! I developed an eating disorder over this shit. You watched me develop this inferiority complex and shrink down to a size zero (but she was always still thinner than me, of course), you lying manipulative heartless fuck. &gt;I agree, I can't hold you responsible for how she dealt with her illness. I just know that your lack of support and love was noted. She needed all the love and strength she could get, you withholding it when you were the most important person to her was noticed. Thats cool. You know what I noticed? Whenever you Skype messaged me from the hospital or Alexas house, video calls were not an option. You never took off the bandana you wore over your thyroid surgery scar. You never showed me the medication or the medical papers. &gt;Either way as a consequentialist or even as a deontologist which I suspect you are, I mean, as a first semester philosophy student, I hadnt really specialized in in a field of ethics yet, but good on you for googling terms to impress me with. &gt;your actions, your choices were immoral. Even if you claim to have no single clue what your choices may lead to, the decisions about them weren't exactly for Taylor's sake and were to spite her. For example, the box drama. Ah, the box. I asked you to mail me my stuff - like a watch my mother gave me, and some clothes I bought. Preferably, I wanted the things she had given me in the past as well. Pretty fair, I thought, seeing as I gifted you hundreds of dollars worth of PSN gift cards and subscription box services that I clearly wasnt going to ask back, either. &gt;Before you make excuses, the things she didn't send you didn't matter because you didn't buy them and you knew she was struggling to pay for her medical expenses and needed the money. She sent you what you paid for and that's all you needed. If you want to argue that it was a gift from when you were together I will argue it's a gift you rejected in the first place and if you didn't want it when you loved her, you shouldn't have wanted it when you left her. Its fine. I remember us arguing about this watch. I didnt really like the one you picked for me, because Im not really into Invicta. Classic you spent money on this gift, but I dont think Ill really wear it. You never forgot, and you never forgave me for my insolence on that one. I just accepted the gift, in the end. Asked you to put it in the box along the rest of my stuff after the breakup, because I lost hundreds on visa and college paperwork at the end of our relationship - I was making a last effort to be with you. I was going to sell that watch. I think you beat me to that idea, though. Good on you. &gt;I suspect you wanted it to impress your friends with your new expensive things but c'est la vie, you've obviously never been through a break up before and it was unreasonable to demand or even want those things, especially after the way you treated her. I love how you smugly rub in my face that I was never able to impress my friends with your tacky Invicta watch. But again, for clarity, the items I asked for were my own possessions: my mothers watch, a few clothes, a few gifts that I did want to keep - a lipstick, a cheap bracelet. Nothing like what I spent on you. It became drama because you pretended to be too sickly to mail a box, and because I insisted. Threw most of the clothes out, tbh because I was no longer disordered enough to fit into them. &gt;I feel like this quote describes you perfectly, ""Some people aren't loyal to you. They are loyal to their need of you. Once their need changes, so does their loyalty."" Ah, from google philosophy to facebook wisdoms. &gt;You never had to stay with Taylor out of guilt or pity, but you owed it to her to be a decent human being. She was there for you when nobody else was, You also made sure that nobody else could be there, ever. You claimed me and isolated me. You were obsessed with it being us against a cruel world. And I guess I appreciate now exactly how monstrous you considered the world to be. &gt;just because you had attention from new people didn't make it right to shun her the way you did. She taught you what you needed to know to even play the game but once you started playing you left her behind. You don't regret it now because you're reveling in the attention others are giving you but soon you'll understand why Taylor was so important and why you won't be able to find anyone else like her and how you fucked up. Nope. Three years in, and Im happy and healthy. I am grateful to my friends for giving me the clarity and support to finally get out. Perhaps one day, if everyone I know cruelly abandons me, Ill take this paragraph seriously. &gt;I never hated you, I hated your actions. I find it really strange how you try to act like you've above me at the end of that email when you spent so many years calling me lame names to try and make yourself feel better because you have always been so insecure about me. You have every reason to feel that way. I am better than you in every way. Especially after everything that has happened because when Taylor came to me, when she needed me, I was there until the end. I guess, despite everything, I dont hate you either. I found it painful to re-read this email. My responses have been joking, and Ive finally let out a lot of my anger at you, but this is something I cant joke about: Taylor, I hope youre in a better state of mind now. You have always had so much fury against the world, and I know youve been through shit. I have never thought that you treated me the way you did out of an intention to abuse. I think you were desperate, and you felt like you needed to secure this one thing that you thought was good. Im sorry that you felt you had to do all of this, but I no longer take responsibility for it. I wish you a good life, I hope you will one day find peace and happiness within yourself. &gt;If you get to the bottom of this email, I feel like you deserve a reward. How about you choke on a dick? As for your condolences, I think you may have an idea where to place them. Oh, yeah, after we broke up, I definitely started having sex with men. Im happy to report that I dont have much of a gag reflex. Havent choked so far, and boy, some of those cocks were biiiiig. &gt;KTHXBAI. Yes, goodbye. &gt;P.S. Where do you want me to send Taylor's last words to you? P.S. I still wonder what you would have done if I had been dumb enough to give you my new address."

Part one",2,7paagc,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7paagc/i_remember_when_we_met_up_again_after_four_years/,2018-01-10 08:11:03,"I had moved to London and when I did my emotions just blinkered out of existence. I am a very emotional person, pathologically so, so to spend the first 8 months feeling absolutely nothing was so very strange, and sad, but most of all boring. I was bored to fucking tears all the time. I moved for a job. One I didn't want, but three years on the dole will force you into roles you just weren't built for. I'm not built for the private sector. I was built to dream about changing the world, about going into academia and really making a difference. But emotions had fucked up my degree and so I was forced to travel to the big smoke for the final admittance of defeat. My dreams were going to have to wait. When I accepted that job I stopped caring for the longest time. I got fired from my first job and wound up in a company that was profoundly unsuitable. No one cared who I was and I spent a month desperately trying to fill my days as those who hired me seemed to have no idea why they needed me. Then I messaged you out of the blue. The last time we spoke we were making half plans to meet up in Thailand. You, an excited young backpacker with dreams of South East Asian adventures, and me an old hand whose dad lived there. I was going to show you round. I was going to give you the best possible time. I never made it. Life, unemployment, and the eternal grind of looking for a job stopped me making the trip. I will always be sorry for missing my chance to see you then. I messaged you four years later and we made plans to meet in your home country. I needed to get out of London and you agreed to let me stay at yours. I missed the first flight, and missed you birthday. I had to reschedule for the next month. I made sure I got the flight that time. I bought you gin from duty free. I was worried we wouldn't have anything to say to each other after all this time. I was worried there would be awkward silences and stilted chat. I needn't have worried. We fell into our old conversations and jokes like nothing had changed. We got drunk on gin and competed on your karaoke system. You told me about your life. I told you about mine. You were still weird and quirky but the intervening years had been kind to you. You were now not only fun and hilarious and fiercely intelligent but profoundly beautiful. More than that. For the first time in 8 months I felt something. I felt emotions. You lifted that grey veil that had covered my whole life in dull grey London to reveal you smiling, you laughing. We spent the weekend almost exclusively in bed together. Nothing happened between us though I badly wanted it to. Instead we watched the entirety of Stranger Things and John Wick and laughed at the jokes and regretted the death of the dog. It was one of the happiest weekends I have ever spent. When it came to say goodbye I was almost crying. I asked you to come with me. I was only half joking. You laughed, hugged me and left me at the station. I was barely on the train before you texted me. The time I spent with you profoundly changed me. I came back to London determined to be better so that the next time you saw me you would be proud of me. I joined a gym. I worked incredibly hard at my job as I sought to contribute what I could as the company failed around me. We continued to text every day. Multiple times a day. You made me hope for a better life. A better mental health. I couldn't stop drinking too much. I would get blisteringly drunk and message you at three in the morning complaining. You were trying to get through your masters and starting an internship in a big tech company. I annoyed you with my incessant need to speak to you. But you always forgave me. You talked to me about personal stuff going on in your life as well. You talked about your kinks and being a sub. When I told you I was a dom you teased me by calling me Sir. It made me want to fly back over and jump on you! Then you told me about your eating disorder. I loved you. I was obsessed with you. I was scared I was going to hurt you if I got too close to you. When you revealed you had a vulnerability I was petrified that I would really hurt you. I have done it before. I was trying to be better. I told you I needed a break. I told you it wasn't about what you told me. It was me. I felt so scared. We didn't speak for three months. I got a new job in an amazing tech company and fell in love with the place. I got this amazing manager who coaxed me into becoming better than I was. He was a serious gym guy and encouraged me to sign up for a personal trainer. I lost 10 KG and built muscle whilst developing an actual career and setting goals for progressing. Still every day I dreamt of you. Still every day I got better so I could be the man you deserved. I dated but it rarely went anywhere. I just kept dreaming of you. After three months I got back in touch with you through email. It felt safer to put that distance between us. At first we seemed to pick up as where we left off. Then you became distant. I suspected you knew I had feelings for you as you slowly put up a wall between us. By the time I flew out to see you we were arguing. A lot. "

I am letting it out on here because I feel as if my family would never believe me and I honestly dont want them to know even though they know a little already. So to start about 3 tears ago Tbilisi mother of my kids and I split. It was very hard for me and I was vulnerable. After months of crying and wondering what to do. I decided I wanted to meet some one. Even though I was in no position emotionally. I used tinder at the time I just wanted to have some fun nothing serious. I met a woman on there not in person just texting and she knew my roommate so I decided it wasnt a good idea. Sometime later I was contacted on Facebook by a female I never met and we began talking. Eventually turned into sexting and trading pictures. One night it went from normal to nightmare. This woman in question starting threatening to send all the pics and texts to my ex which at the time I wanted back even though I knew it wasnt possible I still held on to hope. So with this she knew my weakness and thats where it got really bad. She got my roommates info and at the time he had a lot of money. To make this more understandable she is a hacker as well. Well atleast I think she is I other explanation of how she gets her info. With this info that she has on me and the info she stole on my roommate (Im dont want to get him involved anymore then he is so I dont want to go into to much detail on him). She had things we didnt want to get out and also personal info such as social security numbers. So with her info and my vulnerability she began her reign of terror. She would listen to me on my phone through the speaker. Watch security cameras around the city, cameras at work, associates I knew phones, text why am I doing this where am I going as she followed my cell phone signal. Thats not that bad compared to what happened next. She made us do sexual acts together and video them and send to her or she would do a number of things resulting in my roommate and I loosing everything. My biggest concern was losing my kids. I felt as if she were to do the things she said she would I would be in prison and with nothing. The profile she used to talk to me she claimed was underage and the photos I sent I would be considered a pedaphile. My roommate stand to loose a bunch of money so he participated because of that. This went on for a year. She claimed to be apart of anonymous and lived in Mexico. She had a team of woman hell bent on making men suffer. This is still going on today. The woman was called Jenna. She had a girlfriend named Jessica that was her right hand man. Jessica became against what she was doing and started taking to me and going against Jenna. Or so she says. For the last two years I have been talking to this Jessica, she claims to love me and has moved to my state I reside in. I am nice to her as on she and the ppl she associate with can do a lot with computers and phones. She claims to be dying from poisoning of draino . She claims Jenna made her drink draino when she wouldnt do as she was told. She texts me everyday. I know this sounds like something made up or out of a movie but this is one hundred and ten percent true and is only1% of all the things that have happened since she has come into my life. I truly hate her. My life will never be he sane and I dont look at anything the way I used to. Im paranoid a hermit and dont trust a soul now. She has made my life a living hell on the past and well after three years of this it has become normal but with suffering from depression and high anxiety almost everyday is a challenge and keeping it together for my two sons is all the motivation I need. I have never told anyone this outside my roommate and maybe some one on here can relate. But it feels good just to get this out there. "
578,vulnerability,offmychest,I dont approve of my friends methods of picking up women/the women he pursues .,3,7pvdl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7pvdl3/i_dont_approve_of_my_friends_methods_of_picking/,2018-01-12 19:53:32,I recently was contacted by a female friend of mine asking for advice on a situation involving one of my other friends. To I guess put it simply and provide a better idea. My female friend revealed that my friend tried to pressure her into having drunk sex with him. While that alone upsets me because he is someone I thought I could trust...I realized and have to come to terms that Ive known hes been kind of like this and didnt want to accept it. Ive always had a suspicion and Its kind of been eating away at me whether he may actually be like this or not. Another thing that I realize is that the women he gets involved with are usually going through something. In this case my female friend is going through a divorce. But in previous accounts one person had gone through a break up and a few girls I know of were not in the best place emotionally or in their relationships. I dont want to say he takes advantage of women but in a lot of these situations I realize they follow kind of the same setups. I know he isnt the type to force himself on someone but after seeing the messages of how he suggestively tries to get to girl to say yes to it I feel disgusted honestly. Not angry but honestly disappointed in him and the fact hes trying to take advantage of someone whos in a period of vulnerability. In one sense I want to confront him but my female friend says its not that bad and that Im overreacting just she wasnt sure how to go about things since she was supposed to come and hang out with all of us at my place this weekend. While Im also kind of floored by this and want to ask my other friends for advice I dont want to cause an uproar if I am over reacting. I just cant help shake the feeling now that my friend does something so dishonest to someone just so he can get his rocks off.

Okay. This is a very typical adolescent problem but I am living two different lives. In general, Im a very outgoing person in school, I have a lot of good friends, I work hard, blah blah blah but I DO NOT and I WILL NOT ever talk about anything personal to any of my friends (or to anyone that isnt the literal entire internet.) I hate when my friends meet my mom or when they ask to hang out at my house or literally anything that involves them realizing how messed up everything that isnt the facade Ive created in public. Ive never admitted this out loud but Im so embarrassed when my friends meet my mom (because she honestly doesnt know how to act proper in public, doesnt understand how things work in America, etc.) Ive worked really really hard to be this perfect, straight A, outgoing student and I really really want it to stay this way because the one time one of my friends found out that Im on welfare, that I dont have two parents, that my mother doesnt know how to be a mom, etc. there was this feeling of just utter vulnerability and judgement and I hate it. Ive been doing this for years and Ive been able to motivate myself to get through years of my mothers bullshit, but earlier this year I got cast on a tv show and I thought this would be the day I could finally be successful without having the burden of my mother and having to cover up my personal life, but wow I couldnt have been more wrong. It turns out since Im still a minor my mother has to be with me in the dressing room every. single. second. and I have to be around her all the fucking time. Not only that but my (half) brother had to be taken out of school and stay in my condo while Im filming so we had to hire a nanny and now theres four people living in a small two bedroom condo. Now my personal life is merging with everything else that isnt supposed to merge. I worked so hard to be successful on my own at only 16, but my mother ruins it all by being absolutely embarrassing and so inappropriate. I am absolutely sick of this bullshit. I work so fucking hard and I did it all on my own only to have all this shit and now its a mess. I just want to go back to being two different people instead of constantly feeling ashamed. This is a huge cliche but I KNOW I can live on my own and sustain myself. My mother does not know how to raise a fucking kid because SHE IS a fucking kid (she had me as a teenager) AND she doesnt fucking having the financial stability to sustain herself LET ALONE two fucking kids. For the past 16 years I have had to fucking raise myself, motivate myself through school, work my fucking ass off at the age of 14 when I started auditioning for TV shows and movies, AND deal with fucking anxiety after her fucking ex-husband molested me. Ive built a life for myself, I now make more money than her in 3 months than she does in a whole year, I take as many AP classes/Dual enrollment classes as I can, and when she would pretend not to see me crying or tell me to shut up when I asked for her help I learned to help myself. She is absolutely useless. She doesnt do ANYTHING a mother is supposed to do (we live with my aunt, she has no income, she tells me to shut up when Im sad, and shes always borrowing money from me) YET she has the AUDACITY to tell me that I will always need her LIKE NO I CLEARLY DO FUCKING NOT. like am I going crazy? Im pretty sure Ive achieved more in just 16 years than she has in her whole fucking life yet she genuinely, honest to god thinks that. *To get things straight, if she was the kind of my mom that was emotionally caring and I was able to see that she was really trying her hardest then I would not be complaining. I value merit and work ethic, but this is not the case with my mother. She doesnt work hard at all. She has always been emotionally inarticulate (i.e. pretending not to see me crying after I literally just told her that her husband did all that shit) I am just so incredibly infuriated that she thinks that shes a good mom because she didnt abandon me like her mom did. NEWSFLASH; just because you didnt abandon me DOESNT MAKE YOU A GOOD MOM. Ive been so scared to say this out loud because I always thought I sounded like an ungrateful, angsty teenager but I dont fucking care anymore. I am tired of underestimating myself and feeling guilty. Please tell me if this is just a rebellious phase or something because I cant stand this weighing over me. "

I guess they all do. In college, I was that guy kicking drunk predators out of my fraternity's parties. I've been in a handful of long term relationships so I've always been a popular platonic friend. Even when I was single, just friends never bothered me. In fact, I often preferred that. This was just before college though when I lived for a year in my own place in the city. I invited a girl who was a year or two younger than me to come hangout at my pool. We weren't super close but had kind of recently become friends. I was recently single but I had no intentions with her, just messing around. At one point, her top got loose and I thought it would be funny if I yanked on the string. She laughed, I laughed, yada yada. I thought it was a funny game and so I persisted  I did it like three more times before the afternoon was over. To me it was kind of a flirty game. The day ended, she went home, so did I. I moved away to go to college shortly after that and we rarely talked. My sophomore year, I randomly texted her to see how she was doing. We talked briefly and she made some comment like ""the last time I saw you, you were sexually harassing me and trying to strip me in public."" I was horrified. That wasn't how I remembered it at all. I said something along the lines of thats definitely not what I remember but sure and I stopped replying. Its been four years since that conversation. I saw plenty of awful things in college  guys who took advantage of situations without true consent  and I swore I would never be that. One time when I was my fraternity chapters president, I pulled a clearly intoxicated girl away from a bad situation, took her to her place, helped her into bed and despite her asking me to stay, left. The next day, she told me how shocked she was that I was respectful enough to not take advantage of her vulnerability. That was one of many days I realized how bad it really is for girls in college  that a normal guy doing a normal thing like not raping/assaulting a drunk female was somehow an accomplishment. Lately, Ive seen a lot of the #MeToo stories come to the forefront of the news. Initially, I thought to myself Im so glad I was raised right to not do those types of things. Then one day, I remembered that girl from the pool. I wasnt better than anyone. I was part of the problem just like everyone else. I was the reason she could have tweeted #MeToo. That realization was almost soul crushing. It took me a few days to build up the courage but I texted her a few days ago. I explained that I had no excuse, that I didnt expect or need a reply from her, but she was owed the truth from me: what I did was wrong, was without consent, and Im sorry for putting her in that situation. Even more, Im sorry for the way I blew her off when she first told me how it made her feel. Im the problem just like all the guys I thought I was better than. She didnt reply until yesterday. She just said thank you. I really appreciate that. I left it alone after that. I know this is long winded but its something I just want to get out there. The #MeToo movement, victims speaking out publically for the first time in the news every day, it does more than raise awareness for other victims. In my case, it was the reason I realized I was a part of the problem. Not because I was a frequent offender but because my mindset was wrong. The first step in changing is acknowledging that I have contributed to the same problem that has hurt millions of women. I hope this was the first step in me becoming a part of the solution instead."

And I've been afraid of not being vulnerable because the only other way I know of dealing with others is being really cold. And I'm scared of being that person because I've been there before and there are awful feelings of pain. And for as disastrous as my past behaviors have been, they have manifested attempts to feel closer to someone.

583,vulnerability,offmychest,I (25) think I fell out of love with my girlfriend despite her being everything I could ever want on paper and I'm scared to leave her.,12,7g1o3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7g1o3t/i_25_think_i_fell_out_of_love_with_my_girlfriend/,2017-11-28 15:59:58,"&amp;nbsp; We met through a dating app almost two years ago. She's very much my type in both personality and looks. I couldn't have designed someone more align with my preferences who shares my sense for adventure and getting the most out of life. Its the first real girlfriend I've had outside of high school and the longest I've every been with someone continuously. We've been the center of each others lives for the past ~2 years and have gone on many adventures together. We share similar interests and dispositions towards life which is very important to me. &amp;nbsp; despite all of this I think I'm falling out of love with her. It all stemmed from some issues that culminated in the closest thing to a ""fight"" we've had. The core issue was a religious difference and my parents lack of approval of the relationship (they refuse to even meet her). She wants to push the relationship further with possibility of marriage in mind while I see the relationship as more of companionship and a partnership of growing together. I feel too young and immature to have thoughts of marriage. However we live in a part of the country where people tend to get married young and there are few single people our age. &amp;nbsp; Since her attempt to push the relationship in a more serious direction I anticipated that she might break up with me when the (already known) religion issue was brought up. I mentally prepared myself to leave the conversation single however much to my surprise she made some good points and when she thought she might lose me over the issue and she expressed interest in converting in order to keep me. Shocked, I was at a loss of how to proceed. Seeing her in that moment where the relationship was on the brink of breaking I saw how much more she was in love with me than I was in love with her. She admitted to thinking I might be ""the love of her life"" &amp;nbsp; Something about the conversation and seeing her cry over me and the lack of progression of the relationship somehow made me like her less and I dont know why. Maybe it scared me, maybe I never thought of the relationship as that serious per the religious difference. Something about that vulnerability and realizing that she may be more into me than I am into her surprised me. There is a quote from bojack horseman that keeps coming to mind ""when you see someone as they really are, it ruins them"" &amp;nbsp; We're on a temporary break now. Not seeing other people but not talking either, in order to give me some time to think. I've found that I miss her and having her there for me but mostly in a physical sense of having someone there for me. But I don't know if I miss HER specifically. It has been hard having certain things happen and wanting to share them with her, realizing I cant share with her and dont really have anyone else to share it with. &amp;nbsp; I'm so conflicted here is a girl who is gorgeous, has hair in my favorite hair color, likes the same hobbies as me, is DRIVEN (sadly hard to find where I live) and motivated, academic, smart and clever. We have some similar life goals but some things dont align like the religious difference. &amp;nbsp; I've never experienced anything like this before and I don't know what to do or even how to break up with someone. This also scares me that if I stopped liking this girl who is everything I could have dreamed of how will I ever find someone who I will continue to like after things get rough. The thought that I'm just bored with the relationship scares me too. **help, guidance, words of encouragement appreciated** &amp;nbsp; more complicated I have a history of HSV and never thought anyone as cool as this girl would want anything to do with me. I'm scared to have to face that all again in the single world, what if I cant find someone whos ok with it again? (never passed along to anyone else to my knowledge and its basically a non-issue but still the concern is there. "
584,vulnerability,offmychest,Was molested by 16YO(F) friend when I was 14(F),2,7i0hvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7i0hvf/was_molested_by_16yof_friend_when_i_was_14f/,2017-12-07 06:24:47,"I have probably typed, deleted, re-typed and then deleted this over a hundred times over the last year. I have thought of every possible way to say this, every possible way to phrase it, every possible way to explain what happened and to somehow put it into perspective. For a while I struggled with how I could try to keep from condemning the person that did this to me but then I realized that was the exact wrong thing to do and, once again, deleted everything and started re-typing. So now, here I am once again, typing and re-typing in hopes of one of my attempts finally getting to see the light of day. Maybe this one will- the events of yesterday with what came to light about Melanie Martinez fits this ironically well. A girl I considered to be my very best friend in 2015 when I was only 14 was very, very sweet and kind. She was optimistic, loud, bright and affectionate with myself and all of her other friends. She had known me since I was 11 and she 13, the two of us becoming some of the most unlikely friends and eventually growing very close. I was a very vulnerable, affection-deprived kid from a very broken, abusive home that had never allowed me to have friends or people that cared about me aside from my dad and his side of the family. This girl was older then me, if only by a year and a half, and as time went on we got closer and closer. She was the best thing to ever happen to me; the first sense of comfort and real-life caring that Id ever experienced besides the few members of my family that truly loved me. Until things went south. Her comforting me did not stay innocent. I was vulnerable, she claimed to have feelings for me, and even when I said no she pushed. The more I said no the more that she said I was being unfair to her and hurting her. She guilted me into it the way any manipulative, pushy person would despite legitimately months of me saying no. Two months of me not allowing her, or anyone else, to even lay a single hand on me no matter the context. She blamed me, victimized herself and would call and text me over 20+ times within a period of as many minutes if I did not respond immediately to her every text or call. She eventually pushed enough to take control over me and a large portion of my life. She pushed me away from my friends, discouraged others from talking to me and then would turn around and put me down about my physical appearance and mental health when she knew very well I struggled with both. But sometimes things were still sweet. Sometimes shed hug me, just a normal hug, and I was so scared and deprived years of comfort and human touch that I was easy to convince. But, eventually, her hugs would not be innocent anymore. And I was made feel so horrible for saying no that I finally submitted. Because, in the end, no matter how loud I said no she did not listen. She did not care. She was too self-absorbed to care what I, the younger and more vulnerable of the two of us, was not the priority. So when even physically pushing her away with all my might did not work I finally stopped fighting. I was broken, scared and filled with guilt and shame for my previous rejections of her and also the fact that I had STOPPED saying no. It all made me feel sick and want the ground to swallow me up and for the world to end. I blamed myself. This went on from October 2014-August 2015. I hadnt even turned 15 yet. In August 2015 she came back from the sleep away camp she had been at all summer and had lost interest in me. She treated me like dirt the last time she saw me and made me feel even worse. And then she left me, broken and alone, because she had finally lost patience in me not returning her feelings. I was broken. I didnt even fully understand at the time that what she had done to me was wrong. I blamed myself fully, feeling as if Id failed by ever saying no and being so, so angry with myself for hurting her when it was I that was molested and emotionally manipulated. I have been told many times that I did not say no loud enough. That me finally being forced into silence meant it was no longer her fault and became mine. I have had therapists legitimately tell me that I did not say no loud enough and that if I had only fought harder it would have stopped. And, let me just say, I physically tried to shove her off of me. I said no. I fought. But she was taller then me, nearly 58 to my 54, and weighed quite a lot more then me. It was not hard for her to physically hold me down when I tried to fight- especially as back then I was not nearly as strong as I am now. I now suffer from PTSD from both this girl and my abusive mother, anxiety, extreme guilt, body image problems and have attempted suicide multiple times but have not been suicidal since late 2015. Ive lost almost 10 lbs in the last month and a half because a girl I now work with reminds me incredibly of R, the girl that molested me, and it has set me back so far that I can barely even force myself to eat a single meal a day and even people coming within, say, five feet of me makes me flinch and shudder and instinctively step away. I havent let people touch me in... months. Ive been touched since then, of course, because my family does hug me and I dont turn it down but Im not at all comfortable with it. All human contact and relationships and vulnerability make me sick to my stomach. Theres only one girl that I trust, aka my sister, but other then that I cant handle anyone being close to me or any sort of relationship with anyone else. "
585,vulnerability,offmychest,Just ended a relationship on good terms but still feel like such a bad person.,2,7jfw9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7jfw9x/just_ended_a_relationship_on_good_terms_but_still/,2017-12-13 12:59:47,"Sorry this is a bit of a rant. So I had a relationship that lasted around 2 years and my whole heart was not in it and Im still feeling like such a bad person for it. We are both 22. He was a VERY shy guy and had no prior dating experience before me. I could also tell he had pretty low confidence. I didnt have much dating experience either though. I could understand him because I used to be very shy like him. I could always depend on him for a good laugh or for someone to keep me company. We didnt have a lot of common interests but had similar senses in humour and almost always had fun on our dates. I was very attracted to him as well. Heres the catch... I dont think I loved him (I honestly dont think he loved me either). There were times in our relationship where we acted very lovingly to each other and gave each other gifts and showed affection in other ways. There were times in which during/after hanging out with him I did have that feeling that I loved him but it seemed fleeting and sometimes I got anxiety and thought things like there is no way this relationship will ever work in the long term. Neither of us even said  I love you once to each other... I could definitely tell he had difficulties with being emotionally vulnerable and speaking his feelings too so that didnt help things or make the relationship really grow. I feel guilt because I had a lot of doubts about the relationship (even in the beginning) when I started dating him I even told my friend that I wasnt sure of him. I had these doubts but I always pushed them aside because I would go on dates with him and it would all clear up and Id think wow, hes so sweet and I enjoy his company.... I really saw his flaws though. (Although I rationalized it and told myself that everyone has flaws). We were exclusive throughout the whole 2 years... although we werent even officially gf/bf until 6 months of dating. (I was the one that had to ask if we wanted to be official too). He would never take the lead on the relationship.. . Again I think he wasnt good with emotional vulnerability and didnt have very high confidence. But maybe it also was that our personalities didnt mesh well together. The doubt and uncertainty of the relationship really got to me at around the 9-10 month mark of our relationship. I still liked him but didnt know where it was all going so I broke it off but we ended up we dating again 2 months later. When we got back together it was better because it seemed that we both really wanted it to work. I still had doubts occasionally though (again I saw his flaws). Our relationship was very private the whole way through. No trace of it ever existed on social media, I didnt even talk about my relationship to my friends very much and some of my friends (more distant friends) were always surprised that I even had a boyfriend. Of course if someone asked if I had a boyfriend I wouldnt deny it or anything I just didnt talk about it a lot. My friends would say things like oh youre STILL dating him?!?? I had no idea? But I did bring him to family/friend get togethers sometimes(I dont go out much though). Im naturally not a very talkative person and not a big sharer so I suppose that was certainly part of it too. The past few years Ive also gone out with friends a lot less and been less close with my friends, because they were/are still in college... Im not. I maybe think they could tell I had doubts about the relationship which is what makes me feel SO SOOO guilty. To be honest I was a little embarrassed of my BF in some ways because he didnt have the greatest social skills. (Just really quiet, difficult to have a conversation with). I was worried people would think he was weird. Im really cringing writing this right now because I just feel so bad. I also kept thinking things like I wish he was more athletic, harder working, or successful and I was worried I was settling. Despite this I was never interested in any other guys though and could still see that he had good qualities and I thought we had a solid relationship. So a few weeks ago we officially broke up and it was fairly mutual because we drifted apart so much , our communication had broken down and I was feeling that he didnt really value me. We broke up on good terms, still being friends but agreeing to no longer date and to see other people. (Although I cant see myself dating anyone anytime soon). Its pretty crazy though because we broke up at the exact same time of the year so it almost felt like reliving the same relationship twice. TLDR; was with my boyfriend that I wasnt sure I loved for 2 years. I m really trying hard to move on but still feeling residual guilt because I knew the relationship shouldnt have lasted that long and I was mostly in it for the wrong reasons much of it was trying to cope with loneliness. I also have anxiety so that could contribute to my strange feelings. (Although thats no excuse). Just really needed to get this off my chest."

Sometimes I do fine with the departures but other times (like today) I'm an emotional disaster.

All told, I have a really great life and feel like it's not fair for me to complain. I have a good job, but it's not what I want to do forever. I have some good friends but I also get overly disappointed when I'm unable to socialize. I'll go out 2 or 3 times in one week with a handful of people and it's the best week ever! For a few weeks in a row! Then...nothing. Everything adds up and I really feel like shit. This has also been a painful week for me health-wise (stomach issues, unusual joint pains, sore throat, messed up shoulders, etc.).

She said she didn't love him anymore, yet just weeks ago I would've consider them as one of the most happiest couple I've ever laid my eyes on. I didn't think much of it at the time, I put my focus on supporting her in her decision. After all, if that's how she feels then there's not much to do. ""At least she's being honest with him"" I thought. Then comes yesterday. After spending the entire day with my boyfriend, which we so rarely do as our work schedule always overlaps the other, I couldn't help but to find myself thinking about what she said. ""I don't love him anymore"" Me and my boyfriend had been having an amazing day and after spending the evening out of town we headed home. As we drove home he had to patiently listen and watch as my singing destroyed whatever song we were listening to and almost get punched in his face as my notsoamazing dance moves echoed with every beat. He just smiled, slightly laughed and mostly just stared. I always catch him stare and I completely love it. Then the shuffling from the playlist turns on Kiss me with Ed Sheeran and I hear her words in my mind again. ""I don't love him anymore"" I for the first time really realize just how vulnerable I am for being so deeply in love. Because what if he wakes up one day and feels just like my friend did? What if he wakes up one day and just don't love me anymore. I couldn't help but to start silently crying in that moment. I already knew he saw me crying before he even asked what was wrong, because he always look at me. No matter the surrounding I'm always the one he has his eyes on. Despite how pathetic it sounds I simply just answered that it was because I loved him so much. But if he only knew what was going on in my mind in that moment. How I wish I could cherish every single minute with him, save and store every little small thing he does for me, every smile he gives me, forever. Because no matter what he says today or tomorrow, he might as well wake up one day and realize that he doesn't love me anymore. And even though it makes me devastated just thinking the thought I also come to a realization that this, exactly this, is what makes it so beautiful to be in love. You put yourself, the naked you, in someone else's bare hands. And in return they do the same for you. The beauty in trusting someone to not break your heart when they at any moment can toss you to the ground, because the choice is all on them. The beauty of vulnerability will always be apart of why love is so beautiful. He loves me today and today I will do everything to make sure he loves me tomorrow."

I'm philosophical and have a lot of interests and so much love to offer, but it seems like everyone I pursue never wants me back.

And it always seems like just once I've gotten someone to start to reciprocate, they find someone better or they don't want a relationship or they completely disappear without explanation. I don't understand it. I've been told I'm gorgeous, witty, fun. I've been told I'm perfect. But yet I'm still here, sitting in bed alone and wishing I at the very very least had someone just lying next to me. I have so so much nurturing to give and support and affection, but it seems like everyone I talk to runs for the hills when I want anything beyond sexual. I guess just want to be wanted for more than my body, just once. And to not have my affections rejected immediately and to not feel like my default role in anyone's life is not worth love, only worth lust. td;lr: I'm just so fucking lonely. "

Whether it was discussing music, or our lives, our dreams and our aspirations, and everything in between, you were always wonderful to talk to--and still are. I knew there was something special about you, early on, and I was proven right. This week, I had a conference in a town not too far from your university. You visited me in my hotel and we spent hours in a hallway adjacent to the lobby, in overstuffed leather armchairs, just talking to each other while grinning like idiots. At some point in time, I asked you if I could kiss you, because I had never kissed someone before, and you let me. It was awkward, and I laughed at my clumsiness, but you were patient with me, and kissed me again. You left early in the morning, after kissing me for what seemed like hours, and for the first time in a long time, I felt relaxed. Two days later, we had another date. I took a train to visit you in your city, and when I arrived, you were waiting there for me, with a large grin on your face. We linked arms as we walked towards our destination, and halfway through, you opted to hold my hand, intertwining our fingers together. Along the way, you surprised me with candy--we're both adults, but the thought that you packed candy for our excursion for the sole intent of surprising me melted my heart a bit. At the monument we visited, you held me close to you and kissed my forehead. On the ground floor of your dormitory, we kissed as a cheesy 2000's playlist blared--and separated frequently to laugh. On the fifth floor of another building, we kissed and moved against each other with a passion I never thought I'd experience in my life. Afterwards, you held me against you, before kissing me softly several times and promising me that we'd meet up again. When I had to leave, you waited with me outside until my Lyft came, and as I climbed into the front seat and looked in the side mirror, you were still there, waiting for me to leave. It's been two days. I've spent more time today crying than I have in over a year. You were so kind, so understanding with me. I miss the witty banter on your end, and the funny faces, and the eyebrow twitches, and the forehead and hand kisses, and most importantly, you. I have never experienced such kindness from anyone, and the sheer vulnerability that you have brought out from me is almost scary. It hurts now, but I think for the first time, I'm experiencing something akin to intense feelings for you. I know it's early, but you're special to me. I should stop crying, because I know I'll see you again, and soon. The next time we meet will be as memorable, if not more memorable than our previous excursions. Thank you for making my time in the city so wonderful. Thank you for showing me affection, admiration, and kindness. Thank you for making me feel. See you soon."

I chastise myself when I feel things strongly, especially about other people. I am extremely guarded. I will suffer through anything in order to not rely on other people. I do not think about my happiness at all; I've never been able to until this point. All I've focused on is my survival in the barest sense. I do not like being weak or showing any form of weakness or vulnerability. The one thing I'm certain of is that I'm depressed and have been for over 20 years, and I came to the realization for the first time today when thinking about this shit: I have no idea what it's like to not be depressed. I have no idea what it's like to wake up and not think about not wanting to live. I've never attempted suicide. I've thought about it, but never even gotten close to making an earnest attempt, which is why that is phrased as ""not wanting to live"" as opposed to ""wanting to die."" I called a suicide hotline when I was a teen and hung up after talking for a few minutes, apologizing for taking up the time of someone who was ""more suicidal"" than me. But I think about it all the time. Whenever I'm not doing something or talking to someone or listening to music, that's the exact thought I have. It's like that's just my default setting. I don't think I want to die, I just want to stop existing like this. I want to stop being on edge. I want to be able to acknowledge my own feelings. I want to stop purposely cutting people off and making them feel bad because I decided to isolate myself because of the fucked up shit that's happened to me. I want to be able to do something as simple as telling him how I feel about him without referring to my emotions as stupid. I want to feel like it's okay to care about myself without feeling like I'm being selfish or a burden. I want to be able to write here that I want to be able to trust people without hesitation because I'm not really sure I want to trust people because they've always been untrustworthy and disappointing. I want to relax for a single moment. Every therapist I've been to has made a remark a bout how I've ""lost a lot"" in reference to other people, or that I have been let down a lot by others and that this is probably where my issues stem from. Those statements are true, but at this point also not, in a way. I stopped relying on and expecting things from people when I was a preteen, and I've never allowed myself to since. When I expect nothing, I can't be let down and I can't be upset when they leave. At least, this is what I imagine my subconscious was thinking when I developed this defense mechanism. Cut your losses and move on. I told him that and he said that he hopes he doesn't let me down. I hate that my first thought was that he probably will be because I really, really don't want him to. This is the first time I've done something purely because I feel like it and it's terrifying. The only reason I think I've been able to justify going through with it is that even if things don't work out, the city he lives in has much better job opportunities than the one I'm in now. And I don't have healthcare here, but I will there. Leaving here doesn't matter. I've lived here my whole life but there isn't anything for me here. It's more expensive and louder than it is there. But I'm moving 4100 km and across a border (I'm already a citizen of the country thankfully) to live with him. I'm alone, and therefore safe, here. But he makes me smile, and every time we've been together has been fun and I'm pretty sure I felt happy, and that's weird as hell and throws me off and scares me. He is extremely excited for me to be moving there, and so am I when I stop to think about my feelings. We have taken our relationship very slow because of our natures, and I tell myself that because we were hesitant and did not rush things that this is not an awful idea, but that doesn't make it less scary because I'm ultimately doing this because of how much I like him and confronting that thought makes me feel inexplicably weak and pathetic. I've made no secret of how guarded I am and how fucked up my childhood, family, and most of my life has been, but I've never gone into great detail I've mostly spoken about it sarcastically or while making a joke. He's similar in a lot of ways, so he understands, I think. But I wonder if maybe I'm wrong and he doesn't understand at all and once I'm comfortable to actually talk about myself and be open, it will have been a huge mistake and I'll have yet another reason to be a jaded misanthrope."

I cant make assumptions, wellI can its what I do. How do I know our relationship was special to us? These things may just be things from every generic relationship. Was there anything that made ours special? The message he sent after a paragraph to get me try and get me to go out with him, just those 5 words broke my heart. Ive fucked up havent I? in some ways I wish I had just said yes to have those extra 16 days with him. In some ways I wish wed never have gone out. Because this is shit and even then his feelings wouldve faded for me like they did before. That always scared me, that one day hed wake up one morning and decide hed fallen out of love with me. These are things I never told him and now he may never know. When he told me about his nightmares and stuff like that I just wanted to lie next to him and wrap my arms around him, tightly. I felt so bad for not going out with him. With a teacher worried about him and everything I thought it was my fault. I was so worried. What finally made me go out with him? 2 things. 1)when we were at the bus station waiting for my bus one evening he was telling me about some girl at a party who was wearing one of his jumpers and was asking if she could keep it. When I asked why she was wearing it he said well I didnt have sex with her or dont worry I didnt have sex with her this upset me and for a while I couldnt work out why. Then when I realised it was because I liked him I panicked. I was going to wait until we went to a festival together and kiss him in the crowds outside bastille or something like that. But when I thought about losing him to another girl, yes I liked him a lot and wanted to go out with him but the main reason I said yes in the end was because I was fucking selfish that may make him hate me but Im going to be honest. When I thought about seeing him with some other girl I broke. I freaked when I thought I was going to lose him. 2) The day before I said yes was Wednesday night I cant remember completely but we had some kind of argument. I thought Id lost him. In drama he sat as far away from me as he could I thought he hated me. Then when everyone was rehearsing Stuart paired me with him to run through flash-heart and I was uncomfortable. I thought he hated me. I thought Id lost him and that scared me more than any relationship. So that evening when I thought he was going to give up I said yes. he said how an ex threatened to break up with him after hed mentioned to her about joining the army. I dont understand that. If you love someone you dont give a shit what they decide to do with their life. You accept it and support it, if it makes them happy. he didnt box for a while after we started going out. Im still not clear why. If it made him happy its part of you. You cant pick and choose you accept someone as a whole or not at all. When he wanted to kiss me for the first month he had to physically move my head to face him. It made me uncomfortable because it made things actually seem real. Towards the end we never kissed like we used to. I wish I had embraced out relationship from the beginning and spent as much time as I could showing everyone exactly how I felt. When we re-started college the roles switched he was the one who didnt act like we were in a relationship now I realise how he felt at the beginning. Relationships scared me. They still do. The pressure, the closeness, the vulnerability. I miss him tickling me when I was sad and saying I want content! after he asked me if I was happy once and I replied with no, Im content. I still loved him. In my opinion love doesnt just disappear. It does though. I like movies about love because its easy to believe, easy to forget the bitterness of real life and slip into the world of love and romance. I lied I said I was okay when I wasnt. once on the bus when I was sitting on the seat a step down in front of him. he texted me asking if I was okay. I said i was okay. I was crying. I lied. I wasnt okay. The last bus ride we ever had we sat together listening to music, I was crying. Silently for most of the journey. I tried to get his attention by leaning on his shoulder bit he was playing solitaire in his science group chat. I was miserable. I wouldnt tell him because hed see me as weak and break up with me. he couldnt handle me being unhappy anymore. I didnt want to force my presence upon him. I lied mainly to hide that shite and to get him to not have feelings for me because I was a mess and it wasnt fair on him. Im sorry for that truly sorry because I loved him, love him and its shite because nothing will ever be the same because he wont fall for me again. Also because were never going to see each other again, then well forget the small memories like racing each other into his kitchen or when he first stayed over at mine, or small shit like that. why I didnt tell him I was depressed? Because I didnt want him to see me as weak and whenever I tried to bring it up he just said ""change your state of mind I felt I was annoying him or making stuff up. I didnt feel I could tell him in case he dumped me. So Im sorry things werent meant to work out this way. There was still so much to learn about each other that we never will. And that makes me sad. It all ended at once. Yes for him that was probably best it ended when it did I was holding him back and whenever he changed I wasnt sure I would fit in with the new change. I dont know how to say goodbye. I cant say goodbye. Thats why I still visit old teachers, a well as the memories. "

Weve been broken up for 3 months and dated almost a year. We lived together and we had great chemistry. Ive had time to reflect on what went wrong and I wish I could of changed it while we were together. We really didnt have a falling out but we were pretty much no contact this entire 3 months. Last week we went out to dinner and things progressed and we hooked up. My guard has been up since our split and it was when him and I went out to dinner. However, i let it down when we had sex. I enjoy being single but I hate what comes with it. I enjoy the independence and not having to let someone know where I am at all hours of the day but at the same time I miss someone checking in on me. Someone who genuinely cares about my well being and just someone to come home to at night. Dont get me wrong, I have a supportive and caring family but I just miss the intimacy/vulnerability with someone Im in love with. I dont think him and I will ever get back together and I wish I could tell him how I feel but I know its not a mutual feeling so theres no point to even waste my breath. My circle of friends are all engaged/married and it sucks to know Im just the single friend again. I just miss my ex-boyfriend and wish I could go back in time.

597,vulnerability,offmychest,I'm a ramblin wreck from Georgia Tech and someone just died at my school,2,7100eu,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7100eu/im_a_ramblin_wreck_from_georgia_tech_and_someone/,2017-09-19 12:32:40,"Im just going to say right now that as a computer science major you might expect that I dont pay attention to the news or American politics and that English isnt my strong suit, and youd expect right. Yesterday night, word had spread that there was a shooting on campus and students were advised to stay indoors. At the time I didnt know much besides this, until the videos of the event had started circulating and someone posted a recount of sorts on the GT subreddit. The incident depicted a man holding some sort of tool in his hands, walking at our schools police officers, screaming shoot me, and was told to stop more times than I can as he walked towards the officers, who backed and backed and told him to drop the knife until it finally happened and he was shot dead. It also became clear that the man would not wanted to be called a man and was a member of the LGBTQIA community, and that they (the preferred pronoun) was born intersex and had left suicide notes in his room before this happened. I personally believe if you wanted to kill yourself, you would do it in a way that would not make others kill themselves and traumatize them as well, as Georgia Tech as a school is no stranger to stress, but I am adamant that this is was no ones fault, police are human too and were all lucky we werent in either persons shoe, because we probably would have done the same things even though we fall asleep by telling ourselves that we wouldnt. But of course, that didnt fucking matter because I woke up to POLICE SHOOT PRIDE LEADER DURING EVENT. Now I understand why the school was so reluctant to reveal what happened last night. This was a person first, what part of this doesnt make sense to whoever is writing this bullshit, a real living breathing person who died less than a day ago and somehow they already feel compelled to put some twisted fictional spin on the very same day that we mourn a death. The vigil was tonight, and guess what, Antifa is on campus, a police car is on fire, they're shooting fireworks at our windows and were being told to stay inside. What kind of fucked up organization protests DURING THE VIGIL OF A DEAD PERSON. Georgia Tech is a school of many different beliefs and we all somehow manage to get all get along quite well with one another because through our suffering we become equal and we get to understand each other better, but all this nonsense is just a slap in the face of a community during a moment of real vulnerability. I frankly dont know how I feel about this, I am somehow ashamed that some part of me cynically thinks that this was planned to intentionally incite some sort of response from the news as they made have called the cops in themselves mentioning an armed man, but I hope that maybe by writing this maybe Ill get through to some of you , and maybe, hopefully never, the next time this happens, someone wont feel compelled to deface a tragedy for a few clicks or use it as a means to propel their personal narratives. Please send both our police department, and the parents of Scout Schultz, some love, they could all use it right now. Edits: grammar and a few clarity adjustments"

A few nights ago, I've told myself I deserve love many times and cried so much. It was really cathartic. I still had work to do. TW: sexual assault. My journey has started in the summer of 2017. Highlights: I called it a self-improvement journey in the beginning. Wanted to get fit. Started keto. Couldn't continue keto because I was really depressed about some personal issues. Thought it was restrictive for me. Wanted to focus on an alternative lifestyle instead. I've learned about very healthy habits from keto. So I'm thankful that I took control of my health to feel better. Learned about the importance of good fats and avocados are amazing. Learned about new ways to get fiber in my diet. Starting having casual sex with a guy. I've never had that experience before. Only been in a relationship with one guy and that happened within the last year. I have realized that I need to have emotionally intimacy with a partner. I've been ignoring what my heart wanted. I wanted to love someone completely. He didn't treat me well and thought I deserved that. I wrote about in my journal. This was the line that I wrote that made me go to therapy about my own personal issues of self-love. ""She doesn't feel she deserves love so she is settles for attention."" I didn't want to have so much self-hatred for myself anymore. Calling it a self-love journey from that point on. Also asked for therapy for coping with my sexual assault. Unfortunately, my insurance is regional so I'm going to get help with that after I graduate this upcoming semester. Started taking piano lessons. My teacher has a holistic approach. She told me that the piano is not about pressing keys precisely, you need to feel the piano. I've realized that I've been taught to not show vulnerability and people will always seek to destroy you. This one of the few times of my life, I've just allowed myself to just feel. It was strange bit but liked it. My ex contacting me. He still has feelings for me but he never really loved me. Realized he liked the idea of me and not really me. He was never really interested in my career goals and my volunteer work. I'm very passionate about my goals. When I mentioned it, he turned the conversation to how I said I still wanted him. I was very vulnerable to him about how I felt about and realized that I want someone to love me completely. Made art to illustrate how I felt. That's when I said that I deserve love many times to myself. "
599,vulnerability,offmychest,Lessons from a broken relationship,3,72rvqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/72rvqq/lessons_from_a_broken_relationship/,2017-09-27 22:20:51,"These are the lesson(s) from personal experience. I hope this helps anyone who is struggling with the same issues. I moved to Canada from Germany because of a guy. Now when I say because of a guy, it means he didn't ask me to but he was happy to realize that I'm ending up in the same place as him with a couple months difference. He was an out going person but quite reserved with his feelings. He was polite and rational. had control over his feelings. had the ability to make you feel special or dreadful in his own ways. good looking and etc... We dated for some time when he was still in Germany and did long distance when he moved to Canada. Long distance wasn't working. we opted for being friends. That faded away after some time too because, as I found out last night, he has been seeing someone (even typing these words heart but the lesson is way more important). All this time that we were apart, I kept him in the back of my head and lived with the image that I had of him in my mind. I couldn't date anyone else, despite making an attempt a couple of times, because I had made this golden statue of him in my mind and would compare everyone to that. He was a pretty damn good guy but this was a giant mistake. Fast forward to when I moved here 2 months ago. I didn't tell him that I was finally here. why? because I was scared of getting rejected and also because I didn't know if he feels the same way about me. So I went back and forth on the issue for two months until we started running into each other and it started to get super weird. So i drunk texted him last Friday night and apologized that I haven't told him about being here and that was because I knew he was seeing someone. he read it and didn't respond. I woke up the next day and apologized. He politely said that it's ok and asked if I'm also doing a PhD at the same university as he was. I spent 3 more days in hell thinking whether he really is with someone or not. To comfort myself, I told myself that he is reserved and has got offended over the fact that i didn't tell him about being here. Plus, I needed to know for sure to be able to make my peace with it and move on. I asked him and it turns out he has been seeing someone since May. She is living in his hometown and they are doing long distance. I saw a picture of her and she honestly looks like such a genuinely nice and lovely person. First thing i noticed about her was how genuinely happy she looked. You have to be happy to be able to have a happy relationship. I wasn't. I was constantly insecure and suffering from lack of self esteem. lack of self confidence is revolting and I udnerstand that now. you turn bitter and shy away from stuff because of that. Perhaps the thing that bit me the most was never telling him how i felt about him. Since I was in an abusive relationship years ago, my mind was instructed to think expressing feelings equals vulnerability. I was horrible at expressing emotions and I would downplay my emotions so he doesn't know how much I was into him. When we were apart, he asked me if I finally made up my mind about the university I was gonna join. I said no. I lied. Why? because I didn't want him to know that I care so much about him that I'm leaving my everything behind in Germany and moving to Canada just for the sole purpose of being with him. If I did in fact bite the bullet months ago and told him I was moving to the same city as him, it wouldn't turn out so bad because he would tell me he is with someone. As the last piece of advice, give yourself credit; when you go shopping, don't buy something because that guy or girl is gonna find it sexy, buy it because you want it. We would have been perfect if I didn't hate myself so much... love yourself, respect yourself, accept yourself. I cried my eyes out, lost sleep and yelled at the top of my lungs so hard that now I almost have no voice. The important thing is if I don't fix these issues, I won't get over this phase and even if I do, this phase is going to repeat itself after every guy. Sorry I know it's long, I stayed up all night thinking about these stuff. --- **tl;dr**: 1-Try seeking happiness from your own self rather than from a relationship because if you are not happy with who you are, no relationship can make you feel better and even if they do they won't last long. 2-Tell them how you feel 3- live with reality"
600,vulnerability,offmychest,So confused by his mixed messages and feeling angry and disappointed with myself.,1,73e6fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/73e6fx/so_confused_by_his_mixed_messages_and_feeling/,2017-09-30 20:17:59,"I (26) met this guy (27) on an online dating website (ok cupid) and we really hit it off. He is French and was visiting but went back to France to return to Australia months later. When he returned to Australia he tried to get in touch with me again on the website but I had deleted my account. Anyway, I restarted the online dating account and saw a message he sent me trying to reconnect when he returned to Australia in June. Being in September, I reached out and apologised and explained the situation. We spoke a lot for a week via text and the more we spoke, the more we connected. I told him that as a romantic, I struggle with modern dating culture as I find it so fickle and he expressed that he is exactly the same and he hates how girls he talks to have so many dates with other guys. After I expressed my romantic side of myself, he told me that he thinks that I am 'perfect' and that I am 'unreal' and 'incredible' and he has been waiting so long to meet a girl like me and by luck I have shown myself. He then said that he feels some concern that he might fall in love with me and have to go back to France so it might not be good for us. I told him that it is a bit early to say this stuff, but I jokingly said that I do have French citizenship, so if it ever did have the potential of getting so serious, it wouldn't be an impossibility. He then said that he was worried that I would be disappointed with him and that he has trust issues and insecurities that make it hard for him. I confessed that I am exactly the same as him also. at that stage I had gotten tired and told him I was going to sleep and he said 'Goodnight my little night owl' in French. I'll admit that I was so perplexed by his level of interest in me because this guy was so damn handsome and charming and I kind of felt like he could be the type to get any girl he wanted so I wasn't sure why he had this type of interest in me. We organised to meet last Friday but he had to cancel as he had accidentally double booked plans with his friend. I was understanding of this and he didn't get back in touch to make new plans until Saturday night. We met up on Sunday and had such a wonderful date from 6pm to 12am. He did come across a little nervous at the start of the date but as time went on and after we had a few beers he relaxed quite a bit. We talked about so much, I can speak French and his English is also pretty good so we had no issues language wise and when he told me I look like my one of my favourite actresses (Monica Bellucci) I nearly died. At the end of the night we kissed and I asked him if he wanted to see me again and he said he did. He also made comments about me being 'beautiful' and 'cute' and me smelling nice. That night he also made a passing comment about how he wouldn't want to have sex on the first date because it isn't romantic (I don't really remember how that came up as it was not something I proposed). I hadn't heard from him the next day (Monday), so I thought I'd be proactive and in the afternoon I sent him a message thanking him for such a nice time and I told him I would love to see him before he does a one month trip around Australia which he is leaving for this weekend and I didn't get a response. I sent him another message on Wednesday apologising for being impatient, but told him that I feel he has pulled away and asked if he is still interested and the only response I got was 'I am interested!'. The day later I apologised for my previous message and said that I'd love to see him before he leaves ( he comes back to my town in a month and will be in Australia for another year) and he said he doesn't think he has time. I simply said 'that's ok, I hope you have a great trip!'. I haven't heard from him since and feel myself going crazy hanging out with hopes that he will eventually get in touch but if he did, I don't know how I would even respond because it feels like this distance has disrupted the connection and made me doubt his reliability and interest in me. I feel so ashamed of myself for getting so involved so early and for coming on so strong. I never usually do this with guys so early, but the level of in depth discussion we had about our romanticism and vulnerability almost made it a premise to this type of discussion. I did have a look at his instagram and he has posted pictures of himself with friends and also liked photos of other girls so I don't think it's a matter of him losing his ability to contact me. I also can't help but feel that he was disappointed with me after meeting me and because he found me underwhelming on this date he has lost interest and found another girl instead. I feel so crushed, I had to take a few months off dating because I had very bad depression at the start of the year and it sucks that this was the first experience I've had and this experience and shame has made me so angry at myself for screwing it up sending him those messages after the date and coming off too strong. I'm not going to message him again because I want to respect his space now, however I do really hope he can tell me if he is no longer interested rather than just leave me hanging on waiting :( I appreciate your time reading this rant."

There was a pretty large and close group of people my age there, and I thought I fit right in. I met a girl, got into leadership, and hung out with that group the whole time I was there. I came forward to my boss (ministry director) about a new yet steady dependency on pornography. He told me he felt like Ive been dishonest and he forced me to step down from paid ministry. My friends were against his decision and seemed supportive to my case because I came forward and was never found out as my boss said I was. This happened just after I committed to going to school to be a pastor. I moved on campus and continued to volunteer at that church an hour away because I loved my friends and my girlfriend at the time was really starting to get plugged in. As soon as I moved on campus, I stopped getting invited to places. After church hangs were limited to 3 minute conversations before and after. When my ex and I broke up, I lost every sense of community there. I switched to a nearby trendy church that my friend from community college went to. Ive always heard that it can by cliquey, but I thought that because I had an in, I wouldnt have that problem. Dont get me wrong, it definitely helped me get a leg up, but these people just felt weird about me. To be honest, Ive struggled with depression since my ex and I broke up, and I feel like it may have put up some type of wall between that natural development that happened at the last church. Either that, or theyre all pretentious yet scared shitless of vulnerability. I like to think thats not the case though some of it is probably true. Either way, Ive worked myself into 3-4 different groups at that church and well say hi, but Ill never get that text to hang out with the rest of them. Ive been there about 2.5 years, trying to hang out with the people I thought I was closest to but never really working the other way around. I went to a new church tonight. I didnt know anybody and I was greeted by a guy that wanted to cut the conversation pretty short. As soon as the music was over, I went out the door and went straight home. Im not an unpleasant guy. I mean, you can check my post history and tell me otherwise, but people have always told me that Ive got a warm personality and yeah I can be quirky, but it adds to the conversation rather than makes distance. I dont get why these relationships dont work for me. My closest friends (the guys I can call up on a Saturday morning and invite to go surfing) dont believe in God, but theyre excited to hang out and text me first sometimes. I feel so much more valued by them, but we dont share the same outlook. Six years ago, I thought I was dating my future wife and that Id be a pastor at the church I came to faith in. Now I just live alone in another city working for my dad and surfing on the weekends to pass the time. I wish a Christian really understood that and helped me in a way I couldnt do alone. "

I didnt even have the energy to but bed sheets on my box spring mattress (which my dog pissed on, Ill get to that later). I was so depressed from life. Before moving back home with my mentally-ill mother, things were even worse. It was only me and my dog (Hachiko) in about a 350 square foot studio if you could call it that. It got to the point where I only left my rental for work and food (I hardly ate, and when I did it was junk food). I had just ended an abusive relationship with a transgender-sociopath (who, unfortunately, has been involved in my life one way or another since I was in Junior High School) and felt all sorts of negative feelings about myself. So, basically, I hit and even deeper depression, could hardly find the energy to get up for work, came home exhausted, was either sleeping all day, or hardly sleeping at all. I mean I was living in a dark, cement cinder-block shit hole with no desire to take care of myself. (BTW, my shitty fold-out bed I got from Ikea was also smelling like dog piss, and I was sleeping on it, and I didnt care, just felt bad for my dog, who I knew was having bladder-issues and needed to go to the vet.) And that is when I decided to move back home because I was becoming very intent on committing suicide. (FYI; and this is for an other post if I make it back to Reddit, but I have been a dog behaviorist for 14+ years and wasnt intentionally neglecting my dog. But again, I cant fit everything in to this post as its not about the happier moments of my life.) And at least Id have my mom, not that we were really on good-terms with each other at that point, and my dog. Well, the depression, lack of goals, and generally not wanting to wake up in the morning only got worse. I didnt have a social group anymore (after breaking up with the furry and nerd/gamer community.) so I was very isolated, and humans are social animals so of course I just felt even more hopeless and it reinforced the, whats the point, when my mom is literally the only person who texts me or talks to me. (Not kidding, that is the current situation now.) I was doing nothing with my life. I was neglecting to even clean my bathroom at my moms place. Or wash clothes. Make my bed. Anything that required expending energy . You can imagine the disrespect my mom felt (but at the time I didnt care or think about it, mental illness does that to you.) which resulted in a lot of arguing and drama. (Again my mom has a undiagnosed mental disorder, and she was in a relationship at the time, which makes her even more weird and easily annoyed/angered/depressed) So I think you get the point, I was committing suicide, kinda, by trashing my body, sleeping all the time, devaluing myself worth, generally neglecting everything. I mean I was only going to work, and even there I was so tired and lacked energy, and was easily irritated. (I worked for a awesome family business that I had watched grow over the years and they understood my depression. But, again, not the point of this story.) Not many months later, I somehow how managed to find the desire to get help, because I was sick, unhealthy, had horrible anxiety/ breathing problems and rapid heart rate. The result of neglecting to really do anything but sit at a computer, create artwork, and chat with people online. (I bet you get this nasty picture of a fat dude with a bottle of Mountain Dew and Doritos, piles of anime and greasy balding hair browsing 4chan, surprise! Im female.) Next chapter: I liked this therapist, she was really helpful in sort of getting me to put my life back together. I saw her for about ten months, and resolved some of my issues from the relationship with the psychologically and on a few occasions physically abusive trans-person who I still refer to as they because They didnt want my parents to know Their gender. (Literal psychopath, since my parents had met Them before They transitioned and knew They were female, oh, for another story, this person had tried to convince me for the longest time that I wanted to be a boy/was trans to, and preyed on my creativity, and vulnerability, resulting my creating alter egos that Theyre alter egos fell in love with, I had ing dissociation from my own body and cant even mention those characters names without wanting to vomit anymore.) Strangely, at this point via my therapists suggestion (and considering I am into Bondage Sadism and Masochism, however at the time hadnt explored this side of myself in depth because of PSYCHO TRANS PERSON) I decided to join a Sex Club (I love being on the fringes of sub-culture, I dont define myself by it but the people you usually meet are pretty cool) and yes, you had to pay to be a member. So, Id regularly attend events at the sex club (which I am not going to name for privacy reasons) where there would be rope bondage, edge place, people ing in front of other people and myself. And I felt better, got to explore more about myself and it was great because there was a ZERO ALCOHOL POLICY and ABSOLUTE CONCENT was REQUIRED. Those people at that club were some of the most polite ones Id ever met, very respectful (Ive just not had great experiences sexually most of my life) and I had friends to look forward to meeting and hanging out with. Ah! I also got to cross dress as a boy, and role play characters of mine. It was a way to get away. So this was for another couple of months. Me avoiding my mom, having a social life, being able to vent (Ill skip over the few crappy dates I went on with some of the club members and poly relationships, which werent for me) and just feeling accepted without having to hide who I was. I like expressing myself and coming up with costumes, stuff like that. (I mean work and being home all week sucked, but yeah) Months later though, I am still being pretty much a piece of shit, I still have no direction in my life, I mostly go from training and being with my dog, which was also therapeutic , and being at the sex club. I hated being at home (because there was still the memories of trauma from the place my mom rented that stuck in the air, if you know what I mean, from my childhood) and around my mom or her boyfriend. February comes around and that is when I meet the first, last and only person Ive ever given a beep enough about to actually have any desire to do something with my life. I mean I set goals AND accomplished them in the two and a half years we were together. Sounds cute right, wet met at the sex club, our first date was on valentines day. We had a hell of a lot in common. Similar backgrounds. I mean I RIGHT out of depression with him around. The weird shit (which I question a lot and eh, is going to be hard to talk about honestly.) I am in to what they call Edge Play. It involves knifes, blood, needles, rape. But I didnt like the wussy stuff. The stuff dominants / subs / tops / bottoms did at the club. I mean I like to basically see how close I could get to simulating murder, almost. I am a total masochist, and I like being afraid, I like borderline questionable personalities that ACTUALLY have the balls to d some pretty kinky shit with me (yes I know my fetishes arent fetishes most of you are likely to share with me.) I honestly wish I had the video footage and pictures to prove it. But I dont. Although, SHIT, my boy was the first guy I ever dated (and a pretty boy I might add, very athletic, think k-pop star, I mean, beep, he could dress, *I am female, and apparently am attractive because I get compliments* I mean I lucked out with him) that didnt beep out when I requested him to cut-me, tie me up, be aggressive, blah blah, and, again, it isnt like really horrible kinky-porn. We just clicked and generally enjoyed relieving our stress that way. Everyone has kinks right? NOPE. I cant tell you how few guys there are who actually will do this shit (let alone are in the medical field, obviously, STDs are something to worry about, and I wouldnt let some rando stab me with needs, look up Needle Play if you are interested, my ex was in the medical field, but to protect him I am not going to say what field he is in specifically) just from recent dates even. And, I get it, its kinda weird to hurt your partner, its not normal to want to degrade, spit on, hit, or bite-until-they-bleed, most guys might say they think choking their girlfriend is hot, but they hesitate to do it, or in my case, arent doing it as IF they were really trying to end my life. So Ill spare you a lot of the crazy-sex stuff. This guy is highly-educated, comes from a wealthy family, and is my total motivation to GET MY SHIT TOGETHER. I want to be with him, I enjoy spending time with him, he doesnt spend all day on his phone. Hes romantic, kinky, and I respect him enough to listen to him. But I am still suffering from major depression. Somehow, he stays with me through this. (leaving out a lot of stuff in-between) He encourages me and inspires me to go back to college, and is super supportive. Hes the first guy who actually tells me I am smart (uh, my whole life Ive has a lot of just negative people so my self worth basically wasnt there) and hes just awesome. But, its not all awesome, of course. The romantic days spent watching movies in the rain (we watched the movie Spring in the hot tub at the complexes pool area, he had a tarp to cover the hair we stuck my laptop under.) The sad part is, him and I both had bad mental problems, he did have anger issues, that of course we were both aware of. He did forget things, he almost had different personalities, again, over the years I made him aware of this. Just, it wasnt perfect, but yet, this was what I wanted. Most nice guys, normalcy, that isnt for me. Even now, as I sit here, writing this, depressed. Kink is something I cant live without. Pain is something I need. I know a lot of you will say Kink and BDSM is healthy, but thats something that I questions, because of how much I want to be used and abused. (Eh, there was a lot of bad men in my childhood.) So okay, now things go to shit again. (I am really in to Korean culture lol, and jokingly mentioned K-Pop, I love the language, the people, the food) His mother terminates our relationship, I havent met her, once. My ex is upset (in Korean culture parents opinions are absolute, especially with very traditional houses) and I dont really know what to do. He had been really mean for months up to that point. (Forgot to mention, he totally motivated me to weight train again and I had a gym membership so I was looking sexy as hell again, granted, I was never fat by any means, I weigh 125 pounds and I train in Mixed Martial Arts, kickboxing and grappling, beep yes MMA!) The breakup as horrible, we werent able to maintain a friendship. Id broken up with him before. I mean I spiraled right back down in to depression. Remember, I dont have much of a friend group and I admit I centered my world around this guy. Its just how my mind works (Ill get to my diagnoses with my mental illness shortly) Seven months go by, and I cannot get over him. I text him, harass him, contact him over social media to the point where I end up being blocked. Its just ugly and I hate how my mind works. And, it was this way in our relationship when I was depressed or super manic (hint hint at my disorder.) I just was desperate to keep him because if it wasnt for him, my life still would have been in shambles. I mean, what the hell I was college because I wanted to get out of my predicament. I wanted my life back and then HE is out of my life. I hate my parents. I wouldnt go to college for those assholes. Or anyone. Not myself. I didnt believe in myself. I hate myself (I still hate myself as I write this.) I was miserable, but kept going, only because of him. I know, ing sad, and kinda creepy I guess. That that was all I had, right? I hoped if I continued on my path, maybe I could get him back. Well. Seven months later, I get him back. But it was just a lure. I got him to talk with me again. And eventually, to meet up with me (btw, my mom wasnt around that often so I could sneak him over to my house when she wasnt there) and well, shit, I make out with him all night, we get drunk, we talk about things, watch Rick and Morty and he apologizes very sincerely for what he did, but still maintains that we cannot be together because of his family and situation. Well. me. Because I really believed that if I held on eventually things would change. We spent of the summer going to little pop up markets, our favorite places that I only shared with him (were massive coffee junkies, and love food, especially dried meats, cheese, and pizza) at the beach with my dog. We were working on ourselves together. He was about to finish up college. Everything was good, we never argued, really. We just knew our how to deal with each other. Moreover, I finally got on medication, finally got diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and was just continuing to work towards getting into a Biomedical Engineering program. Sigh. But it wasnt perfect. We had bad days, and a lot was brought on by my ING mental illness. And he didnt always respond that great, hed sometimes assume my legitimate reasons for being angry or sad were me having a Bipolar day. I wasnt expressing my actual feelings, fearing that soon Id lose him. I even freaked out when he bought a 2015 Lexus. I mean, his mom forced him to get the car (and you all wont understand unless you know Korean culture, ugh, hes half white, technically an American citizen but thats a whole other mess about a multimillionaire family and all the pressure he was under and no, money seems to only make people more miserable) but I was starting to think he was changing. This shit is stupid to get upset over, right? WELCOME TO BIPOLAR BRAIN, and the stress of college, and the fact that I moved out of my moms that October to this shit hole I am in now with thin walls and obnoxious roommates. I didnt mention it was after that August that I moved back out of my mothers- Sadly, in the end, I was the one to end the relationship. I actually broke his front teeth, that were fake from an incident in his past (so honestly, I didnt know what the hell happened, I blanked when I did this, we were play fighting and I justdid it, regretted it, he left because he has bad anger issues) But that was the part where everything started falling apart. Yes, my life was improving, yes, I had goals. But now I didnt have him. The reason I started all of this. The reason I was fit, eating healthy, and wanting to live life. And, no, he wasnt perfect, either, hed ignore me a lot, when I had an episode of depression. Hed flake out on me. Hed hurt me in a lot of ways psychologically. Still. Even at this point, I dont know who was more ed up. I mean wed both been abused as children, both by our parents. Both were often left alone, were the adult child had chaos. He was worse, and developed issues because of it, yknow. And I was becoming my boyfriend therapist, and I knew he was hurting and needed real help but hed just compartmentalize things. I know I am going on a ramble, but I loved smoking weed with him. I loved it when hed calm down. I loved it when his mother was in Korea so I could stay at his mothers place with him. I loved taking baths with him, and feeling his bones. Id take his hand and feel every joint, tendon. It was the only time hed fall asleep in my lap. The only time he was relaxed and I wanted that for him. So badly. I wanted to be the person that was going to be there with him for the rest of his life. But thenI was becoming abusive and toxic. Now its October of 2017. And why did I write this? Because again, I dont care about myself, or my life. Ive quite attending classes as of this quarter, even though I have gotten super far on my path to Biomedical Engineering. I was doing that for him, because I knew it was important to have status to get into his family. Because I wanted to try like hell to hang on. I am on more medication. But now, it doesnt seem to affect me at all and I am laying in a dark room, I havent left the ing SHIT hole I am renting and I just dont give a anymore. Why? Because I worked so hard. I gave up my dog. I made my life around this guy. Because he had everything I wanted. And no, it wasnt MONEY I was after, Ive always been afraid of being dependant on someone else. I thought that him and I were a team. I thought wed work through our issues. Eh, not so. Here is the thing- I want to die. I thought I would kill myself after this summer. I left my last job of six years, I dont have friends outside of acquaintances from college and my MMA gym. I dont get texts or phone calls or invited anywhere. I havent left this ing house in weeks. And my mother is the only one texing me or checking in. And honestly, I dont want anything to do with my family whove contributed to a lot of suffering in my life. I have about a months worth of rent money saved. But no desire to keep going. Because I just dont want to go through this crap. Because I am socially awkward and hate people. I am ing miserable. I have been for 7 months or so now. I just hide in this room. No contact. I understand, that there are people who care about me, this isnt depression warping my mind. Im pretty coherent with the meds I take now. I know if I do this, the suicide, and I want to, that my family will miss me. But intevitabbly, I know that they arent going to take care of me anymore. I am 26. And my dad still pays for my car, and my phone. And helps with rent. Thing is I want to be free of them, and live my life, but my life would be miserable. Because I just cant imagine dealing with the stress of a normal shitty desk job, that doesnt contribute to the world. I cant imagine living on $30,000 or less a year. Biomedical Engineering, finishing college? That could have happened. Id of been well off. Even without my ex. But I just dont care. As much as I have enjoyed college, the social interaction, the free gym, the personal growth and general boost in intelligence. The fact that its made my depression less? Thats all stopped now in the last 2 weeks of this quarter. I just dont know what to do. Or why I just dont care. So I had to get this off my chest. (Wish I could have written and gone into more detail but I am so. so. tired.) It's stupid how much one person can change your life. I am envious of those of you who have worked through rough patches in your relationships. I am so warped in my mind, maybe I missed the red flags with my ex bf. I just don't know anymore. And... I need to get away or just, die. I mean being with that guy was the best thing that happened to me. And it's sad for me to say that, I wish it could have lasted. And I know getting over exes is hard but I just don't get people. Ugh. -Ghost "
603,vulnerability,offmychest,"[NAW] Just for today, because of the news...",3,74o1fg,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/74o1fg/naw_just_for_today_because_of_the_news/,2017-10-07 01:42:12,"I feel like today is an appropriate time to get this off my chest with the recent news about Weinstein and the anniversary of the Billy Bush/Trump reveal being tomorrow, I thought I would come clean as someone who dealt with sexual harassment in the workplace. As a young 24 year old, I was hired as a communications liaison at a large call center to increase efficiency of communication for a huge tech company and also craft messaging for contact representatives. Like most contact centers, this was a third-party location, and I was working for the tech company who contracted to the third-party firm. I don't know exactly how it happened, but I remember I was in a meeting between the tech communication manager and the CEO of the contact firm. The CEO's son was in the meeting room, but I am not exactly sure what his title/purpose was of being present. Regardless, he stared at me. Just watched me, and it was very unnerving. He was stationed in India, so I wasn't exactly concerned with him... yet. Some weeks go by, and he shows up and has an office in my home location (I used to have to travel between 4 different locations). He drops by my office and starts talking to me about how he had to come here to oversee the location and he is now an operations manager, as this location was less productive than the others. He says I will be reporting directly to him from now on, which is really strange because I did not work for his company, I work for the tech company. Anyway, a couple of weeks go by, and he informs me I have to go to one of the other locations with him (2 hour drive) because they have ""phenomenal numbers"" and this location didn't. So, I head out with him to see what is going on, but when we get there, and I actually see the numbers, there isn't a large discrepancy, in fact, my home location was performing better than the other. On the drive back, he puts his hand on my leg. I brush it away. His hand goes back. I tell him to stop. He did. We arrive back at the home location, and I am shocked and confused by what had happened. I didn't know what to do, my biggest fear is revealing vulnerability, so I didn't tell anyone. I just sat in my car and cried. Couple of weeks pass again, he calls me into his office to discuss the word count on a message I crafted. When I knock on his door, he bids me to enter, he is standing behind his desk and asks me to walk over. He turns toward me in his chair and his penis is displayed in full view: ""You should suck this."" Again, I have no idea what to do, I froze up. After what felt like 5 hours, I just walked out. I was in such a perilous position - between two companies - do I talk to my HR department, his? His father owns the company, things aren't the same in their culture. Two days later, he comes to my office, pulls his penis out and tells me to bend over the desk because he will make me submit to him. Thankfully, someone came down the hall and was on their way to my office. There were a dozen of these instances, and I didn't know how to deal with them. I sat in silent shame. No one tells you, not really, how to deal with sexual harassment. There's a clear line of reporting, but how do you reveal something that makes you feel violated to someone you don't really trust, like a supervisor you rarely have contact with? Anyway, I just think we as a society need to do better. **TL;DR** I was sexually harassed by an executive's son in the workplace on multiple occasions, I was young, I didn't know how to deal with it. I feel like society needs to do better for everyone."

See that below. URL So basically, the pregnancy went super well. He was always doing just perfect. She had high fluid but it didn't cause any complications and one day after his due date, he was born. She woke me up when her water broke at 2:58 am and he was born a little before 6am. He has all his fingers and toes, he can hear fine, he likes boobs and being held close to your chest. We just got done watching a Mongolian Throat singing performance and he fell asleep on me. He's the fucking best. My granny cried when she held him today and she's a tough woman. It's rare to see that vulnerability. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go watch him flail around in his crib.

It has never been anything major, and was completely manageable when I had a psychologist. During the last two years I've seemingly become worse, and while it is completely fine mostly there are also low points. Today I found myself walking, talking to myself and trying to process whatever it is I'm processing. Soon afterwards I'm just sitting down on a road, crying, laughing, joking and berating myself in a way that is hopefully less maniacal than it looks on paper. I was aware of it all, and would immediately stop as soon as someone got close, yet when the whole evening devolved into me ultimately repeating ""I can"" with a giggle I start to get worried. It didn't feel wrong then, and doesn't now either, because the whole phrase seemed so innocent and meaningless, wonderfully absent from any need to analyse or think about it. I don't know if this is what people call an episode, or what it is, but it happens from.time to time. It would honestly be fine if I had some way to deal with it, but after the psychologist had to move I don't really have anyone who I can admit vulnerability to. I can talk about parts of it all, but do so in an analytical manner that makes me wonder if the subject is myself or a test case from some paper. I'm writing this here because in real life I'd lie till I was blue before admitting to the smallest part of it. Sure, I'd repeat my observations, and have already done so to a very small degree (sleep deprivation only), to others. But the tone would be as impersonal as possible, and any body language focused on seeming collected. It is not a conscious decision, and even when I'm conscious of it I still refuse to show any cracks. Writing all this is a way of putting it all on print. I don't know if it will help, but at least it is there. PS. Sorry to anyone who read this text. It wasn't written with reading in mind, but rather as a way of getting everything on paper for myself."

A bit lonely, even in company. Walking through the maze of life's problems ( grad school ,financial stuff, trying to improve myself every day). I don't feel opening up to friends,who are mostly untrustworthy and may leverage my vulnerability. Parents are toxic , and non existent sorta. Moved from CA to DC, and feel lost. Made few friends , being South Asian doesn't help either. Sometimes it feels it would be so great to place my head on someone's shoulder and just open up,share thoughts. Yet everyone sees me as the strong guy who rides around in a motorcycle,without vulnerabilities - who see my stoic mask.

But I felt the impulse to express it, even if it's to strangers or it exists unread. I need you more than I can say. You are part of the fabric of my existence. I owe so much of my strength to you. During times of extraordinary hardship or periods of hopelessness you are a star in my sky, guiding me home. If my brain and its contents were magically converted into a new language, your name would translate to ""absolute joy and tranquility"" . Obviously I can't just tell you this. We're 2 people who don't express the depths of our emotions directly. One of our many common traits is a reluctance to be or fear of, vulnerability. But if the day ever comes when I grow out of that fear, or my reluctance fades and is replaced with an all consuming desire too explain to you in detail, just how much you mean to me and how I don't think I could lead a normal or fulfilling life without you and how terribly that thought scares me, this will be here lol."

I have been plagued with so many thoughts and have been crying uncontrollably at the thought of not being around them as often. My grandma recently died, which hit my mum incredibly hard, since she dedicated her whole life to being around her and never really got educated, had a job/career or any responsibilities other than 'looking after' her dad and very ill mother. She feels really lost and lonely now, since she has no real world experience, she is finding it very hard to find her feet and start her new job properly. My moving away has further saddened and demotivated her and guilt trips me often that she is now even lonelier (she has her husband (my stepdad) and my two brothers and many friends, so she isn't lonely at all). After seeing her very depressed and without much will to live, I am worried my absence will make her worse. It also doesn't help that we have an amazing relationship and I see her as my best friend pretty much. While I am very grateful to have such a wonderful mother and a good life with her it has made it very hard for me to come to terms with leaving home. It is just unfathomable. I am not even excited nor happy, just homesick, yet I haven't even left home. I keep crying and moping around. I know it's normal to move out, especially for university - every single friend of mine has done it, so it isn't something out of the norm. I feel like leaving will change my life completely and I won't have that closeness with her or my family anymore, and time will pass by so much so that I won't even get to see my young brothers grow up or be able to spend time with my mother before old age/illness hits (we have a family history of cancer). I feel like I am insulting her in the worst way possible and leaving her alone at the height of her sadness/vulnerability after the passing of her mother. Bottom line is, I am really worried things will never be the same again. Change scares me. If there are any encouraging words out there, I need to hear them."

Sometimes I feel trapped inside my own body, like a spectator to my own life who can only watch helplessly as I stumble from one botched interaction to another. I also feel like I'm on the brink of tears a lot, but I can never bring myself to full-on cry. I'm physically incapable of trusting other people enough to open up to them about how I'm feeling. And if I actually did confide in someone, I can guarantee that it would end poorly - either my awkward attempt at vulnerability would make them uncomfortable, or they would go on and gossip about me. I hate looking at myself in the mirror. I hate meeting new people cuz I always mess it up, but I hate being alone even more. And now I'm starting to feel anxious whenever I'm in a big crowd. I'm the worst. I feel unlovable. I have no hobbies so I try to kill as much of my free time napping as I can. My family adores me but I feel like I'm an absolute fraud who's completely failing them. But in spite of all this, I don't think I'm depressed. I don't feel like this every day. I'm also not suicidal. I used to tell myself that if my life still sucked at 30 years old, I would kill myself. But I don't think like that any more. To be honest, sometimes I wonder if I ever did, or if I was just faking it to seem dark and interesting. All I know is that tonight I feel profoundly alone. I'd hoped that typing all this out would be cathartic, but I don't feel any better. EDIT: also, I fucking miss my dog"

I wish youd just tell me how you feel for once, i feel like you never have or do. you always always keep that shit bottled up and I know that has to suck. maybe youre numb to it who knows. You think youre afraid to hurt my feelings? You think Im that weak. I'd be the happiest person alive if you told me to jump off the tallest building nearby because you hated me if it meant you actually shared how you felt. sorry I over communicate(d) how I feel, but it feels good to embrace feelings. You should try it sometime. I know thats always been painful, vulnerability. Youve said before ""You didnt like me appealing to you from a position of weakness"". I dont care about that, Ill be weak all day long knowing Im at least honest to myself and others. omnia vanitas, memento mori. I grow more and more disappointed by the women I court as each attempt goes by. none of them have the same spark behind their eye. it is infinitely saddening, what has happened to us. its ironic, as I dont really know how much of my feelings are valid or idealised. perhaps Im crazy. perhaps our relationship was poinsoned and doomed so fucking early on and you just got off on watching me squirm and on to the next. I dont think thats the real you though. I think thats the you that started to like the power and control you saw you had over people. that vanity will come and go, just like us I guess. as strong of words as these are, Im just venting. love u bb. hope youre well, wherever you are and whatever youre doing these days. im just a phone call away, I hope you know that. as long as this is, ive become a much better listener."
611,vulnerability,offmychest,Quest for emotional connection.,2,6y62ex,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6y62ex/quest_for_emotional_connection/,2017-09-05 15:54:04,"I sometimes think to myself and reflect on how I'm very nomadic when it comes to being emotionally invested into people. It's nothing on purpose and at the time, I am not really aware of it. It's a cycle. I invest a little into someone, it grows and gets stronger. Then some way or another, I let it die out and I start to retreat. Sometimes it's because I end up giving all that emotional connection to someone else (which goes south anyways) but other times I have no clue. I am someone who truly prides themselves on being able to connect with people. Why do I let these connections go? I do not take advantage of people, so it's not like I'm getting something and then just leave. Am I afraid of vulnerability? Well, that's a natural instinct, everyone is. I feel almost empty, like a bag of chips that only has crumbs left on the bottom. Maybe I am just emotionally inarticulate. Over thinking is my specialty, with a little side of anxiety to go along with it. A combo deadlier than we care to acknowledge. "
612,vulnerability,offmychest,Thank You Kesha,57,6qa9z9,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6qa9z9/thank_you_kesha/,2017-07-29 20:26:34,"When I was in high school I was in a horrible relationship. Like REALLY horrible.. physically, emotionally, mentally abusive for almost 3 years. A lot of stuff happened that I kept to myself (looking back, idk how no one saw what was happening) but I eventually decided to graduate early, solely to get away from my abuser and the life he created for me. Some stuff happened, he got arrested for his actions and after it all, I was still able to move on with my life. I took this as an extreme ""blessing"" from life and made the most of it. I decided to become a nurse, got accepted into a nursing program, and in the last year I've graduated and become a registered nurse working in a hospital and I'm on a really bright path. I also met my husband (just got married 21 days ago!!) and we moved to a new city with our 2 cats and puppy. My life is wonderful now. All of this abuse happened from age 15 to almost 18 years old and I'm now 21 and completely moved on in my life but I still haven't moved on from the scarring. It took me a long time to even realize/accept that I've been scarred by this. I've tried therapists but I'm still working on finding one that I'm comfortable with. As of now, I've never told anyone all of the details of what I endured, not even my husband. He knows the surface details but neither he nor I care to discuss what really happened. I'm working on getting it al off of my chest but in the mean time I turned to music. listening to heart break songs, etc but nothing really summed up the amount of absolute insanity I went through, it only scratched the surface (as in, only discussed normal break ups, not abusive ones). Anyways, it's been a few years and I've been trying to find something to help this healing process and finally, I I found it. I used to be a slight fan of Kesha in middle school and fell away from her in high school. She had the whole thing with Dr. Luke happen to her and recently made a come back with her song ""praying"" and I actually think this is my saving grace. This song has 100% summed up every ounce of feeling I've had since what happened in my life. The feelings of realization that I wasn't the problem, accepting it, and hoping that the other person heals for the sake of others.. she summed it up. Even when I was a fan of hers I still knew she was pretty weird but this song made me LOVE her. I just need to say why... At the point I'm at, I've accepted the events in my life. I know now that I won't ever get an apology and I know that i may not even have anyone acknowledge what I went through as real because I have yet to tell anyone the full story. But these events really made me suffer. And I went through a REALLY hard time of literally praying and looking for answers as to why this happened to me. And I came to some pretty rough, soul- breaking, yet healing conclusions. I stripped myself down looking for answers and eventually found them. In this song Kesha discusses wishing prayer and soul changing on the person who hurt her and as ""big"" as that sounds, I understand that as being one of the worst thing you can wish on someone. I remember feeling so scared that my ex boyfriend now had the power to move on and cause this same harm on someone else. I hoped and prayed that he would realize what he was, how wrong he was, the power he had.. I wished he could reflect on himself and find the strength to change because I didn't want him to make anyone feel the way he made me feel. I also knew that realizing something like that took strength and it would be so painful because he would also have to realize that he is weak and needed to heal. But, even after his arrest, he received no repercussions and because of this I feel he may never learn what a monster he was. I stopped following his case after realizing the amount of stress it caused me wasn't worth it.. After all of this, I still feel like I've set out a bomb in the world. I know that this person is capable of so much harm, even after the harm he caused, no one had stopped it. I don't think he has the strength to fix himself because only the weakest can hurt someone so much but I still hope he finds that strength. I know now, after reflecting on myself that he is the only person capable of ""fixing"" himself, court ordered or not. And I know it's been years and, at this point, im optimistic that he's changed with time, but I still can't imagine someone so evil getting better. And even if he does or has, I know that to heal he would have to realize his evil and no decent human could accept that without feeling shattered inside.. so, I wish healing on my abuser. I wish he could feel the same bare, raw, vulnerability that I felt while trying to ""solve"" what was wrong with me because having to reflect on myself was/is the most painful thing I've endured, even after everything he put me through. And it changed me for the better, making me kinder and more accepting and tolerant of others. It made me realize I wasn't the cause and I hope, if he does the same, he will realize he was the cause and will change himself. Realizing my ""innocence"" was hard enough, I can't imagine the pain of a realization of guilt. Reflecting is a skill, one that I was forced to learn and continue to work on. I'm thankful for being able to learn but it still hurts. It's something that Kesha wishes for her abuser in her song. People like that need to reflect and realize what it is to be in the position they choose to put others in. Because to cause someone pain that strong, you need to know a pain even stronger. And this requires even more healing as an individual. So, Kesha, thank you for putting these painful healing thoughts into words. I finally have an outlet for this darkness that I've worked so hard on bringing to light. Idk if this makes sense it's really late at night and these are some pretty jumbled thoughts. I just needed to let this out, I absolutely love this song and I love Kesha for writing it. TL:DR I had a traumatic experience followed by a few years of acceptance and healing. Kesha recently wrote a song that sums up EXACTLY where I am at in the healing process and I just need to make it known. I am so appreciative and thankful. Thank you Kesha for making me feel not so alone. "
613,vulnerability,offmychest,My friend was arrested and charged with first-degree murder (his mother). I feel sick.,6,6rp33d,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6rp33d/my_friend_was_arrested_and_charged_with/,2017-08-05 11:49:57,"I made a friend via a Yahoo Chat Room back in 2004. We had been very close since then and told each other pretty much everything. He has always had a damaged relationship with his mother. He's always hated her and has told me stories of when he was a child and how she abused him. A few months ago, he took advantage of my vulnerability and kindness, as well as my inability to really do anything about what he wanted to do. He is well into his adult years now. I sent him a message about a week ago and hadn't heard back. As the days went by, I got the feeling that something had happened. I Googled his name and the second result made me want to vomit and faint at the same time. He had killed his mother and been arrested. An argument started everything, but she died and he had minimal wounds. It just really doesn't look good that his mom was the one that came at him first, but possible. A few months ago he asked if I had a particular app that deletes messages after a chosen amount of time. None of them save and are completely private. I figured he asked me to download it because he was a tinfoil hat type conspiracy theorist, plus I like trying out new apps. At first, the conversations were harmless. Our usual. Then one day he confessed wanting to kill his mom and started bribing me with $ (I had mentioned my financial problems in the recent past) to help be a coverup. I acted interested to see if he had actually planned anything, to then tip off the police (anonymously) to his plans. He was too smart for that. Every single time he brought up the idea (few times a month), his story changed. I immediately said that I felt uncomfortable with these conversations and didn't want to be involved. He apologized and I thought that was that. Then he tried asking me questions subtly. I acted dumb because it was obvious as to why he'd be asking certain things. I then started to try to reason with him, saying that doing something that drastic would ruin his life and that I thought he was a good friend. That he didn't deserve to be abused but he didn't deserve to be locked up for life either. That he should just move out of his mom's house (as I stated earlier, he's well into being an adult) and stop speaking to her. That I hoped he'd make the right decision. He said that he felt she didn't deserve to live because of how much shit and grief she had caused. That he'd be better off knowing she was gone for good. I barely responded to his messages after that. Occasionally, having conversations but always changing the subject so he'd engage in other thoughts. After what I know now, I wish I had tried to get more information out of him. The only information I really had was that he wanted to kill this woman. Even if I had told authorities, them speaking to him would have tipped him off that I had told someone. He could have played dumb then, said that he planned no such thing and thus putting my safety in danger. To my knowledge, I am the only one he had told. I should also mention I live 200 miles away and would have to drive to his city to make a police report against him. I could not afford to do that. I know I couldn't have really done anything to prevent this but part of me is telling me I could have. I want to puke, I want to scream, and part of me even wants to die a little. So many people are in pain because of his actions and I'm blaming myself. I have since blocked him on all accounts and phone numbers. I don't want to be friends with a murderer and I honestly felt that he didn't have it in him, that he was just in pain. I was very wrong."
614,vulnerability,offmychest,I [30 F] just sent my husband [31 M] to jail for child sex abuse,1218,6t03zh,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6t03zh/i_30_f_just_sent_my_husband_31_m_to_jail_for/,2017-08-11 19:47:47,"I discovered my husband of 10 years is a pedophile and has been abusing a close family member. I'm trying to cope with this and I am not. At all. I feel like dying, although I wouldn't ever act on it for the sake of my children. He went to jail 3 days ago. I'm angry at a lot of his family, as I feel the ones involved in the chain of abuse that led to this failed. I'm hurt and disgusted with him. At the same time, I'm mourning the loss of my best friend and my kids' father. It's horribly conflicting and I keep riding the waves of grief, barely afloat. Horrific images keep playing in my mind. I don't sleep, save a couple hours a night. I don't eat much. I'm struggling with the desire to drink myself stupid so I can numb this excruciating pain. To explain my anger with his family, here is the horrendous history they've kept hushed. His grandfather [90 M] is a raging alcoholic and a pedophile. He abused my mother-in-law as a child. Then, he abused her daughter, as well. When my MIL and I had discussed this before she passed, I asked her why she would have ever put her daughter in a position of vulnerability with him. I couldn't imagine how she even continued to have a relationship with him. She said she had blocked that part of her memory and forgotten it had happened to her, then it all came flooding back when the abuse allegations involving her daughter arose. She has since passed away. Speaking with her daughter, my husband's sister, she said that she had been left with family members for extended periods as a child because her mom worked in remote location for lengthier times. Piecing these parts of the story together, I still cannot fathom how one can forget such things and put their child in that position. I am very angry at my MIL for her lack of preventative measures and blame her to a degree for what has happened since So, when my sister in law was a preteen, she sexually assaulted my husband at the age of 5. This didn't come out until later on, when my husband first committed sexual assault himself. He was a preteen at the time he first perpetrated. My MIL had taken a woman and her 7 year old daughter in off the streets for a period of time over Christmas. She discovered my husband and the girl pantsless in his room. She did nothing. It took years later when the girl went to the doctor, had a vaginal exam, and the abuse came out. He was charged, with what exactly I don't know. He was placed on house arrest and put into diversion therapy. I talked to him at length about this when I first heard of it, in the beginning of our relationship. His sister didn't like me because I was ""stealing her brother from her"". He spent less time with her and she was threatened by me, so she would tell me all the dirty family secrets in the hope I would leave him. So, the entire incestuous history was relayed to me. I brought it up to him as soon as she told me. I was mortified. Of all the horrific things experienced, this was the most morally disgusting thing I'd ever heard and I had no experience with that kind of abuse. I was relatively healthy sexually, if not repressed compared to my peers. He assured me that the counseling had set him straight. He discussed the shame and the group therapy. He was ashamed that I had found out, angry his sister had divulged that so soon, without giving him the chance to tell me. It was about 9 months into the relationship. I was already in love and believed everything he said. I was wrong and I feel so horrendously guilty for trusting him. I come from my own line of fucked up hell, but had no experience with sex abuse. Regardless, I have many of my own emotional issues. I battle depression, anxiety and anger constantly, but I'm able to redirect and cope better than most. I'm pretty functional most of the time. All of this fresh hell has brought up all of the horrible events of my own past. To give a ""brief"" summary of my history - I grew up around constant abuse. Physical, verbal, and drug abuse. My mother was high on opioid painkillers from when I was 5 until 14, when she went to jail and was forced to quit. She was often comatose or near it during my childhood. She ended up dying 4 years after her sobriety because of the damage the drugs had reaped. I was 18, she was only 49. Because of my mom's issues, we spent many years living with my aunt and grandmother. My aunt hit my mother, sister, and I a lot during our childhood. Broomsticks, fists, whatever was available. One time, she threw a mug at my mother and shattered her shoulder, resulting in 2 surgeries and a prosthetic bone replacement. She verbally abused everyone, including my grandmother. She was an angry, unhappy person and we all suffered her misdirected wrath.... My uncle [34 M, at death] had drug abuse problems and committed suicide long before I was born, just before his daughter ever met him. He went into the mountains shot himself in his car. My mother [27 F, at the time] had to drive the car down the mountain, still covered in his remains. Something clearly happened to my mother and her siblings when they grew up, but whatever it was, no one talked about it. No one went to therapy. It just got pushed under the surface and locked away. At times, I have felt the addictive tendencies coming out and have to reign it in, for fear I'll end up like one of my family members. Sometimes, it feels easier to throw yourself into a bottle and avoid the pain. Many people are unable to reel it in when those urges to say ""fuck it all"" hit. I've coped with a lot, but I'm totally losing my shit right now. The weight of it all is crushing me. I lost my best friend, the memories of him tainted with the sting of what he's done. I can't believe that I've lived with him so long and been so close, but he was a monster, hiding it all from his ""best friend."" I feel like I missed some sign I should have seen and the guilt is overwhelming. Then I think of all the people that could have done something to change the course of things that didn't. I wonder what would have happened if only someone got him the help he needed, when he needed it.... If any of the abuse had been reported at any time, how differently would everyone's lives have been? But nobody said anything. To this day, his grandfather has not answered for what he did. He has lived a long life of freedom doing God knows what to who. How many lives have been hurt? I know of 5, directly related to his actions. It kept happening because people were shamed into secrecy, too afraid to speak up, kept sweeping things under the rug. No one got proper counseling. The cycle just continued. Now, I'm left alone to support my family to pick up the pieces. We are all entering therapy and I'm sure will continue for years to come. I don't know if any of us will ever truly recover from the damage done. I think I might have finally had the last straw that will break me for good. Tl;Dr: My husband has become the next link in a chain of incestuous sexual abuse and I'm falling apart in every imaginable way. "

""maybe we'll date other people and find our way back to each other."" thinking like that is so embarrassing. i can't imagine how much worse it would be thinking that while you were actually there, breaking up in person. i've had this note for weeks, editing and deleting and adding. i still don't know what to do with it. vulnerability sucks. ""understanding"" and ""closure"" sound nice and pretty but....like for us, i think has just always been easier to kinda sweep the small stuff under the rug - but then when we get in a bigger fight it all comes back again because we haven't resolved it. right now, we're okay because we've swept everything under the tug. we're broken up but we're communicating almost as if we haven't you know? i don't know how to put distance between us. maybe the 4 months apart will do it. maybe the whole i'm going to actively try to move on and my heart will catch up mindset works. but i still don't know if keeping our emotional connection open is smart. you said you thought meeting one on one would be sad because it would be a goodbye. what does that even mean? it's not just a goodbye, it's an end. a real end. i'm not at the point where i want to accept that which is why i'm scared of an one on one which just reiterates everything we've already said before. it feels like you're moving on, or you're finding acceptance in all this. i'm not. i don't want to be your best friend anymore. i just want to be myself.

It's rare for anything bad to actually happen, but the thought that they *know too much* about me makes me extremely uncomfortable. I have avoided and ultimately lost friends because of this. I often dodge personal questions and hide things that don't really matter. I wish I could just talk to an AI instead of a human therapist. Or answer a multiple choice quiz, get my results, and then get written instructions on how to fix my problems, without ever having to interact with someone personally. I can't see myself being able to even tell a therapist my problems. The thought of being in the same room as one makes me nervous. It's irrational. I don't know what I'm even afraid of. I can function well enough to survive; I'm just unsatisfied and feel like I could do better. I've made progress over the years. It's just frustratingly slow.

I'm sex repulsed, I cant stand the thought or sights of sex, but to hug a woman, kiss a woman, share a bed with a woman to me speaks a wondrous volume of affection that is passionate and pure. I fell for one of my closest friends at the age of 16, I was head over heels in love, she felt the same, I won't go too heavy into the backstory, but basically, We were together for 5 years, the first 3 years were amazing...But questions started being asked and over the course of 2 years, she wanted to have sex and I just couldn't do it and as a result our once wonderful relationship fell completely and utterly apart and it tears my soul asunder. It's been a year and a half since our relationship ended. Not a single day goes by when I don't think about it...How all that time we spent together has amounted to nothing, all the money we spent on one another, meaningless. Every night of resting in the safety of each other arms and the pushing of my lips against hers... But what destroys me and what has me thinking about this every day for the last year and a half is what she said to me when the dreaded conversation came: ""I don't feel like I'm anything more than a friend to you."" How can you say that...I shared my bed with you...That is where you are most vulnerable...and I shared that vulnerability with you because I loved you...I kissed you passionately because I adored you...and you felt like you wasn't anything more than a mere friend? I don't think anyone will understand and I know sex is an important part of most relationships, but to me, I shared something with her that I couldn't with anybody else... I cut all contact with her, because I couldn't see her without feeling immense grief, I couldn't even look at her anymore because I don't understand how you're supposed to go back to being friends after everything...I wanted to stay friends, I truly did, but seeing her at all destroys me... Please any advice to try and help me get over this would be greatly appreciated, I'm so scared and frightened that I'm going to have to bring this with me for the rest of my life. I'm tired of thinking about it everyday...and I feel like I can never let myself get close to another person ever again because whats the point if I'm just going to experience all this pain again if it doesn't work out."

They just keep putting it off as pointless drama and move on with their lives. I mean, I get it. I'm a seventeen year old female, so obviously it must be in my nature to be some obnoxious nuisance to society that only wants to make everyone miserable (totally no sarcasm there), but can't I just be allowed to work things out with other people when I see a problem? Apparently not. Is it so much to ask for to just have someone in my life, in person and not just on the internet, who would be willing to listen to me and try to help me out with my struggles, rather than just expecting me to get over everything and move on? I'm just so sick of how every time I show even the slightest hint of vulnerability, I end up getting verbally abused. I just wish that someone took me seriously and cared about how I felt. Instead, it just feels like people wish for me to disappear. "
621,vulnerability,offmychest,Healing from an extremely abusive relationship. It's like rawly and painfully awakening and remembering who I am.. what I'm worth.. and slowly restoring my faith in humans.. belief in good.. and love.,3,6ma1xm,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6ma1xm/healing_from_an_extremely_abusive_relationship/,2017-07-10 07:20:06,"Hi everyone. I don't really have anyone to bare my heart to right now. I want to send this out to the universe and see what comes back. I really appreciate your perspectives.. whatever corner of the world you're in.. whatever life path you've walked. I dated, what I recently learned in psychology is called, a ""narcissist"" for eight months. He was incredibly cruel and selfish but hooked me with rare very special moments of revealing a deeply hurt.. damaged but in some ways wholesome.. helplessly pure childlike heart. He would verbally and emotionally abuse me but sometimes with time, he would realize how hurtful or selfish his actions were. With sincere tears in his eyes he would apologize and express that he's learning and wants to change.. express that his cruel actions and words are purely from ignorance because even his own mother never showed him any love, open-heartedness, gentleness, morals. It doesn't come as a surprise.. he experienced a horribly abusive heartbreaking childhood. He used that excuse almost always. And being an empath.. my heart opened and poured for him, I wanted to love him more. Help him see all women aren't money hungry and out to lie and cheat. Show him it's okay to open and be vulnerable. My upbringing wasn't perfect either. I honestly felt we were both ""breaking"" our cycles of hurt from the abuse and neglect our parents created. (My family was very poor growing up and my father abandoned my mother, sister and I when I was 12.) He always said such amazing things about growing old together.. building character through experience.. being there for eachother.. building a life and family together that's strong and confident (him) but sensitive giving and loving (me). He would say I am the best person he's ever met with character he values most above anything. That I have changed his life forever in all aspects of his life.. work. And I was learning a lot about patience, understanding, and forgiveness. No relationship is flawless and flatlined. I appreciate and value rolling with the punches of life. Struggle is what makes you grow.. its the only way to learn and become better, more open, build character and heart. It keeps you grounded and humbles you. And I love the idea of a life partner who is down to walk the sometimes mountainous path of life with you. I reallllly respect and value open-mindedness, adaptiveness, willingness, and effort. Anyway.. I honestly believed we could awaken together.. Live more and more with awareness.. and mindfulness.. and learn together. But I was wrong. He would tell me his ex was exceptionally beautiful.. she was a professional model.. but I'm pretty. His other ex is very smart. But I'm definitely not smart. I'm talented and creative. But not smart because ""my brain is not the type that could do physics problems or be an engineer."" In the painful fights about this.. I asked him.. ""so your father who is a farmer.. your mom who is a dentist.. and even yourself.. according to your definition aren't smart."" He had nothing to say to that. This is one of the most painful fights I ever experienced. I stayed with a man who fought me and defended himself for the right to call me stupid.. many times. He would tell me my problems are trivial.. that he doesn't care about my pleasure.. several times he would fuck me and just roll over. I would silently cry in the dark and ""finish myself"" next to him as he snored. We fought so many times about our sex life. It was always selfish and only about him. I invited him to a vacation in Palm Springs with my closest girlfriends and their partners. He ignored me the whole trip. It was so strange. I pulled him aside and spoke up about how this vacation was for him to get to know my best friends but it's also for us. He talked to my one single friend the whole time. They walked around the farmers market side by side and did not include the rest of us in anyway. He hates horror movies but when that one friend said she wanted to watch a horror movie he immediately said let's do it! It was getting late and everyone was slowly going into their rooms. I asked my ex.. cmon let's take a bubble bath together. He said no.. this movie is awesome. It was just the two of them having a blast chatting and reacting to the movie together with the lights off. They acted like how a great couple acted. Attentive.. caring.. laughing together. Later he said this was all harmless he just genuinely wanted to see the movie and he only connected with my friend Jen because my other friends were quieter. I took a bath by myself and got drunk on wine. I rarely drink. Two glasses and I was very very drunk. I was so deeply hurt I just went to bed. After the movie he came into the room and initiated sex. I was so drunk I barely remember it happening I just lied there in the fetal position. I had to get up and run to the bathroom to vomit from the movements. He didn't care that I was sick or too drunk. He just passed out. In the morning he asked.. did you really throw up.. I could smell it on you. He said that was one of the greatest things about me.. ""You never leave me wanting."" No matter if I'm sad or sick.. he could come fuck me. He always said marriages end because the woman stops having sex and uses it as a weapon withholding it. That he has friends who haven't had sex in 6 months. He'd ""never allow that."" My heart sinks when I think about all this. When I brought up the fact that multiple times when I have been very sick.. (one time I was throwing up all night from a stomach virus).. he didn't ask if I was ok or offer to get me a single glass of water. He fought and yelled at me saying ""there was nothing I could do!"" Even if he just asked once.. are you okay? Can I get you some water? Or pat my back.. or just even sat with me for a bit.. That would have meant the world to me. In fact I would have told him to just go to bed and that I'll be okay. My heart feels so heavy writing this. This wasn't love at all. He was so proud that he had slept with 120 women in 5 years. He told me I was the first one he gave eye contact with when having sex. And he said he typically didn't kiss the girls he'd sleep with. That I have no idea how much he's changed. I brought this up so many times.. that I want to make love.. sex should be us sharing how we feel physically.. it's about both of us..and he just never cared. He would say for him sex is just carnal and sometimes he needs to be a man and take it. Its not about whether I orgasm or enjoy it. It's just about him. It was all about power and control. I never once orgasmed in the 8 months we dated. He never tried. It was always for him. He went down on me maybe for a few minutes total in our whole relationship. He always blamed it on me. He said some women aren't confident or comfortable orgasming in front of people. He would say some girls orgasmed as soon as he put his dick in them. Typing this out I know it sounds fucking heartbreaking and pathetic. I know. If I heard all this from my sister or if my future daughter were telling me all this... I would be utterly mortified and devastated for them. Sometimes it's very hard to see unobstructed reality when you're struggling in the middle of everything. Every single week for the 8 months we dated, I drove 22 miles with traffic to spend time with him. One time I drove over to talk about how he's hurt me as I am crying next to him in his bed.. he got mad at me and said ""I told you I was tired!"" and he went to sleep. I was so hurt and disappointed but not surprised. I drove all the way back home. He didnt notice. We went on a snowboarding trip with his coworkers to Mammoth and he was being an arrogant bully to me infront of his friends. Trying so hard to be funny and cool. I pulled him into our room and I spoke up and said he is hurting my feelings. He said ""its all in your head."" He ignored me for the whole drive home. We were a few miles from my place so I said I want to go home to my place.. not his apartment which was about 50 minutes away in traffic. He stopped the car and immediately threw all my luggage, pillows, snowboard, on the side of the road and drove off. I dont know a single person.. especially a man who would have done that. . He later said ""youre in charge of your actions.. you said you can take an uber."" Alot of hope in me died that day. I never thought people could be this cruel. I never imagined experiencing someone like this. Later on I ubered to his place to pick up my car. He said ""sometimes I fuck up."" that was it. As much research indicates.. people who were abused as children often have a very unhealthy relationship with sex. He was once over 500 pounds but with sheer will.. starving and lifting he lost 230lbs. From age 30 to 35 he overcompensated by ""fucking and conquering as many women as possible doing whatever it takes to make them comfortable"" His greatest fantasy is rape. He would often tell me his greatest ""id"" fantasy is to kick down a door like a Viking and violently rape a wife as his defenseless smaller frightened husband is forced to watch in horror. (My ex is 6'5) He used to ""jokingly"" say rape victims often orgasm because in a subconscious level they loved it. He would joke and say 50 shades of grey is about him.. and there's a reason why that franchise is insanely popular. Women love and want to be raped on a cave man level. He absolutely lovess the new Westworld for how brutal and fetishized rape, pleasures, violence, dominance, and indulgence is. He would often say when he looks around and thinks about it.. his character and life is similar to most great leaders. The greatest leaders he knows arent emotional, caring, sensitive, ""squishy"" or giving. Superstar singers.. athletes.. businessmen like trump.. geniuses like Steve jobs.. world famous video game designers.. they all have one thing in common. They ""lick the earth"" as he would put it.. and they dont hold back their id-driven desires. That is the source of their greatness and inspiration, especially as an artist (we're both artists). Being a sensitive ""squishy"" ..that all seemed so empty to me. He told me one of his fantasies ""is to have a line of hundreds of women waiting their turn to be fucked.. i impregnate them and I don't take care of the babies."" His exact words. ""Like a Viking king"" He often said sex is a need. If he doesn't have sex in two weeks everyone starts to look like meat. He doesn't care. Men and women alike. I tried to understand the root of all this. It was horrifying to hear but in all these stories.. all I saw was this nerdy obese kid who was ignored all of his life... a guy who was so ignored that he lost his virginity to a prostitute... this helpless little boy who would be locked in his room for days by his horrible stepfather. His cries ignored by his cold mother to ensure her loans are paid by this new man. It all screamed suffering and heartbreak. Especially because I personally know several women who have experienced rape and I have been volunteering with The Rape Foundation for several years. I really tried not to judge. How can you.. life is crazy and sometimes devastating.. and some of us are dealt difficult cards.. like your parents. And humans are capable of such cruelty.. a lot of times they genuinely think they're doing the right thing. We also got into many painful fights about his views on having children and marriage. He said he would absolutely test the blood of his babies. That was a deal breaker. I would explain how hurtful that is. He would say its not about me. It's statistics. Women will lie and have men financially support children that are not theirs. (This is what his mother did to his stepfather. When his stepfather found out my ex wasn't his real son, he began to abuse my ex from a very young age.) He also said 80% of women initiate divorce for the payday. So if marriage was a deal breaker he would consider ""many types of arrangements"" with the help of his lawyers. Anyway.. 8 months we dated and he hurt me 1-3 times a week. According to him. 1-3 times a week I cried for no reason. But when things were good we were both adventurous.. incredibly playful.. tender.. driven.. and affectionate. We both love the same music and movies. We loved cuddling and watching movie after movie. We didnt have a lot in common but we liked that about eachother. His world is all about gaming and gaming art.. and my world is about the outdoors.. and adventures.. We both loved martial arts. He did Jujitsu and I did muay thai and kick boxing. I really miss the singing. He would sing to me.. and alter the lyrics so its about girlfriend. We loved going on long drives and talking about life.. our hopes and dreams. We both wanted to start our own start ups. We are both class clowns. We played a lot and messed with eachother often. He would say that I am the first woman he sees as an equal that he actually respects. But one thing was rawly clear. We were cut from different cloths. He's a big tall trump loving white guy from Texas who grew up in a big house with all his bills paid.. no student loans.. went to art school.. atheist.. first job was after college for a video game company.. etc. I'm a Korean American from the east coast who was raised by a struggling single immigrant mother.. have had at least one job since high school.. lived in my car in NYC.. put myself through college thus have student debt (this was a big issue for us.. he said for him to even consider marrying me.. I would have to get rid of my debt. I'm the first one in my family to go to college).. insatiably curious about spirituality.. religions.. philosophy, the human condition. I am such a sensitive giving tender hopeless romantic easily hurt squishy. And he's just a confident iron fist, force. His mother and the rest of his family believe vulnerability and feelings equal weakness. A few times he was very vulnurable and shared how when he gets married and starts a family, he plans to stay away from his family because they are all a very certain way. ""poverty mentality"" is what he would call it. He would share how his mom never cared.. and still doesnt care about his problems when he tries to open up to her. He would resent her for her hard coldness but I don't think he's aware of how attached and proud he is of her. He'd laugh and say ""my mom is a tempest. Shes the boss of the house, what she says goes, she gets her way, she's dominant she's fierce. She's a force."" He would express how the other girlfriends he introduced to his mom were shredded apart and ended up crying going up against such an intimidating woman. I see right thru all that. His mom holds a tremendous amount of guilt. He never once talked to her about how she abandoned him while his step father would abuse him and lock him up. For days he would sleep on a bare mattress.. starve.. and go to the bathroom in the room. He said he became obese because of this feeling of having absolutely no control and not knowing when he'll eat again. It's so heartbreaking. When he got older his step dad and mom sent him away to a military school for delinquent kids. He would be locked in his dorm for days as well. He would beat kids up and created a group of friends that he ""protected"". Multiple times he told me about a very feminine kid who would massage him in exchange for his protection. My ex would explain if they locked him up in his dorm for a few more weeks he would have absolutely fucked that feminine kid. My gut tells me he did a lot at that school that he'll probably never tell anyone. I see thru all this. He and his mom have taught eachother to pretend like nothing happened. To bury feelings. His family bonds by being mean to eachother. This is their style of love. This is their way of comforting eachother.. pretending like it went away. My ex is just an abandoned abused little boy who SO yearns for the affection, adoration and loyalty from his mom. He would explain how he truly believes she did the best she could and she did an amazing job as a mother and that he has to forgive her, and in order to truly forgive her he needs to believe she did the best she could do. I think thats a noble amazing thing to say.. but looking at his life, you can see.. it takes more than words to truly forgive someone. As time passes I am able to step back and look at things for what they are.. it's clear that he treats and views women like they are his mother. His sex life Is full of emotionless resentful aggression. In fact he prefers to be able to take it to have complete control. This is how he gets his power back. He will never make himself vulnerable because he doesnt want to feel the things he felt when his mother abandoned him as a child. He will test his future babies because his mom lied to his step dad about this. He will get a prenup because his mother went from man to man searching for someone who would finance her education. Last Christmas while he was visiting his mom, his childhood came up in conversation and his mother walked out of the house because she felt overwhelmed. It was the first time they had ever spoken about it. My ex called me and said this was the first time he had ever seen his mom break down and show emotion. He broke up with me in that minute on the phone because he said he simply cant have these feelings in his life. Seeing his mom break down reminding him of me, he cant handle it and its not healthy. All this exudes fear and suffering. I see the fear and suffering as it cycles through from mother to son. And I see this all without judgement. It's all so common. I see the ripples of fear and suffering that's been passed down from my father to me and how that's effected me and my relationships. Im not a doctor or a psychologist. But I have spent my whole life studying the human condition and the endless helpless human yearning for happiness.. fulfillment.. and feeling whole. I dont have a child and I will never truly know how my exs mom feels. But there are nights I cant sleep because I worry about our sweet family dog in Korea that is living her last days with cancer. We all have empathy and compassion in us. All humans are tender.. feel things.. and are innately good hearted.. soulful creatures. You can fill the void use distractions and run as much as you want. Humans know when theyre hurting others. Humans know atleast to the tiniest degree the effects of their actions. I know she's holding a lot of guilt and sadness heavily in her heart. She's created such a tough persona she can't get herself to let it out. And my ex has become the same way. I don't think he'll ever realize that. People will live a lifetime running from feeling. My heart goes out to them.. because every single one of us battles fear.. everyday. I don't think he'll ever realize.. all the characteristics and cruelty he hates about his mom.. is exactly how he is and how he treats others. My ex is incredibly charismatic to his coworkers and he's loved and well known at work. Many shy guys at his video game company idolize him and his ability to sleep with many women. He's this fearless jokester who is ""untouchable"". He is very proud of the fact that he hit the ""jackpot"" being born a tall white confident man. He has absolutely no one he's responsible for except for himself. Im very close to my mother and sister and when my parents divorced I pretty much stepped up and felt responsible for keeping the three of us together. Since high school I started to help financially support our family. He couldn't understand that. He'd simply say it's very good of me. We are such opposites and we knew this from day one. I was WAY too giving. I paid for amazing vacations because he had never snowboarded.. snowboarding was my life from middle school to college.in one particular trip to aspen I got really sad because he chose to spend two and a half days with a private instructor. I explained to him how I saved up for this vacation so we can bond and spend time together. Share something new. The main goal wasn't for him to have a free snowboarding vacation without me. He fought me and said the private lessons were for me so he can get better fast and board with me. I spent two days snowboarding alone. We were supposed to meet for lunch one of those days and they completely blew me off. I would have loved to spend the week on the bunny hill with him. All he ever wanted to do was play video games and stay in his dark apartment. We almost never went out. He didn't really have any friends except for coworkers. He said he only went out to get girls so he felt no need anymore. We always just walked down the street to Whole Foods.. got pressed food and stayed on the couch every weekend. If I brought up wanting to go hiking or renting bikes by he beach.. or going to a museum he would get mad at me and say the weekend is his time and he needs to play video games. I always planned amazing adventures for us.. especially for holidays.. things he'd never done in LA. He surprised me with a candle lit home made dinner one time. The first three times we ever went out to dinner was after me begging to go out and I paid. He used to say I am the balance and light that will melt the ice and softened the thorns around his heart. I remember one time he was just in awe. He didn't own any plates or cups so we went to target and I got him some essentials. He said he had never been treated or cared like this. In the beginning, he did hand draw me pictures of me which was really touching. He had flowers sent to my work. Once after we fought and once after I took care of him while and after he got a gal stone removed. He used to say he had never spent money on anyone. He used to never even buy girls drinks before taking them home. So many times I told him. I don't care about the money spent. Pick a dandelion for me. Let's share a mcdonalds apple pie on the beach. It's the thought, care, and effort that is so special. He just never got it. He blew me off on Valentine's Day because he was tired from work and didn't want to drive over even though I had spent a lot of time researching and bought expensive tickets for a special movie showing at a gorgeous vintage theater downtown. He also knew that I had a dress I had been saving to wear. He blew me off during the holidays when I kept asking and asking if we could get a tree and decorate it together. He said things like that aren't important to him. It just seems like he never cared about me and my happiness at all...and if it took an ounce of effort it never happened. I look back and beat myself up for staying and choosing to accept all the excuses. Honestly as the days pass and I continue to practice Shambhala meditation, self love and mindfulness.. I see I was YEARNING for that strong eternal male energy love... the love of an unconditionally loving caring father that I never had. He broke my heart 1-3 times a week for 8 months, honestly my heart and gut knew it was very wrong. But my yearning to fall in love and the yearning to settle down blinded me. He would hurt me so badly but then say the sweetest most amazing promises. And I CHOSE to accept those empty promises instead of real actions. I gave the love that I wished to receive. Even though my ex didn't deserve it. The biggest lesson I am walking away with is.. why did I stay for so long. That's where I am going to learn and grow from. That's where my self love needs to focus on. Believing in someone.. believing in hope.. believing in good and forgiveness are all wonderful things but there needs to be an unbreakable boundary where my self respect and self worth isn't brutalized. And I need to have enough self love and strength to walk away when my heart knows it's wrong. For good. Even when they're crying, apologizing, explaining, or making the most beautiful promises. The very last week we spoke. I texted him in the morning after fighting the night before. He bit my head off about bothering him at work. I went silent after that. After several hours he emailed me explaining he fucked up and when he gets emotionally overwhelmed he doesn't know how to deal. He said he loved me.. loved what we've built.. that I am a ray of sunshine he has been able to capture and he will never give up. He said he was going to come over that night to fix things. I was so exhausted and broken.. I couldn't get myself to respond. I just didn't get it. Me caring.. me reaching out being affectionate.. texting him to see if he's okay.. all of that to him was nothing but an annoyance and a horrible burden. If you have so many excuses against caring about someone.. and so much aggression and aversion against it... why be with them? How can I apologize and be sorry for burdening you with my affection? After getting no response for 5 hours he texted me. ""Actually I'm not coming tonight. I'm seeing other people."" That was it. After all we went through.. he threw me away in two sentences via text. That was it. After a few days. I emailed him a couple times that I deserved a proper phone call break up. He unblocked my number and finally called me. Immediately he just unloaded his anger. He blamed everything on me. He said I have a personality disorder and as my friend he was begging me to get help. That everything was in my head and that I cry for no reason. He said he knew from the first week of dating that I was the problem but he felt bad for me and was tired of hopping from one girl to another those were the only reasons he stayed with me for 8 months. He said he is tall.. confident and white.. he makes a shit ton of money and he LOVES his life. He said ""I simply have TOO MANY choices.. our connection wasn't special at all and I will love again"" he said he has mastered self love and I need to focus on loving myself. He said he had already fucked someone new and she is ""very sweet and fucking awesome"". I stayed on the phone as he said every single thing a hurt desperate person would say to try to convince himself that's he's okay.. he's in control.. he's not hurt.. and he's right and strong. We often talked about the five love languages. He always said he only needs physical touch. And I need all five which he thought was crazy and absurdly needy. I stayed on the phone with him as he described all the reasons why this new stranger he slept with was better than me. How her only love language is touch as well. He emailed me on Monday saying he will never give up, and by Thursday he had slept with someone new. As I listened to all this.. it finally clicked in my heart. That was it. All the hope and forgiveness and empty promises that he had stacked up broke in me. He finally cut the remaining fragile dwindling karmic tie between us. This was never meant to last. I was never going to make this guy happy.. my happiness and well being was never going to be his motivation.. and we were never going to work. Time stopped. As he yelled into my ear... I so clearly realized this horrible cruelty he was yelling into the phone was his internal dialogue convincing himself that he is right, he is okay, he not hurt, and he is not responsible. Having no control.. or being accountable for selfish hurtful actions causes him to lash out. He has such a fear of feeling things.. of getting hurt.. or having no control that he rather live a surface level life and cushion himself with yes people and agreeable circumstances that make his life easy and unchallenging. Control everything. That, believe it or not is the shortish summary of my last 10 months. There are so many other examples and details but I have a feeling you guys get the picture. So here I am today. It's been an up and down road to healing. Today my close friend sent me articles on the toxic relationship between empaths and narcissists. I am SHOCKED how accurate and to the T these articles capture our relationship. Our relationship was EXACTLY like how these articles explain it. Honestly... I wish fate would send these articles to him.. I even contemplated having my fiend or my sister email them to him. Is it wrong of me to care about his happiness and growth? Care about him opening his eyes to the destruction he's creating? Is it wrong of me that I don't violently hate him? I feel sad FOR him. I feel no need for relief by cursing him and saying cruel things. I have no need to fill any voids by sleeping with people and saying ""OH I am SO over him. OH he was horrible and I can do better."" Life is vast and life is crazy. How can I condemn and judge anyone? That's just not me. You can't control certain cards you're dealt... like your upbringing. But you DO have the choice in how you live on from these experiences. That is what I do choose to examine. I wish him bravery and strength.. I wish that for anybody and everybody. I wish that for myself too! I'm working on it everyday. Strength to see myself and life without any veils. See my actions without any self deception. (Deception like cushioning your ego.. focusing on blame which is so empty and pointless.) Fear from not knowing what's gonna happen.. fear of having no control.. it's instinct to protect yourself. Your ego will protect itself with all kinds of destructive momentary relief (empty sex, alcohol, saying mean things to people and putting others down, etc.) I wanna see things for what they truly are. Be brave enough and have the wisdom to walk away when you know it's wrong and not meant for you. Is it wrong of me to hope that he'll learn the true root of happiness? It's not money or sex with hundreds of beautiful women. Or telling yourself how confident and awesome you are. How many people know you. (From the years of isolation.. all he did is draw alone in his room. Now he is a somewhat well known video game artist and director at a major video game company in LA.) Living a full life is about living awake.. how much you open yourself to the world. How much you give and share. Vulnerability is true bravery and strength. Not cushioning your life with ease and agreeableness. But I realized.. who am I to force a lesson on anyone. Who am I to ""make"" someone wake up or realize things. Even if he were to have a.. ""shit.. now I see"" moment.. it takes consistent drive and desire.. difficult demanding willingness and dedication to be awake and mindful... it takes a long time to change your habits. I just wanted to know what you guys think. Thank you for reading. I may be hurt and heartbroken but I am SO thankful for this experience. I think these lessons have really opened my eyes and I'm coming out stronger and a lot wiser. You definitely can be too open... too giving.. and too forgiving. URL URL As the time passes I rawly see how completely lost I became. I lost myself and completely forgot who I am and what I'm worth. I became a deeply desperate and sad person. Everyday I yearned for the small crumbs of kindness and affection he would strategically give me.. especially in the form of verbal affirmation: telling me I'm the love of his life and he will never give up. But then check me by ogling and comment on women's bodies while we're out.. and keep me down on myself and insecure. He is truly manipulative with his words which in this world can take you far. It's rewarded. He was always very proud that he could get what he wanted.. especially with women. I also rawly see that how you treat and speak to others is a true reflection of how you treat and speak to yourself internally. If someone is so easily and freely able to be sooo mean and cruel to another living breathing FEELING human.. how is their internal dialogue with themselves and their self worth? He texted and emailed me a few weeks ago. He wrote: Text: It's been hard without you. I hope you're okay. Email: It's been hard without you. I hope you're okay. Sorry for how things went down. I couldn't respond. Hes just a boy moving through the world carrying his pain from his cold mother. And I am just a girl carrying forth my yearning for love from an absent father. I still care about him.. a lot. But I dont think its him. I take it as me being an insanely squishy caring person who will ALWAYS be more on the side of believing in change and people and good and happy endings. I will always be on the hopeless romantic optimistic side of the spectrum. I take this as a huge painful life lesson and I am taking one baby step at a time to remember who I am and what happiness looks and feels like in action. I am so thankful for so much in my life.. and the few but amazing people I DO have in my life.

622,vulnerability,offmychest,An unorthodox breakup letter,4,6mpdsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6mpdsz/an_unorthodox_breakup_letter/,2017-07-12 07:30:16,"First of all, Id like you to know that you should never **ever** think its okay to control your members with guilt. I cannot stand how much you threw around phrases like if more people would and we need some people to step up and you may not feel comfortable, but its a challenge for you to grow in. Excuse me, but since when were you in charge of my growth? Since when were you the dictator of my every move? Ill have you know that you even had me feeling guilty about possibly having to move for a job. A job! Why is it so utterly horrible for me to leave? I also dont particularly like how you tried to clothe your controlling ways in concern and a desire to press into community. Oh my word, if I had a dollar for every time the word community was thrown around. I do not know who first coined the idea of Christian community, but there is something wrong with the idea that a perfect community exists or is even remotely attainable in part. Dude, we are broken creatures. And I dont think you understand that the reason community was promoted was to help the broken, not to isolate into little church-islands. What the heck would you do if a homeless, crack-addicted man set foot into the church? I hope youd handle it well, but trust me when I say that we are supposed to actively seek to love those people. Why on earth should we isolate ourselves from those who are hurting and desperate? Why on earth should we stay safe? Jesus sure as crap didnt stay safe. You say that you care about your members, but I dont think its very caring to dump all these duties and rules and tasks on them. Isnt church supposed to be a place of restoration and care? Since when did it become a place of rigidity and judgment? I want you to know that I chose to stay as long as I did despite my misgivings. I want you to know that I *listened* to your teachings and requests. I submitted to you, stretched myself, and pressed into my own flawed places and repented. I was transparent with you. Why, then, werent you transparent with us? Why, then, were you not willing to change your own heart? I do not wish to stay in this make-believe world where being on your best behavior with little fake moments of vulnerability is better than being an absolute hot mess and not pretending. I do not wish to act like everything is fine. Know this: I am **choosing** to honor you on my way out. I am **choosing** not to shut you out completely. I am *choosing* to put up with your, frankly, obnoxious requests until the end. So don't you think for one minute that I am letting you have power over me. You will not control me. And dont you **dare** think that the way you treated me was praiseworthy. There was a lot of scuttling around, fear, and guilt that was pressed onto me. You valued me as a member because of what I could contribute, what I could do to improve things. You didnt value me because of who I was. In fact, I think who I actually am was terrifying to you. But Im not going to apologize for that. I am sick of being sorry for things I have no control of. So, this is my breakup letter to you. I do not think I will ever return to you. I hope you grow up in *truth* and *actual* maturity. But I wont be there for it. "
623,vulnerability,offmychest,"Dont read this, it's too long with limited payoff",2,6n08kl,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6n08kl/dont_read_this_its_too_long_with_limited_payoff/,2017-07-13 18:02:13,"Hmm, what should I write about? I'm a strange redhead now. A strange man dyed my hair for free. He's good at what he does, by the way, even though he's full of overblown bravado and talks a bit much about sexy topics to his hairdressees. So now my head is lit a tawny rose red-pink and orange, all dramatic and the like. I like it, it's all so very stylish, but I don't know if it suits me. It's attention-demanding and loud in the way that bright redheads tend to be, and as much as I like to overdramatize things on the inside, on the outside I like to keep cool and aloof, quiet and to myself, it feeds my ego just the right way. The red disrupts all the pretense to chill. It screams ""pay attention to me!"" if you know what I mean? In other words, it betrays a little too much. As usual, I'm writing all lofty, but I'm being super colloquial at the same time. It means that this is a letter. I didn't know that this was going to be a letter when I started, and to whom, but it got obvious in the first few lines. Even as it sickens me to be so tropic and love lorn, pent up and over blown, to the very last. (Isn't it obvious that this is a torrid love letter?) I say last because I feel that I'm falling out of love. As usual, I'm writing to you, that guy on my mind who just won't leave, the person whom I spend way too much mental energy on despite our dumb pedestrian circumstances. But you are leaving. Even if my mind still spasms on you occasionally. Why do I write letters to you that never mean to actually reach your eyes? It's the same reason why I've been so crazy about you in the first place. Or more like, I write letters to you because I'm crazy about you, and I'm crazy about you, because, well.. there are a slew of reasons, probably, but the one pertaining to my soapbox the most today is that when I'm near you, I approach this feeling of getting recognized, and recognizing you. In the way that we don't get recognized in our day to day, or not always. It's this superstition of being apprehended in what may be the way we wish to be understood or seen. Being aware of someone else, who is aware of you. Some scholarly guy in social psychology called it the Looking Glass after Alice in Wonderland, and in sociology I like to think of an analogous concept called subjecthood. Or is it subjectivity? Sorry, ive never been that precise with my terms. This is getting so so cerebral. Maybe way too cerebral, it's kinda out of control. Anyway, all this is to say... Being around you gave me a small thrill that I wanted more of. In part because of the way you made me feel, I held a great appreciation and admiration for you that I thought could be the basis of a long and self-sustaining relationship. But I'm falling out of love with you today because I no longer get that feeling when we interact. Every time we text, I only feel a glaring disconnect. Our sensibilities are different, how we want to approach conversation is different, and our jokes totally fly over the other person's head. I feel that texting has only made our differences visible, and at the same time painfully shrouded away whatever magical dynamic that we had in person despite our differences. I think part of the reason why that dynamic is missing is because the connection is closed off when we text. You're much more obtuse and hard to open up over text. It makes me wonder how much of your vulnerability with me in person was due to the fact that we were having sex? Or how much of that openness was nonverbal and depended on body language? Maybe it's me who's more obtuse and afraid, and mistaking your passive nature for closed-offness. But I doubt it because you've professed to me that you have an issue being open to the women in your life. Anyway, I'm losing trust (and I was low on trust to start with), and now, even when we last met in person and you tried to tell me I was special to you, I don't really believe any of it any more. I'm only seeing the you who isn't willing to open up to me over text. It's not the whole picture, I know, but it's dominating my vision. So, you know, I'm not feeling connected to you any more. I enjoy opening up to you in person, but I have trouble believing in the depth of your openness to me. Maybe the street goes both ways and you're feeling the same as I cut things off more and more over text. If I feel any throes of passion over you, it's my brain trying to clutch at what I used to experience around you and asking why I can't have it back. Leading back to this letter. This letter and all my other letters are the unfulfilled outlet of what I wish you understood about me, things I could say to you but you don't seem to venture an interest in over text. The things I never fully got to express in person, although I thought you might see it and understand it anyway.. because of that recognition I was talking about. Umm, more, and more, and more. I'd still be willing to give it a try with you, because I liked you so much, and I know we had some spark in person. I'm just losing my feelings for you and I'm worried there's no going back feelings-wise, even if we give it a try. Too much distrust poisons the well. We can only get to trying also if we meet again in person, before I do the trying, for me to explain what's going on, because you sure as hell ain't soliciting any info over text. What am I supposed to do, volunteer an answer to a question you aren't asking? Actually, knowing me, I won't be surprised if I end up taking matters into my own hands and deciding to do just that one day. Nobody reading this will get where I'm coming from, and I'm not sure if that's because my perspective is super skewed or if its because I'm not doing this scenario justice. Also, if anyone read all of this, I owe you some margaritas, because I know I write some crazy overcomplicated shit :) more disclaimers"

I finally reach 20 years of age and I wrap my 19th year on earth in a few hours. My 19th year was special -- not due to your conventional life changing experiences. I did not find someone that i love and loves me back. I did not graduate from university. I did not socialize as much as i really should have. I did not learn and improve myself as much as i would have liked. On the contrary, if I would tell you what happened during my 19th year, you would deem it a tragic year. Two weeks after i turned 19, i was rushed to the ER due to cardiac disease that almost claimed me if i have acted a few hours slower. I was diagnosed with myocarditis in the cardiac intensive care unit. I thought my life was coming to an end, prior to my official diagnosis by a few hours, the doctor thought i was showing symptoms for a heart attack. It felt weird, you would think that a person my age being told that they might be passing away in a few minutes to a few hours would phase them. I remember being calm in that moment. I was accepting of imminent death. I was only regretful of not living and experiencing everything i have dreamed of. Everyone around me was panicking, crying, shaking, and trying to comfort me. I was just not convinced that I wanted to spend the last hours of my life in a tragic state. If the cruel world really wanted to claim me, then I was not going to let it enjoy it. I ended up having a full ""physical"" recovery in two days and exiting the hospital. I wrapped physical in quotation marks because even though i was physically recovered, my mental conscious has received a blow. I ended up suffering post-traumatic stress for many months after due to the event. I suffered from an extremely stiff neck at all times. I suffered from extremely tight chests that forced me to take a few trips to the ER because i couldn't breathe. I became a hypochondriac and my body began playing tricks on me, deceiving me that i am still dying. I was forced to drop a class and retake it in the upcoming summer because it was worsening my stress and my conditions. Winter was approaching and it seemed like life was getting better. I thought i was reaching the end of the tunnel and light was finally penetrating my skin. I was then abruptly told that i was scheduled for tristate maxillary jaw surgery in march, with a recovery time of up to 3 weeks. I would like to clarify that i was aware that i have to undergo jaw surgery because i had an open bite; however, it was intended for the summer when i was out of university. I had to take the March surgery schedule since it was the only option. I had to drop two more classes in the winter and only take 3 courses as i will not be able to complete all 5 if i i had to undergo surgery and be out of school for 3 weeks. Around the same time in parallel, i started falling for this girl i met. She was really nice, great personality, and i think we bonded. She seemed like she enjoyed my company and i made her laugh. I used to a religious person and i always had the ideology that i will not date anyone until marriage. That changed last year when i started shifting the way i think and i no longer think that way. I felt like she was special, something about her made me feel emotions i never felt for any other girl prior to her. It just felt so right with her. I have never been 100% sure about anything but with her i was 100% sure i wanted to try and make her happy. I wanted to share my future with her. I wanted to dance, sing, laugh, cry, adventure, experience, and grow with her. I felt so strongly about her and i really had to try - for my sake at least. It did not work out how i wanted it to, not in the slightest. She started straying from me and told me she just wanted to be friends. You know, maybe it's because i am unexperienced i turned her off. Maybe it's because i wasn't attractive enough for her i turned her off. Maybe it's because of my religion i turned her off. I say maybe for all of them because even thought i showed all of my true emotions to her and appeared vulnerable to communicate trust, she would always conceal as much emotion as she can and not involve herself. She interpreted my vulnerability as a source of power rather than trust. I don't like that she did that and it really hurt me. Back to the jaw surgery. I had it and it went successful, which is great. However, the post surgery recovery was not as fun. I was, for a full 8 weeks, on a strict liquid diet. I was not allowed to use my jaw for 8 weeks. I had to drink all of my food. I lost about 17 pounds in the period and became a shell of my old person. I felt really down, i felt really weak. I was still doing university at the time and i had finals, i was also going through this hard situation with this girl, it all really took a huge toll on my mind. But, i made it. **I do not suffer from any post-trauma stress due to my myocarditis incident anymore.** **I finished my courses in time even though i had major surgery and was on a lengthy liquid diet.** **I survived me being rejected by the girl and i am glad to say that i barely think of her anymore, when i used to think of her several times a day only a few weeks ago.** **I can eat well with my new jaw now and i have since gained back all the weight i have lost.** **I received a 4-month software developer position from BlackBerry recently.** **I am making more friends, talking to more girls, and i am working on myself. I have returned to the gym for 3 weeks now and i am already seeing improvement that is boosting my self confidence.** Considering all the hardships life has thrown at me, i am truly proud of myself. I cannot wait what to see my 20th year on earth is holding for me. Thank you for everyone that loved, listened, and helped me in this past year. You and I transformed a possible hell-on-earth experience into a personality-shaping, growth experience. I feel much stronger and dedicated to comeback. I feel like i am becoming the person i really want to be. Thank you if you made it this far. &lt;3 "

I know I did it for an irrational reason and that I'll regret it one day. It's just that I've been abandoned by people so many times, and the possibility of going through the same thing with you scared the hell out of me. I knew it would have broken me if it had happened again so I took the easy way out and distanced myself from you. I thought I would feel much better now that I don't have to worry about you leaving but I honestly don't feel good at all. I wish I could just tell you the truth, that I miss you so much to the degree that my heart hurts. I miss it when you used to open your heart to me and tell me about your life. You were so beautiful in your vulnerability. So real, so honest and so beautifully human. I wish you knew how much you mean to me. I love you, sweetheart. I'm so sorry."
626,vulnerability,offmychest,I'm depressed and my boyfriend doesn't get it...,2,6o0zzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6o0zzt/im_depressed_and_my_boyfriend_doesnt_get_it/,2017-07-19 00:12:28,"Last week I came clean and decided to tell my 26-year-old boyfriend that I think I'm depressed and that I was going in to see a psychiatrist last Friday (July 14th) to get a firm diagnosis. He asked me why I'm depressed and seeking help...and I got frustrated but tried desperately not to show it. See, I feel he SHOULD understand why I'm depressed. He knows what I've been through the past 6 months...yet he had to ask? To clarify, I watched my 61-year-old dad die agonizingly slowly over the course of 12 hours on January 23rd of this year from esophageal cancer (as well as heard him cry out for his dead mother to help himand he pleaded for somebody to take him homeyou guys, I cried so hard that day...and my boyfriend wasn't there). Later that week, we buried my dad on my moms 51st birthday. Then in February, my boyfriend lost his paternal grandpa (one whom he was very close to; he was like a second dad to him). A few days after that, I was driving to his place and almost got into a deadly car accident. It shook me up and made me realize that not only are people around me easily capable of dyingbut so am I, and it freaked me out. Then in March, I lost my paternal grandpa. A couple weeks later, I started a temporary state job with the DNR that would last until May. Fast forward to May, I went on a 2-week vacation with my boyfriends family to Europe. When the plane landed back here, stateside, I turned the data back on on my phone only to find out my 9-year-old Yorkiepom had died 30-minutes prior of cancer and heart problems. 3 days later, I started a new job with the county. In June, I celebrated my first birthday (Im now 24) without my dad and I began having roommate problems again (the same chick was giving me problems back in November and Id thought we settled things). And in July, I went with to my boyfriends familys cabin to be there for him and his family when they buried his grandpa. The entire time I was there, it was a constant reminder of the 4th of July and how that was my dads favorite holiday of all. He loved to set up extravagant fireworks shows for the family, hold parties thatd last all night, and grill out food (like chicken and brats) for all to enjoy. And being up north camping was something my dad ALSO loved. And so the entire time I was there, I was moody. My mood literally resembled that of a rollercoaster. I was having troubles falling asleep due to nightmares (one of which, I dreamt that my mom had been diagnosed with cancerin another, I dreamt that my dad was still alive and we were STILL trying to research natural cures for himthat one turned weird though when I saw my aunt start drinking hummingbird nectar/juice/feed as a way to prove that it has healing qualities), and I would wake up nauseous and throw up minutes later, so maybe part of my mood swings was the fact that I hadnt been getting much sleep around that time. When the actual 4th of July came around, a day after wed buried my boyfriends grandpa, wed been at his familys cabin for 3 days. After I woke up, I was ecstatic because my mom had texted me, asking if I wanted to come home and eat some grilled food (like how dad would make it) with my sister and brother and their significant others. I was super excited, I was quick to ask my boyfriend if hed drive us there immediately. But he shot me down. He told me he wanted to stay at his familys cabin for the whole day yet; that he didnt plan on leaving this soon, especially since he hadnt gotten to shoot guns yetone of his favorite hobbies to do up at the cabinwhich he doesnt visit all that often. He told me the last time hed visited was something like 2-years ago. So I felt a bit dickish when I started throwing anger his way in the form of a cold shoulder and verbal aggression when hed poke and tickle me to get a reaction. I felt especially bad because this all happened in front of his entire family on his dads side. I felt like such a child. Im actually embarrassed to see them all again after the way I acted and how I treated their son/grandson/cousin/nephew with disdain. I was even more angered when I noticed we werent doing a goddamn thing the whole morning. We literally sat around in the kitchen/living room for hoursuntil 11am. Everyone was just talking about the same shit theyd been talking about all weekend (how my boyfriends dad wants to build a giant shed thats against city ordinance and his neighbor might fight him on it). I was so frustrated, it felt like my life was being wasted sitting around doing nothing when I could be home with my family for the first time all weekend. There was a point where I actually felt like my ears were being grated every time my boyfriends grandma would speak. HIS SWEET GRANDMA WAS PISSING ME OFF, YOU GUYS. That was when I began to wonder if agitation is a sign of depression. So I looked it up and saw it was, which prompted me to take a few quizzes online (via my phone) to find out if I am truly depressed. All the quizzes said Im exhibiting severe signs of depression. All of them. Every last one. So that was when I decided to text my mom my thoughts on all this. [Her reply, in case you all were curious: What are you, pregnant? Thanks for taking this seriously, Mom. In all seriousness though, she did when she tried being introspective of herself and her feelings. She discovered she is also depressed. As it turns out, so is my little brother. And so is my sister. My whole family is depressed. Isnt that just the greatest?] While I was texting with my mom, trying not to show how agitatedly bored I was (which I think I immensely failed at), my boyfriend was almost pleading his brother and dad to go out and shoot guns (apparently those two were on the fence about it and, had my boyfriend not begged, they probably wouldnt have gone out and shot guns at all). Once he got his way, we headed back to the bedroom to get ready to go. I, of course, was still pissed, and my boyfriend could tell because I wasnt responding to him. And so that prompted him to say this: I dont want to stay if its going to make you miserable. When he told me that, it made me feel even shittier because now he was putting his own happiness aside for my ownor maybe he was guilt-tripping me into pretending to be happy, I dont know. What I do know is that I suddenly felt selfish. So I told him, Its fine. You dont come up here all that often, and Id feel bad taking you away from your family. If you want to shoot guns and ride the pontoon one last time, then well do that. Then I slapped a smile on my face and kissed his forehead to get him to believe I was fine with it. And so we rode the family pontoon around the lake, and then from there we packed up to go shoot guns (something Id never done before). When we got to the homemade shooting range on their family hunting property, they placed a .22 rifle in my hands and taught me how to use it. In hindsight though, that probably wasnt the smartest thing to do with a depressed girl showing signs of agitation. I comforted myself though through the whole experience as I pictured my dad standing by my side, beaming with pride as I successfully shot down all 20 pop cans they had set up (I shot most of them down back to back). I got my boyfriend, his dad, and his brother to all laugh at how insane it was that I was a natural-born shot (none of them were, I guess). Once his dad called it quits, my boyfriend and I piled into the truck. He turned and asked me what I thought of the whole experience (greatly hoping I would say I loved it). I told him it was meh because Id never had any desire to shoot guns in my life (Id prefer to be more like my dad and shoot crossbow)and also because Im petty and still wanted to make him feel guilty for keeping me from my family. He looked hurt as his dad and brother hopped into the truck. And off we went, driving back to the cabin. We took a different route than what we did previously though. We went through a town called Spooner, one that my dad was visiting often within the last couple years, and we drove by a restaurant that he absolutely loved. The reminder of all of this hurt my heart, and I cried silently in the backseat. My boyfriend had no idea. That day was awful for mebut it was also an eye-opening and introspective experience. It helped me to realize my mental state as well as to diagnose why the hell I was acting out so aggressively to people around me when, never before in my life, Id ever done that. Im usually kindhearted and patient and willing to give to other people. But lately I feel selfish, like Im taking from everyone. The thing is, I realize I havent had a chance to cope with all of the losses and dramatic changes in my life. I havent had a chance to grieve. And so that lack of allowing myself to let it all out has manifested into a grief-driven depression that makes me easily agitated, frustrated, and jealous with those around meincluding my boyfriend. And so, my anger towards my boyfriend is ultimately what led to me seeking help. I want to control these negative feelings before they consume me and destroy my relationship with one of the only people in this world that still manages to make me somewhat happy. My psychiatrist believes that my emotions are human and my reasons for feeling them are justified. She also believes Im way too harsh on myself. Meanwhile, my mom says Im being selfish and that I need to stop acting this way with my boyfriend or else hell dump me. I mean, yeah, Im trying. But God, its just so hard; especially when I want him to understand what Im going throughyet it feels like he doesnt WANT to understand. Particularly since after I told him Im depressed, he went to further lengths to avoid me that weekend by getting his family to allow him to go on a short family road trip to the south of the state (they all brought his grandma to her class reunion). Upon his return Sunday night, he was super huggy and elated to tell me stories about how much fun he had with his family. This effectively made me jealous because prior to me telling him Im depressed, he was eager to make plans with me for the weekend. And now he comes back and tells me what a happy family he has? So not only did he ditch me at a moment of extreme vulnerability, but he also comes back and unintentionally brags about how much fun he had with his family. And yes, all of this after I told him my whole family is depressed. I was jealous of him before all of the losses started happening in my life. Im jealous of how hes moving up extremely quickly in his job (the other day, he was just offered the opportunity to get his SIGMA black belt [the first of his coworkers to get that opportunity], and today he is having a discussion with his boss on getting a raise), he still has his dad, he still has his dog, he still has his grandma (I lost both of mine when I was in elementary and middle school), he doesnt have roommate issues, he has friends to hang out with in the cities (all of my high school friends stuck around in my hometown, so now I feel double alone), and his family goes on global trips YEARLYmeanwhile my family is struggling to afford where we live. He also has zero college debt (after grad school, Ill have accumulated $72,000 of debt$12,000 of which will be paid off from assets given to me from my dad and grandpas deaths), and is good at everything (ice skating, rock climbing, rollerblading, bike riding, weight lifting, math, science, reading and understanding complex topics in books, water sports, drinking, socializing, travelling, f*** me hes even better at relaxing than I am). Its stressful dating someone so perfect. I always feel so inferior. And having gone through so many losses, I feel both broken AND inferior. I tell him that hes perfect and hell say the same thing back, but to methose are empty words. Maybe the next time he tells me Im perfect, Ill ask him what he thinks makes me perfect Maybe then Ill be able to tell if his words are just words or if he really means them. Thanks for letting me vent. It feels good to talk this out with myself. Makes me feel like Im less alone in my battle for normalcy in life. Signed, a depressed 24 year old grad student just trying to get by."

Like my constant suspicion of being ""be treated"" or the private and probably the worst things I've one being told by my girlfriend to her friends. It's kind of weird because I've never had a relationship where that's happened before, but I have an idea it seems from my high school days. During high-school, I saw some of my closest friends go through so many of the crushes with other girls and get rejected or crushed and have to deal with it. But to see them in that much pain made me kind of unconsciously decide I never wanted to be in that position. And so I do everything I can to make sure im not. I don't date someone unless I know they're into me for sure, I don't break up with someone because I fear that they'll end up being happier than me and I'll have made a huge mistake, and I always have this inner feeling to not trust a girlfriend because it's always going to end in a breakup and so I might as well make sure others don't find secrets out, or because it'll show my vulnerability and they'll exploit that. It's honestly gotten to a point where I just don't believe in love anymore, because it can't be real. Because people are always going to be assholes or wanting to get something to one up m or joke about me on. Or for a partner to use my own vulnerability to one up and mock me before leaving me. I really can't tell if love is meant to give you happiness anyway, considering it seems to be more about ""conquering odds"" and keeping communication as to keep it alive rather than to be happy."

Things that were so simple for others were extremely difficult for me, such as making friends, coping in stressful situations, relating to others. As a result, I had very few friends in childhood and was constantly bullied. I've also suffered with a great deal of mental health issues my entire life, including depression, anxiety and OCD. Things got a little better as an adult. I still had very few friends, but I graduated college at 22, found a good job in marketing not long after and my social skills have improved a lot. I'm 24 now and still have my issues, but for the most part I felt like I was making progress in life. However, I recently came across Aspergers Syndrome and realized that I fit almost every symptom. I know I should be relieved that I finally have an explanation for why I am the way I am, but I'm also devastated. I have a lot of pride in myself and my capabilities, and feel shame in being autistic, and like I'll never be able to live the life I want. I deeply apologize for saying this as I know it's probably offensive, and I know in my heart there is absolutely no shame in being on the spectrum nor would I ever judge somebody else who was , but I can't help but feel this way. It kills me to know that there is something broken in my brain, and while I may improve, I'll never be at a level that just comes naturally to others. I thought reading up on Aspergers and visiting forums would be good for me, but if anything they have made me feel worse. It seems like everybody on the forums is miserable and hopeless about life (I realize the irony as I'm writing this...) and that I'll be doomed to the same thing. This sub is more optimistic, but the Aspergers sub in particular is so gloomy and depressing. Part of me thinks, ""If none of these people have achieved the life they want, what makes me so special?"" I feel like having Aspergers may have robbed me of the life I crave, and I don't even know which parts of myself are ""me"" or just this disorder (my love of writing, many special interests, etc.). If I didn't have it, maybe I'd have been able to make friends and have a normal childhood, I wouldn't have all of the mental health issues that have destroyed me for 24 years, and I'd be more optimistic about my career. My future and career outlook are what scare me the most. I'm an introvert who for the most part likes being alone, but I worry I'll never be able to develop my social skills to the level I need to get my dream job. I know several people who have gone from very shy/awkward to outgoing, but if this disorder is just part of how my brain is wired, how much better will it get? I'm really sorry for this depressing, pity party of a post. I'm the problem. I'm somebody who never likes to show any vulnerability or emotions, so this shows just how bad of shape I'm in. I just want a normal life."
629,vulnerability,offmychest,I don't think you will ever realise just how much I hate you. Not that I think you care.,6,6i16yf,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6i16yf/i_dont_think_you_will_ever_realise_just_how_much/,2017-06-19 04:32:14,"I gave you 7 years of my life. Most of my 20s, wasted. Lost a bunch of my friends, my self esteem, my mental stability and trust in others because of you. All the years I stuck by you, I looked after your emotional and mental well being whilst also trying to look after my own well being without ANY support whatsoever. Even after you cheated on me early in your relationship, you came me, bawling your eyes out and told me it was the antidepressants, they do funny things to your decision making. You love me and you always will, will I forgive you? And I did. But when you asked me not to tell any of my remaining two friends, to keep it to myself because you didn't want them to hate you - I should have seen the warning signs then. All the time I spent worrying about you, worrying about US, doing everything I can to make sure you slowly got better from what I thought was depression, listened to you when you were upset, spent ages researching things, looking things up which would improve your life and our lives in the long run. And all for what? So that you could run off to the States with an online friend that *I* stupidly introduced you to because I knew you were lonely and had no friends either. Even in my own loneliness I was still trying to look after you and make sure you were OK. The MOMENT I broke down and made it clear to you that I need your help, that I need you to be there for me the way I've been there for you all these years; you ran away. You spent 24/7 talking to V, skyping with her, reading her messages and sex chat between her and the guy she was pursuing, including seeing pictures of her vag. I told you I wasn't comfortable with that, and nothing changed. You told me I needed to trust you. Then you started raving on about her, telling me how you've found your soul sister, how you are both one soul split in half. Bearing in mind I was in the middle of an emotional break down and only just about keeping it together enough to still go to work; hearing you talk like this about someone else when I'm feeling vulnerable, insecure and fragile damn near killed me. It was as if you were sticking a hundred knives in the open wound that was my soul. I just.... I couldn't understand why instead of caring for me, looking after me, helping to hold me together, you were instead spending all your time and attention talking to some woman in the States 24/7, and then TALKING to me like this! And you! You twisted it around to make it sound like I was some stupid, insecure woman who needed to get a grip. Like I was jealous of you having a friend, telling me that I'm trying to control you, that I'm putting restrictions on you, that I've really changed recently and you're sick of me being so insecure, that you can't cope with my negativity, V is a happy, cheerful person who's got SUCH a positive vibe. Maybe if I was more positive you wouldn't be talking to her so much. And I'm.... Flabbergasted. I just don't understand what's going on. I needed your help. Of course I'm insecure, I'm having an emotional breakdown and I have NO friends to talk to, no close family, no one except for you who's obsessed with another woman, and you're telling me I'm being too negative? I try and try to make you understand, but you say that I could never understand the kind of kinship you have with V. And then one day, after one of your night time walks in the park which is a new habit you've picked up (and I know it's just an excuse to Skype with V). You tell me that you told V you had feelings for her, and she turned you down. Of course by this time, V had introduced you to our mutual friend, R. And with V not reciprocating your feelings, you turn to R. Lovely R, who is a caring person like me. Who you told me one of the reasons you love her is that she's so motherly. And R falls for you hook line and sinker, like I once did. Did you tell her that she's your soul mate? That you'd be there for her till the day you died? That you can't wait to grow old with her, that she doesn't need to worry, you'll always look after her even if she has Alzheimer's and doesn't remember you. That you were both meant to be together, that all you both need is each other. Did you tell her all the same romantic Bullshit you once told me? And then three months later, after going to the States on ""a camping trip"", you tell me that not only have you both been dating since the day we took a break (an exclusive break, where we BOTH said we would stay single and work on US, on starting again and repairing our relationship from the bottom up, and building trust up again), but after 3 months of dating you're now married. It turns out you told R that we had broken up. That explains the flowers she randomly sent me! You completely failed to mention to her that you told me you wanted to stay single and work on us. You promised me that nothing would happen between you both and that this would be a perfect way to prove to me that I could trust your word. And instead you came back married. It also turns out that the relationship counselling we were both attending? You told her that it was counselling for ME, you were just along for support. Lies. You're full of nothing but lies. You lied to me. You've been lying to R. No doubt, you've been lying to yourself. Convincing yourself that your lies are truth. I was your rock for 7 years, and the moment I crumble and need you to be *my* rock, you run away. Find someone else. Less than a month later since your return, you act strange one day. Tell me that this is the last time you'll be doing this thing for me. I catch you watching me as I'm doing stuff, with a weird look on your face. Before bed, you ask me for a hug goodnight. A hug? Why? But I stiffly oblige. Next morning, you say goodbye to me on your way to work. It isn't until 11pm that night, when your wife messages me to tell me that she's had a phone call from you and you're at the airport in the States, that I realise why you were acting so strange the night before. Why neither of us had heard from you all day. I haven't seen you since. You took, what, a small suitcase with you? Your room is still full of your stuff. You told me you got an open ticket and you had full intention to come back, but seeing as you got stopped at immigration and interrogated for two hours, you're terrified if you return to the UK you won't be allowed back. So you and your wife have decided it's best you stay over there and apply for your green card from the States. But I know better. I know you. R has known you less than a year, I've lived with you for 7 years. I've heard all your lies. I know how you think and how you work. You were NEVER planning on coming back. Never. You've always said you're a minimalist, that you'd be happy to sell everything in your room that doesn't fit in a rucksack or sports bag. You couldn't bear to be in the UK and get your green card from over here, so you left without a word. You promised me that you would stay and help me find a new place to move to, I mean, I can't afford to live at our place on my own! But you left anyway. And you used the last of your savings to get this ticket. You said you were help at immigration for two hours because they thought you were a drug mule. The experience left you deeply traumatised apparently, and you didn't even turn your phone on for two days. I'm not sure if you made this up or if it did actually happen. But I'm guessing it worked wonders to help you to convince R that you're a sensitive soul that needs to be looked after, and that it's best if you stay in the States. I hate you. I feel emotionally and mentally drained. I have no RL friends close by, nobody to talk to except that relationship therapist who kept me on. I have no one to hang out with and distract me at weekends. No one to give me a hug and tell me I'll find someone else, someone who actually cares about me. No shoulders to cry on. I spent so much of my time worrying about you and trying to help you, that I barely had energy to Socialise with other people and try and make friends. I'm not good trying to make friends at big meet ups, but whenever I asked you to come along for support you'd start an argument. ""Why do you need friends for anyway? Why aren't I enough for you? I thought it was supposed to be just US two against the world. Nobody else. We're supposed to be enough for each other. I'm hurt that you feel you NEED to have friends, that I'm not enough for you."" What the actual fuck was wrong with me? Why did I stay with you for so long? I know why. I'm stubborn and I was determined to make this work. I thought that all the horrible things you'd sometimes say was just a sign of your depression, and if I only helped you work through that, we'd turn out OK in the end. I realise now that my stubbornness blinded me. I hate you. But I also hate myself for being so stupid. This horrible, isolated place I'm in now is partially my own fault, I know. But I'll forgive myself, eventually. I will never forgive you for those stolen years full of lies. You're a horrible, evil person who wears a mask of vulnerability and sensitivity to convince people that you're a sensitive loving soul who needs care and attention. All these years when you convinced me I was emotionally shallow and less sensitive than you. I've realised now I feel FAR more deeply than you ever will, and my feelings are true. But you don't care, do you? You're in the sunny States, enjoying a life of luxury while your green card and SSN is processed. Your wife will realise one day what a big mistake she's made. She's a lovely, caring person who has been through so much herself. I hope when that day comes, she's not as isolated as I am and has far more support around her than I do right now. I hope I never make the same mistake again. But right now, I don't know how to get through this on my own. "
630,vulnerability,offmychest,dating rant.,20,67yoll,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/67yoll/dating_rant/,2017-04-28 07:21:55,"I'm doing recently well with life; of that I can't complain. I'm(M) in my 30s, worked really hard to establish myself in my 20s career wise so in that aspect I feel it paid off. But I feel like I sacrificed a lot of my social youth to achieve this. Now that I'm in a stable place in my life and going back out into the world again I'm finding it an alien place with regards to dating and relationships. So much has changed; it feels like honesty is no longer the best policy. Out in the world it's just people maneuvering in the dark - afraid to be alone and afraid to take a chance. Is it really that bad? Is fear so strong right now among single people that we all are so resistant to any form of vulnerability? It probably is just me. I've wondered quite frequently - am I just this fossil from another time? So I'm torn between two thoughts; do I want to adapt what feels like the manipulative dance of the modern time or just be true to myself? The sad truth is; I don't want to care anymore. I've gone through so many cycles of not caring to meeting someone who I feel I want to take a chance on that the up is not worth it anymore. And that fact is the saddest thing of all. "
631,vulnerability,offmychest,My reflection on my ex-girlfriend,3,69g1l0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/69g1l0/my_reflection_on_my_exgirlfriend/,2017-05-06 03:19:55,"I thought Callie was one of the most genuine, altruistic, and sympathetic people I had met in my short life. Her history with an abusive ex-boyfriend (or ex-hookup, at this point I am not really sure what to call him) reflected a level of vulnerability and a sense of realness to methat she had been through something traumatic and emerged as a seemingly more wholesome personthat was really valuable to me, despite what she had to go through. I trusted her with my personal problems and confided in her, especially concerning problems with my dad. When she broke up with me, she said that she wanted to feel more connected and that she didnt anticipate wanting a serious relationship, but now that she did, what I offered just wasnt enough. Now that she is texting the guy who supposedly raped her last year again, her reasons for splitting with me seem more like excuses to see him again. Or maybe he wasnt that bad for her after all, and she was, on some level, lying to me about him. I dont really know, and this gap in information is actually killing me, but to pry into that situation now for my own closure would be seen as selfish and unnecessary, so I have to either forget about this situation and make no attempt to extract meaning from it, or take my usual self-defeatist, postmodern stance on things and say that the meaning in this is that there is no meaning at all. Either way, I am now slightly more skeptical about people I let into my life than before, which I dont want to be, but I guess thats life. We dont get to choose the people we become or the experiences we go through, as much as wed like to think that we have control. I definitely lost control of this situation. The only thing I do have control over is how I extract meaning from it, and I guess this reflection is my attempt to come to the most valid conclusion. Callie was also oppressively optimistic. I am very frequently hit with waves of melancholy for no particular reason, and in my own depraved way, I relish them. To me, happiness is, and perhaps should be, only part of the human experience; sadness is ever-present and necessary sometimes. But not to Callie, and she confessed on multiple occasions to feeling the urge to immediately rid herself of situations and people that make her sad to pursue more happy ones. The first time I heard that, I thought to myself, Wow, that is a mature way to approach things, and I should try to emulate her behavior in my own actions, because I frequently find myself sad when I would rather be happy. I thought that was so proactive of her, and I judged my own approach to sadness as an immature one simply because it appeared to be lazy relative to hers; just like anything else in life, if you want something, you go get it, right? Is that as obvious as it sounds? No. It turns out, that approach to things led to the demise of our relationship. She had to give me up to be happy in the present, and keeping me around just wasnt worth any sadness that I caused. Maybe I shouldnt be with someone who jumps to such hasty conclusions. Part of the reason I think Callie started to become so discontent with our relationship was that I spent a lot of my time in crew practice. It seemed as though I always had practice, and any time that I didnt spend in practice, I spent studying. So I resolved to quit the crew team next year to spend more time with her. And then she broke up with me, and screwed up my plans to make her more happy. Maybe I didnt factor in the fact that spending time with me did not make her happy after all. Or maybe, more accurately, that having the ghost of me in her life in the present did not make her happy and that she was too impatient to wait for me to materialize my ghost by changing my schedule around. The fact that she was so ready to give up a six month relationship with me because of that makes me really upset. Maybe I am just a flat-out shitty boyfriend who is not worth sticking around for. Maybe my predilection toward melancholy moods is simply irreconcilable with anyones well-being in a relationship, and I should try to forget about that part of my personality in the future. Maybe I should just try to avoid people who have abusive relationship baggage because they end up stomping on your feelings when they get back with their abusive exes after you invest yourself in them just enough so they stop valuing you. Maybe I should realize that I am blowing this out of proportion just because this was my first real relationship. The fact that I have to say maybe about all of this is really frustrating, and I guess the only way it can be. I hope someone else down the road gives me a reason to not hate myself and women so much. Because this relationship, after everything, has just made me more into the calloused, melancholy person I am, despite having every indication of changing me for the better when it started. And for that reason, Callie, you are no longer genuine, sympathetic, or altruistic. Youre just a normal person: self-interested and, in the long run, only cares about her own happiness. I guess that was my fault for not seeing you for your true self while I still knew you. But despite all of this, I enjoyed having you in my life. It has been really difficult letting you go, after making so many plans in my head about what we would be doing together this summer. It was nice getting to know someone on an intimate level. I will make my best effort to remember the good memories we had together and to erase the bad ones. Even though I dont like you now, I can still remember when I looked at you with all the admiration and love in the world. Ill try not to forget that."
632,vulnerability,offmychest,My feelings weren't taken seriously as a child and now I have emotional problems.,8,6bke56,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6bke56/my_feelings_werent_taken_seriously_as_a_child_and/,2017-05-17 07:30:15,"Every once in a while something trifling happens in my life that throws me back to my childhood experiences and makes me realize why I function the way I do now, as an adult. I've always had a hard time expressing feelings, being affectionate, gentle, or showing any vulnerability in general. Which is partly why I struggled so much with the romantic aspect of my life. I cannot bring myself to open up. As a child, my feelings were not taken seriously. Never really considered, or thought of as valid. I was not supposed to emote or get upset. Even now, it seems like I am not supposed to show any human flaws or oscilations in my mood: I am not allowed to have bad days. Sometimes I feel like I'm being viewed as in-house customer service. Ready, willing, effective, and smiling whenever my help may be needed. Maybe that is why I come across so mellow and unphased. Even with things I should be excited or euphoric about, I can only be happy with some reservations. Never not consider what could go wrong, the negative aspects, and faulty points. I was always regarded as someone who was expected to function at an optimal level, deliver optimal results, and have no weaknesses. If I'm visibly hurt, I'm just being silly. If I'm in love I'm immature. If I'm heartbroken, I should put myself together and be rational. If I fail, it's because I didn't try hard enough. If I'm conspicuously less than proper, I'm doing it on purpose to upset others. I took offence from a nasty comment? Well, I should learn to recognize a joke. I'm not really even a person. Just an amalgamation of bragging points, the ultimate product of good family genes, the dentless shiny logo on the facade. It's like I'm a fucking mascot they produced to make use of and show off. Better be spotless because judgement will soon befall me. Even today I seem to be a two-dimensional entity with no real character. Like my soul is about to cave in on itself. I don't express my fashion sense, I don't wear any accessories, no make up, nothing extra that does not serve a purpose. That is something for which I could have faced endless ascerbic remarks and teases as a child. That is how I saw it then, and it stuck with me. Though it may come across as if that is the absolute description, it is not. My family has been lovely and generous towards me, I have many nice things to say about them as well. But they made mistakes and they continue to make them. They sting and continue to affect me. Of course there are nuances, and other sides to the story, but this is the one I wanted to get off my chest today."
633,vulnerability,offmychest,I wish I never had sex with you,4,6byrg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6byrg9/i_wish_i_never_had_sex_with_you/,2017-05-19 06:08:45,"You were my first and it was amazing, words couldn't describe the feeling of love, intamacy, vulnerability that sex can bring. You were so patient with me too, you took the time with me until I feel like I was really ready with you, until I felt secure enough with you and myself, until I had all my walls down and finally had given you everything I had. The times we did were amazing and now when I think about it, it hurts me so much. I can't stop imagining you doing it with someone else how much better they must feel than me, how much more you're enjoying them than me.....I can't stop thinking about all of that. Anytime I hear about sex or something sexual, I can't stop but think about us doing it, you craved for me at one point and then it went away and now all of it is gone. When we first met, you were ready to get into it. But I wanted to wait, to get to know you more, love you more than just that way. I wanted to know I was making the right decision. Yeah, sex isn't that big of deal after doing it for the first time, but it's such a big deal when it deals with someone you undyingly love. I'm sure you know that and I know you felt the same way as I did. You taught me, took the time to show me to love someone like that. In a way, awesome. I got to have sex in my life, something I always wanted to do.....but now I don't know if I can do it with anyone else. I'll feel too nervous that they won't be like you, so understanding and loving about it. That's why I say I'll never find anyone like you. It fucking kills me inside..... that's why I wish I never had sex with you."

I feel glanced over. I feel like all is seen is this shell. This protective cocoon, a shiny carapace of smiles. Armor of love and support. I am the one unaffected. God fucking dammit. I cant let anyone see the hurt and pain. I cant let anyone know that I ache, that I feel. All that is seen is my smile, is my reliability. Kait is steady. Kait is consistent. Kait is constant. Kait is strong. Kait is a blast. Kait is always ready to do anything. She doesnt need reassurance. She doesnt need to feel valued. Because shes got it. She is handling it. She can do anything. Because anytime I express insecurity or need it has been rejected. So I pull up the shell again. I dont let anyone see that I need validation because I have been invalidated. I cant reach out because that hand has been left empty. All people see when they see me is strength and consistency and support. The oldest child, oldest daughter. The soldier. The leader. The fixer. They dont see the tears when I turn my head. All they want to see is this fucking paragon. So all the vulnerability is locked away. Im the only one who sees it. The only one who wants to. Why is this so hard? Its hard because I know I can be discarded when Im no longer of use. Does Kait look sad? Does she sound upset? Dont worry about it. She can handle it. Glance over. If I say Look at me. They leave. Or if I falter. If I am any less myself for a moment, then I am met with hostility or disgust. Why arent you doing this? Whats your problem? Why arent you giving more? It doesnt matter that I feel depleted, I still need to give. When did I stop feeling valuable? When did I stop feeling capable? When did I stop feeling loved? Capable is easy. I stopped feeling capable when my dad died. Before then. after I got hurt, after I broke bones and just duct taped those fuckers, after I ran and rucked and marched on six broken metatarsals, I felt like a god. I could do anything. Anything was possible as long as you fought for it, worked for it, wanted it. My dad died. It didnt matter how hard he fought cancer, how much he wanted to live, the cancer won. He died. And with it so did my belief that I was capable. When did I stop feeling valuable or loved? I dont know. Maybe when my fianc left. Maybe when ex gaslighted and manipulated me. Maybe when Sam treated me like I was disposable. Maybe when I realized that when I needed to rely on someone, no one was there. I had been shot at, pistol whipped, tied up and left. Yet still. Kait, fix this. Kait, I need this. Kait, I need support. Kait, be there for me. Everyone relied on me, but I dont have anyone to rely on. No one I trust. But its really fucked me up. Because I am feeling so raw and unloved right now. So insecure and not valuable. So hurt. And my INTJ brain has it all lined up and rationalized, and I intellectually know where I am, but I cant get my heart to catch up. And I am afraid to ask for validation or reassurance. I am afraid to reach out to someone who I value. I am afraid to ask for it to be returned. Im afraid that I am only good to people when Im not inconvenient, when I dont need anything, when all they can see is my shell. Lets do a wee bit more examination here. Okay. Dad told me to be like Ender. Count doubles. Be strong, like Ender. (What the fuck was he thinking? Thats a horrible idea. Ender broke because he did not have anyone, could not let anyone in.) AA (fuck AA) told me that I couldnt control anything outside of myself. What other people do or say is their business. If Im hurt, what is my part in it? (What the fuck? Thats a horrible lesson to teach to a 15 year old kid. No internalize everything. Now everything can be manipulated to be my fault in some way. Someone hurts me? Well, its my problem and not theirs.) The Army. I will always place the mission first. I will never accept defeat. I will never quit. Duty. Honor. Duty. Sacrifice. Anything less is failure. Anything less makes me a bad soldier. I will never consider myself, I will always put everything before me. Sacrifice without hesitation. I am second to the mission. Anything that jeopardizes the mission is failure. Weakness is failure. Vulnerability is weakness. Suck it up, drive on. Okay. Sum up. Point one: Everything in my life has told me to keep it in. My Dad, AA (fuck AA), the Army (semi-fuck the Army), has taught me that I am second. Whatever I am feeling has to be kept in because it is less important than whatever else is outside of me: other people, the mission, doing what needs to be done. My thoughts and feelings are irrelevant. Point two: I do not feel as capable as I once did; my father died and shattered my world view. My fianc left me because I wasnt fun because I worked two jobs and went to school so she did not have to work while she was in school. I gave everything I could to that relationship, but it wasnt enough. I felt taken for granted and only worth what I could give. My ex made me question the validity of my emotions with her abuse. Sam only wanted me around as a substitute girlfriend when it was convenient; I was disposable. I was shot at and violently assaulted and no one was there to help me. My family needed me to do shit for them. My friends were busy. My ex was selfish. I was alone. I felt like I had no one I could rely on. Point three: As a culmination of points one and two, I am now reluctant to reach out to anyone for help, to even admit I need help. I have someone I really, really like. Someone I have fallen head over heels for, someone who is so lovely and genuine and compassionate and kind, someone I am so compatible with. But I am absolutely terrified of opening up. I am terrified of being inconvenient. I am terrified of no longer being of use. I am terrified that I am only valuable when I am easy. I am terrified of being rejected. Point four: My head knows they care about me. My intellectual brain says: they are a good person, they are lovely, they are different. I have held them and been there for them while they have grieved and mourned. They have actively sought opportunities to help me be vulnerable with them. They accepted the broken soldier parts of me. (Maybe I am okay with that because who wouldnt be a bit broken after what I have seen and experienced? Is that part of my feeling more valuable? Is that more valid than the feelings I have when I am simply broken Kait?) I am just having a hard time getting my heart to catch up with my mind. Conclusion: I want more with this person. I want someone I can rely on. But if I do not communicate, then I will never know if I can rely on them. "

I wrote a letter to someone and I'm not sure if I should give it to them. It's long, so I appreciate if you actually read it all. I needed to put it out in the world somewhere. That's all, I guess. Hey, you. I was constantly over the moon when we were together. Of course some of this was the newness of the relationship; those honeymoon hormones are hard to beat. You said it well though: being with you feels peaceful. I honestly felt like I could share anything with you, from minutiae about my day to day life to horrible things I had done and had been done to me. You always cared and you knew the right things to say. I felt so deeply connected with you in a way I havent experienced with anyone, whether they were an acquaintance, a friend, or a romantic partner. In some ways youre a lot like my first love, there are similarities in a lot of the things that made me fall in love with both of you: your empathy, your genuinely, deeply altruistic natures, your ability to connect with just about anybody, your love for my dog. However, the ways in which you differ from him are a lot of the ways that I wished he could be: truly investing yourself in things that I care about because they matter to me, always supporting me and what I wanted right up to and beyond the silly idea of shaving my head, sharing some interests, tastes, hobbies, and life approaches (mostly keeping it together on the surface but sometimes shrieking inside), having also struggled with some of the same or similar things that I have. You possess all of his best traits, and you do it even better because you have so many fucking amazing features that are all your own. Youll probably find this hard to believe, but this coming bit has nothing to do with my feelings for you. Here we go: there arent words in the English language to accurately portray how much I respect and value you as a person. Frankly, the world is an infinitely better place with you as a part of the global community. That said, youre human and fallible and like all of us, prone to making mistakes. I dont want you to think that I have you up on some pedestal made of my own naivet where you can do no wrong. Theres no pressure coming from me for you to do good; I know youll do good. You cant not, its who you are. You may fuck up sometimes, but Ive seen you agonize over stuff when you havent even done anything wrong, and your attention to how youre affecting other people with your decisions is one of the things that make me feel unshakably confident in the fact that youre a true good person. Like the TED talk on vulnerability, Ive always seen it as something that may not be comfortable, but is necessary. Im not afraid of being vulnerable and opening myself to others, but with you it felt truly different; I wanted you to know everything about me, even the ugly shit, and I wanted to know every last detail about you. I wasnt lying when I said I was grateful for every experience you had had that led you to me the way you were. Looking back, its sad that I thought that, because I think I know now youre still missing some experiences that maybe could have kept you with me. I feel like I was more crushed by things ending between us than I was by my last breakup. I was definitely hurt by that too, but since I think I knew deep down from very early on that my last ex and I were not truly compatible long term, it was easier to accept. You were the first person in many years I could see a real future with. I showed you part of that stupid journal entry and maybe that spooked you on some level neither of us realized at the time, I dont know. When I didnt hear from you when you came back from traveling, it hurt, but I figured maybe you had had some time to think while we had no contact and decided you needed low or no contact with me. I didnt want to be vulnerable or pathetic, but I agonized and stressed over the lack of response I received to my benign text asking how your trip was. My overthinking kicked into hyper drive and I started considering all the possible scenarios that could be playing out. I probably should have just called. I know all of this is stupid. Why is this idiot girl having a mental breakdown over two unanswered text messages? I think what bothered me so much about it was that before (and after, honestly) things had ended between us, despite being somewhat notorious for being hard to get a hold of, youd always responded to me. At the very outside, it would maybe take a few hours, but you did always get back to me. My mind went bananas trying to think of what this sudden silence meant, and I know I should have known that the correct answer is usually the simplest one (you were busy), but I couldnt stop thinking that you had met someone, that you were really suffering and didnt want to reach out to anyone for fear of burdening them with your problems, that you were trying to make me angry at you so it would be easier for me to move on, or, my selfish fear, that you just didnt want to talk to me because you didnt give a shit anymore. I was so worried. It was on my mind constantly. Maybe that means Im weak; its true that I have a really hard time accepting things and moving on. Im not the person you reach out to anymore; I understand why, but that doesnt dull the ache of knowing that fact. One thing that keeps popping into my head is the question why? Why would you get into anything at all with me if you knew you werent ready then? Or did you even know that you werent ready? Or was it a trial run in hopes that you were, or could make yourself be ready? Im not angry or upset, and Im not blaming you; hell, I probably pushed things faster than you did. Im a clingy person, and I love being in a relationship and having someone to share my life with. But the fact is that you kissed me at midnight on New Years. You laid between my legs and told me you thought you were falling in love with me. Why would you do those things and then leave? Thats a rhetorical question; youve explained your reasoning in an articulate and rational way. I respect your decision, although I wish to god or the devil you hadnt made it. Im not writing you this letter in the hopes that youll suddenly have a change of heart and want to be with me. Frankly, Im not sure if Ill even give you the letter, and if I do, Im not sure if youll read it. I think that you would, but who knows. You truly dont owe me a thing. To be completely honest, I dont think I could be with you right now even if you lost your mind or something and showed up on my doorstep professing undying love. Its not water under the bridge yet; the bridge has been hit with a flash flood and the river is wide and fast-running, rapids almost, impossible to ford, and its named Resentment and Distrust Creek. I feel like Id be constantly walking on eggshells, trying not to do anything that might get me blindsided with being left alone again. Given time and distance, I think that we could try again. When both of us have had time to heal and grow, things could be different. I feel like you may not like me saying that, because even reading it myself it sounds pathetic, like Im painting myself as some war widow sitting in the window waiting for her MIA husband to return. Im not going to wait for you. Im going to open my heart to the world again. But god knows, if our paths never cross again, I think you will be my one who got away. Youre different from anyone Ive ever met. I honestly dont even know why Im writing this. Its cathartic, I guess. All these thoughts have been constantly bouncing around in my head and I want to let them out and get them away from me. Most of all, I wish you had felt you could talk to me. Ive told you before and Ill tell you again: if you ever need anything, Im absolutely here for you as a friend. This may be not my place to say, but I think with all the listening and solving you do for others, you should have more people who are listening to you. I had hoped you would have known I would be completely understanding of forgetting to send a text if you had just reached out afterwards to tell me life was hectic. It really sucked to have to essentially grab you when we happened to be in the same place at the same time to get you to speak to me at all. When I first saw you there and we said ""hey"" to one another and left it at that, I completely panicked. As soon as I finished my cigarette, I ran back inside and into the ladies' bathroom. I was drunk and freaking out, on the edge of having my panic attacks resurface if I'm honest, and I burst into tears and slid down the wall to be as small as possible without touching the nasty night club bathroom floor. You couldn't even shoot me a text back that would take you all of 30 seconds but you were out getting wasted with your brother and brother's girlfriend. I guess I just dont understand. Im really sorry for the name calling and lack of understanding I displayed that night. Thats not usually my style, but I was drunk and really hurting. I get that you didn't want to ruin my night out with friends, but to be honest, my last couple weeks had already been pretty bleak. I wish you had approached me first. I wish you had given me a hug. I'm sorry for everything. I hope your life is the best it can possibly be. All I want for you is to find peace. I wish it could have been with me holding your hand."

Canned jokes retold again and again. Clothes and images you hide behind on the regular. Thoughts that you read in books or you just quote someone wiser than you. So much schtick I can't keep up. I liked you despite all that, not because of it. You think you're so honest but you can't even come clean with yourself. I fell for the person you became when you were still and quiet. The person I fell for was the one with the spontaneous laugh not the boisterous one that rides on the surface. The person you were in those moments before you cared what everyone thinks and made it more important than the person beside you, and let their opinions and your image trump even your own damned thoughts. I thought you had some kind of mettle, a person committed to deep values and acting to live them out. Sure, you have ideals, but you have no idea what to do with them when it comes to taking action with your own hands. You can't even acknowledge people when they speak. You can't acknowledge truth when you hear it. There are so many layers of bullshit residing in you that just deflect things that are too hard, deep or real. The strongest fantasies I have about you aren't relationshippy or sexual. They're not about apologies or letting go. I fantasize about you finally getting it within yourself, something clicking so that you have that a-ha moment and finally get woken up or shaken alive. If you did, you might actually come around and say: ""I treated you poorly. I discarded the one person who called me on my bullshit, came to me with vulnerability and honesty, saw me for who I was and wanted more of that."" It's not the apology I want. It's the sincerity of you, in any form or context, sitting across from me, being as real as you can and were made to be."

My friends have been in love and at the heigh of their love they were on top of the world, but then when the love came crashing down so did they. My parents at one point loved each other very much, but now I have to avoid mentioning one of them around the other because of how much they hate each other. I'm turning 18 in 4 months and the realization that I'm becoming an adult has also made me realize how much certain aspects of adult life scare me. I've never been in love, even though a guy once told me was in love with me, but I know I can't avoid love forever and that terrifies me. When I'm older, I want to get married, but I'm terrified of the possibility of it ending in a divorce as bad as my parents'. I'm also scared of the moments before marriage, all the opening-up and vulnerability I'll have to go through and the inevitable heartbreak when I get rejected. My logical side avoids developing even the smallest romantic feelings, but my emotional side still tends to get the best of me. For example, there was a guy I was talking to for a while, but now I can see him losing interest in me while simultaneously gaining interest in another girl, and it hurts. While I was chatting with him I kept telling myself and others ""Oh, we're just being friends"", but internally I had a sliver of hope we would be more than that... As stupid as it sounds I'm trying to account for my slightly-hurt feelings by saying its just pms, but no matter what it is, I hate how I keep falling into the trap of romance when im so scared of it. To sum up: I'm scared of the vulnerability and lack of control in love, but the walls I put up are very weak, leading to an internal strife that I hate and don't know how to channel in a healthy way.

I told him that millions of women marched for women's rights yesterday, I was not going to let a man intimidate me and to go to hell. He then proceeded to call me ugly anyways and be a huge baby, spamming my Facebook photos with awful comments. Men, it is not okay to use a woman's vulnerability of her body against her! I happen to be very proud of my body and wouldn't have been too embarrassed if the picture was posted but yet my family does not need to see that! It wasn't a sexual picture, it was a picture of my bush that I had recently dyed pink to match the colour of my hair. If a woman trusts you with her body, it is sacred. Do not hold it against her...It is manipulation and harassment. Also guys why is it that when we turn you down, you tell us we're ugly? A minute ago you wanted to face dive into my honey pot, now I'm gross? What makes me so upset is how often sexual manipulation has happened in my life, for the longest time I feel I was almost obligated to sleep with someone because I was leading them on but like Ashley Judd said ""I am sick of zipping up my smile so you don't think I want to unzip your pants"" but that goes both ways, guys...No means no...And to me if you manipulated yourself into getting a yes...It was still a no. Have some respect for us. See every woman as if it were your mother or daughter. I will no longer sit back, I will no longer lay there while a man fucks me because It was easier then saying no, I will no longer be blackmailed, I will no longer be quiet, I will no longer pretend it's normal. I will stand up for my right to not have sex with someone for no reason at all, I will stand and show my stretch marks and perfect imperfections, I will stand for my right to wear low cuts shirts and short shorts and not fear rape or harassment. I will stand beside a man as an equal. I respect you, you respect me and unite in equality. Please stop forcing women."
640,vulnerability,offmychest,Was only with her for one night about a year ago but want to thank her,29,5ttdgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5ttdgv/was_only_with_her_for_one_night_about_a_year_ago/,2017-02-14 02:16:11,"Only a new member, never posted in this particular Subreddit (couldn't decide where else to put this), but I'd just like to get this out there (might be quite long, and rambling). OK, so about a year ago I lost my virginity. It was early evening, twilight, one of those dirty drizzly days when everyone is drunk/hungover all the time, just waiting to see the sun again (anyone from a city/large town in Northern England will get what I mean). About 5-6 hours before I had taken a large amount of Codeine (was/still am addicted to it). In fact I took so much that I passed out in a half-empty student bar, only woke up when I felt something on my face, and realised I had a serious nosebleed (weird cause I never get them). I cleaned myself up, still relatively high, but coming down. I walked around the city centre for a bit, looking at all the architecture, and then a bit of people-watching, when I realised I was sobering up, so I went into a pub and bought a pint of blackcurrant cider. Anyway, I planned to get drunk alone, listening to Muse through my earphones in this pub (Black Holes &amp; Revelations to be exact). I had noticed this girl, also sitting alone, on a table to the left of me, reading some book, charging her phone in the plug socket on the wall. She was stunning, even at first glance, but I wasn't the type to approach (still am not). That's not to say I'm particularly shy or nervous, I have plenty of mates, male and female, I think I'm just stubborn, in that I don't like to admit vulnerability or whatever. I noticed her also looking at me, but at the time I just thought it was me being vain/self-absorbed. So I looked away, and went to the bar and bought some more drink. Then I sit down and open a book that I had in my bag, Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, probably hoping to impress her. She looks at me again, and beckons me over with her hand. Immediately I can tell that she is confident, or at least more confident than me, which intimidates me, but I decide that I've got nothing to lose and go over to her (first time I've ever done this) You know how you have all these insecurities and doubts, and you act in a certain way to put a cloud over it? Well for me, I try to be the 'strong, silent type', and the 'wasted, cynical type' at the same time. She had these eyes, blue just like mine, and I could tell straight away they saw right through me. First thing she said was along the lines of ""What's wrong darling?"". I don't know why, but I told her about the codeine problem and other issues, within about 5 minutes. I trusted her eyes, is the only explanation. It's like I'd been waiting to see her. Maybe I hallucinated the whole thing, idk. I rolled a cigarette for her and myself, and while we were outside she suggested that we do something non-alcoholic. We end up in this bar, get a few pints each. I remember ""Let It Be"" by The Beatles was playing (not really into them but I love that song). We were sitting on a table together, not saying a word. She typed ""Are you content in silence"" on her phone, and I type ""Content now' back. So when the band was taking a break between songs, this group of girls starts dancing near us to the background music. I had been fiddling with my hair all night and was quite obviously nervous around her, even with the array of downers I was on. She said that if I wanted to pull, now was the time. I tried to act all cool and distant at this remark, but a few seconds later she asks if I'm a virgin. Straight away I tell her I am. Quite quickly she grinds me down and gets me to admit that I'd never even kissed a girl before (nothing to be ashamed of I've since realised). We're outside again, smoking rollies. She asks me if I'd like to lose my V, and even though I'd like intimacy more than anything else in the world, I try to say I don't want to, probably out of stubbornness. Again, she sees straight through this, and invites me back to where she was staying to 'drink tequila and chill'. We drank tequila, I was shaking with nerves. I didn't expect her to be so gentle and slow, but I appreciated her immensely for it. Without going into too much detail, It was the best night of my life. She made me feel real. Haven't seen her since, I know she's got her own life to live. I try not to, but I've thought about her near enough every day since then, even though I was with her for literally less than half a day. Thank you."
641,vulnerability,offmychest,I got too close to my high school teacher.,3,5kcqop,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5kcqop/i_got_too_close_to_my_high_school_teacher/,2016-12-26 18:48:26,"Female, recent high school graduate. I keep thinking about my high school teacher. I had known him for a couple years but got dramatically closer to him toward my senior year. This is really hard to talk about because it exists somewhere between the ""gray areas"" of student-teacher relationships. I don't want to reveal too much information, but there were things that happened between us that probably shouldn't have happened between a student and teacher, especially at that level. My teacher was and is a respectable, kind, and generous man, yet I can't help but feel very remorseful, and vaguely disturbed by the situation in retrospect. He was considerably older than me and married (I knew this), and I cared tremendously about his work, art, and family, but at some point, the dynamics changed in our relationship. As I got older, I felt more and more physically attracted to him(I understood it was my hormones going wild), but the part that confused me is that he did not discourage this. Oh god, it was surreal. I was obviously having feelings for him that I tried not to express due to shame and shyness, but he seemed to encourage these feelings. He would say some (suggestive) things that made me feel kind of dirty but turned on...I felt like maybe it was all in my head, and maybe I was the one who was just thinking dirty...It's hard to describe, but I used to be completely breathless and unable to concentrate after that. I have a history of abuse (that I disclosed very briefly to him), and due to this, I have a lot of out-of-control feelings around sexual arousal. Sometimes in those moments I'd look at him drowsily, glassy-eyed, and I know that communicated exactly what I didn't want it to. So he would do something else, like maybe stand by my desk as I kneeled to pack up my things. It was really triggering, and I was always shaking, but it (confusingly) felt good. Perhaps some of my reactions were due to PTSD related confusion, but I really did get the feeling that he might have gotten off on my vulnerability. (As much as that sounds like a really bad thing to say about a professional!) I feel incredibly guilty for liking, and expecting the feeling of him teasing me. I felt valued, though. Like I was pretty, like I mattered, like he was my father. We got closer and closer as the year ended, and then a little while after getting very riskily close physically, and a nervous attempt to ""apologize"" on my part, he shut me out. I have never been so heartbroken. I still don't really know how to feel about it. I mean, on one hand, the experience is too fresh in my memory to really understand clearly, but on the other hand, I really loved (still love) this man and therefore am very conflicted about it all. I know that even suggesting that there was some inappropriate behavior is very dangerous because that puts his job, life, and reputation on the line. I'm never going to speak to someone in real life about this, but I had to confess here. It was too much to hold inside. Thanks for reading."
642,vulnerability,offmychest,(Wall of Text) I've been having sex with a girl with a long-distance boyfriend,1,5kioti,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5kioti/wall_of_text_ive_been_having_sex_with_a_girl_with/,2016-12-27 19:13:11,"I'm a college student, and I haven't been in a long term relationship with anyone who hasn't cheated on their SO with me. I met this girl in October, and there seemed to be mutual interest. We spent time together in groups since we're in the same social circle, and after about 2 weeks I was about to muster up the courage to ask her out to a concert when she casually mentioned having a boyfriend. After the fact, I texted her saying I had feelings for her and I was sorry if they were unsolicited, and she told me the worst thing she could tell someone like me: that she liked me too, but she couldn't because of her boyfriend. So I suggested we go to the concert as friends, which we did, and we had a lovely time. I invited her to a group get together that weekend, and she said yes. The next day (Friday) I got a call from my mother in tears saying the family dog of 14 years was about to pass. She was visiting family across the country, and my dad was left at home alone taking caring for him. I left work in tears and rushed to a train home, and cared for him for 12 hours, while my dad rested, and picked up my mother from the airport, and they both got some sleep. To anyone who's owned a dog, I'm sure you know how painful it is when they're suffering. I had to hand feed him from a water dropper and hold him up whenever he needed to relieve himself. All throughout the night, until 6am, when my shift finally ended, this girl texted me, keeping me company in one of the hardest times of my life. Later, on Saturday, after he had passed, I returned to my apartment, to the much needed company of my friends, including this girl. We all had a great time and it definitely made me feel a bit less sad. One by one, they all left, until it was me and this girl watching Netflix, likely due to our mutual late night prior. Knowing she had a 1.5 hour commute to home, I suggested she stay in my bed. I'd like to say it was platonic, but I'm sure we both knew what was happening. We immediately passed out, but waking up next to her led to us cuddling, which led to us hooking up. We didn't have sex that day, but we spent the whole day in bed, until we left at 8pm to order food. I thought it was a moment of emotional vulnerability on my part and a bad case of caring too much on hers, until she came over again, and again, and again. She had cheated on him before, and him on her, but not like this, nothing serious. We started having sex. She started spending time with me outside of bed, with my friends and roommates (who all knew the situation). I began getting attached. She was sweet to my friends, and seemed to like spending time with me. I'd help her with classwork and share my hobbies with her. It was nice. Guilt took me eventually, and I said it had to stop after 2 weeks of hooking up. Cold turkey, no talking, texting for a week, until we found ourselves drunk and at a party and all the feelings came back. I asked her on a date with me. She said yes. She came over that night and we had the best drunk sex I've ever had. She spent more and more time at my place as the year came to a close. Before break, she had spent 8 consecutive nights at my apartment. She told me I was the best sex partner she's had. I told her the same, and I know I wasn't lying. She was wearing my clothes to class, showering at my apartment. We knew each other well, what we did and didn't like, what we enjoyed, what we wanted out of a relationship, and I told her I thought I was in love. She said she felt something for me but she couldn't say the word. I told her I couldn't keep doing this, that I was getting too attached, and she said she wanted to be with me. She left for winter break on my birthday, about a week ago. She won't be back until mid January. I want her so badly to break up with her boyfriend, but I know she can just as easily turn around and break my heart. I don't know what to do or what to say. I know I'm a stupid kid in love, thinking with his heart instead of his brain, and I don't know what to do. I can't think straight because of my feelings for her and I know it. I just don't want to be hurt, even though I set myself up for it. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Talking about it and having people know helps me somehow. Tl:Dr: girl has a boyfriend but I fall for her anyways and we hook up a bunch. It turns into a pseudo relationship and she says she'll ditch him for me but I'm worried she won't. "

I realize I am no longer a child, yet I still feel like one. I also feel old and worthless. It doesn't make any sense. I am disgusted by the amount of men who have molested, abused, and taken advantage of me before I turned 18. I feel disconnected from the world, like everything I see has been perverted, like there is some hollow, insidious plot beneath the smile of every older man. Most of all, because a vast majority of my abuse has taken place in my hometown, I feel betrayed. It's as if everyone is blind; it's as if my town is haunted. I can't understand how seemingly respectable, professional older men do things like this. I don't really want to understand, either. I keep having flashbacks, and I keep re-experiencing my fear and arousal. I always feel guilty, because I feel like a terrible person for being aroused by memories of my abuse. I have awful self-esteem, and I'm not pretty like other girls. But still, 40+ men will look at me in an intensely lustful way, and I will feel myself become aroused without actually wanting to be aroused. I dress in baggy sweaters to hide my body, but they still talk to me on the street, kiss my neck, touch me, and my body just responds no matter what. I know I can say no, but I am always afraid that it'll end in violent retaliation. It makes me want to cry. I am always turned on when I don't want to be, and it horrifies me. A week ago, I was walking the college campus with my friend, and an older faculty member left one of the doors swiftly. He walked past me and I froze. I was insanely disturbed by his scent, or manner of walking, or just his closeness in general. Something about him terrified me and I could not place it. Then came the unwarranted arousal. What makes it so awful is that sometimes when I'm in that situation, an older adult that I trust will start to make advances toward me because I'm displaying signs of arousal. Then it all goes wrong. I have some anxiety that manifests in public places, and I am always experiencing disturbing unwanted thoughts and unexplained panic attacks. I just finished my first semester of college, but I feel haunted by school. I can't bring myself to visit my high school anymore because the place is drenched in memories I haven't fully developed. It is a cold, echoing, confused place. I am very sad, but I know I can't kill myself because I have 5 failed suicide attempts behind me and I feel like I need something else besides death. I've tried the whole suicide as an answer thing, and it never worked out. I just want to be loved. Loved by a man who isn't harsh, emotionally unavailable, or driven by lust. I want a man who will not use my vulnerability against me. Thanks for reading."

When I was old enough, he was someone I wanted to protect. I wanted to be someone he could ask questions. When I didn't know how to bond with him, I just spent time reading in the same room or watching him play video games. Video games were his life and he was very good at them. I kept all of his secrets. Occasionally, there were moments of vulnerability. Concerns he had, he asked if I had solutions or experience. My brother was a typical last born. He was the baby. He knew no punishment. He knew no responsibility. He would groan loudly when asked to help around the house or clean up after himself. No amount of tact worked, actually. He always made it seem like too much was required of him. Most people's tone changes when they are joking. He insults people as if he is joking and people think it is a joke, so they let him walk away without resolving anything. He might ""jokingly"" say that everyone in the family exists to serve him. He would stay up until 4am playing video games. He would complain loudly at the screen as if no one had asked him to be quiet the day before. I would have to, nightly, ask him to be quiet because sleep was very important to me for keeping my job. Then one night, he exploded at me. He was told that I should move out of this house. He then insulted me by telling me that I never spend my money on anything useful. His tone was dripping with hatred. How dare I ask a reasonable favor that would dare besmudge his perfect little carefree life? He was not a grateful person. We did not ever expect a thank-you from him. When he had friends over, he would openly call me names to be funny, yet become absurdly angry when I would be in the same room as them. He will take an entire pizza box into his room, then ""jokingly"" lie and say that there is no pizza left if anyone else wants a slice. When his favorite foods disappear quickly, he will ""jokingly"" say that whomever is responsible is fat. He is a selfish creature. He cannot feel that other people need sleep. He has no empathy. A couple times a week, I might ask if he wants junk food, or fast food. I would get him burgers, subs, cheesesteaks, and candy. I would make him breakfast. I spoke to him about common interests. I would hang out with him. I spoke to him to let him know I cared. I built his computer. I don't mention the piles of clothes in the bathroom that are his, that he never hangs up my towel when taking it down to shower, that he spilled reptile ""dirt"" all over my towel, that he never cleans up the mouse blood from the sink, that he never deals with dishes, that he neglects the dogs yet screams at me when I am not watching them when they are outside, that he piles things on top of the trash so it falls everywhere for the next person, or that he frequently intertwines anti-homosexual slurs into his speech. I asked him, recently, if he thought I was an asshole. He told me ""yes."" I asked why. He told me that I had no empathy. That I never think about how people feel when I say things. You could not be cured. I've vowed it off. You're dead to me. "
645,vulnerability,offmychest,[xpost from raisedbynarcissists] RANT//NAW: NGrandfather makes me hate the holidays,2,5l0ovj,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5l0ovj/xpost_from_raisedbynarcissists_rantnaw/,2016-12-30 12:35:46,"I posted this in another thread already, but I still need to rant. I don't know if this is the proper format for this subreddit, as this is my first time posting and not just lurking. Each year, I noticed a little more. The sneaky judging, passive-aggressive comments, lack of a thank you, and even more rare - an apology. If it does happen, it's for something vague. Last thanksgiving? He was making fun of my dad about buying 3 different barbecues in the past 10 years because they have broken down (from daily use). My grandfather hardly uses his but bragged about how it still works. My dad was defending himself when I interjected ""oh my god they all cook food, why is this an argument"" trying to diffuse the tension. My dad walked into the kitchen, and my grandfather turns to me and says ""do you need me to kick the shit out of you? Because I have plenty of years of experience :)"" I dreaded Christmas this year. I have my own family problems with my parents, but upon getting to know my grandfather... Holy shit. We got to my grandfather's. His wife (my grandma) passed away earlier this year, making him my last remaining grandparent. He's also the biggest ass. He's got a lot of support from his church for his involvement, but they don't know what he's like with his family. My dad has a slew of issues, ranging from nearly dying as a child from Encephalitis and suffering brain damage, to not knowing how to handle extreme emotions, going from spacing out to red in the face and ready to hit me. There's more, but I won't get into that, because asides from that brain damage and other past abuse, I truly believe my grandfather is to blame. Christmas afternoon, we arrived. My sister and I stood in the door way, hesitant to go upstairs to the living room. We finally go up. I nervously / happily say ""Merry Christmas everyone"". My grandfather is sitting across the room. He calls me over. I slowly walk over, with a deafening silence and all eyes on me, he says ""your dad tells me you're getting fat. Your fatness is genetics, right?"". This was a jab at my sister and my mom, who are on the chubbier side, but there was always an expectation of me being tiny, and now that I'm 23 and going / gone through my second puberty, I had to get rid of my size zero clothing because I have hips and breasts now. I'm a size 4-6 US now, and I was just getting okay with this, but at my grandmother's funeral, I was being complimented by his church friends on how pretty I was. I have a mild eating disorder, where I took paleo a little too far to the point it stressed me out. Then I started university, and the ""freshman 15"" and second puberty and stress double teamed me, along with time constraints and a difficult time finding paleo food in food courts and finding comfort in bingeing the unhealthy stuff. I'm not even that fat, but he made it sound like I was obese, and proceeded to tell me ""guess your whole diet thing was fake, since you're not into that anymore"". I have food intolerances that do in fact affect me anytime I have grain, legume or dairy products, but being so restricted at all times is very hard and to this family - too much to accommodate. After my grandfather told me I was fat in front of cousins and my aunt and uncle who I haven't seen since the funeral, I replied ""oh my god that is not how you greet people. How about ""merry christmas, how're you doing?"" like holy crap"" and I sat down and texted my boyfriend and best friend what just happened. He told my dad (his son) he wanted to give me money for school, but didn't even ask me about school. My GPA was 87% this semester, the highest my marks have been in YEARS. I got accepted into on-campus volunteering, taking control of my borderline and mental health issues.... but nothing matters to this piece of shit. I feel like he used my financial vulnerability as a means of luring me out just to use me as the punching bag in front of everyone. He's insulted my mom over the years as well, and mows down my dad in front of other family members. He does this to us the most out of all my other family members. I didn't even want to go, but I didn't want him to feel alone either as our other family members are marrying off and having kids, hanging out with the in-laws and whatnot. I'm not a model grand-daughter, but I try. I try to be sympathetic to this man. But later in the evening, he apologized for his ""bad attitude"" but nothing specifically, nor did he say anything to me about anything else. Growing up, he has given my cousins and I money at the beginning of showing up, I'm guessing as a means of buying our attention, or paying us for the impending emotional punching. He mocks us, insults us, and the phrase ""what Teddy wants, Teddy gets"" has become a common phrase. He was like this before my grandmother passed away. He's been like this his whole life. I don't even know if I can say he's a narcissist. He's a psychopath. I'm not even sure if this will bite me in the ass someday... I can't say I care much anymore. Even a cut of the inheritance, should I receive anything at this rate, feels like cursed money. They say love is a choice, and when it comes to this man, it's a very. Fucking. Difficult. Choice. Growing up, I have always dreaded going to his house for anything, and was always excited to leave, despite the fact I couldn't figure out why until years later. TL;DR;; Grandpa... you're a fucking asshole. You treat my dad like shit, and he tries SO FUCKING HARD to please you. You're not even worth it. You don't really give a shit about any of us, we are either trophies or embarrassments, often both at the same time. Your kindness was in the form of a cheque-book, and there was always fine print. Your ""love"" is always conditional, and my respect for you in return, is also conditional. My other grandparents were so kind, so sweet, model people within their own right... but they passed away years ago. When I was little, I was led to believe you were the good one because you gave us money but looking back, it was the love, the acceptance, the experiences that I look fondly upon. Merry Christmas, and may my fat ass break your stupid chairs. "

I've been out of the house for a few years now but I still have so much venom in me. It's not even an active thing, I just find myself retreating to a head full of hatred whenever I'm actually involving myself with my dad. The worst part is that he wants me to love him. Today I had a discussion with him where I really tried to give him some fodder. I showed interest in some talk about an old heart surgery and he started going on about it. Then he kept going on about it. It wasn't in an interested sort of way. It was like he couldn't find anything else to say so he just kept retreading the same things while I tried to look at least slightly interested. The whole time I just kept thinking about how much I wanted him to shut up. That I didn't care about the topic, more than that I really just didn't like him. I changed the subject to try and keep invested and he just brought it right back. I was fuming. It was stupid and unnecessary and over dramatic, but I was fuming. I ended up excusing myself a little later. Now, a while after the encounter, I wish I could give him that love. I see his vulnerability and I wish I could help with it instead of being such a shit head. This happens every time though. I have a right to be mad too. For years he came home screaming at everybody, calling family members bitches and stupid. He made them feel stupid. We would get into screaming matches until he got the belt which only stopped when I was big enough that he couldn't. He does so much to destroy my mother's sense of self worth and even now I constantly hear it. Now I don't know what to do. I want to meet his vulnerability half way. He's 75 now and he needs that love, I don't just want to abandon him. Maybe that's just a symptom of emotional abuse though, I don't know. I don't know if I deserve to let myself do what I can or if I have a duty to my family. I don't know if I'm being inhuman right now. It sucks."

I don't want to spend another minute dancing on the edge of dreams that weren't meant for me. I get that I am begging for it, throwing myself at it, but the want is too strong to make it shameful. I'm stuck in my mind with so many options that it feels like none at all. I'm trying to catch something careless. To feel the foolish freedom that comes with self-possession. To just, for once, not feel apologetic about taking up space. Instead I am sleeping alone, hiding in blankets and white noise, hoping something will find me and wake me up. I often think that I've found it. My eyes toy with the idea of opening before closing firmly shut, so as not to be mistaken for trying. The vulnerability. Oh, the vulnerability. The trust it takes to let someone close enough to feel my skin and poison my mind. I want it to be taken from me. I want desire that threatens the fabric of my universe. That rips holes in safety and silence. That kills me like the slow drip of honey or a bullet to the head. Get me out of my mind for an hour, a night, a lifetime. Save me from the burning building I've built to crumble. Weigh me down until I forget how to tread water. Anything works. "
649,vulnerability,offmychest,The worst feeling,2,5mb8ty,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5mb8ty/the_worst_feeling/,2017-01-06 14:31:42,"For the longest time I couldn't express in words exactly what I was feeling until I finally starting writing it down, so now Im here cause I just really needed to get this off my chest ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- The worst part about being raped, isnt just the fact that I got raped, its the emotions that come with it. Hate, loneliness, shame, embarrassment, vulnerability, confusion, loss of yourself worth, loss of your pride, decrease in confidence, loss of trust, etc. I could go on forever but the combination of those and wishing you were a different person is what makes it hurt as much as it does. It is easy to hate other people, especially strangers, it hurts to hate someone you love but it is unbearable to hate yourself. How do you live when you cannot stand looking at the person in the mirror? No matter how many times someone tells you its not your fault and youll be okay, it doesnt change how you feel. I hate him with my entire soul, I hope that one day he endures the same pain he has put me through and that he ends up in hell but at the same time I cant stand who I am anymore either. It could be that I feel he ruined me, or tainted me. He made it unworthy to be in my own skin. The thought of what he did makes my want to crawl out of my body and jump into a brand new one. He has violated the temple which was once mine and I do not know how to cleanse it. This is what tortures me daily, it makes me toss and turn in the middle of the night. It does not allow me to live comfortably as the person I once was. People say never let something bad that has happened to you define you but it is easier said than done. What is even worse is I always have to put on a faade and act like nothing is wrong, that I am still the strong woman they once knew but on the inside I am slowly falling apart. I want nothing more than to become someone else, run away and change my name, my hair, my face change anything I possibly can about myself even if it means leaving those I love behind. I face the challenging of resisting the urge to abandon ship and fight everyday put myself together again. Somedays it works but most day it just hurts, it feels like I am just stacking garbage on top of garbage and trying to call it art. I keep wondering if I will always feel this way or if I will be myself again one day. I miss her, she was fun, outgoing, lighthearted, very stubborn but loving and free willed, she loved life and everything it had to offer. I dont feel her free spirit anymore, her optimism is fading more and more every day and I cant help but to feel hollow and defiled. Hopefully one day I will get over it but I fear I will never be the same. "

It seems like such a stupid thing to be upset over because we had only been seeing each other for a month. I had been holding myself back from showing a little too much vulnerability, partly because of past experiences, and partly because I was afraid I would scare you away, thinking we would be moving too fast. I was trying to do the smart thing and not jump right into anything too quickly. But as it happens, you were already seeing someone else 2 weeks prior to our first meeting, and he readily threw himself all in. You were open with the both of us about each of our existences. You told me he wasn't very eligible, that his religious beliefs and lack of relationship experience were red flags to you. You told me I had no red flags you could pinpoint. You told me you were a rational person. I always planned for our dates, did little things that would make your day easier, and you told me you're always thankful and appreciative of me for the things I did to make your day better. After a while, you were tired of hurting both parties, since we both wanted you exclusively. You decided to take a week to think about it, and in that time, with the possibility of losing you very real, I broke my own personal rule. I confessed to you. After one month of knowing you. Not once while we were going out did I ask about the other guy or bother with any details. He was the insecure one, inquiring about the times we went out, probing more about me, trying to sway you to take his side. Maybe to you, it was him wanting you more. He never planned for any dates, and when you two met up, it was always, ""hmmm what do you wanna do?"" back and forth. I did my best to convince you to be rational, because why would you walk down the path where you could foresee the obstacles. Feelings can grow between us, or it can dissipate. It was obvious whom amongst the 2 of us would put in the effort into making it work. And yet you chose him. Because he had a way with words. Because you felt more for him than you did for me. You were willing to overlook the obstacles in hope that it will all work out rather than walk down the path with no foreseeable problems and work on just the feelings. You told me it was because he threw himself in right from the start. You told me if I had been upfront earlier, you would've chosen me. But just because I confessed to you later, does not make my feelings any less real. You told me you were looking for a long term relationship, yet this decision was based on how you were feeling right now, in the short term. In your own words, you told me I was the right person but in the wrong time. Oddly enough, I understood you. You wanted to know what it was like to follow your heart because you had been rational your whole life, and you were afraid of losing this feeling you have. All these happened 6 hours ago. We parted amicably. I cried. You cried. I feel hurt and betrayed. I want to hate you. I really do. I feel stupid because we had only known each other a month and I was head over heels for you. However, if I could do it over, I would let you in much sooner. I would open up much more and tell you how much I adored you. At the same time, I wish you well and hope you find your happiness with him. I hope he buys you flowers. I hope he plans for your dates. I hope he gets you little things that he thinks you might like. I hope he will go out of his way to get you medication that you're lacking, even thought you don't need it. I won't be holding out that things won't work out with him, but if we are both single and our paths ever cross again, I would like for us to pick up where we left off. "

My car was diagnosed with cancer four months ago. The prospect wasn't good, and we had just taken him in from my mother, so my fiance and I were heartbroken. It was inevitable, as he is 15, but it still hurts so much. My father passed away 7 years ago. He was never find of cats, but this one worked his way into his heart. A black stray, over a year at the pound, and when we went to look at him, all he did was skull under chairs, out of sight. My father's response was, ""He's perfect."" That cat and my father were inseperable. He grew into the most loving and affectionate animal I'd ever met, and when my father passed I tried to push out all my vulnerability in my awareness that this cats love came from my dad's own caring for this neglected feline. He helped this animal find unconditional love, and now it is my last connection with my father. Im currently overseas, away from the love of my life while she deals with her companion while I'm gone being out down. I feel helpless. I know hes just a cat. He's my last present connection with my father, he's my future wife's constant companion, and he means so much to me. Hes dying of the same cancer my fiancee had, and I'm far away, unable to say goodbye. I love you Sultan. I love you dad. Someone call a whambulance. I just hope you feel the love all of us had for you. Thank you for making me feel vulnerable again after my father died. Sorry Reddit. I just needed to vent. "
652,vulnerability,offmychest,I became the crazy ex girlfriend :(,6,5itf7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5itf7p/i_became_the_crazy_ex_girlfriend/,2016-12-17 18:25:29,"How I became the psycho Ex-Girlfriend It started with a swipe. A right swipe to be precise. I suppose thats how most relationships start these days, a click, a swipe, theres no more courting no subtle psychophysical mannerisms that are meant to convey interest. Unfortunate really, but then I also succumbed to the convenient, game like apps meant to find my next source of sexual satisfaction for the next few months. Little did I know that I would fall for this guy without even realizing it. Alright lets start off by saying that I dont blame A (well call the dude in question A for anonymities sake) for anything except not being honest with me, and even this is a stretch. That said I will jump right in. February: We began talking on this app called bumble, most of you know it I am sure. For those who have been living under a rock or simply have the good sense to avoid these dating apps, bumble is an app where the woman has to start the conversation with people she has matched with (not sure how it works with men looking for men or women looking for women on the app). After the conversation is started the person has a limited amount of time to respond before the math expires. I started my conversation with A using my usual one liner Do you ave 11 protons? because youre looking sodium fine The texting blossomed from there, for the most part he started the conversations after that, we discussed the usual hobbies, etc. and more importantly we discussed what we were looking for. At the time I was looking for something in between casual sex and long term, a sweet spot that was more than FWB but less than a full on relationship, and to be completely fair that is what A gave me. Most of you may think, wow that sounds great! all the fun none of the drama, who is she to complain? And youd be right, I look back and realize this was my fault, A was giving me what I asked, and I am the one who changed my mind. But there in lies the problem with dating on these apps or even just dating in your 20s. Our wants change as our feelings develop! Fast forward to about a month later, A asks me to be exclusive, I agreed, thinking that exclusive meant dont fuck anyone else. Which is sort of does, and more, the more part is what I didn't get, I kept talking to people on bumble, never really pursuing anyone or going out on a date, just chatting, keeping my options open. A little bit of background information for you; A is unique in that I hadn't dated anyone like him before, he his about 510 dark hair, larger boxer type frame and not really in shape, but not grotesquely obese. Everyone before him had been muscular, extremely athletic and very tall. So I didnt really think things would last long, I had a tendency to lose interest quickly, I require a lot of sex in a relationship and a lot of guys have a hard time keeping up, and I hadnt been serious with anyone since my first boyfriend J who I met at 18 and dated for 2 years and had all my firsts with. (He was older and also traveled a lot so I rarely saw him) So when I say I have little experience with relationships I am not exaggerating, I have a lot of trust issues and and baggage from events of my past and I am emotionally detached from people in general due to this. When I felt weird still talking to people on bumble I figured its because I was just off my game, but later realized this was guilt. The feelings were slowing starting to creep in. A noticed I had changed my picture on bumble while he was off on a trip with his friends, and confronted me about it, I explained my ignorance, and said I would delete the app, and so I did. Mistake #1. So we continued dating and having incredible sex, we would spend the night at each others places often and it was just very relaxed. May: By this time I am realizing I really care about him, I dont find other men as interesting anymore, and I am trying to be more open with him, at least in my own weird way. But A seems disinterested, I notice he spends a lot of time on his phone now, and I worry its because I am boring him. A has also quit his job at this point, something I thought was good, since he seemed to hate it. He talks about his future a lot and finding what he wants to do, talks about grad school, etc. A lot of his plans involve going to California, and he talks about it like its nothing. Ouch. Suffice to say I am blind, I have completely ignored all the warning signs, the disinterest, the little comments about my weight, talking about the future as if I am not part of it (well duh girl, you arent). Mistake #2! I have also been getting irritated by the fact that I am still just the girl he dates, because dumb me, I forgot that I just wanted something in the middle! To make things worse he wants me to meet his parents, okay, so I am the girl he dates, he wants to take things slow, but wants me to meet his parents? I think it is fair that I was confused, but I am the one who let him do this, so only I am to blame. I will never bad mouth As parents, they were fucking awesome people, his mother is honestly one of the kindest, loving people I have had the pleasure to meet. His dad was very kind as well, though I did sense some tension over the quitting his job issue. His nana, uncle and aunt were also hilarious, amazing people that I truly regret not being able to know better. If it had been a socially acceptable thing to do I would have stayed in contact with them. So we leave and go back to his place, he says his mom liked me, which I am thrilled about it. That night after we got back, I also told him about me moving to Tennessee, I know what youre thinking! Wtf, where did that come from, youre kind of the asshole in this situation. That is true only to a point, yes it was a shitty thing to drop on someone, but my moms health is very hot and cold right now and TN holds better options for my education and internships. Had he not talked about moving to California so often and tip toed around the fact it wouldn't work out with us if he did, I will 100% say that despite my moms health, as much as I love her, I would have stayed. I can now be honest with myself and say that yes, I loved him at this point, before this even, and I would have stayed if he had asked me to, if he has said dont leave I would have ignored all the red flags and stayed with him, knowing deep inside, it was never going to last, he was ready to leave me any minute. June: A invites me to meet his friends at a birthday pool party they hold for him. So I go to meet his friends, and they are mostly jewish, nothing wrong with that, I have jewish friends and they are all awesome. Problem is, all these people know each other REALLY well, they all have a lot in common, and I am sitting there equipped only with knowledge pertinent to my degree in molecular bio and biotech and very little real world experience, I am 22 and still in college, what do you expect? I rarely see him during the party, which is fine, he wants to reconnect with his friends right? So I am sitting at this pool party not knowing what to say or how not be awkward or a burden on these people, who to be fair really tried to keep me involved in the conversation. At one point in the evening he and I are talking and I make a joke about him having other side chicks, (it really was a joke!!!! I am not a passive aggressive person!) and he pushes me away from him and scolds me, in front of others, for insulting his character. Embarrassed I was almost a mute for the rest of the night, when we got back to his place he didn't want to have sex. So we laid down and watched t.v. in the dark. I started thinking through the day and all the times he had introduced me as this is ___ , the girl I am dating. Most of his friends had no idea he was dating anyone (RED FLAG!) and my paranoid, and newly vulnerable self figured the reason he had been upstairs for 1/2 hr was because he was fucking one of the attractive girls at the party who were foreign. I told myself I was stupid to think he would do something like that. Suddenly I realized I had tears running down my face and it pissed me off. I hadnt cried over something that wasnt a movie/sad youtube video/ book for three years and this motherfucker is the reason Im silently sobbing like some pathetic toddler. I hid my face in his chest and pretended to sleep all night, I didn't want him to ask questions, how could I answer? This is the night I realized the true extent of my feelings for him, and the vulnerability he had brought out of me, and it scared me. Moving on to the end of June, I didnt see him often anymore, I had bought him a watch online for his birthday, a gorgeous wooden one that was personalized with a message engraved on the back. The watch took a while to make so it didn't make it until after the move. I was moving to my dads house since my lease was up, and I didnt want to shell out for an additional 6 months since I was moving at the end of the year. He helped me move there and spent the night. We talked, and he said he would be willing to try long distance, I was thrilled. My heart felt like it had just received a direct dose of adrenaline, a day later I texted him telling him I loved him for the first time. I figured I would tell him before the watch came. He called me a day later at his fourth of july party with his friends and said he loved me, and then IN THE SAME CALL broke up with me. I had never felt so instantly empty and grief stricken. I could barely talk to him, I was in tears sitting on the driveway in the dark listening to him break up with me, tell me long distance wont work for him because he needed someone to hug him at the end of a hard day. The next week was filled with me felling empty, alone, and worst of all even more broken than normal. I got a call form him later that month when the watch came, he loved it, I didnt know what to say to him, he had just torn out my heart, threw it on the ground, and acted like it had never happened. I told him I was glad he liked it and he replied with thats all? What did he want me to say? He knew how I felt, and he decided that wasnt good enough a week ago. During the summer I went to TN for a month to visit my mom and watch the pets while they were on a trip. He and I texted a little here and there, he would say he missed me and tell me how hard it was for him. (Hard for him? seriously dude?) My parents and friends told me I was better without him, that he had ditched me once I became inconvenient. I became angry, and we fought, and stopped talking. When I got back, I chatted him up October, I really needed sex and I wanted to get over him, I figured fucking him would desensitize me. Mistake #? I lost count. All my old feelings for him crept back up, I ended up telling him I couldnt do it anymore, I asked him if I could pick up my stuff sometime. After he asked to reschedule, I told him to just leave it all in front of his house and I would pick it up while he was out. He forgot to put it out, and when I called him to figure out where it was he asked if we could do it another day, I told him no. At this point I wanted all of this to be over. I had fucked my ex J (first boyfriend) and honestly just felt like shit. He said to come to barnes and noble where he was to pick it up, I did, and I left him with one last heartfelt note wishing him well in life, and trying to pathetically explain my feelings. Mistake. Press on to December, I leave in a week. Right after Christmas in fact. I am exited, and hoping this will serve as a clean slate where I can forget about him and all the pain I let him cause. And I get a call from Js finance (I know, I am an asshole, but thats an even longer story) she is crying and trying to tell me in her garbled english/japanese that J may have given her an std an that he had died in a car crash and the funeral had passed. She gave me long enough on the phone to get the location of where he was buried and then hung up. Any progress at trying to pull myself together was dashed, in fact I am still trying to figure out where to start again. And stupid, stupid me, I had been fucking J before hooking up with A after A and I broke up. So now, if having to deal with the sudden death of my first love and close friend was not enough, I have to tell A he needs to checked for STDs too. I call him that night but chicken out. I text him two days later and tell him to get checked and why, but he replies asking me what he needs to be checked for, how long have I known, and when I refuse to call back and ask Js fiance what she was checked for he goes on at me telling me he is disappointed in me, I am immature, and have put his new partner at risk. Triple ouch. No care at all that J is dead, I find out that within a month of us not seeing each other anymore you have moved on, and you think I am immature because I dont want to call back the fiance of the man I fucked, who has just died. Right. So long long story short I let my emotions overwhelm me and I made some seriously cruel comments and a fool of myself. Well, if you made it this far, congrats, I am impressed, and you probably are wondering what the fucking point of this is? Well I guess there are a lot of points, 1st, create the expectation that your feelings may change as a relationship evolves 2nd, dont allow yourself to be vulnerable to someone who doesnt treat you right 3rd, we all go crazy sometimes, and while I always preach that you should be classy when breaking up, if you do go a bit crazy, forgive yourself and learn from it. 4th, if hes actually into you, he will actually try 5th, good guys/girls don't make you feel like shit 6th, dating in your 20s is hard as fuck 7th, talk! if you are unsure about where a relationship is, talk about it, if you are upset or worried about something tell them, if you love them tell them, if you want more tell them, just talk. 8th, they may be wasting your time, but youre the one letting them 9th, people lie 10th, this one is a rule: if youre texting an ex, wait a day before you send it and see if you still feel the same. Most of the time you are just letting your emotions/wants get the best of you. ~Good luck my dears, and tell me your crazy ex moments!!!~"

654,vulnerability,offmychest,Read to my story,2,5925i7,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5925i7/read_to_my_story/,2016-10-24 13:06:43,"Warning: 3000+ words To whoever is reading this, whoever you are whether I know you or not is more than likely not relevant Im like you a human being. What it all comes down to is skin and bone, we all start out as the same and enter the world in the same manner. Why is it then that we all are treated differently later on in our lives? Our society has a huge impact on us growing up and how we are perceived as young people. Im now 21 and for me it has been a huge struggle, living alongside depression and self-harm Poverty and being homeless. Having no family and not really having a place I can call a home. For as long as I can remember I have not had a happy childhood. From the age of 8 Ive been without a dad. Dont get me wrong he loves me and I love him I just have not been in contact with him for 13 years. He got put in a secure mental institute in 2002, since that day everything from going to school and life at home got tough. My mother had to cope being a single mother and bringing up her 3 children, she was always at work and that was barely enough to cover rent and food for all of us. Luckily she managed we moved around a lot. Living in hostels and houses where we were only there for a short amount of time. My mother was always looking for a partner, she had so many boyfriends after my dad. All of them were so abusive towards me went days without food. Got locked in cupboards whilst they went out to shopping. I was never understood as a child. Throughout school I was bullied for what my dad had did  it was in the papers and on the news. Everybody knew what happened. I was skiving from school from year 7 all the way to year 9 because school was too hard for me. I never had any friends to whom I could talk too. At the age of 14 I moved to a new place where nobody knew about my dad, I thought great! I could start a new life where nobody knew my past Boy was a wrong. I was still bullied. I was 6 foot tall, got told I was ugly and nobody would ever talk to me. I started to believe everything they were saying. Thus starting the self-harm journey for me. I researched into self-harming and looked at so many different blogs that had different stories about people who were self-harmers. I took a blade from one of my mothers razors and used it against my skin. I loved it. Every day at school was such a nightmare for me, I was walking through the halls and it came to the point where I was avoiding everybody I used to wait at places that nobody would go to just so I could get to my next class without any confrontations. High school was a time where I genuinely felt scared. Year 10 however was quite a good time for me I met this girl called Jessica, who later turned out to become my best-friend  she was amazing, we did everything together!! We chose the same classes to do our GCSEs in just so we could be next to each other and have our conversations when the class got mega boring! It came to the point where I was reliant on everything she did I got upset when she didnt show up to class or if she had dentist appointments. I enjoyed every minute of school when she was there because she had friends who were popular and because I was her friend I got accepted into that social group. Without her, happiness for me would be non-existent. The one date throughout all high school which I will always remember is December 01st 2010. I had a birthday party on my birthday which is November 21st but due to Jess not being able to attend because her parents were strict as hell I promised that Id come to hers the following week. We planned to have a sleepover then go for a meal in the morning prior to the morning she came into the living room and passed me her teddy which she adored so much. It was white and a polar bear! So adorable. She treasured this bear so much that I was shocked she gave it to me to sleep with. We said our good nights then she went to her room and we all went to sleep. In the morning I went into her room to give her the bear back. What I saw still haunts me to this day. She had hung herself. I dont know why she did it, there was no note, nothing. I blame myself still to this day my happiness went when she took her own life. She took my heart and still has it. I have yet to gain any more friends due to this because I do not want to get so attached to someone to watch them leave and have my feelings torn apart. Her suicide began the thoughts of my own suicide. Sixth form time now and I was still getting bullied but due to Jesss suicide everything they said to me or did to me didnt have any effect on me. Well thats what I thought. I was always self-harming and even thinking about my own death. Contemplating how I would do it which was more painful and which was quicker. I started too research into it and what I found was shocking. The more I researched the more I wanted to end my own life. From the age of 14 upwards I was always getting called a faggot however I did not deem myself to be gay others were already calling me it. Could they see something in me that I couldnt? Nevertheless these feelings did not show till I reached sixth form. I ended up coming out as gay and announcing myself as gay in sixth form. I loved the way boys looked, how they had great jaw lines started to picture them topless and the feelings I felt were amazing. People always used to put me down every now and then though. My mother didnt take this very likely and practically threw me out the house and I had to live in a hostel with ex-offenders who had just come out of prison. I felt so different to everybody there. It was at the hostel where I had tried my first suicide attempt Took loads of paracetamol. Low and behold it had no effect on me  I just was sick for ages. In 2012 I got my own flat and at first I thought great, freedom. There was bills to keep on top of and housing benefit only paid some of the rent. I ended up getting into so much debt and I stopped paying my bills. I had no electricity or hot water for ages. I never cleaned up I lost all hope in living. I treated every day like it was my last My attitude to life was if the police came I would just end up killing myself. I didnt really appreciate anything. I wanted to die. I still get feelings now of wanting to die There is always something or someone who is negative towards me and even though the effects of what they say may be minor my mind just amplifies the comment by 1000 and Im suicidal. I know that when push comes to shove and if someone said to me to end my life I probably wouldnt do it Im not attention seeking by writing this, I just need a release and everything is just getting to me. I need to write it out and read it back just to get a sense of everything. Im only human and everybody makes mistakes yet people always crucify me for them. I always feel like Im not accepted by anybody. I always feel like if I died would my mother love me again would anybody even care. Heck, would anybody even notice Im gone. Who would actually fucking miss my presence. Right now writing this I feel like nobody would. I have no friends nobody I would really talk to when Im feeling like this. I just keep everything locked inside and just hope people ask me if Im feeling okay. Just those three words are you okay? is all Im waiting for. What would my response be? Yes Im fine. More than likely that would be my response. Last time I felt suicidal was the other night. Whilst at my university accommodation and it was so upsetting. Heres me thinking moving away from home into a place where nobody knew me would be the best thing ever and I would get away from all these thoughts. I guess I was wrong. I always tend to come to the library now because in my accommodation I always feel like Im going to resort to using a blade just like the old days. The other day in one of the lectures we had to talk about childhood and everybody in the group was writing so many happy stuff and there was me who was writing a whole lot of stuff None positive. I just wish I had a happy childhood. I always feel left out of everything that is happening I dont go out and party like everybody else. Im still very isolate when it comes to socialising Everybody thinks I am confident but when it comes down to it Im nothing of the sort. I put on a brave face and change my character to make people think Im happy. I always get scared admitting that Im not okay. People on my course at university are actually quite alright I bet they all think Im quite confident too! Theres this one girl who is on the young peoples and societies course and we click like anything! She so amazing but oh my god When do I tell her that I find her attractive? I hate these choices that I have to make. Dont know where to add this in so Ill just add it here whilst going through my abandonment from my mother and living in my flat I ended up going into sexual favours with older men for money. This wasnt something I wanted to do but it was something that I needed to do to survive it was my source for meals, a place to stay for a short while and my main source for money. I was claiming jobseekers and this wasnt cause I couldnt get a job it was because getting a job meant I would have been homeless a lot more sooner than I was. The government was paying for my rent and this was the only way I was able to live under a roof. The range of ages I would have sex with for money would range from the youngest of 27 to the maximum of 55. The most recent one was a 44 year old who was a guy who was deemed in a professional role in the community and he would pay me for sexual favours and sometimes I felt pressured into doing these things. However there was nothing I could do to get out of it because I was deemed an adult and every choice I was making was my own. It was like I was being groomed, they were feeding into my vulnerability. They took advantage of me I let them. When I was going through this time in my life it was a tough struggle because I thought I was going to be relying on this for a long time. I had no way of seeing where I would end up if I didnt get out of it. The scary part is if I had the opportunity to do it again I would possibly end up doing it again. I was living my life based on everything that other people had said to me, people used to call me all sorts of names and I would reflect on everything they had said and I would try and change the way I was so I could be normal again. I always seem to think people are talking about me behind my back, people look at me in a weird way and I would think they were thinking about me in a way that made me feel so paranoid. I have always had long black hair that was sort of emo, always have had it in a swoop sort of way. Everybody used to say I had gay hair. I have always thought I was different but not as different as everybody used to assume. But then again who else would be writing this so late at night in the library at their university because they didnt feel safe being at their accommodation just in case they got a blade and used it against their skin because they missed the way it felt. Two weeks have passed since I wrote this and not much has changed, I ended up getting drunk on Halloween and got a knife to my throat and kept saying that I wanted to die and that life wasnt any good anyway. I used the knife on others who were trying to stop me from using it on myself  I didnt do any serious damage but I did put it against peoples throat even if it wasnt my intentions. I guess I wanted to die that much. Ive told some lecturers about what happened that night and they told me to seek help and my course mate took me to the student hub and I had to register for an appointment with someone from the wellbeing team. Im seeing them in 5 more days and even though its not something I am looking forward too because I dont know how they can help me from doing killing myself. I mean my flat mates ended up taking all the razors and sharp objects from my room so I cant harm myself. Even though they have took them doesnt mean my thoughts have gone. I guess Im hurting so much inside that all I want to do is see what its really life to be non-existent. Ive done some volunteering and I met some lovely people and I started going to the ladybird project and on the 11th November I went and played quidditch with them and it was such a great laugh because I wasnt thinking about any negative thoughts. I cant seem to sleep at night so I end up going to the library and playing runescape because it beats being in my room all alone. The future isnt looking all that good  I have my birthday soon and I dont even know if Im doing anything for it because everything is piling up on top of each other. I still have an assignment to do due in on the Monday coming up. Im going to end up doing that on the Saturday and hope that it wont take that long even though I dont even know how to do an annotated bibliography. Even though it doesnt seem long because it is only 120 words per annotation. I think Im going to go with my course mates though for my birthday and hopefully my mom gives me some money for it  she said she would but in honesty I dont think she will and if she does it wont be much. My bro should be giving me some money too but I dont know he is going to do it because all he does is work and I dont think hell come all the way to see me because why would he? Im just a stranger to him  its not really like he knows me or has to do anything for me. I think its obvious why I get down all the time because all I see is the negatives in everything  I cant fathom all of the thoughts in my head that are positive because nobody even understands how hard it is to be inside my head. I talk about my problems so openly and I feel Im just annoying everyone with all the boring stuff that effects my day to day life. Im not eating properly or sleeping properly for that matter. I cant seem to manage a proper meal especially after looking at my body earlier and just seeing the state it was in. I know its a state and that its not exactly attractive but I actually cant be bothered with exercise  Id rather just sit alone in my room or come to the library at night. The course mates may talk to me or may sit in the room during the lectures but Ive stopped going to most of them as well because I cant wake up in the morning so everything is getting to me in a way. I put assignments and essays at the last of my priority when in reality it should be at the front of agenda. I wonder if my flat mates are coming to my birthday or drinking on it  doubtful mind you but if they dont I dont think Id care but if my course mate dont let me come to hers on my birthday Im actually going to probably break down cause fuck drinking alone in my flat. I wonder whether Ill pull anybody. Heck I may go to a gay club on my birthday if I feel like it and the people Im out with dont want to come  or the music is kind of shitty. I wonder shall I cut? I want to cut myself again just to see what its like. I dont know, would it be a good thing? NEW CHAPTER Its now the end of October and Im in a house now in my second year of uni; well thats what Ive been telling people who Ive been living with. I cant find it in me to tell them that Ive not actually started, I cant tell them that I cant afford to pay the rent for my accommodation. 24/10/16 and Ive made a noose, going to kill myself in my room soon and I dont know whether anybody will read this but Im going to keep it open on my computer and well see if anybody reads this. Ive visited my mother this week, I made sure I had an eventful week leading up to this so I could smile and welcome death. The flat mates are great and amazing, they have nothing to do with me feeling like this but I just cant handle the fact that they are all going to be here all year doing uni work whereas if I was to keep on living life, Ill have to find somewhere else to live. I cant do that, Ive moved around all my life. Im planning to tell unipol that there is a dead body in their room and that they have the burden of moving me and knowing that they had the hand in making me doing this. Government and their systems made me want to kill myself, why does money have to have a huge impact on people. Im going to have to work on some sort of suicide note now The joys. "

It's been 1/2 years since I've seen you in public at that party. But still, I remember exactly what you look like. You probably don't even know who you are, or what you did. I bet if you were reading this now, you wouldn't even know I wrote this letter for you. I saw you today. Not in person, but you were tagged in a picture on Instagram. I was at home, laying on my bed doing my nightly scroll. It was a on a girl's page. One that met through a few other people. You seemed to be cooking something, and you were smiling. Her caption hinted at the fact that you two were romantically involved with each other. My heart stopped, and I felt my stomach drop. I stared at your picture for a minute or two, trying to picture you as a wholesome person cooking a cute dinner for a cute girl. But I couldn't. All I could think of was your god awful face when you were on top of me, even when I begged you to stop. ""How fucking dare you,"" I thought. ""I've gone so long without even hearing someone even mention your name, and here you are, cooking a fucking dinner, invading my personal space. In my house. How dare you show up on my Instagram feed and bring up my feelings of anger and vulnerability in my own fucking house."" Out of anger, and straight up confusion (Does she know who you are? Does she know what you did?) I unfollowed her. It's hard for me to say the ""R"" word. For me I always feel like the second that word comes out of my mouth, the blame will get put on me. People pity me, or people judge me. I fucking hate that word. But I confided in a good friend about what you did, used the ""R"" word. She asked if I was okay, if I needed to talk, and if I wanted her to cut of his wiener. I giggled. It made me feel a little bit better. Humor gets me through tough times. I put my phone down for the night. I've been laying in bed for the past hour, thinking. Being angry. Thinking of all the things I would ask you, if I ever saw you again. ""Why did you do that?"" ""Why did you force yourself on me when I told you to stop?"" ""Why didn't you care?"" ""Have you done this before?"" ""Who else have you hurt?"" ""Does your mother know she raised a rapist?"" ""Do you even know what you did?"" ""Did you push it back as far back into your memory like I have?"" ""Why??"" Just. Why. I feel like I want to delete all my friends. I feel like I want to leave town. Anything. Just so I never have to see your fucking face again, and be reminded of how you fucked me when I begged you to stop. It's been 2 years since it happened. Will I ever get over this?"
657,vulnerability,offmychest,What I have learned since I flipped my world upside down,61,54znqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/54znqt/what_i_have_learned_since_i_flipped_my_world/,2016-09-29 10:47:45,"Many months ago I woke up one day and decided it was time for me to stop talking and thinking about what I should do and actually go and do what I felt at the time needed to be done. It was a hard day, but I am happy that I went through with it. I turned my world upside down, I got rid of things that were bringing me down and changed my attitude toward life. It is amazing what you learn when you become vulnerable. I just want to get off my chest what I have learned and gained. I have learned how to manage my depression; it is no longer hanging onto my being but tucked away. I always felt heavy, everything was a struggle to do, to cook, to do homework and manage relationships. Now I am one step ahead of it and I never let it get comfortable for long. It is amazing that I have weeks where I am content, just the other day I was happy for no reason, just sitting with a shit eating grin on the train coming back from work. I took care of myself. When you get comfortable you tend to forget how to take proper care of yourself. It is more than eating better and losing some weight. It is being able listening to my body and respecting it. I found a huge link between how I took care of myself and my mood. I became more interesting. I used to just study, that defined me (ps I still study :P). But sitting alone and reading useless theory did not help my mental well-being. I took some risks and got involved in things I found interesting. I started to have fun and the balance helped me with my studying and focus. I became a better friend. During the transition I had to get comfortable with vulnerability. My friends were very receptive towards that and they were willing to open up to me more. This process strengthened our bond. I thought this process would be lonely at first but I actually rarely felt that. Lastly, I learned how to check in with myself and reflect. This process helped me understand what I want from life. The answer is that I do not know, but the check in help me understand my current situation, my well-being and my options. It helps me balance being an independent individual and a social being. It helps me deal with ambiguity that I do not know what I want to do when I grow up. It helps me take things in pieces instead of an avalanche. Overall I thought at this point I would still be in a rough place. I just want to encourage people to take that chance to change up their habits, you never know how it might positively impact your life and well-being. "
658,vulnerability,offmychest,Advice wanted: I [18F] slept with a [35M] married man and everything is falling apart.,0,55lisu,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/55lisu/advice_wanted_i_18f_slept_with_a_35m_married_man/,2016-10-03 12:59:39,"I fucked a married man who was much older- flirted with him, solicited him into fucking- and in some ways, though it was my fault, it almost felt like I had no choice at the time. I wanted to have a life worth writing about in a wikipedia article, so I thought my drug-free and trouble-free life needed some spicing up. I would go through with the act, despite being in a happy 2 year relationship with my girlfriend that was still, in some ways, unhealthy because I have BPD. I was working at a nursery in an area far from my home and took up a job as a live in nanny for this couple with two kids, which in itself was odd because the father was a stay at home parent, which meant that there was already an adult present to take care of the kids. I would later find that this man not only had an emotional affair 9 months ago and essentially cheated on his wife, but was a manchild who was financially dependent on his wife, the business owner and main provider of the house. His dislike for being responsible for his children necessitated my presence in the house as a functioning supervising adult in exchange for free room and board. For the longest time we would co-exist peacefully in the house, and I would function somewhat as an older sister for the children, though I could never replace the parental affection they needed from the overburdened working mom and the lazy, piece of shit dad. It was as if I had to function as a husband for the wife to ramble for hours upon hours to, a wife for the husband to watch things and laugh fakely at the scenes of a TV show, a parent and older sibling to two hyperactive and extremely spoiled, temperamental children. Most days, I wanted to die, but I wouldn't bail because I made a promise to stay and the family seemed so broken apart and needed me. I still hated my life at the time, but it was a temp job so I thought I would live. Work at the nursery was labor intensive and I failed many of my duties as a nanny and helper- I never did the laundry, failed to do the dishes or cook, fucked up the shower curtains with mold, and avoided the family because they all needed me to entertain them in some way nearly constantly. I had to lock myself in my room to get any peace of mind, though I constantly feared failing my job like their previous nanny, who not only abandoned this family due to homesickness, but was ""very introverted and kept to herself,"" a complaint made by the family. I came to hate the children because I was constantly tired but felt like I owed the family because they were so generous with the room and board. **On my last days in the area, the father was left alone with me in the house and began telling me both about his oncoming divorce and his personal affairs.** He asked me how I felt about polyamory and shared his journal about his sexually explicit times with the other woman. At one point, he joked that I wanted to sleep with him, which never occurred to me- I only engaged in sexual conversation with him because I was used to doing so with my friends back in college and took his trust in me as a sign of closeness. I was dismayed but enjoyed the male attention and felt as well a sort of obligation to repay him in all the duties I failed, remembering as well how many times I rejected all the times he asked to watch some TV shows with me because I hate watching things and I was always tired. He showed me the porn he liked to watch. He told me that he would jack off in the kitchen and hope I came downstairs, just for the thrill of it. He kept going on and on about sex and what he did with the other woman and what he would like to do with other women, and I encouraged the dialogue because I continually thought it was a sign of trust and I liked being trusted by him- and he made it seem like he had such a hard, sad life, too. **It devolved to me asking him if he would have sex with me because I thought it would be quite the experience to earn a title as ""homewrecker"", though at this point they were already officially divorced. I did it gladly with him a though the second day I was more reluctant and all I wanted was to sleep. I had to suck his nipples while he jacked off.** I've told my friend about it and he says I did all of this because I have no self respect and low self esteem, which in itself is true, but I can't help but wonder why my intentions were so selfish and why I was so impulsive. Because of the divorce between the couple, the mom, (who, by the way, found me in my underwear on the couch and knew I fucked her husband, and she kicked me out of the house) sent me a text to send her an affidavit in order to ensure she got custody of the kids. I of course obliged, but for the month that I told nobody about what happened, everything came rushing back. I came clean to my girlfriend a week ago, sending her a confession letter over text, and having her wait for 8 days to respond. In that time, I was sure she was going to break up with me, causing me to fail a crucial test on microbes. She said she understood, though it seems that she is under the impression that I was taken advantage of, though I am officially a grown individual, even if I was 18. At this point I fully take the blame because I was the one who asked for it, and I was the one who thought that this sexual favor would be not only inconsequential, but would wipe me of guilt from neglecting all the things I was hired to do in the house. My girlfriend and I, though reconciled, are taking a break. We have always been codependent and she has forgiven me entirely and fully but we are on break in order to more fully develop our social lives and our career goals. She and I were and still will get married in the future, but the anxiety from having to relive my experience with the married man has overtaken every corner of my life. And somehow, even though I asked for the sex and even though I knew what kind of trouble I was literally asking for, I experience now anxiety attacks where I cannot go to anyone for help because I have always relied on my girlfriend for support but wish to give her space to live her life. I have thought about who I am as a person, felt dirty, horrible, easy, selfish, and soft and wanted to kill myself a few times. Of the people that are there to support me, most of them are boys who I suspect do not respect my relationship with my girlfriend despite not having known what I did- and only being there while I'm vulnerable because I needed physical comfort, so they could play knight in shining armor.

659,vulnerability,offmychest,I was almost murdered. I've never told anyone. I need to own my story. **Trigger warning domestic violence &amp; rape,3,4z4cea,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4z4cea/i_was_almost_murdered_ive_never_told_anyone_i/,2016-08-23 12:48:59,"Firstly, a foreward: It's been a long road leading me to type this right now. If you've ever heard of Brene Brown, you'll know where I'm coming from. She's the researcher on shame, guilt, fear, vulnerability. I suffer from severe PTSD. She preaches that in order to overcome shame, we must own our story. It was only recently I realized I even felt ashamed. But I'm deeply, deeply ashamed. So ashamed, I can't speak of this to anyone I know personally. So off my chest is goes, and I tell my story. For the first time, for no other point than to tell it. Here goes. Hi reddit, I'm a 25 year old UX designer (I make websites pretty). I'm a single mother to a 4 year old boy. He rocks. He's my whole world. I live in a nice city, a small one. I grew up in los angeles. I lived there for 20 years. Actually, I came here in the first place because I fled. I fled my abuser, my home, my friends. You see after a while, they all become one. So inextricably intertwined. I couldn't tell one from the other, my face from my nose. I ran. I was forced. I was kidnapped. I left. These are all true, it just depends how you want to look at it. You see when I was 17 I met a guy. Not a nice guy necessarily, but a really really cool guy. He was so handsome. He had the dopest tattoos. He had a new york accent. He was so...different. Exactly what I was looking for. And he liked me too! Oh how he liked me. After we were dating, things were fine for about a month. He was controlling and jealous, but not enough to break up over. Just enough to barely blip on my radar. Then one day, we were having friends over. You see we lived in the place to live. If this was NY, imagine we lived in the center of times square. People came up to party with us all the time. Strangers, randoms, all was welcome. So one night we have people over, one friend of mine and some randoms/acquaintances. One random guy is super nice, he's a cop (I confirmed, he was off-duty). He tells me he's rolling. I offer to give him a massage, because I used to take ecstasy too and I know how nice it is. I ask my bf for permission first, he says go ahead. At some point the guy put his head in my lap. My bf walked over and slapped me. He doesn't deserve privacy, I'm going to call him by his name. His name was Chase. At least that's what he went by. It was his middle name, really his first name was Connor. He just slapped me right in the fucking face. I was appalled, in shock, and everybody silently left. Everybody, silently, left. When I type that I feel hot knives searing my stomach. Fuck you guys. They were all men. All much bigger and braver than I was. I remember the cop saying ""I feel like I should leave you guys alone now.."" and that was it. They left. And I stayed. I stayed. It was a light slap after all. It didn't hurt. It just surprised me. I guess I'd crossed a line that I never saw drawn in the sand. Of course I shouldn't have done that. What woman in her right mind would've let that guy put his head in my lap? I was acting afool. I was lowering myself. He was just lifting me up to the standards I should be holding myself too. Plus, he apologized. He was deeply sorry that he lost his temper. I mean, I'm not perfect? How can he be? Plus his slap didn't even hurt. It's not like I'm a battered woman. It's not like I could possibly ever become that. I'm at no risk. I forgave a one time mistake and that's it. It ever happens again and I'm leaving you. You bet your ass I'm leaving you. And it didn't happen again for a long time. But I just kept fucking up. I didn't know what was wrong with me, but I just kept fucking up. I was getting reminders. I looked at the delivery guy too long when he brought our pizza. My old guy friend texted me to see how I was doing. I exchanged pleasantries with our doorman. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was really fucking up. He told me all about it afterwards. I didn't realize how I was disrespecting him, but the way I talked to other guys made them think I was into them you see? They all thought I liked them! And the ones that liked me, well that was because I made them think that. Even if I said nothing, I looked like a ""w**re"" so they thought I was easy. It's funny, they never liked me because I was smart, funny, pretty, or interesting. But only because I looked easy. I took note and changed the way I dressed. Started averting my eyes. I stared at my shoes. I forgot people's names. There's no point when they're all the same. You see to him I was the tornado. He was the volcano. Yeah -- he loved that song. I started to learn my lessons. I grew to adapt. I was a chameleon in a chameleon's world. I learned my place. I looked down. I spoke when spoken to. I knew the look. The look that said it all. The look that chills me to my bones as I type this. But then came the big day. The one you're probably reading this for. The ""juicy bits."" It was August 6th of 2010. (My son was born on this exact day 2 years later.) He bought pills that day - xanax. 2 mg. I remember. He took a lot. I took a few too. We sat by the pool at our apartment complex, in sweltering heat, our shirts sticking to our skin. We made plans for the day, for the evening, everything seemed so bright. My memory is spotty here, so bare with me please. At some point, we argued about something. He demanded we go up to my room. I refused, I stayed behind with friends. I took a stand. Finally. You could see the pool from my room, and vice versa. He stormed up. I could see him watching me. I watched the lights flicker on and off - you see it was night, so he could only see me with the lights off. Eventually I say, hey I'll go up, I'll see what's wrong. I go up and he's dranken a fifth of vodka to himself. He seems passed out on the couch. I go near to see if he's okay, and he bursts up, pointing a knife at me. I don't remember what he said. But it was scary enough that I backed out the door, and ran to the elevator. He caught up with me. He was bigger, taller, faster, stronger. I frantically pushed the down button. I punched that button with all my might. He made it first. I felt a sharp blow to my upper thigh and I was on the floor. Then my keys flew into the wall, lodging just above my eye, sticking straight out. I grasped my leg, already bruising, and tried to get to my feet. He kicked me. He fucking kicked me with all his force. I ran back into the apartment. I grabbed a kitchen knife. I remember saying ""You think you're the only one that can pull a knife?"" I don't remember what he said. Next I remember trying to flee the apartment. He grabbed me so hard, caught my clothes that he tore them clean off me. I didn't even think that was possible. At some point I made it downstairs and ran to a friend's apartment. From there I ran to the apartment complex across the street. Our weed dealer lived there. I trusted him. He saw how fucked up I was. I was crying and my nose was bleeding. I had a black eye too. The first words out of his mouth will be burned into my memory forever. He said ""Alice...I've wanted you from the moment I saw you."" I said ""Chase beat me"" and he ushered me to his bed ready to tuck me in and comfort me. He gave me a pill to help me feel better. The next thing I remember is waking up and he's trying to have sex with me. He's trying to shove it in, I have my legs shut tight. I'm resisting, so, so hard. I'm crying no. The next thing I remember he is getting up to throw away the condom. He carries me home. Lays me down in my bed. Chase bursts out from the bathroom (he was hiding in there, why? only makes sense to him I'm sure). He grabbed my bong and smashed it. And then he walked over and punched me in the head as hard as he could (he admitted that later). I saw stars, colors, heard noises, and I was out. When I woke up Alex (dealer) was gone. It must've just been a few minutes. He threw me out of the bed. He choked me up against the wall. He punched me in the face. Over and over. I was crawling. Trying to get away. He grabbed two butcher knives. He cut my throat with one, the other he poked at my stomach, stabbing at my flesh. I screamed as loud as I could. I cried for my mommy, my daddy, the police, god. I was about to die and I knew it. I keep crawling. Finally I'm making some progress. I've reached the door. Thank fucking god. If I can just reach the handle. But he's back again. And I feel a blow to my head so hard I think my brain is leaking out. He kicked my head. He's kicking my head. Over and over. Against the bathroom door frame. My cheek is broken, I can feel it. My brain is swelling, I swear I can feel it. And I'll never get away. Then he does the unthinkable. Yanks my dress up and starts jamming his fingers into me while screaming ""is this what alex did to you is this what you want you fucking slut."" I guess Alex told him we had sex. They fucking smoked a cigarette together before abusing me. Alex saw him punch me. He fucking left. A rapist and a coward. The last thing I remember is my head getting kicked in. The next thing I remember is waking up the next morning with 12 officers at my door. They arrest him. I look in the mirror. I look like an alien. I collapse. I have no memory. They take me to the hospital. I have severe concussions. Fractures. My throat was slit. I look like I'm already dead. He's arraigned. Sometimes I feel like I forgive you Chase, and sometimes I feel like strangling you slowly while watching the life calmly leave your eyes and furiously masturbating to the sight of it. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry I just can't anymore. If anyone reads this, I can tell the rest of the story tomorrow. But not tonight. Not tonight. Anyone going through the same thing I know you feel the same way, but you're NOT alone and you ARE strong and capable and beautiful. Please, if you're in need, reach out to me and I'll be here night and day for you. It only gets worse my babies. I doubt anyone read this, but if you did, you're a trooper, thanks for hearing my story."

With a tight chest and a heavy heart I slip into a trance. I'm enraptured. The world fades out around me as I loose myself in fabricated longing. This fragile state of ecstasy is simultaneously real and contrived. The emotions I feel are concrete but their source is so far away that it may as well be imaginary. My senses are assaulted by vivid memories that wash over me before disappearing as quickly as they came, like waves breaking on the seashore. The intoxicating warmth of familiar skin smells so sweet. I can feel soft hands on my cheeks as her body presses up against mine. I hear a voice that sounds like home. These fleeting sensations are a refuge from the loneliness that often defines my life. But my access to them is limited and beyond my control. The feelings I'm still addicted to after years of separation from them are just a perversion. My mind constructs a corrupted vision of the deepest connection between two people. It's a mere shell of an idea, so hollow that it collapses in on itself under the weight of the emotions it conjures up: intense longing, exhausting serenity, and the bittersweet melancholy of vulnerability. There is no correlation between how badly I want this and when it will happen again. Furthermore, I imagine that that the next love I find will be vastly different than that which I experienced when I was younger. I was so oblivious then. Infatuation was the order of the day and I was fixated on the body. Now though I crave the mind more than anything else. Comparatively speaking, the body is merely an accessory we carry with us through life. It's something we can shape and mold to our liking, to an extent, but it does not define us like our thoughts do. What a beautiful thing it is to share a deep connection with someone. I'm in awe of the unique way humans fall for each other. It is this that I want more than anything else. "
662,vulnerability,offmychest,"This cant be normal, what can i do",1,4w9ro4,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4w9ro4/this_cant_be_normal_what_can_i_do/,2016-08-05 20:33:12,"My mother immigrated to Canada as a teenager, she did not speak a word of english and was abused by her uncle who was the only person she knew when she was forced to move after her mom died. She had an incredibly hard time at her uncle's house, and when she met my dad he offered her an opportunity to escape what she was going through. After he convinced my mom to cut ties with what little family she had, he took advantage of her vulnerability and made her life a living hell, he abused her as he pleased and threatened to put her out on the street if she tried to fight back, this was over 20 years ago and before information and resources were so widely available online, even if they were she was a broke teenager who soon became pregnant, with me. I spent the first 5 years of my life in and out of shelters with my mom, i would wake up at different stranger's houses on the floor while my mom was out and tried to provide for us, some days we could eat, some days we didnt After a bitter custody battle, my mom wanted to go back to her home country and take me with her. I dont know all the details but my dad somehow legally barred my mom from leaving the country with me, she ended up going and i was left with my alcoholic criminal father For another 2 years i slept on random floors and couches, it's all mostly a blur to be honest, i dont remember many specifics and this scares me because i do have some memories from my early years in school but none of my home life, i must have forced myself to forget, but I'll never forget the dread i felt when the schoool bell rang at the end of the day Fast forward a few years, my mom marries an ex military man from her home country, and i start living with them. The first time i meet this man he tells me that he sees the devil in me and he will straighten me out, if its the last thing he does. His warmups to beating me up were always along the lines of im not afraid to kill you, im not afraid of going to jail, who""s going to believe a bratty little kid like you. As my step fathers abuse went on, he truly convinced me and my mother that i was a vile child and slowly more and more she would take his side and stop defending me, soon she was as terrible to me as he was, it was like she completely forgot that i was her daughter, they treated me worse than a dog. It was odd, it felt like their love for each other fed off of this weird hatred and sense of disgust they had for me and my biological dad, this hate spread through both sides of my family, everyone in my family was very harsh with me and proud of it as they somehow felt that they could beat the sin out of me. That sin being born out of wedlock which i had no control over. My step dad would use military tactics to discipline me for the smallest things, i remember once i got the beating of a life time for whistling while i was cleaning a shoe closet (my grade 3 teacher earlier that day was teaching us how to whistle, she said the 1st person who could whistle out this whole song would get a prize or a sticker or something like that), he felt like it was disrespectful to whsitle in front of adults, before he beat me i told him i didnt know that, i tried to explain i couldnt have known, i said something along the lines of i cant read minds and he absolutely lost his mind. That nught he beat the crap out of me and made me sit on my knees for hours over salt he spread on the floor, it was very painfull he did this a lot. School was the only escape i had from this terrible life i was living, i never wanted to go home. I remeber once i was vrying after i had beaten and i said i wished i could just stay at school, my parents list it and decided to beat me again. As the years went on, i speny most of my time grounded, when i started getting invited out to birthday parties and slumber parties, my parents said they would beat me for even asking but sometimes i did try, once i got this sweet strawberry schort cake invitiation card and they laughed and ripped up in front of me and made me clean it up, i dont know why but this made me hysterical. These 2 particuly enjoyed finding out what i liked so they could breeak or destroy it in front of me, i dont know how they could have been so cruel. Now that im older i remeber my step dad had this huge grudge against me for drawing in this bible he had, i dont even remeber doing it but he would show it to me every now and then and talk about how terrible i was for doing that, i wonder if it might have been related? Mind you this is still all before high school, some of my favourite things they destroyed - once i found an awesome box of amazing books and i was consuming them like crazy (still think those books were awesoem), my parents noticed and decided the books were fake idols and threw them away. Once they stole my diary, i got in trouble for a bunch of stuff i wrote in it, some of it was about boys that i liked (this was around grade 5), they made me hold up most of my favourite clothees while they cut through them with this huge knife, sucha crazy scene, i feel liek it was almost barbaric. Anyways most of elementary school went on like this, one of my teachers who i really likef and she cared aboht me, called child protective services once because i would get to school crying a lot (my parents would beat me if i refused to wear what they wanted in the morning tried to change or really do anything that they didnt like), my whole life i had been threatened not to talk to anyone about what hoes on at home because that was supposed to be private. A made the huge mistake of beginning to tell child protective services the truth but i backed out and they were no longer looking at remiving me from the home, but from what little i haf told (instantly regretted by the way) they reccomended family counselling. I remeber after they left my house for the first time, my parents just looked at me with the most hateful dead eyes ever. After that for a while they refused to serve me dinner, i would have to wait until everyone went to bed to take my food, or i would fix myself a plate and eat on the stairs because i wasnt allowed to eat in my room. Anyways fast forward a bit, my first year of high school came around, and again i would ask to go see friends i was never allowed to so i would try my hardest to stay a few minutes after school to hang out with the other kids, this wouod infuriate my parents, once i went to grab a burger after school after being invited by friends i stayed out until sunset, i went into total rebel mode, they kicked me out. They sent me to live with my aunt on the other side of the continent, they advised her not to let me out or to let me have a cell phone, i wasnt enrolled in school for a year and stayed home to babysit her kids. It was mentally devastating for a 14 year old, she was very abusive to me and her kids as well. She would have all kinds of men over in the evening, and when she wasnt around many of them would make advances on me, i was only 15, i was made to do some terrible things that i can never forget unfortunately, it haunts me every day. Over time my aunt told everyone that i was a no good little s**** and accused me of lying about the abuse, once she even forced me to talk on the phone with one of the men and apologise for lying (i never lied about any of it) everyone just continued to hate me more and more, its crazy i had never actually even had any kind of consetual sexual experience at that age, not even a kiss from a boy my age but i was labeled a s*** in my family and i still am for things that were forced on me. Anyways fast.forward through high school i i was very motivated to get as far away from my family as possible, i got an impressive job for my age i was vey proud of myself and thought that i would finally be free, i dreamed aboht moving to Australia for no reason at all it just seemed beautiful and very far away. At 17 i got into my first relationship, he really enjoyed hurting me during sex thats what he liked, and all i cared about was having someone take me away from my parents house so i whatever he said. He said humiliating me turned him on, and letting him hit me was hot. We dated like this for almist 4 years, one night we got into an argument and i slapped him, he called the police and told them i abused him, i was beyond shocked. I am not a violent person at all, everything ive been through majes it really really difficulty for me to cause other people harm intentionally, i know how much it can hurt. Anyways he spreads this story among his whole churchgoing family he basically spreads it to everyone, even the people who i thought were my friends he managed to convince. I have always been a quiete person who keeps to myself, i gues i didnt realize he just had a stronger relationship with a lot of the people, while i was just at work all the time or cooking and cleaning for him Ok so all this happens, i live at my step brothers house for a while and finally feel like im getting my shit together, i got a new better job somehow, i got a nice apartment im doing my thing even though i have a lot of pain im working through it and trying to be a professioal, work is my life i dont go out much but one night i decide to go to this party So my supposed friends leave me black out drunj at some guys house who i dont even know, i was so drunk i dont quite remeber what happened 2 months later i find out im pregnant, i havent been sleeping around so i know its from that night, i tell my supposed friends and i tell the guy, i want to keep it. For some reason whrn i found out, it was one of the happiest moments of my life, i felt like i could give the baby a better life than i had, i loved this baby like nothing else before it was amazing, i was prepared to keep it even if i had to raise it by myself, i haf never been so happy on my life. Anyways this guy is totally against baby, i have just a few friends, the ones who introduced me to him and of course tjeres no way anyone in my family would be happy about the sitiation or the circumstances, the girl that i thoight was my best friend and the guy keep telling me that i need to have an abortion and that what im doing is wrong, believe me i fought hard but i guess my low self esteem and everything ive been through made me so weak i ended up giving in. This was the worst decision of my life i cry about it every night. Not long after the procedure they both viciously start hating me and talking about how it was wrong and i can never take it back, i already realized when it was too late but they made me feel a lot worse. So i ve lost my baby no friends no one to turn to, i try to get back up again. A few weeks ago my bank account got emptied out by these 2 guys who i also thought were my friends, im so naive it took me over a week to fogure out that anything was wrong. Bank refuses to reimburse me because they were my supposed friends, my rent money is gone, all of my paycheque from my 2 jobs is gone. Police say they cant help me. Now here i am so depressed, i got fired because i couldnt cope with everything that has happened from a job i loved. The past few years have been incredible i feel like this all too much for one heart to handle, i need out life has been nothing but harsh to me, i cant catch a breath, i dont even see any point in fighting anymore eapecially since losing the baby, i cry every morning and every night, i cant leave my house because sometimes i cant stop crying and im so embaressed i cant tell anyone about everything that has happened to me. Everyone hates me and betrays me i wish i knew why. Anyways here i am now, my landlord is expecting my rent payment tomorrow (in a few hours its 3am), i have 0$ in my bank accout and have been living off a bag of rice that i will finish tomorrow. im so sad, its all so much i dont think i can get over it anymore. i love my apartment so much and have worked so hard for it but now there is nothing more i can do, i miss my baby, i wish my ex didnt hate me so much, i wish everyone would stop hating me and give me a chance to breathe and live like everyone else. i just dont know I am so sad, i cant do this anymore, i dont think everything is supposed to be so hard? I dont think normal people have endured so much hate? I dont know if anyone can relate And believe it or not there is so much more that ive left out Sn: also i thought about getting income assistance but my wallet recently got stolen with all my id, i have no passport i have no birth certificate my aunt wouldnt give these back when i left her house."

It's not even the regular ""I just don't like her, she tries to insult me"", it's the fact that she treats her kids like shit. My boyfriend and I talk about getting married a lot. And it's been more than 3 1/2 years. I straight up told him ""I don't want your mother at our wedding"" and he still feels iffy about that...which is weird, considering all the abuse she put him and her daughter (25f?) through. She almost killed him once, when he was a kid. Knocked him out cold and bleeding and never even took him to the hospital...just walked away. He told her secrets and she never even believed him...secrets I'm not even going to specify. She told him she wishes he never existed. Everytime my boyfriend tried to bring up the attempted murder (in a semi-humorous way to avoid sounding vulnerable) she just laughs about it. But today, he finally called her out on it with seriousness and vulnerability. And you know what she said? ""GET OVER IT. I was abused, too."" I'm so glad my boyfriend and I don't want kids (which she still doesn't take seriously). What the fuck are we going to give her grandkids for, so she can knock them out too? I don't even trust her around my nieces and nephews. But yeah, man. Horrible fucking person. Do NOT want her at our wedding, I'm not kidding. To the point where I would rather sacrifice inviting everyone else if I have to, because my boyfriend brought up the idea of just having a nice wedding with just the two of us. I try to invite him and his sister to my family's house more to get away from her, but they don't seem like they want the help a lot of the time (which I understand for the most part because my 4 nieces and nephews live here and it can get chaotic). My mother never even liked her, though. She always had an eye on his mom, for good reason. I just hate when my boyfriend, his sister, or whoever tries to cover it up a bit saying ""she's mentally ill."" Many people are mentally ill and are still able to...idk NOT abuse their children? They have permanent trauma because of the way she blamed them as little kids for her relationship problems, financial problems, etc. And my boyfriend has a permanent bump on his head from the hit. How the fuck are you going to knock your child out cold with a broomstick, clean up the blood around his unconscious body, and walk away? It's not your kids' fault that you made the wrong choices, got married and had kids early in a relationship and now regret it, never have any sex whether your husband is there or not. And the fact that her husband, my boyfriend's own FATHER, told her he was tired of her shit and didn't have much of a problem moving to Jersey (for medical reasons though, but still!!! You know how a lot of men, a lot of HUMANS are about sex??? The fact that he didn't have a problem leaving...obviously that vag is defective) My boyfriend and his sister, my friend, deserve better than that. That is not a mother. That's not how you raise your kids at all. I don't give half of a fuck what she says about me. Please. The problem is what she says and does to her kids, the people I care about, on a constant basis. The problem is seeing the damage permanently instilled into their minds. They told me when they first met my family (and his sister's boyfriend's family) they felt so weird, because they never saw a family genuinely love each other and have a bond and...be close to each other, you know? And that says something. I know we are all adults and in our 20s now. But I want them to be close to my parents. I want them to see what a real family is like. As for the future mom-in-law, I just hope she dies soon."
664,vulnerability,offmychest,I [31/m] have been self-destructive since my father passed away and was caught cheating by my gf [30/f] with another woman [29/f],1,4xa4bs,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4xa4bs/i_31m_have_been_selfdestructive_since_my_father/,2016-08-12 06:28:11,"Where to begin. About 1.5 years ago, I had a string of bad events crush my world. In a span of 3 months, my long term gf kicked me out, my father passed away, my dog died, a girl I was rebounding with got pregnant and we got an abortion, and I took on a job so stressful that the attrition rate in the first 6 months is over 50%. That all happened between March - June 2015. Sounds like bad fiction right? No, it actually happened to me and left a lasting impression. During the wake, I had to drive to a nearby motel room where the rebound girl was holed up just before the abortion, where she would lambast me for putting her through the experience. To top it off, my sister's outlet for our father passing was to lash out at me verbally about anything in my life she didn't agree with. I was literally sleeping 4 hours a night if I was lucky and having horrible night sweats. So to say I was in a dark place by October '15 would be an understatement. I was alone, living at home with a reeling mother, working a thankless job that could only be described as ""abusive"". That's when I met L. We connected via hinge and went on a date. There was a connection and we even kissed on the first date but I never intended to call her back for a second date. I was going through too much drama and a good chunk of it was female based. About a week later, she texted me stating she thought we had made a connection and was hurt when I didnt follow up. Needless to say, I responded and we started dating. I was in such a weird place when we started the courtship. I wanted intimate contact but no emotional connection as it was a sign of vulnerability and exposure to possibly more pain. I was at my limit on pain and just didn't want to experience anymore, so I kept her arms length. The strain this caused her was apparent and we probably almost broke up several times. Eventually, I was able to switch jobs (much better) and started being more emotionally open. She reciprocated and the relationship flourished. We had great sexual chemistry, laughed at the others humor, and generally got along great. As the feelings started to brew, I got scared. I was vulnerable again. I couldn't deal with more pain. But I didn't want to break up with her, so I made a worse decision, and started a secret relationship with another girl. S [29/f] was smart and pretty, and had many qualities that I liked. But I could tell that she and I would never have long term potential, it was simply my mechanism for shielding myself from getting a higher emotional attachment to L. The secret relationship started in April '16 and progressed slowly. L and I were far more compatible, had way better sex, and complimented each others personalities greatly. S was recently out of a long-term relationship and more interested in a non-serious relationship anyway. This is how things were until early June. I was still getting attached to L and was scared to emotionally commit, so I broke it off with her. She was devastated but the break lasted 1 week as I missed her and wanted to see her constantly. I was emotionally vested and wanted to see her. So I came back and we made up. At this point, I should of called it off with S and but instead of a clean break, I started acting distant. She didnt seem to mind and our interactions became far less frequent. Then another twist happened. I lost my new job (early July) after a new manager decided to move my position to another country. I was dumbfounded and squashed. L was supportive and helped a great deal. I was really connecting with her and had strong feelings for her. I felt nothing for S. But then L and I had a couple small fights where-in she suggested I need to focus on myself, get a new job, and potentially do it without her support as she feels I am getting comfortable. I agree but also worry that this means she is looking for the door. I immediately text S. L reads through my texts via a smartwatch I forgot at her place and she confronts me via text. I cop to the whole thing and she calls me a sociopath. She blocks my phone # and says she never wants to talk to me again; that I am the worst person she has ever met. That happened 3 days ago. I miss her terribly. I'm ashamed, guilty, remorseful, and feel hopeless about life. I should be focusing on rebuilding myself and getting back on the horse. Instead, I am wallowing at home, not eating or sleeping well, wishing I had been a better person, with her. This is the makings of a greek tragedy: the steps I took to eliminate the potential for feeling pain via rejection were the necessary ones to cause the rejection and did not dull the pain of loss anyways. It is tragically hilarious. I love L but ruined it. I expressed the actions of a damaged person and it blew up in my face. That's my story. P.S. I am toying with writing a letter of catharsis and love but these never work and she is steadfast in her perception of me. "
665,vulnerability,offmychest,Midnight musings about why I've been down for the past couple of months. Spoiler: it's me.,1,4xxrp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4xxrp7/midnight_musings_about_why_ive_been_down_for_the/,2016-08-16 14:40:54,"Hi Reddit, Sorry for the wall of text, here goes: I'm posting for therapeutic reasons. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this, so you guys get to be on the receiving end of my whining. Here's a little background: I've always had problems opening myself up to others, and with my self esteem. Since I was a kid, I've hidden anything that could make me appear to be weak. I never cried in front of people, I never laughed or showed too much excitement, I never showed when I was in pain, or indicated that I needed or wanted validation from anyone, even the people that I loved. I was so cold. People were actually kind of scared of me. This is how it was from the time that I was very young. Anyway, fast forward to 19. This is when I first met my husband. I was interviewing for my first big girl job. Basically, it was a hybrid customer service/front end web development job, but that's beside the point. Anyway, the opportunity couldn't have come at a worse time. The day before, I had just gotten all my wisdom teeth pulled, and I was nowhere near ready to be interviewing for something outside of retail. I was a stuttering, painkiller dazed mess, but for some divine reason, this guy saw potential in me, and I got the job. Of course, we weren't romantic at first, but from the moment I met him he was a safe place. I was way out of my depths and by far the youngest person on the team, but I never hesitated whatsoever to ask him questions. It doesn't sound like much, but for me that was a huge deal. Our business relationship grew into a personal one from there. The catalyst being that we started going out after work as a group and drinking together. Being a newly minted adult, I naturally gravitated toward the guy who made me feel safe and like 'not an idiot'. He's a great storyteller and conversationalist, which made it even easier to talk to him. It's funny, I don't even know if I've told him that hearing that he was going out was the only reason I even finally accepted the invitation that my coworkers had been extending since I started. I didn't realize how enraptured I was by him at the time. Well, it turned out we had enough in common for these outings to become regular, and then eventually romantic. Let me tell you, those first months were filled with so much passion and lust that it still makes my heart race to think about it. Of course, as most relationships do, ours calmed down after a while, and grew from lust and passion to deep, true and honest love for one another. So fast forwarding again, that all happened 5 years ago, and now we're married with our first child on the way, a baby girl. That love is still there, and has only grown. Seriously, I can't even put into words how much I love this man. Every time I stop and look at our lives, or feel our daughter moving inside me, I wonder what I ever did to deserve such a wonderful life. He's done so much for me over the years, he's grown so much as a person, and helped me to grow as well. This is where the whining comes in. Remember the part of this post that was describing the cold, dead person I used to be? Yeah, I'm not that person anymore. I still struggle with letting myself show emotion and vulnerability to others, but with my husband I'm completely myself. He effortlessly obliterated every wall that I had up before I met him. It's the most freeing and terrifying thing. Well, here is where the issues that I needed to get off my chest come in, apparently I'm not that great at signaling to my husband that I desire him...you know, intimately. Because of this, he completely misses my cues and it leaves me feeling so emotionally distraught. We've talked about this many times over, but it's always just me complaining about his lack of attention to these things, and the fact that he never initiates anything with me. I complain that it makes me feel worthless. I complain that I want things to be like they were when we first got together. I complain and he listens. Then when I'm done, it happens. The look of sincere sadness and remorse. ""Honey, tell me what to do and I'll do it. I love you more than anything. I don't want you to ever think anything different. he says. Tonight we had the conversation again, but this time I realized something when he asked me what to do. I admitted to myself and to him that I don't actually know what I want. I realized that I'm being unfair to him. I'm relying on him to make me feel beautiful and valuable in a way that he can't. I realized that it doesn't matter that he kisses me in the morning and tells me how much he loves me, or that he randomly stops what he's doing in the middle of the day to tell me I'm beautiful and he's happy that I'm his wife. The truth is that yeah, we don't have sex or make out as often as I'd like, but that issue is completely separate from the one that I'm projecting onto him. The insecurities of my past, the fear of being broken down because I've exposed myself are what's really at play here. I'm being unfair by putting that pressure onto him. He builds me up so much, but no matter what he does, he can't make me love myself. I need to do that. I need to see the beautiful woman in the mirror. I need to value my thoughts and see my worth. I think this is the first step for me to get back to the place I was in when he started breaking down those walls. In the past few months I've freaked out looking at all the rubble and started trying to rebuild them. That's not the answer. The answer is to face the person in the mirror, to start telling her to shut the hell up with all the negativity and start talking about how much she is worth and how much she loves herself. Hes laying here snoring next to me while I write this. His foot touching mine and his hand on my arm. He always needs to be touching some way when he sleeps. How could I ever doubt his love for me? No, we're just fine. I need to remember that the little voice in my head telling there's something wrong with me is the enemy here. I have a feeling all the other minor problems I've created in my head will resolve themselves, and if they don't, I'll still have a partner who is willing to move mountains to make me happy and an inner voice that doesn't try to break me down all the time. Thanks for reading my midnight ravings, this really helped. Tl,dr: wah wah wah, love yourself you dumbass... I mean you beautiful, strong woman."
666,vulnerability,offmychest,A non-comprehensive list of sexual activity with my ex that I didn't consent to:,5,4ygrm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4ygrm0/a_noncomprehensive_list_of_sexual_activity_with/,2016-08-19 13:53:53,"Each of these he either knew I wasn't into, or never even tried to establish if I wanted to do them before he did them anyway. * Extremely early in our relationship, he noticed I wasn't receptive to his advances (which were way too much for a meek 17 year old girl like me). He made me feel like I had to have a reason, so I told him about some childhood trauma that made me reluctant towards anything sexual (which was true and a reason, I guess), and he said OK. He never brought that up again for a year and still did the rest of the I'm about to detail anyway, knowing my vulnerability. * The day we first tripped in the park, he tried to finger me through my jeans on a bench in public. * Early on one of our first dates, he desperately made us make out in a bush with him on top of me, grinding into me. * Again much too early, the first time I sucked his dick he knew I didn't want to. He pushed me further and further down his body while we were making out and I resisted until I felt too much pressure and gave in. He later bragged to our friends about coercing me into it. Our first argument was me being angry at him for telling our friends because I wanted no one to know we had fooled around. He apologised and then afterwards made me feel bad for starting an argument, because he was ""in such a good mood before."" * Endless times he guilted or manipulated me into sucking his dick * The first and only time I ever had a free house for him to come over, I was excited to hang out with him. Instead he was miserable for an hour after I had said I didn't want to fool about. I gave in and felt so disgusting after he left I showered 4 times in one evening. * Going for a walk to get some chips during lunch and hating every second of the walk back as he made us stop every 100m to make out, to 'be romantic'. I know he could tell I was not into this. * Him forcing his hand down my pants for the first time after me saying NO so many times. * He begged me for months to let him lick me out until I reluctantly agreed. I wish I hadn't. * We got a hotel room once before we had gone all the way. We really got the hotel room to get high off shrooms and have a place to stay. I had made it clear beforehand we weren't going to have sex. He got condoms anyway and sulked when he realised we REALLY weren't gonna have sex. * The BEGGING to fuck me in general. He begged every day for half a year for us to go all the way. Thankfully the first time we had sex was when I wanted to. * Aggressively groping me in public. Later in our relationship: * Me: ""The way you'd make me suck your dick early in our relationship was not alright."" No significant response until ""Uh.. what.. you want me to apologise for the dick sucking thing then? FINE. Sorry. Are you happy now?"" * When that guy groped me at a concert, I told him I didn't feel comfortable having sex for a while because I felt violated. He asked for sex anyway, I gave in, I started crying half way through. He carried on fucking me for a full minute before he stopped. Then he felt like shit for being a bad boyfriend and carrying on after he noticed I was crying, and it was ME who had to reassure HIM and make him feel better. There's more but I'm leaving it there. I guess I wrote this list because I was too inexperienced to realise at the time that what was happening was not OK. Most of these things happened in the first half of our relationship, though some like the begging or the sulking never stopped. As our relationship progressed I slowly started to like him more and things slowly become more consensual. We were together for two years. I look back with so much anger that these things happened, that I let them happen, that I didn't have enough respect for myself to dump his ass. Instead the 17 year old me was happy someone was showing attention her attention, even the kind of attention she knew she didn't want. Much later in our relationship he grew as a person and apologised for the mistakes he made and I know he feels guilty. Multiple times he was the one first crying about ever hurting me like that, and I was one the having to tell him it's ok. At the time I was in love with the person he had become and ignored the person he once was. But the damage is done and now, after ending our relationship, I'm so angry. I'm angry for every time he invalidated me, I'm angry he took advantage of me, I'm angry for every time I thought that this is what a relationship had to be like, I'm angry that he turned almost every one of my 'firsts' into something I reluctantly agreed to (and in some cases didn't even agree to) instead of something I WANTED. I hate him and I hate every single person I know who respects him. He's successful and well liked. And so disgusting. It keeps me up at night because I can barely calm myself down when I think about it. Right now I want to punch a wall. Thank you if you've read this far, I've never shared this with anyone before."

We talked about moving in together, our plans for the future, he said on more than one occasion he wanted to marry me. Out of the blue last week he said he was breaking up with me -- we've talked and we've talked and we've talked, the conclusion is that life just sin't working for us right now. He works two jobs and lives nearly an hour away. He also has a drinking and substance issue (as do I) and it didn't help things. He said he was afraid of a downward spiral and totally losing everything. So it's over. I went to his house this weekend to drop off his belongings and to pick up mine that he had, afterwards I went berserk and yelled at him through text. He said he hadn't been talking to me because he was trying not to think about the breakup and he also said he didn't stop loving me and wanted to start over but didn't know how. I said I'd do anything, he said he just didn't know. I love yous and I care about yous have been exchanged multiple times since the breakup. He said he'd always be there for me, and maybe once things settle down we can try again in the future. Throughout this time I'd been having some bleeding and cramps, I thought I was having a stress period (though because of the type of BC I'm on typically I don't get periods) but yesterday it was horrific and I was bleeding really heavily, so I went to the Dr to get some progesterone (tldr I get Hell periods that last a month so I get progesterone tablets to stop them so I can function.) She said my symptoms seemed more like a miscarriage, went to the hospital and confirmed everything with a blood test and ultrasound. I was only a few weeks along, but I'm still reeling: How did this happen? I was on the pill and he pulled out, though admittedly with our 'activities' sloppiness occasionally did occur. I didn't even know I was pregnant. I'm also very childfree, and if I had known I was pregnant during the relationship I would have aborted it ASAP and he would have supported me but for some reason I feel really fucked up by this. Having a baby is definitely not the better alternative but I feel so devastated. I haven't told him. When I was in the hospital I texted him, but he never responded -- but to be fair, all I texted him was ""hey"" and left it at that when he didnt answer. What was I supposed to do? Beg him? dump everything on him right then and there? I wanted him to know, but on the advice of my friends, reddit, various advice forums, the safer route seemed to be to not tell him it happened. So... I haven't told him. Granted, it's been a day, but I haven't told him. However, I did tell one of my closest friends in confidence, because I needed advice on how to handle it. He told his girlfriend, who claims to be a psychic, and she messaged me saying that the fetus was contacting her. And me, in my stupid fucked up emotional state, went along with it. I needed any sort of reprieve. She told me I would have named it Alan* (not his real name) and I told her I don't like the name Alan* and besides it's the name of a mutual friend of ours so it was weird, that's when she began to talk about how the fetus loves Alan* and that I would have named the potential baby after Alan* and how Alan* and I should get together, which is all bullshit because I honestly don't even really like Alan* (I can only handle him in small doses and definitely not one-on-one) and it fucking hit me that she was preying on my vulnerability. I feel so goddamn stupid. How could I fall for something like that? On top of everything already happening I'm seething that this new dollop of bullshit got added to the pile. I want to tell my ex everything. Not because I think it'll make him get back together with me, but because I feel like I really need to tell him. I feel like it's not my right to withhold this from him and I feel like he's the only one who could support me through this, given how shitty my ""Friends"" were about it (I don't really have any family support and I won't see my therapist until later in the month) and I need someone who understands my grief. Which I don't even understand because I don't want kids, being pregnant/having a baby right now would have been terrible, and I don't want kids in the future, but I still just feel so empty. I'm scared if I do tell him, he might think it's a ploy for sympathy/to get back together with him, he might go into a downward spiral, he might think I'm lying (he had an ex who lied about a miscarriage) and I'm trying to do no contact. I don't know what to do about this. I feel like I'm being pulled apart in so many different directions. I want him back, but not like this. I just need a friend right now. Advice on handling this is appreciated. edited for grammar/details"

We recently moved in together when he took a job cross-country. We have been engaging in conversations about our future lately and what it may look like. I have serious trust issues which I've tried to communicate openly. I know that I need more reassurance but asking for it is very difficult. He has openly admitted he thinks it's unrealistic to believe he won't be attracted to another person ever again. He cannot tell me he'll love me forever because he can not scientifically prove it. He can not tell me we'll be together forever for the same reason. When I told him I felt that he seemed unaffected by me he replied ""well I am"" and then he proceeded to tell me he simply didn't feel as intensely about me as I do about him. He is an honest man. When he tells me he loves me I know he means it, however that love seems to be limited to either A. what he'll allow himself to feel or B. what he is capable of feeling towards me. I feel so sad. I don't know how to continue giving so openly. I want to, but to what degree do I allow myself to hurt knowing he doesn't feel the same way? I believe in spiritual love. I believe in more than chemical reactions in the brain. I don't know how to open the dialogue that I love him but I need more without sounding contradictory. I watched two people exchange vows this evening, true vows! not fluffy pinteresty vows, but realy life ""hey, when life gets real I'll be here"" vows and it breaks my heart to know I may never be able to share in the exchange of that type of promise with the person I love so dearly. I have tried talking to my friends about it, but they don't know him like I do. They just see the scientific mind. They joke that I'm dating a robot. His friends have told me in the past how lucky he is to have someone like me in his life, that he can be difficult. His family has told me I'm a strong and patient woman. I don't know what to do or who to turn to. I feel so alone in my own home. I never thought I'd be capable of vulnerability with another person, and here I am more vulnerable than ever, and it's brought me great pain as well as joy. How do I communicate with him how I'm feeling without sounding needy? Please, someone help."
669,vulnerability,offmychest,Why do you act so weird around me?,2,4lno3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4lno3q/why_do_you_act_so_weird_around_me/,2016-05-30 13:16:40,"When we first met you bragged to me about girls you dated. I thought it was super random and weird. I just remember I was quiet. I thought you were an awkward guy with an ego that tried to come off as a bigger macho man than you really were. I thought you were trying to impress me. I thought you speak that way to many attractive women you meet. So I brushed it off. Then I saw you around again because you appeared everywhere I was. And we started talking about nerdy kiddy stuff that we both liked and you were nice and sincere that time. I tend to like guys like you. Shy awkward types with uncommon (to the world) interests. You were nice to talk to and we clicked well. You're not that attractive, but personality trumps that for me. But then you became a dick to me. You hurt me. I felt rejected and was confused why, especially after I thought we were building a genuine friendship. I was trying to be a real friend with all the support I was giving you. It was real. But when it was your turn to return it you chose the opposite route. You did it twice. After you disrespected me two times, I was sick of your treatment of me and I thought, screw you. I was pissed. So I genuinely disliked you for years. I thought you were an asshole and didn't want anything to do with you. When I'd see you around you would come up to me and talk and I'd speak back, because I'm nice. But I never initiated. I heard you liked me, even before our falling out, and I paid attention to your behavior around me and confirmed from that it was true. I still disliked you. Then I heard you had a condition and I felt sympathy for you and disliked you less. I made excuses for you being an asshole. If I was ever brief with you in conversations online it's cause I was convinced you were an asshole and I had my guard up with you. I had cut you off, mentally. And you felt it. I know you feel it. I know you felt that I didn't like you. The awkward way we said hi to each other. You knew. The way I distance myself. The way I never interacted with you. The way you tried to open up to me last year. You did that because you felt I was distant and you wanted to become closer. Maybe you knew why I was distant and maybe you felt guilty and tried to fix it. It was then and only then that I started warming up to you again and trying to give you the benefit of the doubt in my mind. Maybe he isn't an asshole. Maybe it was this, maybe it was that. I remembered how you tried to show your vulnerability to me and I liked and respected that so much. I remember when you were honest about the way you are, your weakness. I remember little things you've said to me that I felt was really sweet, or said period and I like them because it shows you are human, and I like that. I like sensitive, caring human beings that can be vulnerable. I thought you were an egotistical asshole and it seemed you were showing me the real you and I like the real you. But I don't even know if this is the real you. I don't know you. A part of me believes the real you is a sensitive, emotional loving person that is misunderstood. The other part of me thinks you are a manipulative, selfish, egotistical asshole. Who knows who you are. We never got to form a real relationship because you pushed me away. You didn't push anyone else away but you did me. You're so weird. The last time we saw each other out and about was really weird too. Why were you so weird that day? You made me feel so uncomfortable. I had to hightail out of there. God, why were you so weird? Why are you so weird around me? Hot and cold? You are so nervous and weird one day, and confident and talkative another. Why do I even care? You probably don't even like me in a special way. I see how you talk about women and talk to women. You probably like every attractive girl you know. So why do I give you special rent space in my head if you don't do the same for me? I'm not every girl. You seem to think about me too based on how you act, but I don't know. I assume I'm like every other girl to you. You're probably emotionally immature and incapable of loving a woman truly. Maybe you think of every woman the same and I shouldn't waste time wondering about you anymore. But then again, maybe I'm wrong. You mess with my head and you don't mean to. I think you did mean to mess with my head that last time. And I like to mess with your head in return now. Our relationship, whatever you want to call it, intrigues me. But maybe it's all in my head and nothing to you. Maybe you treat a lot of attractive women like this. Maybe this entire screwed up relationship is one you have with many women and thus really isn't anything worth spending so much mental energy on. If I act like I hate you, it's because I liked you. "
670,vulnerability,offmychest,Waiting for my four minutes - an essay about love,3,4ltxoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4ltxoz/waiting_for_my_four_minutes_an_essay_about_love/,2016-05-31 16:48:56,"If you ask people about what differentiates us as a humans, many would talk about love. But love is not exclusive to us - that is obvious, for example, if you own a dog. The real answer is probably far more boring, but we gravitate toward love because it is the thing we, as people, universally do best. If you ask anybody about the most powerful force in the world, many would also say love. In this case, theyre mostly correct (beyond, of course, forces of nature that we cannot control) - love is awesomely powerful. Weve seen what people would give up in the name of love, how far people would go to fight for their loved ones. Weve seen love cross all boundaries (both racial and sexual) and drive people to depression or true, complete happiness. Love has caused massive political uprisings and many, many deaths. In the context of the limited scope of our lives, love is perhaps the only thing that matters. But romantics aside, love is an evolutionary imperative. It is not exclusive to humans, was not gifted upon us by a benevolent God who wanted us to experience true happiness. Love is biological, and therefore has its limitations drawn in the framework of human nature. Love is limited by our own shallowness as a species, motivated by our desire to better the gene pool. An ideal male is attractive, smart, ambitious and confident. An ideal female isattractive (its a short list because men are stupid). But life, alas, is not fair. And here we arrive at the negative part of the post. I lurk in the subreddit r/foreveralone, as I am indeed alone and have been my entire life. I, like many of my fellow lurkers/posters, have only experienced unrequited love or some sort of failed unhealthy relationship, and I have never been able to truly understand the pure blissful happiness that my friends seem to go through so regularly. I was not given any genetic gifts when I was born. I am not attractive. I know Im not naturally athletic (I used to train five hours a day to be mediocre). And I am not particularly intelligent. My family rejected me for my entire life, casting me aside as a failure. My friends treat me as the throwaway friend, disposable like a used tissue. My coworkers view me as the odd one out, and I am invisible in all other social situations. I am deeply hurt, but have nobody to turn to. I listen to others as they talk about their problems, but as I look for help I find only deaf ears and shut doors. People view us as mentally deranged potential serial killers, as posts are often bitter and hate-filled, and we are associated with psychopaths like Elliot Rodger. But the truth is that most of us want nothing more than to just sit next to a girl, curled up on a couch at night watching Conan OBrien. We want to talk about our day, to find somebody who doesnt judge us like the rest of society does. We want to be able to be truly vulnerable with somebody else, because keeping your guard up all the time is exhausting and unhealthy. Is it so wrong for us to want these things? We all know what love can do for people. We all know how much happiness love can bring. We saw how Ted Mosby struggled in How I Met Your Mother, and we saw how he almost gave up hope so many times. Did you hate him for wanting what Marshall and Lily had? Did you deride him for his self-pity? People are not what they seem at the surface. Love is simple. Its a decision, a conscious one that deserves to be questioned and deliberately answered. Love is too important to be determined by a womans face, or a mans position on the football team. Love is too powerful to be trivialized by generalizations about somebodys race or social status. There was an article in the New York Times a while ago that stipulated with the right set of questions (theres a list of 36 questions) and four minutes, any two strangers could fall in love. The setup was simple - seat two people across from one another and have them ask each other the 36 questions. Then they would stare into each others eyes for 4 minutes. We can see the beauty of the experiment (just the staring) in Rachel Plattens music video for Better Place. Four minutes of complete vulnerability. Thats all it takes to break down every barrier, overcome every preconception and find bliss. I have not lost hope. I am still waiting for my four minutes. As for you - please try to find a way to tell your loved one just how much you love them. Love is deep, it is all-encompassing, and it is one of the few emotions that is an end in itself, not just a means to an end. Love is universal and transcends our social structures, our conceptions of race or sexuality or gender. Love is what we do best, and for those of you who have been lucky enough to find it, please cherish it and keep in mind that there are those of us right now locked up in office buildings or apartments or homes, just hoping to one day find what you already have."

More secure, somehow. Comforted. I don't get it. I wish I did. I feel...guilty. Like I know I shouldn't feel this way. I miss my ex, and I don't. Push, pull. He was arrogant. Cocky. But it was charming. I hate that I thought it was charming. I see Tyrion Lannister on TV and want to throw up, because he reminds me of him so much. That witty banter. That condescending banter. That secret soft spot. Or did I imagine that? Did he actually really love me? What parts were true, false, or idealized by me? Did the cons outweigh the pros? I felt like I had to prove myself-- show I wasn't stupid like most people were. That was probably a sign, but the banter was intoxicating, the vulnerability was there, and I thought if I was patient with his judgemental attitude, he'd be patient with my emotional one. We're all human. I thought we accepted each other. Loved each other's quirks, even if they caused us to butt heads sometimes. God, what a mess this has turned me into. Seven AM now. Not a wink of sleep. How does one leave and never look back? I'd be a pillar of salt five times over if the real world was anything like the bible. Look at me. Blubbering like an idiot. ""There, there"" ""It's okay"" ""You deserve better"" ... These pre-programmed responses. I'm tired, dont you understand? I'm tired. ""I deserve better"". So what if I did? Duct tape over a bullet hole wound doesn't do much besides hide the evidence. I'm empty, now. I was empty before, too. I know I won't be empty forever. I know. I missed my therapy appointment the other day because I slept until 5 pm. I'm not sure what I would've said, though. I tell her my feelings, and then what? She gives me some tiny goals to accomplish? She's not gonna help. Why do I have such an intense desire for people to take more of a nuanced interest in my emotions? What kind of egotistical bastard am I? I just want to be enveloped in a hug. Have someone go ""why?"", without telling me what to do, for once. I already KNOW what to do. I just feel too alone to do it. I just want someone to care. I should've been born a mollusk. "

You spent every waking hour for a month trying to turn her against me, showering her with affection, trying to get her naked. You knew she was working 80 hr weeks - daytime school, working all night - and you threw yourself at her, like I've seen you done countless time, with false promises, just to feed your disgusting appetites because you sensed her vulnerability. You knew because of the time difference you could talk to her all night when I was asleep, and you could still talk to me during the day and pretend to be my friend. When she told you that you went too far? That she had enough? That it was wrong for you talk to her like that? You threatened her. You told her you'd tell me and I would hate her.

I've made a lot of progress in terms of managing them, but naturally I still live with severe panic attacks, intrusive paranoid thoughts, and dissociation, and generally my reality is just different and sometimes highly unpleasant. It feels like chronic insomnia has taken my brain from me, and I feel like a ghost of my own potential. I say all that not to complain about my obstacles, but to explain why I'd accepted that I'd never get to be myself with anyone. I refuse to be someone's burden, and vulnerability isn't an option anyway. So I carry my shit, and I place filters to keep my loved ones happy and protect them from my twisted thinking. Yes, it sucks to be alone in that way, but this is how I've adapted to be able to function. But then I met you. I don't even know how it happened (or why I allowed it to), but gradually I've let you know more and more about myself, I've stopped covering your eyes during the bad moments, I've voiced my thoughts without interrupting them at the scary parts... and not only haven't you run far away, but you haven't even flinched. You're still here, at my side every time I would've wanted someone to be in a perfect world, and you say none of it fazes you. Though you hate that I suffer, you assure me that you want to hear it all and that you love even the darkest parts of me. What's wrong with you? When am I going to discover that you are indeed too good to be true? When will I learn that this was all a big show, or that you were just a white knight looking for someone to save and eventually the day-to-day of these conditions will be too much? There's no way you can listen to the things that escape me and not judge me for it. There's no way you can honestly be enjoying my company. No one wants a partner who calls them with tears and suicidal ideation, babbling about shit that doesn't exist. You must have no standards for this relationship to bring you happiness. I love you. It takes a strong person to be in your position, to be in love with someone whose emotions completely betray them. Somehow, when I am hyperventilating, when I am afraid that something is out to get me, when I am challenging your commitment and even fabricating relationship-ending issues because I am wired to believe everyone I get close to will eventually hurt and abandon me - you are a rock. To you, the good days are worth it. I don't know how you do it, but you gladly battle my insecurities just for the chance to see me smile again. I have never been so comfortable or felt so safe with a friend or lover in my life, and I can only hope to be half as good a partner in return, when I can. Thank you for looking beyond the demons. Thank you for overwriting the shame. Thank you."

Slowly but surely I flirted with her and we eventually started going out. I heard a rumor she slept around a lot. Well, this was encouraging to be honest. We go out once and have a good time, very shyly kissing me. This turned out to be a game, something she refused to tell me about afterwards. Next time we saw each other we went all the way. The first date and third date involved her talking about ex boyfriends about ~2/3rds the time. The second date she whined about her roommate. 4th date when I wanted to talk a bit before sex it was like pulling an arm and a leg. Now that I think about it, she never offered much to me as a person. The next couple dates were mostly sex, although at times she wanted to hang out and go to restaurants. Last date she shit tested me saying ""you only like me for my tits"" but I told her otherwise. At that point she leaves for an internship in Kansas, going for two months. She said she ll be gone for 2 months. We hug and say a quick goodbye and I ask her to keep in touch. She says ""she ll try her best"" with a smile. Looking back, I always to do a lot of chasing. She was always playing hard to get (except in bed, she was easy.) I would try to be light and open with a joke and she would give me distant, cold attitudes. It wasn't fun and by the end of it, it was difficult for me to get horny for her. I didn't like her attitude. She was so self centered and egotistical. She was shy, true, but it seemed like she was generally pretentious. Not because she gave the cold shoulder and I acknowledge that I'm not the coolest, funniest or most interesting guy in the world, but because everything always had to be about her. She barely listened or let me speak on the first date, checking her phone multiple times when is spoke at one point, just to make it look like she was checking something. It seemed spiteful. She was great in bed, but had a pretentious, stuck up and entitled attitude. I showed her vulnerability, I tried to be open and light. I showed her weakness at time. One day we were showering together and I was at the edge, where I didn't feel like trying to be cool or confident anymore. I never showered with a girl before so I just thought ""let's let her take the wheel"" on this one. After some initial cold and awkward moments, I guess she got the point. It was ok from there. Throughout the friends with benefits relationship, there were moments where she was vulnerable, showed kindness or was sweet. Barely, but few. I texted her yesterday, about a month since we last spoke. Her responses were cold, one worded or matter of fact. She had completely decided to ignore me and give me the cold shoulder. After an ""indeed."" response I asked her ""penny for your thoughts? "" but she never responded. I feel mad that I'm ignored. It's totally fair that she doesn't want to talk to me, though that still felt rude. I was hesitant to make contact with her because I knew I would get Ice Queen in return. Because me trying to be nice to her would just feed into her ego. She probably got off to to the fact that she could ignore someone. Ok, I'm kidding, but as fair as it is, I am upset about this. I did some serious growing up throughout the 2 months together. I started off needy, not knowing what to say to a girl and today I'm more relaxed, confident and less preoccupied with my emotions. I admit that trying to talk to her yesterday was part of me trying out the ""new me"" with a ""fuck it, it probably won't work but let's see"" attitude. I met a girl at a party that I want to go out with, I was kind of waiting for a back up since I pretty much knew this girl was going to give me attitude. It was a defense mechanism, it seemed like a suicide mission. I have something to fall back on now. I put in a lot of work and emotional overthinking into this first girl and looking back, she definitely isn't worth it. This second girl I met was open, conversed and seemed nice. I immediately had a much better vibe and thought she was cool. Maybe I'm the egotistical one, I recognize the first girl's pretentiousness because I used to be shy and had arrogance covering up my weaknesses. I saw my old self in her. But maybe I'm just whining because I didn't get a response I wanted. I'll admit I was mostly testing the waters, but I wanted friendship with her. Though I would not have minded having sex with her when she came back. My mind unconsciously focuses a lot on her and spends a lot of energy thinking about her. I found myself thinking of her as my girlfriend many times. I'm attached to her. But it's wrong. I want to give this new girl a clean slate."

I truly was seeking nothing more than to have an intelligent conversation with a stranger. I wanted to introduce someone new to my life. See what I could learn from someone outside my typical circle. I wished to laugh and simply be present in a moment of meeting someone new. I did not anticipate the night that it ended up being. I loved your warmth, care, and even boyish charm that is wrapped up in your alpha male disposition. You showed some vulnerability and even insecurity that made you even more attractive to me. As the night went on I was drawn more and more to you. You made me laugh, you made me smile and then you stole a kiss. When you nervously shared you did not want the night to end and asked me up to your hotel room so we could kiss some more I felt so comfortable and filled with trust. I felt like we were teenagers as you struggled to get the words out and I knew exactly what you were trying to ask. I wanted to say ""yes"" before you got it out but thought you were so cute as you tried to speak. We agreed sex was off the table. I enjoyed our time together in the room and in the lobby. You made me feel alive again after a very difficult year of heartbreak. I lost a love relationship that I fought very hard for and ultimately crushed my heart. I said good-bye to my mother once again and good-bye to 2 family members. One just a week before we met. You reminded me what it was like to have a man look at me with desire, to touch me with desire, to feel safe, to feel free. I wanted to spend the night in your arms but it felt like it was time for me to go. As we got ready to walk me to my car and say our good-byes you asked several times about seeing me again, will the number I gave you work or was it a burner phone. You often made the statement earlier in the night, ""when you see me again..."". I was excited but I also got scared as we walked to my car. We did not have sex but we did go a bit further than I anticipated. I loved every minute of it but I started to fear I wouldn't see you again. I could feel my throat tighten and my mind race as I wanted to say so much. Instead, I left you with a well wish that caught you off guard and you asked if we were not going to see each other again. It seemed we both communicated that yes we in fact desire to see one another when you return to town. You told me you would be in touch. I drove away believing I had just met my next adventure. Since you have left our communication has been beyond confusing. I have tried to play it cool. I believe I have given you lots of space. But, I have been the one to initiate all of our communications. Last Friday you seemed very excited to have heard from me. And even more excited when I asked if you would like to come see me this weekend or join me some weekend at the end of the month or beginning of June. I really put myself out there and feared being rejected. I was elated when by your response. You were fun and playful in your messages and communicated you would check calendars and ping me later that night. You never did. I believe my message the next morning to you was fun, playful, and flirty. You ignored it, as well as my message later that day and the one the following day. So believing I had nothing to lose I invited you to call me Monday night. My hope was to chat and see if I could get a sense of where you really are at and if this adventure thing was going to happen. Your communication back was appreciated but confusing. Telling me you had your kids and nothing else just left me hanging even more. I get and respect you are a busy guy. I respect you have kids and don't want to intrude on that. I don't require a lot of attention however I feel like I have been chasing you. I asked if you would come on an adventure with me which you initially seemed very excited about. You told me you would contact me later that night. My 3 follow up messages mentioned nothing of the adventure nor nagged you about not reaching out. I feel my response when you shared you had your kids was respectful but also shared my confusion in a respectful caring manner. Ignoring my request to help fill in the blanks and help me understand where you are at and guide me through this maze I find so confusing I feel is unkind. Yes, we had one magical night and that does not commit you to anything. I know this. I just thought and felt with everything you said and did that we could have a fun flexible adventure. I am sadden that for whatever reason you are unable to meet me where I am at with all this. I am not going to reach out any more because the last thing I wish to do is be annoying. I wish to respect your time, space, needs, and life. And without you communicating on your own I don't feel like I am honoring you or myself. I am a pretty amazing women. I am sane, healthy, positive, sexy, a lot of fun and have lots of freedom. If you ask me you are very silly to not explore this adventure but as they say you can lead the horse to water but you cannot make them drink. And even though I am saddened by what I feel clearly isn't going to happen with us I do I sincerely wish you the best in life. I liked that man I met in April. He seemed as if he desired to be loved, had a bit of loneliness in his life, and that he really enjoyed my company and making me laugh. I loved how he kissed me, how he touched me, and made me feel. If this is my good-bye to him, I wish him happiness, joy, peace, and a life filled with love. "

Due to the light in the sky, the negative feelings from all troubling matters seemed to vanish. It's a fresh start to a new day, with plans to try again and live it out as desired. Nothing seems impossible, energy seems overflowing and life seems beautiful as things are. Lunchtime. Fatigue kicks in. Smile feels forced, laughter seems shallow, small talks gets dull. Distraction starts to gnaw away on control station embedded in the brain. Grab a shot of caffeine for a temporary boost to the system to maintain productiveness. Putting up a brave front to most others, not allowing a sliver of vulnerability escape. Sun is setting. As the light starts to fade, vitality seems to go away as well. Time to wrap up the work. Yet another disappointment: Negativity didn't kick the bucket. Like a vampire, it just went into hiding to avoid the scorching light. Sheer will power is summoned, to finish up what you set out to do for the night: workout, dinner &amp; drinks, entertainment, side project for the passions. A few attempts to reach out to trusted ones for help, but experiences predicted the results of failure to understand. Manning it up seems like a better option somehow. This fight with the highly resilient demon is taking a toll on the body. Eventually, the nightgrew dark. Solitude in the late night fed the demon's growth, allowing it to penetrate all defenses no matter how well it is erected. Without hesitation, it strikes fatally at the heart. Memories and thoughts, instead of blood, came flowing out like a river. The failed relationship a few years back, the giving up of a stable career, the immense debt, the various decisions that was made but seemed disastrous now; these self-doubts slowly ripped the soul apart from within. What manifested was a straightfoward feeling - pain and despair. The struggle continues, until the body's self-preserving mechanism takes over the conscious mind. It's comforting and natural, and all sense of time is lost.... It's daybreak."

Sure, some things may bother you if you bottle them up, but they may also bother you even more if you don't. Without exception, when I share something extremely personal, I feel vulnerable afterwards, but not in a good way, where you feel closer afterwards, rather in a way that equally pulls you somewhat closer yet further apart, both reinforces your trust and makes it more fragile. That sounds really corny and vague, but I can't really think of a better way to describe it. It just feels very odd and contradicting though. Is not that I don't like sharing my thoughts or feelings with people, I do, and I have a few amazing people in my life who I feel very at ease with. It's just that I hate being direct and nonchalant about it. I think it's much nicer to be subtle, drop hints, and not be too explicit in these cases - I feel like part of what helps you keep some sense of individuality is that there are things about you that are just for you. And I feel like there is nothing gained from sharing these things either, at least in my case nothing productive has ever come of it. Mostly just a nod, a phrase to show understanding, and some sort of follow-up, you know? To show they care. Which is really nice, but also doesn't actually do anything. Yet I feel like most people, at least around me, value this exact thing that I don't like. They value being direct and extremely honest to each other, and sometimes because of that I feel pressured to join them even if I don't really want to. It's probably not very surprising when I say that I'm writing this now because I did open up to somebody a few days ago. And I'll say it felt good *while* we were talking. But right afterwards, feelings of vulnerability. Objectively, nothing in our relationship has really changed. We've talked since, everything is just as before, neither better nor worse. But it feels weird, it makes me uncomfortable knowing that someone else now knows about what I would consider to be something only for me. Maybe this post is just my shitty attempt to rationalize why I don't like being vulnerable because I'm emotionally stunted or something, but that feels like a simplistic and dismissive explanation. And while I'm not necessarily asking for advice, I do wonder how others feel about this. Oh, and even though I'm not being super-deep or personal here, the slight irony of me posting this here doesn't escape me, by the way. TL;DR: I'm honestly more or less [like this](URL which many seem to think of as a bad thing, but I prefer it...?"

It can be explained that ""those people are just like that"", as my Minnesotan grandmother once stated about her Native American neighbors, whom she believed to be lazy. It wasn't her problem, fault, or responsibility to in any way respond positively to the destitution within view of her kitchen window. My grandmother never was one for history. Her neighbors were experiencing the adverse effects of actions taken nearly 120 years before, at a time when Manifest Destiny was firmly entrenched in the American collective psyche and was thus also an integral part of government policy. The remains of the Plains Indians were forced out of their own culture and expected to integrate into the that of the pale newcomers from the east. For their trouble, they were given land that was mostly devoid of the resources that their culture had been dependent upon. They were also given free food, but of a type that was new to them. The legacy of Manifest destiny is diabetes and hypertension, alcoholism and drug abuse, and suicide. In 1996, I went fishing with my brother and his wife at the Pickstown Dam on the Missouri River in South Dakota. At one point, we needed supplies and stopped at a local convenience store. On our way into the store, a disheveled Native woman in her 40's stopped me, begging me to take the three dollars crumpled in her hand to buy her a 40-oz, as she was apparently banned from entering the store. I ignored her. And I also never forgot her. What are the opportunities for people in this sort of situation? Can they ever really ""pull themselves up by their bootstraps""? Some did so by getting into the casino business- poetic justice for a cheated people- but many are still mired in a poverty-stricken quicksand from which they will likely never escape. I used to believe Affirmative Action was a disservice to the people it was meant to help, but now? Now, I think that it's going to take a hell of a lot more than that to actually begin to heal this wound. Our collective consciences are assuaged because we're on this side of the Civil Rights Movement, spawning a complacency that is privileged enough to deny that racism yet exists. It is the year 2016 and our communities (yes, even the schools- see article from This American Life) are still segregated. This would be the pot calling the kettle black if I didn't acknowledge that I am a racist, as well. I see African Americans as different from myself- both culturally and physically- and until I'm not afraid of that difference, I'm a racist, and I'm a part of the problem. How's this for honesty and vulnerability: I roll my eyes when I see an African American person walking down the middle of the street when there's a perfectly good sidewalk available. I'm a little afraid to drive down Franklin Ave. east of Division, letting go a silent sigh of relief when I get to Fuller (don't deny it- you've done it, too). I get annoyed when my dishes rattle from the bass issued from a passing car, making an assumption about the person driving it. So sometimes I'm a racist, I'm also sometimes...not. One of my favorite places to go in Grand Rapids is Jamaican Dave's. Manze (sp?) knows me- he knows that the reason he was seeing me at his counter every week back then was because I'm a food addict and I was going through a very painful divorce. But I don't have many friends that aren't white and/or of Dutch descent- and that's the problem. The solution then: get out of your comfort zone, deny fear, and make some friends. URL URL URL"

I feel abandoned. I feel worthless. You broke up with me because Im too high-maintenance right now. Because Im suffering from an anxiety disorder and depression. Im not healthy. Im not happy. And Im really, really scared. I have been really scared for a while now, and of many things. I have thought up many scenarios and eventually one of them came true. I guess at some point I just got so overwhelmed with anxiety that I pushed for one to happen. I didnt mean to. I really didnt mean to. I thought I was stronger than this. As I got to know you, I started trusting you more. Even though I was guarded at first, with high walls and closed, locked doors. I started to trust you, because you really seemed to understand what I am going through. You told me you wanted to help me. So I lowered my guard. I opened up. I trusted you with my darkest corners and my deepest fears. I started to lean on you. You offered to help me, and I took you up on it. Silly me. I dont know why I thought you would be any different. I dont know why I thought you would embrace how fucked-up I am and why you would stick around. I honestly believed that you, simply because you understand what depression feels like, would hold my hand and support me through what is honestly the darkest, most difficult thing Ive ever had to do. This vulnerability is honestly killing me. My emotions overwhelm me. I have a really hard time keeping myself under control and most of the time I really dont understand myself and what Im feeling. And now I have no one I can really talk to, because no one I know understands how dark the world can get when faced with depression. Everyone keeps telling me that I should keep my head up, that I should put in an effort to stay busy, but no one knows how fucking difficult it is to do when all thats really on your mind is self-hatred and an intense feeling of worthlessness. The day after you broke up with me, when the reality of it all hit me squarely in the stomach, I finally realised that I couldnt continue enabling this fear of seeking help. I was frightened of getting help. I still am. The thought of someone digging through my life, my memories and all my crippling insecurities weighs really heavy on me. For years I have embraced the philosophy of keeping things bottled up. It wont be a real thing unless you say it out loud. And now I have to actually talk about everything and it just keeps hitting me how many unresolved issues I have and how little Ive cared for myself in the past few years. Ive always just downplayed what Ive been feeling and how things affected me, not just to myself but also to others, not wanting to burden them. And you leaving me has confirmed that I may have done the right thing. Because I opened up to you about what I really felt. And you felt burdened. And then you left. It feels like betrayal. It feels like I should just give up and admit defeat. When I was with you I felt stronger than I do now. I was willing to work on my insecurities and talk about things because I wanted us to be able to overcome everything. You made me feel safe and secure and you made me feel encouraged to become a better me. But I guess I wasnt progressing fast enough. I wasnt healing fast enough. I guess you didnt really mean it when you said you wanted me to talk to you, because in the end it just was too much for you and you began to see me as a heavy object, holding you down from your own healing process. So you left. And with every day that passes I cant help but look at myself and be disgusted that I didnt push myself towards recovery the way you apparently needed me to. I cant help but blame myself for you giving up on me. On us. I cant help but hope that sometime soon youll come to your senses and realise that you loving me is enough to summon up the will to keep fighting for our relationship. Why dont you miss me? How can you not miss me? It hurts so much. What hurts more is realising that, even if you would want me back, I probably wouldnt be able to let you back in. I gave you everything. I dont think you fully know this, but I honestly gave you all I had. You were my safe haven. You were the one person I would have done everything for. The one person I fully trusted. The one person that made me feel like I wasnt broken and damaged beyond repair. You made me feel like I was something worthy of time and love and care. You made me believe that you would hold my hand and pull me through when I would need it, and that we would reach the finish line together. But you let go, and you continued on your own. I can only assume that I became too heavy to pull, and that you needed to catch a deadline you would miss if you held on to me. And realising that I lost you on my lowest point, when literally all I needed was a long, tight hug and some words of comfort, it hurts me so much that I honestly dont know how to find the words to describe to you the pain Im feeling in my chest. You were one in a million. I never thought someone would make me feel so understood, so safe. You took that away from me, completely unexpected, when I never thought you would. I honestly dont know how Im ever going to reach this point of trust with anyone ever again. I dont know how Im going to allow myself to open up to anyone ever again. If you think I was damaged before, just look at me now. All the self-confidence I had gained during our time together has been shattered. I havent felt this insecure about myself in many years. I never thought Id feel like this again. I hope all this was meant as a last-resort wake-up-call, and trust me when I say that Ive received the message. I see clearer now. Ive started seeing a psychologist for my mental issues. Im far from healthy and happy, but at least Im taking steps. Ive taken comfort in the knowledge that as long as I keep paying this woman, she will remain my support. And when she says she wants to hear everything, she really does. I know she will help me. I will get better. I will become happy one day. I just wish youd chosen to stay to welcome that day, but I guess you're happier without me in your life."

She left for college. He stayed home to take a gap year. She was complex, life placed skepticism in her mind. He was simple, life placed his heart on his sleeve. They didn't know each other. -Excuse me- actually, they did know eachother's names; they were introduced by a mutual friend once before. That was August. They were both night owls, occasionally letting the world know they were still awake by a Twitter retweet. -Okay so maybe it was more than occasionally- because he caught her attention. One night she asked if he ever slept. He said ""not for any prolonged period of time"" and gave her his phone number. That was September. Once she came home for the weekend. They were excited to see each other. -Well for the most part- He was nervous. She was afraid. They both had their own problems with vulnerability. He noticed she had the Enchanted soundtrack in the car, and that her eyes were pretty, but intimidating. She noticed how tall he was, and that his dorky smile could turn her cheeks red. They both noticed that they liked they way the other kissed. That was October. One Friday they each acted instinctively. He told her loved her. She told him she didn't believe it. They didn't talk for a week. The next Friday she drank too much. He smoked a pack of cigarettes. She told him she wished they'd never met. Her high walls weren't tall enough to contain her frustration. -Dramatic enough?- She was only frustrated with herself. He told her to get the fuck out of his life. His heart hurt enough to leave without saying anything else. -Jeez more drama- He had been abandoned one too many times before. They both cried. -I think hurt people hurt people- That was November. Soon it was time for him to send college applications. Soon it was time for her to take college finals. He wished her a Merry Christmas, he missed her. She asked to see him, she missed him too. He invited her to his apartment. -Both of them were night owls remember, they liked caffeine- so they had coffee together. That was December. They didn't kiss anymore, but they were there for one another if needed. She turned 19. He got a new job. They both talked to other people. -I guess that was a little boring- but That was January. Valentines Day came and went, and neither of them were unhappy. School was going well for her, except she realized she hated economics. She put in a transfer application. Work was going well for him, except he realized he was ready to leave home in the fall. He ranked his top choices. That was February. One Saturday at 11 pm he called her. He said he was going through old messages, and wanted to tell her he appreciated her. She smiled and said she believed him. He told her not to say anything back, he liked the silence with her. -So woah, check out the growth that happened right there- He was accepted into the college she was attending. She didn't know he had applied. She was accepted into a film program across the country. He didn't know she had applied. That was March. One Wednesday at 11 pm she called him. She told him he was black and white, and she was gray. She told him she had loved him. -Finally, right?- He was in complete surprise. He pinched himself. She was home the next weekend. They went on a midnight walk. They liked quality time together. They remembered that they liked they way the other kissed. Yesterday she asked him ""Do you think we were ever supposed to be together? Or do you think we were supposed to be pals, who missed our shot a couple times, but stayed pretty good friends anyways?"" Neither of them have an answer. This is April."
681,vulnerability,offmychest,I don't really know how to title this but it about myself and my fear of myself.,1,486hyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/486hyq/i_dont_really_know_how_to_title_this_but_it_about/,2016-02-29 09:44:56,"I suppose a little pretext is in order. I get the feeling it might help put this in context a bit. I am only 24 years of age and male. I have not had a relationship but I am very interested in the opposite sex, though I must add that this is a symptom and am not seeking help on this point. Relationships are symptoms or good interpersonal interaction and personal congruence. I am a self proclaimed recluse but that seems more to be something to erect barriers around myself. I am not formally diagnosed but I am sure that I have some form of high functioning autism/aspergers but it is slight enough that I can exist superficially without much trouble. OK, here I go. I am only recently coming to realise that I am so horribly lonely, and admitting that in any form outside my head it horrific. A problem with trying to resolve this is that I am very discerning with whom I let close. In all honesty, I have no idea how to let people close. I have worked so hard to erect walls around myself that I only acknowledge negative reactions from people and dismiss any positive reaction as me seeing things or that the person who said something nice is getting the wrong impression of me. I really don't hate myself at all, I must add. I tolerate my own existence. All my memories of my younger self are of me more or less by myself looking on at the world as if I am watching a movie. Interacting with it as if I have not corporal form. It is not an unhappy childhood by any means and my parents for the most part are good people. It some how comes down to the fact that I have never felt like I have belonged anywhere and that things happen to me without my input. I don't have any passion for thing, event or life. It drives me to distraction. When I get what i want, which is to be left alone, I slip into some sort of melancholia. I wouldn't call it out and out depression but everything falls into this grey mass of happenings. There is no straight forward point to this post but it helps that i have put it into words somewhere. I know I am still young and all that and the whole reason why I have never really had a relationship is because I have not put effort into getting one. that being said, I have not met anyone whom I find is someone whom i can spend a significant amount of time with to illicit the energy and pain of trying. I am very sure that is personal vulnerability issues manifest. That being said, the kind of people that I tend to get along with and have an easy time with are those who artistic by nature, not just in talent but also in how they think. I have no idea where people like that haunt and i very rarely meet them but when I do I get along with them like a house on fire but after leaving their acquaintance I loose touch very quickly. I worry so much about keeping my ego under control and not letting it get over inflated that I go out of my way to ignore positivity that is focused on me. I am so adept at diverting attention away from myself that I estrange myself from others without realising it until they are gone. I am sorry for the wall of text. I have tried to cut it down a bit and have left stuff out but I think this is enough to get the point across. P.S. I don't know where to put this in so I'll put it here. I have on more than one occasion referred to my clothing as armour. I exclusivity wear boots and enjoy heavy thick clothing like the great coat I own. "
682,vulnerability,offmychest,Insecure about being insecure...,2,48kx9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/48kx9c/insecure_about_being_insecure/,2016-03-02 17:20:15,"I am posting this here because I have literally no one else to talk to about this, and it's eating me up inside. And this may sound silly, but here it goes... I feel guilty about feeling insecure. There are a few reasons behind this - the first being my abusive ex. Anytime he behaved in a way that was disrespectful towards me and caused me pain, he would both minimize and justify his actions by accusing me of being ""insecure"", which was rarely actually the case. If I ever really did feel insecure, (because he never really made me feel safe), I could never tell him without him getting angry. The second reason is that it seems like society as a whole demonized insecurity. They tell us that if we feel insecure, we will scare everyone away, never find love, and never be successful. So yes. I feel guilty anytime I feel too scared to admit my own vulnerability, and I am afraid it's hurting my future relationships. There is a man in my life who told me that I can tell him my feelings anytime, but my feelings are that I miss him, I want him, and I am terrified that if I admit that much, it will scare him away... hence insecurity. Then I feel guilty about the insecurity. Ug. I am so used to being a tough, independent woman, but sometimes I just want to be able to feel afraid, admit that I feel afraid, and know that I will still be loved. Is that too much to ask?"
683,vulnerability,offmychest,I Hate Myself,4,4bk5sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4bk5sp/i_hate_myself/,2016-03-23 11:03:38,"First of all, a little background. I am a senior in uni and I have no friends. I have a light schedule this semester so usually I just sleep, go to classes and come back and sleep. In one of my classes, we have to do presentations and at the end, a team of 4 will be selected to go to the competition. I've figured out that I will not likely be chosen, because I don't have an outgoing personality. I've been told that I'm timid, dull, emotionless, expressionless, etc. I have probably the lowest confidence out of all the people in my class. When I find out I haven't been chosen, it will feel like a personal rejected rather than an academic one because the teacher is rejecting me as a person. It sucks that my personality and who I am as a person don't make the cut. Even when I try to talk to people in my class, I am always on the fringe, listening to the conversation but never involved. I don't get invited into the conversation either. Because I am timid, I feel overpowered by the strong personalities in the class who can be harsh. I get sensitive very easily and it just ruins my whole day and makes me hate myself. I have always been a follow the rules type of person but I've discovered that being a ""good girl"" gets you nowhere. Nobody cares if you raise your hand before speaking. They are more likely to praise the louder, more confident person who just talked over you. Yes, I get talked over a lot and am not really respected. People think they can treat me however they want and I'll accept it. That is true because I am too timid to tell them otherwise. I am a people pleaser, meek and overly humble but don't care about myself. I am very simple minded and straight forward and don't know about how group politics works. Therefore, I get insulted and excluded a lot. I can also be too nice sometimes to the detriment of myself. I always think about others' feelings but no one thinks about mine. I also think I can be slow sometimes. Nobody really likes me and to be honest I don't like myself. Who would be want to be friends with someone who excludes such negative energy and is such a pushover? People want people with positive energy. To tell you the truth, I wouldn't even be friends with myself. I have grown to hate the person I am. This world is so rough and brutal and I don't think it's made for soft hearted, sensitive people like me. I am easily hurt and vulnerable. But I don't want to be this way. I want to be happy and confident and able to stand up to people and not have my self worth be determined by them. I don't want to be timid and quiet and hiding, I want to be the loud life of the party. I want to exude positive energy. I want to life my life unafraid and I want people to notice me in a good way and not be afraid to be the center of attention. I want friends and know how to navigate social politics. I don't want to be on the sidelines. I don't want to be a ""good girl"". Is that big of a change even possible? It would mean changing my entire personality and I'm afraid it would be ""Fake"". People have told me so many times that I'm stupid and dull and ridiculous. I've been stepped on and humiliated so many times I can't count. It is a catch 22 because I just exude vulnerability and so I am an easy target for bullying, and because of the bullying my self confidence sinks even lower. I think deep down I really believe what they say. I've been told that all my life by almost all the people I've met. Nice people say I need to be less timid, mean people just take advantage of me. It's always the same thing over and over. Some of the smartest people I've met have also said this to me and when I look at their facebook and they are happy and well adjusted and I'm not, I think what they were saying about me came true. Now it is affecting my ability to earn a living as I am being turned down for job interviews even though I might get a foot in the door. I don't know, I guess I just wanted to get this all out. "

I always thought I'd be a good mother, and sometimes I am. In fact, observers consistently tell me they think I do a great job and tell me how wonderful my son is. He's strong. He's smart. He's healthy as a horse. He's affectionate and loving without being promoted. but most of the time I just feel like shit. I get so furious i can't even see straight. How do I deal with wanting to tell a toddler to fuck off and go the fuck to sleep already before I punch through a wall? It's a battle to get this child to sleep and his shitty behavior is really starting to impede my quality of life. Same with really anything else that needs to occur in order for him to be a cool human being. He's old enough to have opinions, and to understand and obey commands, but not old enough to actually care to follow my instructions. Our family is poor and we really on me working part time for some extra money. I don't make very much, and our schedules are so weird because we can't afford day care. I can't go back to school to finish my degree because there aren't enough hours in a day, and because I can't afford more student loans anyways. Now that I have child I can't imagine a world in which I'm actually happy and in which our family isn't living month to month. I actually feel really conflicted even saying that, because this child was wanted, planned, and highly anticipated. Yet now that he exists my happiness has taken a nose dive. I know there are probably lots of /r/childfree people who will just say I told you so, but that's not really valid. It's not like it was a surprise pregnancy and I decided to not terminate in a fit of personal morality, no. I just thought it would be different. I thought I wouldn't be sapped of all personal strength by having another human rely on me 100% for everything. I thought I could still be myself and have drive and money to take care if myself. That I could take care of the house, and get outside sometimes. Instead I'm stuck inside 99% of the time. I thought I could still wear pretty clothing. I thought I would have even remotely similar body shape after as I did before. I thought I'd be able to take breaks for an hour or two every now and then. I thought I could share my vulnerability with my husband without him telling me to nut up, it's not that bad. I thought it would help make me happy to raise a family. Instead, I feel suffocated and like I can't help things ever get better because we're stuck in a cycle of poverty because of our child and my inability to bring any economic security to our home. I'm completely drowning and don't see a way out. "
685,vulnerability,offmychest,I'm in my head.,2,44kjoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/44kjoo/im_in_my_head/,2016-02-07 18:08:54,"About a year and some change ago, I broke up with my most recent girlfriend. We had been dating for about half a year at that point, which I know is nothing, but she was the first girl I truly loved (or at least thought I did). One thing that she told me when we were first dating will stick with me forever. She told me that I had a sheet of armor that seemed to be surrounding me, and that she wanted to show me that it was okay to take it off. Well, I did. She was the first girl that I trusted as much as I trusted my family and my best friends. And looking back, sure, it was an unhealthy relationship that I'm glad ended, but one thing she did was shatter that armor and left me to try and mend it. If it makes any sense, I disarmed myself so quickly that the armor broke, and now I feel off balance in my day-to-day interactions. I never used to have a problem compartmentalizing my feelings and separating emotions from decisions, but now I seem to be in a haze. In certain aspects I still don't give a fuck and am protected, but on the other cracks where I'm exposed, I am quick to display vulnerability. The one thing that shows that the whole thing fucked me up is that, with any girl after her, when things started out all right, I'd be fine and I'd be very happy with the way things are going. But the moment that there's any uncertainty, I am quick to start and wean myself from them, almost a natural gut reaction to never wanting to feel hurt again. I'm currently three dates into one of the coolest women I've ever met. Great conversation, slow romance, nothing like the quick flare flings I've been having for the past few years. Someone that I currently think may be great for long-term potential. Half of me craves something like that, and wants to be vulnerable and have a true healthy relationship. So I may have been too eager. I already helped her get an internship in her field for this summer, and took her on three amazing, long dates where I really pulled out the stops. When I had to unexpectedly go overseas for two weeks between date one and two, we still were talking really well. That's how good the chemistry is. We even made plans for Valentine's Day two weeks in advance. But I'm used to faster romance; we've only shared some kisses, nothing even that deep. I tried to escalate and she stopped me, though she's still shown affection. But it's triggered something inside me: does she only see me as a more platonic companion, or is she just conservative? Am I fucking up and putting myself into that position? And so on and so forth. This weekend, she said she had some stuff coming up and that she would be too busy to meet up, but had an hour or two to grab a coffee. I told her that I was also busy and we could hang out next week instead. She said that it sounded good. I texted her today in the morning hoping that she got through the day well and whether she knew how the beginning of her week was looking. She didn't text back all day. I know I'm overthinking everything. I know that she'll probably text me back tomorrow and tell me she was busy. I know that I'm overreacting and being super clingy. I know that even if she doesn't text me back, whatever, it's only three dates in and I'll find another super awesome chick in this big city that I live in. But what I'm more worried about is my gut reaction. Why am I so quick to protect myself with faulty armor? Should I just take it all off, or wait until it's fully repaired? Why am I so scared to get hurt? Why do I put myself in this position? Is there anything I can do? So now I'm in my head again. Help."

I got my grades up and moved towards the top of my class. I got into shape, and began to dress differently and cut my hair in a new way. I cut out the bad influences and am leaving the year in an astronomically better state then when I started it. While for the most part it has been great, a few things are still hanging over my head. A few months ago I fell in love with the greatest girl I have ever met. She was first to talk to me, and after a few days of her eager conversation-starting I raised the question ""does she *like* me?"", a suspicion that my friend only confirmed later on. Over the next month we talked, laughed, and hugged for hours on end, both becoming obsessed with one another in the best kind of way. Yet her feelings for me changed, and the once mutual adoration became a one-way street. It was eerily reminiscent of a situation I went through earlier in the year, albeit with the roles reversed. Coming out of last summer (2014) I was deeply depressed and crucially vulnerable. A lot of it stemmed from my feeling of inadequacy and the general notion in my head that girls did not like me. Out of this vulnerability I started talking to a girl who, for lack of a better way of phrasing, was ""under my league"". For the story's purpose, lets call her Fox. We talked and she grew more attached, and for a little while we both had some mutual feelings for one another. My crippling social anxiety (since been overcome) prevented me from talking to her in public, but she fell for me nonetheless, and we talked over text and social media. At the turn of the year I devoted myself to changing my life and beating the sadness that had been so detrimental to my being the year prior. Through this process, through which I became more outgoing, I began to see attention from other girls. Suddenly I realized that I was unhappy talking to Fox, and I stopped talking to her, ending the fledgling relationship. Aspects of it mirrored my relationship this fall. Is it Karma coming back to get me? I try to avoid superstition, but the parallels are so close that it is impossible to not consider it."

I just can't see the big deal of it. I've done the whole ""being emotionally vulnerable with people"" and it did not make me feel powerful or amazed. I like to keep things to myself, because I know that being vulnerable with people does not make me feel good. It doesn't make me feel good knowing that someone knows my deepest darkest secrets because I am very cynical about human nature. Secrets are secrets for a reason; they are not meant for other people to know. I feel good not being vulnerable with people. I'm comfortable with who I am, and thus I do not feel the need to open up to anyone. Just because you fully embrace who you are, does not mean you can and should spew out your secrets and the deepest depths of your mind to people."

It is 6:51 pm. and Im trying to survive. Last thursday, January 14, 2016 around 6:17pm, I felt like my life had ended. The days proceeding that Thursday have been the absolute worst days of my life. I lost who I believed and still believe to be the love of my life. I am still so desperately in love with you, Josh. My heart is in pieces. My chest feels like its burning and my body is so weak and so numb. I am reeling in pain and I can hardly hold myself together. This is heartbreak. This is heartache. Ive never felt this kind of pain before in my life. To give everything: my soul, my love, my heart, my vulnerability, my fears, to this person, only to have it shattered in a matter of moments, this kills me. I need to kiss you. Feel you, hold you. I need you to hold me and kiss me. I need to cuddle with you, be with you, be next to you. I am so broken, Josh. I miss you so much. Oh my god, my heart hurts. I feel like Im dying. *January 23, 2016 2:48pm* Last night, I started feeling better after I did yoga with my brother. I finally laughed some as he and I struggled to maintain balance in some poses and I laughed at his horrible flexibility. We did yoga around 8:20pm after dinner and the rest of the night I felt okay. I cried when Josh texted me back saying he would always have love for me too, so much and told me he hopes this semester is kinder to me and ended with Till next time &lt;3 with a blue heart. I cried. But then I was okay. Must have been the happy chemicals in my brain fighting the sad after my workout. Today, I have been in a constant state of anxiety, heartache, and nausea. I have very little energy and motivation to do anything, like eat. I forced myself to down a slim fast and then I forced myself to do A.M. yoga which didnt help me very much. The workout was hard and my blood pressure was low so I couldnt execute the last couple poses of the 20 minute yoga session. I just wanted to lay in relaxation pose forever. After yoga, I slumped back into bed and took a short nap. Im so sad. I want someone to stick needle in my chest and extract out all the pain, all the emotion, all the everything. My brother just checked up on me and made me smile. He asked what disney movie I was going to watch next (because last night I ended the night with Aladdin) and I told him I was about to watch The Brave Little Toaster. He reminded me that as kids we assigned ourselves to the characters of the movie. I was the blankie, my brother was the radio, mom was the lamp, and the vacuum was most definitely dad. I had totally forgotten we did that and now itll be fun to see if these assignments hold up as I watch. It took me 50 minutes to eat 3/4ths of the homemade pizza my mom brought me, but I feel good that I did it. Anxiety is lower at the moment and I have both of my cats cuddling with me on my bed. I wonder why Josh fell out of love with me. I wish he would call me and ask to see me, or text me that he misses me and that he made the biggest mistake of his life. I wonder why he would hurt me this much. He broke up with me last Thursday, with hardly an explanation other than he doesnt feel the same, hes felt like this for weeks maybe even months, and that this isnt the right time for us. I want to know what I did. I think I know what it was. Depression made me extremely lonely. And I saw him twice before the break up on the 14th. I saw him twice in two weeks and when we went on our last two dates, everything did feel off. He was distant and it felt empty. The sex was empty. But I figured it was because he was having a schizoid episode so I did not ask, pry, or want to overwhelm him, so I became distant as well. I wasnt as affectionate, loving, or happy. And that killed me. It made me miserable. I was so frustrated and wanted nothing more than to be swooped up in his arms and bury my face in his neck and kiss him until I couldnt anymore. He broke up with me last Thursday and went camping with his friends. I was supposed to go on this camping trip with them. We were supposed to go camping at least once together this break. That made me break down when I found out he went without me. He didnt want me enough to go with him to Big Bear. He didnt want to cuddle with me in the snow, eat soup together by the fire, or take pictures together. He didnt want me enough to want that. That kills me so much. I sent him a message the following Sunday, asking if there was hope, asking if he could explain, and asking if we could work together and make this right. Then on Wednesday I sent him another message. The silence was destroying me. Nothing. All week. He dropped me, cut me out, with nothing. Not two weeks before this, we were cuddling on New Years. He was my New Years kiss. Things felt off then, but he looked so happy to kiss me that night. He was so handsome and so cute. I adore him. He finally responded to my two messages on Thursday. One full week after our breakup. He apologized for the silence and told me it was the hardest thing hes had to do and knew it was super painful but just didnt know what to say. He let me bleed for a week while I didnt know if I should hold on or let go. I responded to him, begging him to take me back. And he responded later that night saying that being apart is what he feels is best. I just dont feel like I used to and it wouldnt be fair to either of us for me to keep going he said. I'm so sad.

I look into his eyes or at the back of his adorable, slightly thinning head of hair as he grabs for my hand to wrap around his chest, and I just forget how to make any other sound than a gasp of frustration. He probably thinks I have asthma. Our situation is not unique, but it catches some people (especially friends and family) off guard. I am nearing 30, while he is nearing 50. He has two young boys from a previous marriage, and I met him at work (although we are no longer co-workers.) What I mean to say in place of the long exhalations and loud sighs is that I love him. He makes me boundlessly happy. He shows pride in my accomplishments, concern for my well-being, and interest in my passions and goals. He nurtures me, challenges my mind, includes me in his future plans, and is always honest with me, even if that means telling me my socks are dingy or that everything that I cooked was delicious save the beans. He has invited me into his world, and we are working slowly at introductions with his children. (I am known as a friend and we are respecting their need for regularity in schedules and for private time with their father.) To put it simply, my life is better with him in it. He tells me how happy I make him and has called me his darling and his dear. One night he said I was his ""treasured one"" in German, (which, upon inspection, also translates to ""loved one"") but has stopped short of saying ""I love you."" That is ok- especially considering we have only been dating just shy of four months. But I couldn't take it any longer. Two nights ago, following another unsuccessful evening at opening up to him, I turned around already half way home and showed up back on his doorstep. He thought something terrible had happened, but I said I needed to tell him something and he brought me inside. After a clumsy introduction about how I hadn't been myself recently because I wasn't being open with my feelings, I looked at him quietly and steadily and told him ""I love you."" He did not seem surprised- like he was already well aware, but did sound pleased as he responded, ""You *do* love me? Is it because I said your Brussels sprouts were good?"" (We are a joking people.) I laughed and nodded- taking a moment to be serious and saying I had known for well before his Brussels sprouts compliments. I don't remember a hug or a kiss following that exchange, but I did leave, and I did feel a bit hurt at not hearing ""I love you"" back. I have admittedly let doubt take over my imagination when it is not preoccupied with work, but I have slowly realized that saying ""I love you"" simply to hear it back is not the point. The point is that I was brave enough to be vulnerable, and the gift of my vulnerability is knowing that my partner knows, without a doubt, my feelings for him. When he is ready, I believe he will tell me. For now, I have his deeds to go by, and they are telling enough. "
691,vulnerability,offmychest,"He was abusive and old enough to be my dad but I miss him so much it kills me, please give me advice on coping with this...",1,3w1fgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3w1fgz/he_was_abusive_and_old_enough_to_be_my_dad_but_i/,2015-12-09 16:54:45,"He berated me all the time, was really suspicious of me to the point of not wanting me to even go to school because he thought I'd cheat on him there or something, and was really cruel to me whenever I made a mistake. He took everything personally to the extreme; he took it as cause for punishment if I yawned when I was looking at something he had made (he's an artist) even if I hadn't slept in a while. He was only kind when we were totally in agreement. I couldn't disagree with him calmly, even in small, without him insulting me personally and trying to make me feel really bad in ""punishment."" If I ever had a less than happy demeanour around him, or seemed tired, he would take it as a personal slight and would get angry, insisting that he knows my anger better than me and that I should ""trust him"" about my ""subconscious emotions."" Even when I'm just sleepy! And the day I broke up with him it was a bit after he hit me for the first time, not terribly hard or in the face but with angry force on my thigh, in public, to shut me up when I was crying because he had been berating me. He told me to ""stop trembling"" in an angry voice when I was shaking from panic and fear and mostly sadness. He's also a lot older than me, enough to be my dad, and met me when I was extremely young and vulnerable. I still am young and vulnerable. I have no friends who I see with much frequency, in part because he isolated me so much. We were about to move in together... I was so close to signing a lease because he has a record for violent behaviour of some unspecified kind, from a decade ago or something because he's so much older than me... I guess I'm just writing this to vent because I know I can't go back to him when I write all this (my therapist suggested doing this whenever I feel like going back to him), because if someone was doing that to my mom or friend I would be horrified. So I'm writing this post, instead of texting him back when he texted me saying I broke his heart and he's felt sick all day from sadness and calling me by an endearing pet name we had. Even if I didn't say anything but ""I miss you so much"" or ""you broke my heart too, I will always miss you, I'm sorry I couldn't handle it"" it would start a dialogue and he would reel me back in. God, I just hope he knows how much I liked him. I didn't know it was possible to feel like that. It made me remember the good stuff, because there was good stuff even though the bad makes it so I can't take him back. My therapist calls this the fading effect bias and rosy retrospection. I'm trying to view it as that so I don't reply to him. He is so manipulative and he knows how to make me talk to him by being super sweet to me after losing his temper thanks to me ""making him so mad"" even though I only ever try so hard to make him happy. All I wanted was to make his life easier, but I messed up too much for him, I guess. But god our sex was so good. He was so beautiful, not in the conventional way of a man, he was just so special, with such character in his face, and it felt so wonderful to kiss him, how I felt like I'd broken down his facade and he'd show so much vulnerability to me... I have never felt so passionate of a connection with someone before and I am so scared that he's ruined other men for me because of it. I miss him so much. I miss his blue eyes, piercing like a husky, and his intense chiselled but narrow features, and his good smelling leather jacket, and how safe I felt when he wrapped his arms around me and kissed the top of my head, and how much I loved listening to his opinions and stories when he was in a good mood. He didn't have anyone else but me and we spent all our time together. But three days of me being a little bit stressed and distant, never lashing out at him just being a bit more quiet and less in the mood to party and stuff, is enough to break all the promises he made me, and then he insults me in the specific ways he knows will hurt me the most because of my childhood trauma. I just hope I'm being irrational with sadness because of the closeness of the event. I left him almost 4 days ago and I feel this huge fist in my gut because I'll never be X's girl anymore, and he says I broke his heart and it's not his fault he has narcissistic personality disorder or something even though I would only be subjecting myself to more isolation and abuse down the line if I returned, because the moment things were less than perfect he would berate me and probably beat me. I wasn't with him long enough to find out just who he is, but the cruelty I've experienced thus far makes it so I sadly will never be able to find out. I feel so alone in this world and the past while I haven't felt alone with him, at least most of the time, and I'm going to miss all of the little things about him so much I feel like I'm going to cry all the time still. Comments encouraged, I'm trying so hard to do the right thing here. I've already given him a second chance, my therapist was so relieved when I told him I broke up with him, he clearly has anger management problems and is extremely controlling, if I took him back now I would be so stupid. I just miss him so much and I'm young and I am a little mentally/emotionally unstable. Never liked someone that much before and now I can never talk to him again. I'll never be his baby, his little girl, his lover again. I won't get to meet his parents at christmas after all."
692,vulnerability,offmychest,Nothing like the holidays to remind you that you hate your life...,2,3xczle,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3xczle/nothing_like_the_holidays_to_remind_you_that_you/,2015-12-19 03:32:48,"I've posted here once before. It made me feel a little bit better, so fuck it. Here we go again. This Christmas marks three years since my life imploded. Divorce, newborn child stuck in the fallout, custody agreements, blah blah blah, you've all heard the stories, and the details of mine aren't terribly different. And now my ex wife is pregnant with her boyfriend's child, and he's losing his shit over some (frankly odd) fear that his child is going to call me Daddy. I'm being pushed out of my ex wife's family's lives as a result (they love me and are not fond of their daughter's boyfriend at all, I doubt it went well when my ex wife asked them to stop inviting me to family functions, if she had the balls to tell them what she told me). That doesn't bother me so much, though. They're good people, but a little separation is healthy in these situations, I think. What bothers me is the loneliness. I've tried dating twice since my divorce, both times went... Well, disastrously. Mostly because of me, if I'm honest. I'm a mess. It's not even the whole ""I miss my wife"" crap, that faded a long time ago. I guess... I guess I'm afraid. I was a serious commitment-phobe before I met my ex wife. I noped right the fuck out of every relationship I had before her for dumb reasons, and with people who were far more well adjusted and frankly better human beings. Then I met her and I decided to take the plunge and did all the vulnerability crap, ""let down my walls"", whatever you want to call it. And I got knifed in the gut. No, knife is the wrong word, it was like a piece of rusty rebar. And here I am years later, and even the thought of trying to enter a relationship again draws my attention right back to that ragged hole in my gut and the inevitable thought that follows: ""Do I seriously want to put myself through THAT again?"" I'm about to spend a whole week with my son. I should be happy about that, and don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled for the time I'll have with him. But already in the back of my mind is that tiny tugging thought, that once this week is done I'll have to send him back to his mom and go right back to the first, third, and fifth weekends of the month. And any time other than that... I'll be alone. Merry fucking Christmas, right?"

He's never hit me. He's grabbed me and threw me to the ground. He's pinned me and threatened me. Last night he threw me to the ground and stepped on his throat. I am not innocent. I provoke him. I block the doorway so he can't leave. I get b itchy and condescending. I try to hug him when he doesn't want me to touch him. I've pushed him. This doesn't happen all the time. It never happens for no reason. Lately it's been worse, and my coworkers and friends have been begging me to call. Telling me it's the only way to make it better. I didn't expect the Toronto police to act like such assholes. I was on hold for 20 minutes. I kept telling him that if he just sits and talks to me for 5 minutes, I will hang up. He just wouldn't do it. He kept insisting I stole his wallet, which was never the case. I just needed 5 minutes. The detective took me in to a room. Isolated, with just me and her while a friend waited with another officer outside. She told me not to worry, if he comes in on his own they'll just have a conversation with him, and release him with a 4 to 6 week no contact order and mandatory anger management classes. She specifically told me he would not be arrested. I begged her to drop it. I just wanted it on file in case things didn't get better. She made me let her take pictures and give a statement. When I returned to the room where my friend was, the 2 cops that responded to the call had been talking to my friend. They told me they were going to arrest him, and there was nothing I could do about it. I didn't want to press charges, they said they were going to do it anyway to ""keep me safe. "" I never wanted it to happen. I told them that the detective said he wouldn't be arrested, and they told me it wasn't up to her, but he would be released that day under the same conditions. He went on on his own. Now I'm hearing he most likely will be held over the weekend, released Monday. I'm so upset and heart broken. These incidents don't happen often. He's such a sweet, protective, amazing guy. He just needs help. The stupid, nasty officer told me they just wanted to help him. Her and the other two dick hole cops used my vulnerability to hit their fucking quotas. I knew my boyfriend would be mad. But after this, he'll hate me. His family doesn't know yet. I have no family here, his family is the closest thing I have. I'm going to lose all of them over this mess. I understand that I'm not in an ideal situation. But this isn't all his fault. Now he's angry and scared and feels betrayed and abandoned. And I did that to him. I'm such an awful, horrible excuse for a girlfriend. as much as I know he deserves so much better, the only thing I want is to have him back in my arms. If he'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life making it up to him."
694,vulnerability,offmychest,I was disappointed by The Force Awakens.,0,3xm3cx,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3xm3cx/i_was_disappointed_by_the_force_awakens/,2015-12-21 07:08:08,"(I'll try to avoid spoilers as best as I can but if you don't want to risk it, feel free to not read.) And I really feel like the only one. I see a constant stream of posts here, on Facebook and Twitter of people saying how they loved it. How its the greatest thing ever and blah blah blah etc. etc. etc. I'm sure if you've been on Reddit at all, you've seen it so I don't think I need to go into much detail. But here I am, the only one that walked out of that theater just not really enthralled at all. I don't think its a bad movie at all I was just left disappointed for the most part. I went into TFA entirely blind, having avoided all spoilers but nothing in that movie even surprised me. I successfully predicted every story beat and twist throughout the movie. I didn't think this film would be so predictable and I feel like the emotional impact of certain scenes was killed for me by that. I'm also kinda in the camp that Ray is a mary sue. Just she was so good at everything, everybody liked her and there was absolutely no setup for pretty much any of her badassery. I get being a techincal whiz. Living as a scavenger, she definitely had to find what was valuable in wrecks and maintain her equipment because she obviously couldn't afford new things all the other shit? Why was she a skilled pilot at all? She never had any intention of Jakku because she thought her family was coming back to her at some point so I don't think she would've ever bothered learning but she can do all those crazy manuevers with no training? Not even any implied training outside of ""Yeah, I'm a pilot."" Shes also a great fighter too. She effortlessly dispatched two thugs sent to steal her droid, she's an incredibly skilled marksman (Missing only 1 shot if I recall correctly) and can effortlessly duel with a lightsaber despite no training with it whatsoever (Finn did too but being a soldier, he should have some melee combat training. Swords still exist in SW now, right? I don't think they all disappeared after KOTOR, right?) Can I get some context at least? Where did she learn to fight? Friends on Jakku? Tell me something movie. Don't just tell me shes a good fighter, show me shes a good fighter but give me no context as to why. Maybe have Finn ask about it and she just says ""Jakkus a rough place. Had to learn how to fight."" I would buy that. And she can just inexplicably use the force too. Something I thought required years and years of training to have any sort of mastery over. Apparently not, since you can just learn to mind rape people in two seconds. Couldn't we have gotten some sort of shot establishing her force sensitivity? Like maybe she subconsciously mind fucks that guy at the start to get more rations? Not an absurd amount but just like another half? Or maybe showing her have less control over it? Like when she tried to mind trick that Stormtrooper, she instead accidently fries his whole brain instead, killing him? Not just have her be great at it almost immediately because the plot calls for it. I never felt like she was in any real danger. She just seemed to walk out of pretty much any dangerous situation no worse for wear. Never got hurt or showed literally any vulnerability of any kind. Every other character was vulnerable in some way. Finn, Chewie, Han etc.. Everybody but her. Why? I don't understand. Maybe I just lack the necessary information about her and can really only theorize but make her look somewhat vulnerable. Its ok to have a character be vulnerable. That makes them more relatable. Worse yet is I feel like if I ever brought these problems up anywhere I'd just be pawed off as a sexist. ""YOU HATE STRONG FEMALE CHARACTERS!"" I'd hear when some of my favorite characters in gaming and movies are badass women (like Kerrigan from SC, Sylvanas from WC, Jill Valentine, Ripley, etc. The list could go on. After finishing it, I just felt like I watched a retooled version of New Hope. I hate this. I feel like I'm just a bitter asshole for some reason. I wanted to go in and love every second of TFA but I just couldn't. Not to say it isn't good or to take away from anybody elses enjoyment but I just couldn't."
695,vulnerability,offmychest,Paralysis... I'm sick of feeling vulnerable.,101,3qk0j1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3qk0j1/paralysis_im_sick_of_feeling_vulnerable/,2015-10-29 00:06:00,"Background; 6 years ago (anniversary was on the 14th), I sustained a complete spinal cord injury, which left me completely paralyzed from the armpits down. To the unfamiliar, that means I have no sensation or muscle control below my armpits. I think I'm at a point where this injury is no longer new. For the first several *years*, there were goals to be accomplished, and things to learn, and every day was a challenge to tackle and overcome. I realized, recently, that I've not been truly challenged in my daily life for probably the last year. I have my routines and I've settled into my way of doing things, and I'm just going.. I'm just experiencing my new normal. I think I'm really just dealing with a build-up of negative emotions and thoughts that were once hidden by all the little victories that I fought to keep in focus to help me stay positive. Just recently, one of my answers on AskReddit about my injury got a lot of interest, and I really enjoyed getting to talk about my life, and saying a few things ""out loud"" helped me think through them clearer. So I would like to just let some things out here too. I'm usually a very positive, bubbly person, and I don't want any of this to sound like I'm ungrateful to be independent, or to take what I have for granted because so many people have it worse, but I need to get some of this negativity out of my system. Here goes. I miss being spontaneous. I miss being strong, and capable, and just being me. I feel so absolutely vulnerable at times, and I hate doing anything to indicate that I'm paralyzed, even around those who've been with me the entire way. I hate being seen moving my legs with my hands, I hate the way my feet flop around lifelessly, I hate how flabby my abs got, and how skinny and flabby my legs have gotten... they just *look* weak. I hate anything that shows that I can't feel, like one of my feet slipping off my footrest and just hanging there until I see it or someone points it out. I hate pissing myself because I got caught in traffic and had no way to cath., and I hate feeling like a healthy vibrant person with a broken body attached. Everything I do, all day every day, is to keep my body healthy. I stick to a bathroom schedule to prevent accidents and eat right to keep regular. I turn 2-4 times a night to make sure I don't have any pressure points through the night. I always sit on my cushion if I'm going to be anywhere remotely firm, I lift myself every hour to make sure I've got circulation and relieve pressure on my bottom, and I check everywhere that I can't feel for broken skin every night. My body is my own burden. I'm 24, I shouldn't be concerned with things like needing a fucking cushion to sit on the grass, or catheters, and being tied to schedules that revolve around bathrooms. I should be able to go have fun, drink, feel feminine and sexy.... And the worst part isn't the physical inconvenience of it all, that I'm fairly used to. It's the range of emotions I experience. One day is great and I'm proud of where I am, another day leaves me feeling so defeated and broken. On most bad days, I can keep it in and give myself a peptalk, or call/text friends or family and get on, but there have been times this year when I've broken down in tears just because I feel all this self-imposed pressure to not show any sign of weakness or vulnerability. I feel like I need to prove ""something"", but I know that's stupid. I know the people around me care about me unconditionally, and they're the reason I fight to always be outwardly positive. But some days, I just feel so crushed. If anyone managed to make it through all that, thank you for taking the time, and you're welcome to comment. This felt good. Apologies if it's all over the place, I just started typing what came to mind. Edit - I re-read this, and I want to stress that I'm in a good place. I've accepted it, and I have a very good life and the best support network. I've done things and met people since this injury that I never would have before, and I'm so grateful for that. I don't want to sound bitter, because I'm certainly not, I just really needed these thoughts and emotions somewhere other than inside. And I feel so much better now that it's done, and honestly I'm a little embarrassed. Thanks for letting me!"

I am haunted by memories of you-- everywhere I go. A smell diffusing out a street window, some high-brand perfume, a distant song. It's always in that sweeping kind of way. It's inescapable. Everything around me reminds me of you, I don't know what to do. In school, I can't focus anymore. I feel so little. I don't know how to get over this. I feel as if a definite amount of me has been tied up with you and now that it is gone and irrevocable, I may have lost something forever. I don't know why I wrote this. I miss your innocence, your cute little way of moving yourself under my arms while I was lying next to you. And how you looked up at me from your little alcove in my arms and held the gaze a little longer than you should. How overwhelming it was. So many first experiences with you, too. The kind of innocent nature to it all makes me so upset. How significant we were to eachother. And now we don't talk. I remember seeing you recently and you seeming so happy, and I hate having to put up this front that things are okay, always getting better. Because they're not. They're not at all. I just miss you. But we killed eachother when we were together. I sound so childish. I think of you everynight. I remember wrestling with you in my old room and you falling down onto the bed with grace. Your hair arcing out around your head on the bed linen. And becoming weak. It was a vulnerability. I can't believe you're gone. It's been almost a month and I miss you more tthan ever. But I don't want to tell you this. For I would run the risk of severe embarassment and more so, become horribly depressed if you rejected. Which is likely. I wish things never changed, I would have appreciated our time together so much more. "
697,vulnerability,offmychest,4 weeks. 4 hours.,4,3sfb4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3sfb4l/4_weeks_4_hours/,2015-11-12 04:06:54,"Its astonishing what our bodies can tell us. Even when we dont want it to, or arent expecting it to, it reveals things. When were hungry, we salivate. When we need to regulate body temperature, we sweat. Sometimes, on rare and definitive occasions, our hearts race. When the heart races it usually still needs the mind to decipher the meaning. To me, thats the best part. The truly best part. She first walked up, more unassuming than I was used to, and simply said you look like youre in a band. I am. Then the fairly usual small talk but for a very unusually short amount of time. She sat down and engaged. I took notice of everything I possibly could in that moment because to me, it seemed like my heart was about to start sending signals. She had these piercing blue eyes. She had black hair and soft features. She had an angelic hue to her skin and spoke without reservation. After all, its part of the job description. But I like to think I can read whats in front of me. And as I was reading, I never wanted this story to end. I noticed a few things immediately. Her eye contact was engaging and so thoughtful it was noticeable. She had a nervous habit of running her fingers through the ends of her hair. She was forthcoming but shy and that is a recipe for one thing, vulnerability. Once that became apparent, I was positive that I needed more. I asked question after question and her answers were thoughtful, pure and passionate. She used the word empathy. She wanted to be a writer. She had been through a lot and seemed to finally be seeing a light at the end of that tunnel. Theres a switch somewhere inside of me that knows when to pay attention. Not that I dont want to naturally but it starts hearing things in high definition. Out came her name, birthday, details about her that I couldnt have forgotten had I tried. See, were given these moments in life, theyre just handed to us. And so often we squander them. We watch them slip through our hands to never be seen or heard from again. That, I refuse. Certain people are naturally good, these people tend to find it surprising when you notice the goodness in them. Usually thats because to them, its one setting. They dont even stop to notice at times that theres an alternative to their goodness. The first time I felt my heart pick up its pace was when I told her that if she had to go, that she could and I wouldnt take it personally. Her response was Id rather be here talking to you. Thats courage and honesty. Its intoxicating. We talked for hours and I did not want that night to end. I knew it had to and theres so much more to this story that could be told but Im still not sure what Im trying to tell you. Or her. Or myself. Heres what I know. Life gives us chances. Constantly we are thrown opportunities that it is purely up to us to take advantage of. I asked for her number. I wanted to talk to her again. I quit three years ago letting chances pass me by. Why do we make so much of useless details? Beautiful girl, amazing conversation, genuine heart and honesty. Thats what I saw, thats what mattered and rightfully so. I went back two weeks later. After two text messages were taken without response, I wasnt sure what I was going to say to her if I saw her again. I know this much, I was a gentlemen and I was authentically me. If she didnt want to give me her number, she wouldnt have. If she didnt want to talk to me, shed say so. And what do you expect one of the first people I run into is her. I felt her presence. I was reminded vividly and quickly of that conversation and every detail that comprised who she was to me. You texted me. She said. I did. I didnt respond. No, you didnt. But then, because this is the cutest way Ive ever been rejected via text message she said I picked up my phone so many times to respond and I didnt know what to say. Who was this girl? Where did this kind of honesty and this heart come from? Just like that, it was like nothing had happened in the two weeks between conversations and we just picked up where we left off. Im a man of passion and of heart. I feel things at a level most people dont feel and I tend to understand myself and the results of my feelings pretty well. It was very obvious that one of us was the gas and the other held the spark. She showed me attention when she didnt have to. I revealed all of the details I remember from our first conversation, to my own surprise. April 8th, I even knew the year. Again, Im not sure why it stuck in there, but it did. These are the kinds of results that we dont get to see every day. If we were an experiment, someone would surely be trying to bottle whatever it was that we produced. It is rare that in our lives we experience immediate chemistry. The kind that reinforces belief in our role and counter why life can sometimes be so goddamn difficult. She gave me that. She reminded me that stimulating conversation and a sensitive touch can create palpable passion. She has a thing for ears, its absolutely adorable. She rubbed mine for a moment. She didnt wonder how Id react or what Id say, she just did. Whimsy. My heart raced. Im slowing down for a second because all this talk of hearts racing sounds over romanticized and clich. We create that. We scoff at the idea and at its meaning. But this is what Im saying. Emotion is the cornerstone of every single thing you experience in life. Its what separates real interaction and connection from the idea that there is something more worthy of your time. To me, there is nothing more desirable than feeling something, whatever it may be. Two weeks passed again and this time I was going just to see her. I was nervous, giddy. I asked how her night was. Better now. With that came a hug and a lightning rod. I knew I made the right decision. I was proud of myself for engaging this wild notion that feelings just do things to you and for you and its our duty to let them. I was right where I wanted to be at that moment. I knew however, that there was a caveat. One that I was willing to accept. That is, her boyfriend. When we meet people, it makes zero sense to not put our best foot forward, be ourselves and be genuine. That is what helps us see each other for what we are and allows us to move forward appropriately. I wasnt trying to sweet talk her, nor her me. I wasnt trying to convince her of something that wasnt true or make her believe something that wasnt believable. All I wanted to do was be myself and simultaneously remind her that she is beautiful and worth each and every moment my heart raced. Just today I stood in the shower with tears in my eyes thinking about the conversations weve had. The reason I get so emotional is because thats what we are supposed to do. Last night she said I think about you constantly. I even miss you. How is that possible? Its possible because I am right there with her. Its possible because of vulnerability and appreciation. What it takes for someone to express such emotion is absolutely inspiring. She moves me in ways I wish more people could. Shes addicting. I have a desire to make her feel good and wanted. To remind her of her beauty and the mind that lies so incredibly within her attractive exterior. I want to hug her and tell her that emotion is good. That watching tears well up at the corners of her eyes moved me to such a degree that tears now come to mine as I mention it. I want to tell her that life is about that amazing feeling of not wanting to leave. Not because I want to win her over, but because I want her to get to experience those emotions, even if short lived. I want to go back there. The urge is almost intimidating. Theres a large list of my wants but Im in no hurry to start crossing them off or aggravating an unnecessary timeline. Ive never in my life been able to just roll with the punches despite my desires. But this time its different because it purely comes down to a connection that cant be denied. She might be a few pages. Maybe a chapter. Im not worried about anything but the fact that when I see her name show up on my phone, something happens to me. Only a fool would walk away from such emotion. It might never be more than those conversations and those few touches. But what I love the most about where Ive come is that I know it is forever a part of me because I allowed it to be. As did she. Life isnt black and white, its not even in a definable shade. But we owe it to ourselves to jump on board for the ride because we deserve the experiences that come from taking chances. I write this with a full heart and excitement to know life is full of these moments. I just have to make sure I allow them. "

I never decided not to; I knew I never would. I remember the first in a series of moments that brought me to you, four years before we met. Weighing multiple life-changing job offers, making the calls to accept one and deny the others. It was cold and raining, the light inside was warm, the floors were hardwood. I was part of a huge adventure spanning thousands of miles, leading eventually to you. I loved you about 40 minutes into our second conversation. I loved you enough not to say it, not to exploit the vulnerability of your failing marriage. I loved you enough to listen to the story of the night you broke up with your boyfriend, the details of how and where it happened, and how it led you home. And I loved you enough that when you knew it, and it was cold and raining again but there was no light inside, I left after you said, ""I'm married."" I don't know what was left unspoken--refusal, justification, explanation--but I didn't want you to have to say it. I love you enough that I only told you about the phone call that brought me to you. I never told you about the others. I might have, if it had only been a funny coincidence of the same state, the same city, the same neighborhood. But when you told me enough to know that I'd said no to being at the same party, a thousand miles away, when you were last alone, I couldn't. I loved you too much to stay friends. I could have handled looking at you and wondering if it could have been us--I can't handle knowing it could have been, and remembering the phone calls that fucked us before I knew you existed. I'm not sure how to end this. It doesn't really feel ""off my chest,"" but I guess it won't. I still love you. I hope you don't know."

What next? When you are out of tears, but the sadness still gnaws at you. What next? I dont know how Im going to get by without you. You were such a big part of my life. My emotional pillar of support, my confidant and my best friend. I keep sitting here thinking of times we had together. Cheesy, I know. But it is the only way I can feel sad and still cry. I look at your toothbrush in my toilet and think of all the times you stayed over. Trying to binge watch series and failing. Trying to stay up as late as we can and only making it till two. The cuddling. God Im going to miss that. I will miss the way you smell. Ive come to associate that smell with comfort and goodness and love. I loved how I just folded into you. The tenderness of your hugs. Your nagging will be missed. How youd always scold me for recycling my clothes. Pushing me to shower when I just felt so lazy. I am so sorry for all my ticks. My short temper, my lack of flexibility, and most ultimately, my unwillingness to share my emotions. You, who feels everything with such depth and intensity, as compared to me whom associates emotions to vulnerability. I am sorry if this has ever caused you pain or loneliness. This hurts so much. Three years that we were together, I dont think I have ever been so happy. We are so young, and still growing. Like you said, our paths are at the place where they can no longer continue together. We need still need to grow, and to do so, we need to be apart. I am not sure how us continuing to be friends will cushion or amplify these feelings of pain and lost, but right now it is comforting I dont have to go cold turkey. You are so precious to me. Im sorry I did not try as hard as I could to be the best partner I could be. I feel like I still need you. I still love you so much. I wish I didnt invite you out today. My pain would have been delayed. Let me have one more day with you. I am not ready. This is so hard already."
700,vulnerability,offmychest,The woes of having a chronically ill parent.,5,3nlphm,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3nlphm/the_woes_of_having_a_chronically_ill_parent/,2015-10-06 05:10:19,"My life has been on trial to the next. From domestic violence to sexual abuse to chronical illness and mental illness. Through it all, for better or worse, I've had my Mum. She's an intelligent woman, a talented musician and composer with 11 different instruments in her repertoire. But as I grew up, she regressed. Becoming sicker and sicker and sicker. When I was fourteen I was forced to live with my estranged father for a month. The end of that period was the first time I ever really felt kicked in the head by my Mum's chronic illness. When I finally saw her again at home all the time I realised that in a month her body had kicked things up a notch. She had involuntary muscle spasms, causing her head to flick back painfully. By this time she was using a cane, but this new part of her illness made things so much more apparent. Things have gone downhill steadily. She was bedridden before I was 18. Forced to use a wheelchair in order to be mobile. Nowadays she's no longer able to hold her bladder. Can't use an arm due to arthritis, which means she can no longer play the instruments she enjoyed. Her breathing is getting more and more erratic when she sleeps, and she's constantly in agony. I moved back in with her temporarily, as I'm between places. I have a world of my own shit to deal with as it is. Now I can hardly sleep, as I'm constantly listening for her to stop breathing, or to cry out in pain. The rest of my family ""help"" her, but really they're only exploiting her vulnerability and giving no quality of life or support back. Every time I rage about these things, I get dismissed because I have a mood disorder. My anger isn't righteous, it's a side-effect of my insomnia, bipolar, and my lapses in medications (which are only happening because I'm in this situation right now, which makes it hard to keep things together). I spend every day thinking about my Mum, and how long she still has left in the world, and the fact that I'm the only member of my family who can see it coming and knows it's coming sooner than later. I'm caught on the fact that when the time comes it's going to fall to me to carry the family and let them all mourn. And it's going to be me who has to be with her in her very last moments, because I'm the only one who'll be able to talk straight with her, set her mind at any kind of ease, and then sort through the aftermath. All of this is compounded by the fact that being here is a huge drain on my finances (due to my family's inability to manage their money), and that is deepening my depression. I just feel like I've been waiting my whole adult life for her to pass away. Since before I even knew how to be a man I was forced to fill the role of the family patriarch, in my mother's stead. I thought I'd gotten away from that in the last few years. Become free from it, and been able to just be. But being back here? Seeing it all unfolding again? I don't think it's something I'm going to get to escape afterall. And I know that for my Mum there's no escaping the long, drawn out, suffering. Trapped in her own body, and leaving the world before she'd even been able to lead a fulfilled life. Thanks for reading."

When I was about 6 or 7, my mother asked, a hint of frustration and confusion in her tone "" why don't you get upset when I punish you for misbehaving?"". My response, in honest bewilderment, was something along the lines of "" I'm going to be punished no matter what and I know why and I knew I should not have done it. What right do I have to be upset?"" I learned later from my sister that that was the wrong move. That it made my mother feel somewhat powerless...or something. I didn't understand but I complied with my sisters suggestion to atleast pretend to be upset. In first grade, I was nearly killed by a classmate jealous of my intelligence and attracted to my lonesome nature. I rarely played the silly games in the asfult yard like the other kids. I watched, waiting eagerly for class to start again. I suppose my anti-social behavior belied a vulnerability I was unaware of. The form of vulnerability that comes from not understanding and not fitting in. The rest of my schooling was not much different. I learned to assimilate because I learned that I was hated and misunderstood for being me and through every tier of my existance, apparently, that would always be. I ignored my interest in electrcity, robots, scifi and architecture, what my mom called ""boy stuff"". I had to change to fit in. I didn't want to be disliked. The inevitable internal conflict this created came to a head the day my 11th grade English teacher asked me to read Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. I read a few chapters. I gave the book away. Each line was like staring into a reflection of everything I learned was disagreeable about me. The main characters, who I related to unlike anyone I had encountered, were despised as I had been. So maybe, everyone was right. I spent the next 7 years in the same camouflaged state my teacher had obviously seen through. Trying desprately to prove to everyone, really to myself, that I am a good person and likable. I gave away alot of time to that endeavor and though I spent the majority of that time in a depression and general uncertainty that lead to many poor choices and squandered opportunities. Until I got tired. I decided to read again, the book my teacher nearly begged me to finish, the book that so painfully reflected myself back at me. By now, I had come to understand that my effort to change was evidence enough of my ""goodness"", I cared enough to edure the pain of it. By now, I had learned the value of different people, I had come to understand that it is impossible to be flawless in a world full of different ideals. By now I learned that essentially sacrificing yourself for the happiness of others, it only complicated both parties finding it. It was beautiful realization. It was time to look back at that reflection to see the value in myself, as myself. This time it didn't hurt. This time I understood that it wasn't I who was the problem, it was the people who lead me to think so with their own negative words and actions. No more ignoring my happiness in favor of making others happy with me. Everyone has their own cause. Everyone has their own values. So what if I am indifferent to most of what others are entertained by, so what if I prefer to spend my leisure time reading medical journals and my social time discussing ideas rather than other people or events. It is all of no consequence to anyone but myself and those who chose to be offended by my ignoring their ideals for my being; The offense being the fault of their own expectations and forced obligations, not of my prefrences or lack of interest. I failed at being myself up until now because I was focused on making others happy by being someone else. I killed who I had become and woke up as myself. "
702,vulnerability,offmychest,The story I'll tell at my dad's funeral.,108,3q395g,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3q395g/the_story_ill_tell_at_my_dads_funeral/,2015-10-25 10:35:35,"First off, my dad's not dead, and there isn't any reason to suggest he will be in the near future either. My point is that usually at a funeral, you would have to come up with some meaningful anecdote about a person, which leads to some kind adjectives to describe them. Before tonight, I would've been forced to tell a sententious story about my dad, twisted to come across as far more significant than it is in reality. But now I have a truly sentimental story about my dad. Earlier tonight, I (being 17 years old and living with my parents) was sitting on my bed watching a podcast, when I heard some strange sounds from downstairs. It's important to note that seeing as we have one of those houses that makes weird noises all the time, this isn't a big deal, and also I could barely distinguish between these vague noises and the sound of my own stomach rumbling. That being said, I sent a text to my mum anyway, asking her calmly what she thought of the 'weird' noises downstairs. I was surprised to hear a conversation coming from my parents room instead of receiving a simple response followed by the sound of my dad putting on a robe and walking down the stairs. As I left my room to follow him, my heartbeat started pounding as I realised that this wasn't merely an obligatory 'plod round the house to put your child's mind to rest'. He seemed urgent. While he carried out a methodical search of each room in the house, he showed no level of reluctance or hesitation. I would even say that he was eager to find any strangers lurking in our home. Anticlimax warning: there was nothing out of the ordinary. When walking back into the house from the extension, he explained to me that my mum had forgotten to switch her phone to silent, which had woken them both up, and I retorted that I hadn't expected him to look round the house. Then he told me that ""If somebody was in our house, I want the chance to stab them"". That's the part of the story that will stay with me. I know that my dad doesn't mind a fight (possibly even enjoying them) but like any other sane human, I know my dad has fears too. In that moment, there were no signs of vulnerability in my dad, as he clearly took the idea of an intruder seriously, and actively sought them out. Although my dad's never been shy of affection, this was a display of how much we mean to him. Any sort of personal danger he could suffer was frankly disregarded as second place to the safety of his family. If you read this sentence, then I'd like to thank you for getting this far. It would mean a lot to me if I could share this with someone."

I'm not militant vegan, I'm not a crazy cat lady, I just can't muster up sympathy for people suffering as easily as I feel for animals in need. Maybe it's their vulnerability to human cruelty, maybe it's their simplicity and lack of capacity for maliciousness, maybe it's just that they're cuter than people. Given a chance to save a cat or a stranger, I would want to save the cat more. I think realistically speaking I would save the person, but it would only be out of fear of judgement from others. I would mourn that hypothetical cat far more than any hypothetical stranger. Is it wrong to feel this way?"

709,vulnerability,offmychest,Coming out ruined my life,85,3cggkc,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3cggkc/coming_out_ruined_my_life/,2015-07-08 04:46:26,"Grab a cup of coffee and put on your reading glasses, cause here we go! &amp;nbsp; I hate being gay. &amp;nbsp; My ""life"" completely fell apart the day I decided that I was no longer going to hide that I was gay. I had been dating a woman and going through some pretty awful family things: an alcoholic brother, another perpetually distant brother, an emotional absent father, and an over-involved mother. &amp;nbsp; The thing is, I broke up with this woman because I wasn't finding the support in her that I needed to deal with my brothers situation. He was in and out of the hospital and I was afraid he might die; meanwhile she had lost her father to alcoholism and suicide when she was younger, and I completely understand that this would be extremely sensitive for he. Instead she was moving forward too fast and talking about marriage and babies (we are both opera singers, and if you don't know, raising a family as an opera singer is a very difficult thing to do and requires incredible timing as to not ruin the flow of your career.) In all honesty she was moving way too fast for me when I all I wanted to do was move backwards in time and try to fix everything that had torn my family apart. Combined with her understandable distance to my brother's situation, I had to get out of that relationship. &amp;nbsp; I had always known I liked men more than women. In fact, I had always known that I only liked men in a sexual way. But I loved women, and I loved the idea of getting married, having children, and raising the family I wish I had when I was a child. That was the dream for me. I was going through counselling in regards to my brother and happened to bring up my recent break-up. After some talking, my counsellor asked if I had ever really acted upon my thoughts of men... at that time, I felt like my whole world was falling apart, so I decided to change things up and actually follow my own heart for a while and see if it brought new light to my life. &amp;nbsp; I had gay friends who always pressured me into coming out, even while I was dating my ex (the opera world is small, close, and cruel.) I had been teased by family and friends for being gay as a child (go small town rural living!) I finally broke, and I came out to my gay friends first and said ""FINE, I AM GAY!"" The immediate support I found was incredible, people saying ""yes! you can finally be yourself!"" I felt really good, and for the first time ever I felt loved and respected. I came out to all my friends, and pretty much the entire community. I did not, and still have not come out to my parents, which works because they are completely removed from my world. &amp;nbsp; That's when everything changed and started to go downhill. The other major piece of this puzzle is that I hate men. I am afraid of them. They intimidate me. I feel uncomfortable around them. I had an uncle who... did things... to me when I was young (mostly inappropriate language and sexual descriptions, I don't think there was any touching) but it always just fostered a weird feeling towards men in me. The men in my family were mean, hurtful, physically harmful, and psychologically destructive. I was afraid of my house and in high school I took on extra-curriculars and a job to stay away from home as much as possible. I was never friends with the boys in my school, I was afraid they wouldn't like me or hurt me, and I just never liked the conversations (sports, girls, testosterone). I was ""gifted"" and into arts. I was never really bullied and could stand up for myself, but my answer to fear was avoidance. &amp;nbsp; I started to come out to my straight male friends, the typical type that I was most afraid of, and subsequently fell in ""love"" with one of them. In fact, I would say it's the closest I have ever felt being in ""love"" even after dating several women in my youth. I did everything for this guy; I tried to make him feel better, I did errands for him, I fantasized about us... I was the best boyfriend ever, but he was my ""buddy."" I knew nothing would ever happen, so I used the vulnerability of my brothers situation and the fact that I was having a major life change as a fact for just being SUPER helpful and needy. We are still good friends, and I still love him, but it's been an incredibly difficult and hurtful journey to remind myself that he is straight and I will never be with him in that way. &amp;nbsp; So that was the first major downfall. Then there was the whole ""label"" that comes along with being gay. Suddenly I had to be a different person to be gay. I wanted to date, which meant apps and websites, which meant deciding if I was a bottom or top, or a twink or bear, or mass or fem, or this and that.... I have always been a chubby guy, I hated my weight, and I hate my appearance. I have never felt ""beautiful"". So how was I supposed to ""market"" myself to other men, men that I am actually afraid of but strangely want to have sex with. I cam across the bear community, which I instantly fell in love with. It was like the little glimmer in a sea of ego and narcissism. I grow an amazing beard, and I have quite a bit of body hair, and I'm bigger, so I immediately felt right. But even within the bear community, there is so much distinction and pickiness. Are you a muscle bear, a chub(which I am and hate being), are you straight acting, are you a cub, an otter, or any other type of animal... &amp;nbsp; When I was dating women, it was so easy - do I like them and do they make me happy, that's all that mattered. Now that I am trying to date men it's so freaking complicated!!! Am I scared of them? Am I their type? Are they my type? Do I have enough body hair? Am I really sure they like fat men? I can't even pin down the fears that go through my head. It's simply ""what if they don't like me?"" That was NEVER a fear when I was dating women. &amp;nbsp; I went on three dates with a guy I was REALLY interested in, but he just never called back. I hooked up with a guy in a different city soon after; it was horrible, halfway through I wanted to stop but decided to push through... I cried the entire drive home. I haven't dated or had sex since, and that was about 2 years ago. I went from wanting a family and children to never wanting to get married, never wanting children. I have sexual desires that I am afraid to talk about, even though I know they are common. It's like a giant wall went up the day I came out, and even though I think the other side will be somehow better than anything I have ever experienced, the wall is monumentally more difficult to break down. Sometimes I feel like I should just shell out a bunch of money, hire an ""escort"" and just do all the things that burn inside of me, and just get it over with in hopes that something will be revealed. But in reality, what can you gain from paying someone to like you? Haven't I done that enough by lying to all my friends and family about what I really want and how I really feel? &amp;nbsp; Luckily, I still kept my career in line and have actually began to succeed as a singer. Thankfully my desire to perform outweighs my happiness personally, but it's about the only thing that keeps me going. I can't live like this forever. &amp;nbsp; Would it have been so wrong to just continue to look for a family, still have a great career, and just be happy? Why did I ever think that going down the path I was most afraid of would somehow bring me happiness??? &amp;nbsp; In the end, some good has come of this; I have began to work out and watch my health in hopes of changing my body shape into a more muscular bear type... I have also built up a support system that has been more helpful than ever in my life. I have great friends that I cherish. But I've adopted this ""gay"" personality. I talk about sex all the time - even though I never have any. I talk about gay rights and how liberating it all feels - even though I am not interested in marriage. I act like a ""bear"" and all my friends call me a ""bear"" - that might be the one positive thing that I have going for being gay. I do that ""masc"" thing where you act all tough and rough, but it still doesn't ""feel"" right. &amp;nbsp; I am a very sensitive and empathetic person. It's part of what makes me believe I am born to be a performer; I like to take the feelings of others - characters - and share them with the world in hopes that they might find some truth inside themselves. Somehow I feel like this makes me weak in real life, but amazing powerful in career. &amp;nbsp; The vision I have always had for myself is to be a strong, confident, cool man. I grew up in the country, and those were the men I admired the most. They didn't talk much, but they always knew what to say when needed. They were strong and supported their family. They didn't get emotional and remained rational and cool in the time of need. And when they did get emotional, it was beautiful because it was completely honest. They didn't care about their looks, yet somehow stayed beautiful and masculine. &amp;nbsp; That is the man I want to be, and in all reality, I want a man like that in my life. The men I actually fall for either don't like me, or are straight. I could be that man for a woman, but I can't seem to be that for a man. What happened? &amp;nbsp; I just want to be saved. I have tried to save myself, but I find myself wound deeper into the image that I believe others have of me. I actually make decisions based on what that would look like to someone else. I don't think I ever cared what others really thought about me until after I came out. And if I did, I somehow suppressed it until it didn't matter. &amp;nbsp; Does it get better? **tl;dr I don't actually hate being gay... I just hate myself** "

I'll never be the same.,65,3cu80t,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3cu80t/my_daughter_was_assaulted_by_my_nephew_ill_never/,2015-07-11 06:35:37,"Long story short I lived with my brother (9 years older) right out of high school. I moved from my hometown to a beach town to live with my ""cool"" older brother. Well turns out he was dating (and subsequently impregnated) a teenager. Not cool for obvious reasons. He was 27 and she was 14/15. Also, he ended up getting two felonies slapped on him for exposing himself on two different occasions (one of which was to a child) doing things I'd rather not get in to.... Weird, creeper, liar, needs help... all that. I moved out and eventually back to my home town. Complicating factor: my brother and I married sisters. I married the *older* sister. No, it wasn't a family affair or anything odd/weird, the two sisters are as polar opposites as my brother and I. Imagine if four totally unrelated people met and two pairs resulted. It was like that. Down the road my wife and I had a daughter but our marriage unfortunately ended in divorce. We are civil and raise our daughter together. Both of us have moved on and are in good places now. Fast forward a lot of years. Relationship w/ brother is strained, awkward but there was a sort of uneasy alliance in that we are brothers and don't need to be bff's. We get along ok and whatever. It goes on like this until bomb goes off: his son, the one who is the product of the scandalous relationship 16 yrs ago, sexually assaults my 9 y/o daughter. Every parent's worst nightmare to say the least. I felt, I don't know, responsible because I *knew* his dad was into young girls and maybe should have been watching/careful to see if his son exhibited similar behaviors.... There was another victim as well. My nephew's 7 y/o step-sister (forgot to mention my brother and his wife had divorced not long after my ex and I had ~ the brothers married to sisters thing was done and over after about 8 years total). Nephew's 7 y/o step sister refused to talk about the incidents officially. She confided them to her immediate family but that was the end of it. She mysteriously refused to divulge anything once things got official. Whether my brother (her step-father) or someone else coached or chided I will never know. I pray for that girl... Needless to say I freaked out. Pressed charges, to hell with him being my nephew, **no way** was I going to sweep this under the rug as I was encouraged to do by, naturally, my brother (the perps dad) and, most heartbreakingly, *my daughter's mother and my own father*.... The alliances of the two sisters (ex-wife and creeper jr's mom) is strong. Their mother committed suicide about 8 years ago. It was a messed up situation obviously. Those two have seen some sh!t. It's awful. Their allegiance to each other is the only tangible loyalty either of them have ever understood. I get that but when it comes to the kids... I don't care if you're my identical twin who donated his organs to save my life. You mess with my kids you are dead to me. This was all three years ago. The nephew cried to the judge, apologized (**never confessed**), said all the right things and got a commuted sentence. He's about to turn 18. Not sure if I'm relieved that if he does it again he'll actual consequences or if he's finally old enough for me to meet him in a dark alley and go angry father on his ass. My daughter is an amazing young lady. She seems to have rebounded and is on her feet steadily. I try really hard to watch little things with her for depression, suppression, smiling though pain, those sorts of things and from what I unprofessionally glean she is genuinely ok. As for me I got some medical issues out of this. Severe vertigo for about a year and half. Depression. Drinking. Bitterness and loss of trust of people I loved and trusted. Broken heart. Desperate feelings of vulnerability that I couldn't protect my little girl. To this day my parents and I aren't very close anymore. My dad essentially thinks I made too big a deal about this and ""turned on my own"" (literally a quote from my aunt as to what my dad was trying to convince her). I won't go near my brother or his kid and my daughter doesn't either. My parents took my nephew in during this whole trial ordeal. This was mind boggling to me. The boy was supposed to sit in juvenile detention for a month. I wanted him there. I wanted him scared out of his mind around other criminals. I wanted him scared straight... There is no feeling in the world like going into a court room and sitting on the opposite side of your brother, dad, father of your daughter, and see them all supporting, tapping on the shoulder with smiles and condolences, the sex offender of your little girl. Sitting there in court trying to sort through the pain I felt for my daughter and trying to suppress the seeds of hatred that were trying really hard to sprout inside me towards my dad, brother, nephew and ex-wife.... I'm not sure I was successful to be honest. I've never been the same. The whole experience haunts me in a way that I have learned to hide well. I watch my daughter like a freaking hawk. I overreact to family drama too often. I'm an unforgiving asshole in general now. What I pray, after all of this, is that the stand I took to report this and separate my daughter from that situation will one day be something she looks back on with gratitude. I don't need a thank you. Seeing her grow up to have a healthy viewpoint on relationships, trust, sex and intimacy would be an underdog for the win story. I also hope my nephew turns out ok. Though I'll probably never reach out to him. I think if he died I would be sad for him but, dammit, part of me has become so cold and numb I'm not 100% sure at least some small part of me wouldn't feel at least a tad less threatened that he'll ever go after my daughter again... Jesus I feel like a monster saying that. I love my nephew or at least I did, very much so, and we were close until this happened. TL;DR: daughter was sexually assaulted by nephew. Nephew's father is a creeper too. My whole family, including my ex-wife, essentially rallied in support of nephew. I've become a secretly bitter, unforgiving, relentless a-hole."

It becomes easier with every passing interaction to empty myself of these things, and replace them with you. Im still getting used to all of this. I can still feel the slight change I instinctively make to my persona to separate my vulnerability from you when were together. But I can also feel that jolt when one of us goes in for the kill to make contact with the others hand, a public display against both our naturesnatures we are simultaneously eager and hesitant to set aside. I can feel that affection you are used to stifling when you pull me in closer while we kiss. Its funny how evolution is on our side to make reading the subtle cues of this business so intuitive.

I don't want to live with anyone - and most of all, I don't want the people I care about to know how I feel. I'm often tempted to post to my facebook, or send a text to my friends when I feel down. but most of the time, I simply don't know what to say. I don't want to be a burden. I don't want to share my vulnerability when I'm committed to getting over it. I've come to a realization lately. I'm probably never going to get over it. There is help out there, and it has improved things. But I've run the usual treatment gamut. I've taken medication (zoloft, wellbutrin, cymbalta) and I'm currently on clonazapam. They aren't great medications. They have caused more problems then they have solved. I've done cognitive behaviour therapy. And it helps. to a point. I guess I don't know what to do or where to go from here. I guess I just wanted to write my feelings down... see if anyone has gone through this and won."

I've gone to a couple counselors and discovered my eating disorders from high school and college were basically rooted in the awful timing my parents decided to move us 2 hours away in elementary school. Then, I was bullied from middle school to high school. In high school I got my first boyfriend. Fell in love for the first time. I'm a true believer that people are good, and I don't give up on anyone unless it's the absolute end of the line. I give second and third chances. Well, I gave many more than that to my ex. He physically, emotionally and sexually abused me. I finally broke up with him 3 years later in college, once I met a new guy I became friends with and realized I could do better. My ex was manipulative and tried to get me back for months. When I went to pick up my things at his house, he left an engagement ring and a note in it. Of course I said hell no. Fast forward to the guy I met, a rebound relationship that lasted 9 months. He was so fun and I had new freedoms that I didn't have before. He wasn't like my ex, who called me names and thought I cheated on him with my guy friends. Unfortunately, the guy who wasn't like my ex had a bad side of his own. He sexually abused me. When he broke up with me, he said he never loved me and that he used me for my money and my body. I went off the deep end. Cried a lot. Then a month later I got a Tinder and decided to be spontaneous for the first time in my life. On Tinder I met a guy, had my first one night stand, and got the feels. The next day I met a new guy on Tinder, but this time I didn't want sex, because I liked the guy from the night before. I invited him over for homework help. He said he knew physics, and I trusted him to help. The story turns bad again here because he raped me. I reported it to the police. It was the first time I realized I was raped, and it opened up a world of hurt. I finally realized I had been in 2 abusive relationships, and that they had raped me before I ever knew the word applied to anything in my life. After I filed the police report, I waited months for an answer, just to be told that his hands on my shoulders couldn't be forceful and that it was just ""a means to sex"". They dropped the case there. I took it to campus, where we were both students. It's been 6 months since I reported to campus. It went to a hearing where they found him in violation of the student code - and dismissed him from campus. Then he appealed, and the point of the appeals board was supposed to make sure the decision was warranted. Instead, they re-heard the case. They found him not in violation and therefore was allowed to stay on campus. They basically substituted it for the original decision, which was against policy. It threw me into major depression because it's frightening being on the same small campus as my rapist. I started getting bad with my cutting and eating disorder around this time too, so that became a big issue. I was hospitalized 3 times for 5-8 hours at a time. I decided to appeal to the decision, with a final appeal available to me. I invited a close guy friend over for the weekend with the hope that he could help me write my appeal. My so-called friend promptly raped me the night after I turned in my appeal letter. I was intoxicated and had run out of my anti-depressants at the time, so I have no memory of the events. All I wanted that night was to celebrate putting in my appeal and being nearly done with the case. Instead, my ""friend"" took advantage of my vulnerability. I found out soon after he left that my university appealed the decision of the hearing too. It would have been exciting, had I not been re-traumatized just days before. I since filed a police report last week for the second rape. Every night since then, I've cut severely deep and I've been depressed and feel so hopeless in my life. Today I decided I need to be hospitalized with intensive care, or my life is at risk. I'm cutting worse and worse, and I'm not suicidal yet, but the more I cut, the more I feel myself falling there. I told my dad that I needed to go to the special facility. It holds me there for a week or 2 with group and individual therapy. The first question he asked was how much it cost, rather than if I was okay. He doesn't know about the 2nd rape, eating disorder or cutting. All he knows is I have PTSD from the 1st rape, but he should still support me in knowing I need help. Especially if why I am asking to be hospitalized is because I am so low in my life that I might be borderline suicidal. My best friend is currently on his way to see me because he's worried about my safety. I can't be hospitalized until Monday, so he's staying with me until this weekend. This weekend was ironically supposed to be my Burn Party, where I burn the couch from the 1st rape. I had it planned before the 2nd one happened, and it's just all gone downhill from there. I need to get all of this out of my system, or I'm not going to be around much longer. I can't keep hurting myself like this. I don't know what to do. I don't know who I can trust. And this timing is the worst thing in the world."

Shes anxious, introverted and deals with problem in an aggressive way in order to hide her own vulnerability and fear of abandon. As for me, Im generally a very anxious yet extravert person with a tendency toward self-loathing. As such, I tend to delay responsibility, use denial and not be present By that I mean in the moment. Always in my head, listening to myself Im pretty self-absorbed, am not really confident in my own judgement (which is probably why Im here on reddit) and generally speaking not truly your go-to-guy when it comes to practical problems.

I do not feel l can fill that void and help her heal, that she is ready to be with me and not blinded by her past. Yet the pressure rises, especially on her side She misses living with a guy But I just cant feel it Its just supposed to be natural right ?

But fuck, here's something i grew up to hate, and now I'm the object of hatred, a person giving excuses, but they could be seen as factors, right? as long as i know where i wanna go, doesn't matter, right? i dunno, i'm just ranting. Toni Morrison put it so elegantly in The Bluest Eye: ""The death of self-esteem can occur quickly, easily in children, before their ego has legs, so to speak. Couple the vulnerability of youth with indifferent parents, dismissive adults, and a world, which, in its language, laws, and images, re-enforces despair, and the journey to destruction is sealed."" I started smoking weed about 6 months ago. Took an interest in linguistics. Would like to know more about it. Want to change the world by changing how children are brought up, i want to know more about philosophy so i can write a book about it, or a series of books aimed at children to help them think, to provide structures of thinking so that the child is brought up able to express their views adequately. I want to know more about linguistics because I want to know how to take these things in my head and translate them into symbols which can be understood, but i'm just ranting so there may be a slight loss of information. i looked up graduate scholarships for linguistics in MIT so i can escape, they want an above 4.0 GPA, I think after the massacre of this semester, my cumulative average will plummet even more from 85 to high 70's, which means a 2.3 average. and it's gonna be a extremely difficult to get that to a 4.0 GPA, if not entirely impossible. maybe the dean would like his dick sucked i dunno. holy fuck i don't want to stay here but i'm a fucking idiot why did i skip why did i not put more effort why jesus fuck, i want to do it all over again jesus fucking christ i want somebody to tell me it's ok to comfort me but i know it's not, and i don't know what to do right now other than cry. but i'm not crying. hah i'm too used to disappointment that i disappoint myself. i want to beat myself up for skipping every class, i want to beat myself up for not applying myself harder to my studies, i want to beat myself up for being a sloth bastard all throughout the semester, it's like there's two people in me, one wants to know more, the other just wants to being a sloth bastard and smoke weed all day and do nothing. i think it's time the person who wants to know more to take over. but before that, i have to kill the sloth bastard. question is, how? sorry, if this looks like a long winded rant... but i just came home after a butched exam (that i didn't study because the sloth bastard thought it would be easy, which it sorta was, but it would have been better and the answers could be more clear) and thought about my future. good fucking god, i am an idiot, whatever advice you give me i'll go by it first couple of days then the sloth bastard takes over and the cycle of self-hatred begins again. sigh... help. please."

To avoid vulnerability we numb and we make the uncertain certain. I am scared to death of being vulnerable to someone and actually having a relationship last because everyone in the past has left. I feel I don't deserve happiness and have a very pessimistic attitude towards everything in life. All relationships end and that's that. I go for emotionally unavailable men because it takes away the uncertainty. I know for a fact it will end when I get involved so that I know what to expect. I don't believe true happiness exists. Maybe for other people it does but not for me. Some people in life have to take all the shit so others can be happy and I'm the one who takes the bad so others can have good. I'm afraid to find out if happiness does exist because I judge my future based on my past and know that when you go up and feel good about things it will all coming crashing down again. I shouldn't try to achieve happiness because the let down after such a good high would be worse than never being happy. All of my beliefs are paradoxical. I want happiness but I'm afraid to achieve it. I want a good relationship but I'm too afraid to actually have one work. I want my life to be stable for once but I'm afraid of it going into chaos again. My fears prevent me from acting and so nothing changes. And then my depression creeps up higher and makes me want something better but I am keeping myself stuck. My therapist avoids this terminology but I am self sabotaging my life by doing this. I'm lost, I'm confused, I want something better than this but I can't get over the fear of actually having something better. I need to start believing I deserve more than this and that I deserve to be happy. I need to learn that being vulnerable is actually the key to being happy and I need to start letting people in instead of building a wall around my emotions. I'm a very genuine person. What you see is what you get but I don't let my emotions show. I truly believe I'm a great catch and any guy would be lucky to have me but I'm too afraid to find someone to be vulnerable with. I have issues with feeling like I'm a burden on people and being vulnerable and showing people my emotions, to me, seems like I am burdening them with my emotional problems. I want to make things better I just don't know how to start."

We're a group of college-aged guys. He is the type of guy who will bring up in conversation my old embarrassing moments from the past. It really annoys me, and it makes me feel embarrassed. I observe when it happens to him, he acts defensive or stifled, which to me is indicative that he doesn't like it when people do it to him. It pisses me off that he does something to me which he does not like having done to him. This guy often gets on my nerves because he does things which makes me feel shame and embarrassment. For example, I hate how he always makes fun of my laugh and smile. I'm insecure about my laugh and smile, but it's something that I keep to my self. He literally points and laughs at me in my face when I'm smiling hard or laughing. I want to tell him to stop, but I truthfully fear the vulnerability of admitting that I have body image issues. He also filmed me without my awareness 3 years ago when I was drunk for the first time, and it's a very embarrassing video of me, borderline humiliating. He still keeps a 3 year old video of me on his phone to show people. It's not like he brings up this video a lot, but it's something that he still brings up every now and then, even if it was a long time ago. Quite frankly, the fact that a guy with his tendencies to embarrass people has this video of me makes me feel shame and paranoia. I remember during that same time around 3 years ago, he thought I was filming him when he was on some drunk shit (which I was not, because I was just holding my phone in his direction), and said, ""Hey, fuck you, don't film me."" Once again, I was angered by the fact that this guy has no problem doing it to me but gets defensive if someone were to do it to him. To sum it off, I hold resentment and anger towards him for a lot of shit that he does. However, I feel like I can't express my true feelings about all of this, because I'm in a group of college age guys where doing that could be viewed as weakness, as me taking myself too seriously, as being butthurt, or as being ""salty"". All this time, when he does things to embarrass me, I feign laughter or fake a smile to make it seem like it doesn't bother me. But it does. Shit, I could be taking myself too seriously. But I also want to be honest with how I feel and stand up to my own personal boundaries. Reddit, how I should I deal with this? "

They were talking about how these men are obsessed with them, won't stop texting them, and keep asking them to be their girlfriends when they're just using them for sex. Very superficial conversation. I asked them what makes them insecure and they tried to convince me that they never get insecure, in fact, they're always confident and secure with themselves. So I asked them when the last time they stepped out of their comfort zone was. The last time they tried a new skill, had a novel experience. Because anytime you step out of your comfort zone to try something new, it's uncomfortable and you get a little insecure at first. It seemed like they read in Cosmopolitan magazine to always be confident. It's the ultimate sin to ever show weakness and insecurity. Our culture is essentially training people to be robots- never let your guard down, never show vulnerability! Men, never cry. Never talk about your feelings. Women, act confident in everything! Don't step out of your comfort zone, you might suck at it, so don't risk feeling insecure. Anyway, these girls came across as disingenuous and fake. "

For the last few months my school has been trying to expel me and a few other students because we reported a security vulnerability which allowed private student reports to be accessible publicly. This has induced no small amount of stress, but fortunately I had the support of (most of) my professors. During the last few weeks of my last quarter, I was forced to pay catch-up and prioritize between classes. I chose to focus on one that I felt I was doing poorly in at the expense of one I felt I was doing well in (English). Unfortunately I ended up missing a passing grade in English by some twenty points -- less than one assignment's worth. I'm frantically trying to contact the professor to see if there's anything I can do to change the grade (there's a 40-day grace period for ""instructor errors""), but so far she hasn't responded to anything. It looks like the administrative issues will be resolving themselves positively, which leaves me in the terribly ironic position of being"" allowed"" to receive a degree but not having earned it due to tripping at the finish line. I leave the state tomorrow to move to a house we've bought, the mortgage payments for which we can only afford if I get to keep the job offer I've received which is dependent upon my degree. My company doesn't know yet that I didn't get it, and I don't know what to do. I've gone suddenly from having a very comfortable job prospect and finally (after five years!) being able to support my family... to possibly losing said job offer and having to attend a school on the opposite side of the country (or attend a local school for not less than a year) and having to pay back a $50000 scholarship. I don't know what to do."

When we are together I have to be touching you. I touch your shoulder or hold your hand, the tension eases. Often I get home after you have gone to bed. I get undressed as quietly as I can but I have to do it in the other room, excitement makes me clumsy. I slip into bed and slide in tight against your back. Its a release. I feel all the tension melt away. You're hot, like 100 degrees. I inhale your scent, it's like I haven't had a breath until now. You let out this quiet little sigh of contentment. It's what I live for. If I pull away you groan with displeasure. Makes my fucking day to know you feel the same need. It's not just lust, it's not just love. It's pure vulnerability. You leave yourself completely in my hands, body and soul. For the first time in my life I leave myself completely in yours. When I hold you in my arms I want to shield you from the world. When you hold me in yours I feel valued. I feel cared for like never before. Nothing else matters to me except that little sigh. It's my reward, it's my goal, it's the only thing I care about. I never thought I could feel this way. I never thought I could feel this need. I'm addicted to you. This is my reply to the best love note I've ever received!

It's definitely gotten better with age, experience, therapy and medication but I can't shake off the feeling that it's going to get the better of me one day. That this illness will be the death of me. I wear my heart on my sleeve. Even when I struggle to express emotions in a straightforward way, I tend to make that known. I tell the people who don't know me that well or are just getting to know me that when I poke fun, it's my way of showing affection. I know that openness and vulnerability will inevitably lead to me getting hurt really bad eventually, but I think I'd rather die a kind, empathetic, loving person than living to an old age as a bitter, jaded husk of a human being."

726,vulnerability,offmychest,I crashed my twin brother's new motorcycle today,1,31kkd8,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/31kkd8/i_crashed_my_twin_brothers_new_motorcycle_today/,2015-04-06 09:51:17,"A few weeks ago, with his tax return, my dad bought a pair motorcycles for himself and my mom. They've been wanting to get back to riding for a while since they had to sell their old bikes during the height of the recession. My twin brother and I had been interested in motorcycles as well, but he actually bought one. I didn't. It was the first thing he's ever had that is completely his own. It's in his name, he makes the payments, he pays the insurance, and he's very proud of it. I don't even have my motorcycle permit yet, but my parents suggested we all go out for a ride today and have some fun. My mom rode with my dad, and I rode her motorcycle. My brother, of course, rode his own. Later, my brother had to go to work and my parents and I were going to be visiting friends on the motorcycles. I was going to be riding my brother's (with his permission). He told me I better not break it/drop it/etc. His bike is awesome. I had very few problems riding it and had been very cautious. Everything was going great until it wasn't. The whole time, my mom rode led the way, I was behind her, and my dad was behind me. We pulled up to a stop sign, and my mom turned right, and I followed her, and my dad followed me - completely as planned. My mom had gotten pretty far ahead of me, I had only accelerated to about 25 mph or so when I car came around the corner with its turning signal on. It was going to be turning across my lane onto a road that leads to a truck stop/gas station. I was so sure that the car would wait for me to pass because cars should always let motorcycles have lots of time and space due to their vulnerability and such. I was so wrong. Instead, the car accelerated and whipped across the road in front of me (a very bad call on the driver's part). I laid on the brakes too strongly and immediately lost control (both rookie mistake and consequence of shitty driver's shitty driving). The front tire skid and turned the wheel to the left and I fell down to the right on my head, shoulder, and hip (thank god for my brother's BRAND NEW HELMET). I slid about 20ft on the ground and quickly jumped up when I stopped. I was a little disoriented, not badly hurt, but felt *awful*. That was my brother's brand new motorcycle. I looked at the car and it just kept going. I don't even think the driver knew what happened. My dad didn't see the car turn in front of me because he was looking at something else, but he did see me fall. He stopped immediately, asked if I was ok and helped me pick up the bike. He asked if I could still ride and let me get sorted out again. My mom had kept going, but came back after a minute or two. We assessed the damage - small scratch on the front fender and brake handle, ripped leather on the bike, and a destroyed turn signal. I was so relieved that the damage was minimal and that I was pretty okay, but it's been 3 hours and I can't shake that sunken heart feeling. We never found or even looked for the car/driver, not that we could do anything since I was illegally riding anyways. But that driver doesn't know what they did was wrong, my brother's bike is still damaged, and I still feel utterly *awful*. The first thing I did when I got home was order a new helmet and turn signal. The the scratches aren't so bad, but if my brother wants them taken care of then I must oblige. I'm sure he will be understanding and this will be the butt of many jokes for time to come, but this has me really jazzed up. In addition to the bike damages, I also ruined a new, expensive coat I treated myself to this winter and my brother's brand new helmet. The coat cost me $150 and I planned on getting a few years out of it before retiring it but now it's all torn up. The helmet cost me another $50 to replace. The turn signal was $30. My parents told me I should wait until he gets home to tell him. I really think he'll take it well, especially because I already bought him new stuff. But he doesn't know yet and I had to tell someone and figured you guys here on /r/offmychest would be the ones to tell. Side note: Motorcycle safety is a big deal guys. I've always been taught to be conscious of bikes on the road. It's not just about the motorcycle driver being safe, it's about everyone around them. We all use the roads together, and we ***must*** do it safely. Please, take extra caution when you're driving around motorcycles. My fall could have ended up being a whole lot worse than it actually was, and I'm thankful it wasn't any worse, but it didn't have to happen at all. Motorcycles are inherently risky, and I assumed the risk when I drove one today, but my safety is in everyone else's hands when I'm on the road. "
727,vulnerability,offmychest,I'm Not Ok,5,330lhy,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/330lhy/im_not_ok/,2015-04-18 19:42:23,"We all wear masks. The mask I wear is not particularly impressive. I don't go out of my way to seem happy, sociable, or successful. I wear a mask of stable, moderate, and together. Below my mask though is the face of turmoil and instability. People often comment that I seem quiet and laid back when inside I often feel volatile and emotional. My emotional impulses are such that if I didn't control them I would probably have alienated all those around me a long time ago. When I was eighteen I started to suffer from depression and social anxiety, well that's when I was diagnosed anyway. During that period and the years following I would fluctuate between anger, anxiety, sadness, and happiness. I was very reactive to every little emotion I felt. I would love someone one day and feel rage toward them the next which would lead me to lash out. Self isolation would suit me for awhile and then I would want to be sociable. Sometimes I became so overwhelmed by my emotions I would shut down altogether. Often times I considered offing myself but there were times I desperately wanted to live. I was very unstable. That instability bled into all areas of my life. It affected me academically, vocationally, socially, physically, and financially. I was so off kilter I don't know how I made it through those years. For awhile I thought maybe that's how everyone felt. I mean nobody seemed to notice anything odd with my behavior. Then I went away to college and everything changed. I met people there who saw my vulnerability and instability Townies, faculty, and staff had all reached out to me at one point to let me know I wasn't ok in one way or another. These people were not my peers and to this day I have no clue what made them able see I was in crisis when even my family had no idea. I remember the moments when these people reached out to me like it was yesterday. My advisor and her assistant pulled me aside to encourage me to seek counseling. A creative writing professor suggested I try to connect with other black students or otherwise seek community. A commons desk staff member who I worked with reached out to me and said ""I just want to let you know that it does get better."" Those instances angered me, because I didn't consider them people allowed to be in the know. They didn't know me intimately and if they could see my instability, my weakness, then everyone could. That was when I first started to wear my mask of stability. I started to hold back my emotions. I wouldn't really express anything I was feeling strongly because I was afraid it would expose my instability or what me and a friend eventually called my crazy. I started to observe the reactions of those around around me on the occasion I did express my emotions for clues about how appropriate it was. I quickly learned what people found odd or weren't interested in hearing and stopped sharing those feelings and thoughts. I think I was doing an ok job too for the most part. When I was 22 I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Nobody saw it coming but then again who wants to? The symptoms that come with it namely psychosis and paranoia are really challenging to navigate the world with. The addition of this diagnosis just made my mask thicker. Truthfully I'm still that unstable person on the inside. Over the years I have just learned how better manage it. I stopped lashing out, tempered my anger with love, I fight the impulse to isolate, and generally just ride the waves of the negative, positive, and lack of emotions I feel with the awareness that it will pass. I never really get to relax and be at peace though which isn't fun. There is a lot of effort dedicated to keeping my mental illness from affecting my life. The thing that's really hard is I can't really express this to anyone in my life. At times when things get ready bad I have found myself leaning on people a little more, sharing more; but I don't think they get it because they aren't worried. I'm worried about myself. The perception I have is that those in my life see me as capable. As capable of taking care of myself and being a productive adult. But sometimes its hard. I'm struggling and I desperately want a respite. But there is no sympathy in the world for a tired and beaten down man, especially one struggling with mental illness. So I hide my weariness. For all the sharing I do I still hold back. I can't allow people to see how utterly out of control and broken I am inside because that would make me vulnerable. Vulnerability begets hurt. Hurt brings back the shame and anger I felt back when I was younger. I do everything I can to avoid being in the headspace, it's a dangerous place for me to be. So I don't express to anyone that I want to give up on life sometimes. That some days it all seems so futile. Where they see progress I just see more challenges. People don't seem to like discussing weakness and that puts me off opening up about my own. Its getting harder and harder to wear this mask and carry all this on my own though. I don't think I can keep holding all this inside. I feel like if I do it will one day destroy me. It already causes me to be an addict, I use sleeping pills to escape myself in times of anguish. I'm not ok and I can finally peek from behind my mask to openly admit that."
728,vulnerability,offmychest,I lie and I'm easy.,6,332cmw,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/332cmw/i_lie_and_im_easy/,2015-04-19 07:17:27,"**Holy TL;DR: I grew up in a cult where I had to lie about my thoughts, likes, desires, behavior, and anything that wasn't spoon-fed to me as a survival mechanism. Now I'm afraid of any kind of honesty or vulnerability and can't have functional relationships as a result.** In the interest of full disclosure both my mother and step-father had mental illness that resulted in me internalizing other destructive issues I've mostly worked out. I don't feel they are necessarily the source of the lying but I would feel amiss not mentioning it. I was born into a doomsday cult and had no concept of the outside world aside from what I was told by members and leaders of the cult until I was about ten. From the time I was four any time I chose to admit something contrary to the authorized position or just made a mistake I ended up being taken to three ""counselors"" whose job it was to basically verbally rip me apart and beat me down mentally and emotionally. Pride, self-esteem, and being a woman were literally sins that required confession. I was a very curious child who always wanted to know why something was done one way and not another. This was viewed as a threat and so between the ages of eight and fourteen I had been the focus of our entire community's attempts at convincing me that my curiosity was a symptom of a demon manifesting itself in my weak female psyche. I eventually willingly submitted to attempting to purge my body through exorcisms, what I have no other word for than ""lite torture"", and fasting. I first started lying to my mother about what happened during these weeks long ""exorcisms"". Partly because I was ashamed at the depth of my uncleaness and partly because I wanted to protect her from knowing the extremity of what I considered necessary evils to cleanse myself. Eventually I would reach a point where I mentally and physically couldn't handle it and would either shut down completely or start lying to convince them I was cured. The lying was the only effective way to opt out. Then after a few weeks being home I would become convinced the demon had made me lie because I was getting close to purging it, hate myself for being weak, and would resubmit myself to it all over again. It was an endless cycle that eventually burned out everything but anger and I no longer felt anything about telling lies to avoid standing out, reeducation, counseling, and exorcism. It was a fact of my existence. Shortly after accepting lying as a means of survival I was lying and manipulating people constantly, usually in ways that would make life difficult for the man running the cult. Sometimes out of a sense of revenge, sometimes because it gave me a sense of control and safety, other times it was just because I could. Ultimately it led to me surreptiously gaining a position that afforded limited power and the lying changed and intensified to consolidate it. It all came to a head just after my sixteenth birthday when all my efforts to protect my siblings led to giving them a false sense of security. The day my little brother was almost taken for ""reeducation"" I realized this was unsustainable and that I had to leave and start a life so I could start getting my siblings out ASAP. I got my siblings out relatively quickly and by the age of eighteen through more lies and manipulation I had my mother completely out of the cult, no ties left. Here I am six years later and I'm still instinctually lying to people about stupid stuff like what I had for dinner last night or I'll name a city close to one I spent a summer in whenever I feel like they're getting too close. I've been pretty successful at keeping my lies minimal, unintentional, and low impact. They are never particularly interesting lies, most of them are pretty close to the truth or just lies of omission. A lot of my lies make me less interesting, less pitiable, or play down my opinons and reactions to things. It's almost like I'm telling a ""based on a true story"" and fudging the details to protect my identity. I've never been caught out in a lie and am mortified at the possiblity it could happen. I always promise to ""start over"" with new people (I've even changed jobs solely for this reason) and be completely honest but then I will catch myself lying mid sentence, sometimes I won't realize it is a lie until much later after the fact. I'm also extrememly consistent about the lies I tell, almost like I've created a parallel life story to tell to strangers that helps avoid awkward questions or a sense of emotional vulnerability. People seem to like me, are complimentary about me, and consistently invite me to hang out but I don't have what I consider friendships. I know that is entirely my fault for holding people at arm's length. I don't know how to talk to people without lying or at the very least using manipulative word choices to lead people to the conclusion I want them to have. Because of the constant over analyzing of what I say and desperation to demonstrate value to others when I'm spending time with people I get exhausted very quickly and try to avoid it as much as possible. The most honest I've been with someone outside of my siblings is my ex-boyfriend. Our friendship/relationship kind of snuck up on me. We initially met in an astronomy study group in college, he wasn't completely conversationally fluent in English and I was taking a class in his language so we started hanging to help each other out. For the first month or so the language barrier prevented our conversations from straying outside of explaining slang, pronounciation, and class subjects. I honestly believe that first month of comfortable silence and a lack of opportunities to lie helped me drop my guard around him to a level that I've only ever lied to him by omission. He is also very quiet and reserved which made me feel less pressured to share thing about myslef. He is scary good at reading me so he's very quick to back away or change a subject when I get twitchy, usually before I recognize it even if he doesn't understand why. I feel bad when he's sharing childhood stories or opinons and I can't reciprocate because I won't let myself trust myself to trust him. I don't even know what I'm afraid of happening if I admit my first domestic pet was a cat. I tried to make sure he felt appreciated and cared for by doing kind things for him, making him feel a priority in my life, etc. But I did these things covertly and if he ever tried to thank me or even acknowledge something I did I felt humiliated and terrified at being caught admitting I liked my boyfriend. I used to do things like drop off packed lunches with his name on it at the front desk where he worked rather than give it to him directly that morning when we said goodbye. I also feel embarrassed when he is complimentary or takes care of me. I also know it hurt his feelings when he found out I didn't ask for help with something or sacrificed something I wanted to make life easier for him. I hate that I treated him as though he is unreliable and untrustworthy because I'm terrified of expressing vulnerablility and uselessness. I broke up with him about a year ago to get some space to focus entirely on my mental health. We're still friends but I never hang out with him alone and lately I'm questioning if it is okay for me to allow that much. It has been tearing me apart that he deserves someone who can express affection openly and verbally but he isn't willing to date. Even though I've started *very* casually dating as a way of practicing spending time with people not looking for a long-term relationship. No matter what I say or how much I pull back he has this inexplicable faith that I'm going to get better and we'll get back together when I accomplish that. I want it so much but it feels like a lie to let him think that is even a remote possibility. It also makes me feel shitty that I'm not getting better and I'll ignore him completely for weeks at a time either in the hopes he'll have the mental freedom move on to someone else or to avoid lying to him about making progress. But he knows all he has to do to get me to talk to him again is to ask for help with something. I can't ever see myself casually telling him about my day without analyzing what information I'm letting slip let alone discussing anything I feel approaches admitting emotional ""weakness"". I've seen different doctors, one who diagnosed me with depression and anxiety and we tried different mediations, none of which helped. I kind of gave up after realizing I was manipulating all of my conversations with my therapist, playing down and defending some of the stuff I experienced as a child, faking improvement so he wouldn't be disappointed in me and I wasn't getting called out on it. As much as I realize that I will never be happy until I learn to be vulnerable the thought of opening up fills me with such horror I start weighing whether or not it would be better to be dead against it. It is so extreme I once went skydiving fully convinced I would have a heart attack and die during the jump to hide a fear of heights. I got nothing out of the experience because I was mentally and emotionally shut down the entire time and felt nothing, not even a sense of accomplishment over it, to this day. What I remember of it feels like it happened to someone else, someone approaching the method of their execution. I went because I thought if I didn't go someone might realize I am not invulnerable to falling from high places and use it against me and it would just be better to die jumping out of a plane (wtf logic)? I'm starting to feel like I'm always going to be this way and if I really love someone I wouldn't drag them down with me. I don't know what is wrong with me or what to do and I feel incredibly alone. I'm sorry if this is disjointed or hard to understand. I couldn't let myself edit this or I would either never post it or post it so disorted as to render any advice useless. I'm willing to clarify anything upon request. "
729,vulnerability,offmychest,I use this subreddit a lot but w/e,1,333coa,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/333coa/i_use_this_subreddit_a_lot_but_we/,2015-04-19 13:14:51,"I have a lot of things on my mind and nobody to talk to. Fun thing about BPD is there's never just anger, there's SHAKING RAGE. I seem quite calm at the moment, but I'm suppressing a lot. I can feel a burning sensation in the middle of my chest and there's this ominous feeling in my head that's remarkably similar to a nuclear bomb siren because I just know I'm going to be feeling some very strong things that I've been avoiding all day, and it's probably going to end up in me hurting myself. Anyway. Ex told me once I was the love of his life. I don't like to believe it, but he kept saying it, and with so much conviction, and I started to believe it a little bit. He went away, and he just . . . he seems to think I don't read him. He seems to think I can't tell that how he feels about me has changed. There's no warmth in him when he speaks to me, it's like back when we first met each other, it's all cordial. I make jokes and he responds like he doesn't know me too well. No, I'm not expecting him to act like we're in a relationship, but since we broke up because he moved for a charity, we figured it would fuck with our mental health to go about pretending we didn't love each other. I've been going off him a lot recently, because he's started giving me the silent treatment whenever we disagree - incidentally one of the reasons I can't accept he loves me at all. I felt a bit better about him today, because he voluntarily ended one of his grumps, actively suggested changing the subject and kept a positive mood instead of antagonising me into losing my temper, as is his wont these days. So, I was starting to warm to him a little (from yesterday's concern that his abrupt switch to nastiness was so extreme it might be the proof of Satan's existence). Had a nice little conversation, he went to bed, everything was fine. Then I checked the status section of WeChat, the app we use (has a bit sort of like Facebook where you can upload photos and statuses etc). I saw he'd written a status in Mandarin. Now, considering we'd just been talking about how I struggle with Mandarin, and he knows that writing in other languages is a technique I use if I want to say things online without certain people knowing what I'm saying - or the inverse, to let specific people know because I know they'll pick up on the language. He's notoriously secretive about everything he does, so it's safe to assume at any given time that he's hiding something - or thinks he is, I can read him very well by now. So, out of curiosity, procrastinating on my essay, and a need to brush up on my Mandarin, I had a go at translating it. I struggle, but I understand a lot more than I let on (which is my rule for most things. I don't make myself seem actually stupid, but I'm a lot cleverer than even my closest friends are aware, because they'd be a lot more careful with their words and actions if they knew just how much I can get out of them). It said, roughly, ""Why do we meet that person? I don't want to love, it hurts"". He has previously said that loving me hurt. However, I am 99% sure this isn't about me. He's not expressed the slightest bit of affection towards me as a person - I mean he doesn't even ask how I am anymore - for a long time, and doesn't act at all like he did when it was clear he loved me. Also, a month ago he abruptly became obsessed with this girl who lived about 7 hours away that he met after moving over. This girl, L, is a bad egg. I mentioned this to him and he kicked off, but then admitted it was all true (since this is all stuff he told me). When he first arrived he wasn't attracted to her, and she was climbing all over him, inviting him round for sex. He then found out she was in a long-term relationship the whole time. She broke off that relationship, continued trying to make Ex fuck her, and when he finally agreed to come down to see her for that reason, he got half way there (7 hour journey I'll remind you), his other friend who lives in the area messaged to tell him that L had gotten herself a new boyfriend days ago, was madly in love with him, and was deliberately concealing it so Ex would only find out when they actually met once he got there. Obviously, he was pissed off at her. A few weeks later, she cheated on that boyfriend with someone else, dropped him, and got another one. She started crawling all over Ex again, but he wasn't interested. Now, recently, he went on a travelling holiday across the country. He was lonely the whole time (he moved away specifically to be lonely - his words, seemingly forgetting what the word means), horny and frustrated because he's had sex once in the past 7 months, depressed because he has depression that motivated him to get into this mess in the first place because he thinks you can physically run away from emotional problems, and bored. He realised L would probably be sexually available and became fixated on her. All he's talked about when he shows vulnerability these days is her and how much it hurts he can't be with her. He asked her out weeks ago, and even though he's convinced she loves him, she said no, and moved 2000 miles away with her newest boyfriend. I like to think that Ex is just infatuated because he thought she'd be available and he's just wanting what he can't have, but the idea that he's fallen so hard for someone who's a horrible, horrible person - I mean from what he's told me, even aside from the cheating, she's generally a shallow, fickle person who only surfaces when there's alcohol - it hurts. He spent so long convincing me he cared, and forgot all about me because he's gotten Yellow Fever (seriously, apparently I'm the only non-East Asian woman he finds attractive anymore, won't shut up about how hot the Vietnamese are) and fallen for her. Not to mention a few weeks ago he drew this picture of some not-publicly-named Chinese girl - he put up the original photo of the woman - who I'm guessing is L, since he made art of me when he loved me. She is not the kind of person he likes. The last relationship he had before we got together, he got hurt because the girl cheated after three weeks. He acknowledged that L would probably cheat, but said he didn't care. She's not interested in anything he is, and he's coming back here in 4 months so they wouldn't have had any time together. But he is so clearly in love with her. His 'thing' that always worried me was that he never showed emotion. There's only one time in the entire history of us where I believed he loved me. But her, all he talks about is her, all fucking day. And I know he won't ever stop because he holds onto things. He left the country because he thinks his parents are ashamed of him because he couldn't hide being depressed - he has Prince Zuko levels of obsession with honour. I don't expect to get back with him, but I know we're going to be friends and we're going to sleep together, and I don't want to look up during sex and see his face and know that he's trying to pretend I'm L. What hurts more is that he lies. He avoids the topic, says I don't know what I'm talking about, directly contradicts himself. He's so, so bad at lying, it's like a fucking cartoon, which makes it insulting that he thinks I'm stupid enough to fall for it. "
730,vulnerability,offmychest,"Depressed, overwhelmed, and utterly confused",2,33llv7,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/33llv7/depressed_overwhelmed_and_utterly_confused/,2015-04-24 00:54:34,"This may be a strange read for most, as much of it is psychological, however there are noticeable patterns in my life that cannot be cast aside as coincidence. I'll start by saying that I've had depression for many years now. I still have it and those who also do, know that it's a roller coaster. Some days/weeks/months are good and some can spiral into a void of darkness. As of now I can maintain myself on a day-to-day basis with the occasional slump that can turn my mind into a slow-burning frenzy of negativity. As for the positive, I'm in a very healthy, happy and strong relationship and have been for over 6 years now. We've lived together for about 3 years and are each others best friend. The support system on that front is as solid as ever and it lifts me out of *most* slumps. However, there are things that as of right now are constantly wearing on my psyche. Currently, I am working a part time job in which I have been heavily under scheduled. I have full and open availability Mon-Sun, morning to night. It is a retail position so those who don't know how it works, many part-time associates are scheduled filler shifts called ""on calls"" where you call in to see if you're needed. They use these probably 5% of the time because it's completely based on how sales are doing for a given day. I started at this place well over a month ago and the first 2-3 weeks I was given between 2-4/5 hard shifts (actual working hours) in addition to on calls. The past 2-3 weeks I've been essentially jobless according to my schedule which now consists of 4 or 5 on call ""shifts"" per week. Incredibly frustrating as this has been a noticeable pattern in my employment history. A couple weeks back I received a customer complaint from corporate for something incredibly petty, but as a retail employee almost impossible to avoid. I was told that I ""hounded a customer"" to the point of annoyance because we kept running into each other as I did busy work around the store. Situations like this are common in retail since if you so much as look at the wrong shitty person with any type of expression they go right to corporate and file a complaint. I talked it out with my boss and they said that it was fine because everyone I work with knows my behavior and the description was uncharacteristic of me. So that was that, water under the bridge, carry on and finished out the rest of that week without a hitch. Here we are a couple weeks later and I'm getting shafted out of work. No exaggeration, I am talking *zero* guaranteed hours at this job. I seemingly get along with everyone easily enough although I do admit my sense of humor is a little alternative compared to other white-bread individuals, I feel that I am likable. So. Fucking. Confused about this situation and what to make of it especially since this is a recurring pattern. Prior to this job, I had been unemployed for well over a year. I live in Michigan which is a butt-fuckingly backward ""Right to work"" state which means an employer can fire you, especially within a probationary period, with absolutely no notice or reason to give. So, previous job I was hired in to a very nice office job with 9-5 hours and 4-6 days a week of solid, guaranteed work. Things were great, my report with peers was on point and I was beginning to stroll happily away from the depressive cloud hovering above me. Fast forward to a couple months after starting. I come in and work like a normal day and then at the end of it, one of my supervisors calls me into their office. They sit me down and do a performance evaluation where I'm informed that I made a mistake on a certain thing that I was never fully trained on. Mind you, this incident did not happen that day, it was something from much earlier on. The conversation ends with ""this isn't really working out, we're going to have to let you go"". I was stunned, breathless, and crushed. I was literally 10 days from coming out of the probationary period and now gone with not so much as a ""here's a good reason we're letting you go"". This occurrence still haunts me, it eats away at my vulnerability from time to time and was the reason I could not work again for so long. The coincidences go back even further. The job before the nice office job was another retail job where things started off smoothly and eventually became passive-aggressively sour. My sales were good, friendly with most of the staff, open availability, but things fell apart with that as well. The management eventually kept sticking me in places where I was unable to hit sales goals and kept me off of the registers. I understand people make mistakes here and there, but any that I would have made were poorly addressed. The unbelievable part of it all was that management noticeably treated other employees with far more respect, coaching and helping if other were to make mistakes. The phasing out began with the on call ""shifts"" to where I wasn't working at all for weeks at a time with little communication. Then one day i received a call from the manager asking if I was coming to the store meeting. What fucking meeting? I hadn't heard from anyone at the store in weeks. So I quit over the phone. Before that I had a waiting job at a sports bar. Once again, things started great then shortly after turned for the worse. Management started sticking me on worthless shifts that no one made money on (like a Wednesday afternoon from just after lunch to just before dinner, what the fuck?). I would get stuck with bad seating sections that people rarely sat at, but there was no rotation, I'd be there the whole shift. I ended up quitting that job, but in retrospect it leaves the same flavor in my mouth as all the others. These events have taken place over the past 4 years or so. The patterns are undeniable and conventionally confusing, but the depression that looms over me eats at my sanity. I can't shake the feeling that something is wrong with me, that I'm going crazy, that everyone hates me. Why can't things be transparent for once in my adult life? I have a great SO who loves me unconditionally and is one of the sanest people I've ever met and everything else in our life is wonderful. I'm not asking for help, but if anyone who has maybe a similar experience/pattern with employment or friendships could share to help me realize that I'm not losing my mind, I would be incredibly appreciative to hear your plight. Also, I take great pride in my appearance everyday. Even just going out to the store for a little while I try to look presentable because it makes me feel good and I like to think it helps create a more respectable, professional aura about me. Not that it has much to do with people in my daily life, but I feel that I couldn't have been let go/pushed out of previous jobs because how to present myself. To whomever reads this, I thank you for taking the time to take in my long-winded venting."
731,vulnerability,offmychest,I have no faith in relationships even though I'm in one.,12,33z81e,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/33z81e/i_have_no_faith_in_relationships_even_though_im/,2015-04-27 10:51:49,"I've had a few relationships in my life. Each time, I've fallen in love, *hard*, and each time I've convinced myself that the particular person I was with was different from all the other people I'd been with. That this time would be different. That I wouldn't have my heart broken to pieces this time. And every fucking time, I've had my heart broken. Every time, ""I know we're going to be together forever"" turns into, ""I think we're going to be together"", to ""Are we going to be together forever?"" ""Forever"" is a long-ass, loaded time. In fact, there's no such thing as ""forever"". But where all relationships end in death or separation, I'd rather have the former than the latter. How can you trust someone, open yourself up to someone, make someone a priority, when you don't even know if they'll be there tomorrow? When you're never sure that they'll wake up in the morning and feel the same way? How can you let yourself be vulnerable if maybe that vulnerability will make them see how fucked up you are and they'll leave? I'm now dating someone. We've been together for about five months, friends for longer, and despite that short amount of time, I think I really really love them. They say they love me too, and I believe them, but they've never been with anyone else before. They don't know what it's like to get their heart ripped up and spat on. I'm fairly sure they don't fall asleep and wake up with their last thought being me, the way I feel about them. I've been through the honeymoon period enough times to know they probably won't feel like this for much longer than a few months. And then, because this is all they've ever experienced love to be, they'll leave. Or we'll end up together for so long we'll be bored of each other and everything we had will disappear. Strangely, I'm not afraid of heartbreak. I've been dumped and broken up with enough to know I'll get over it. But romantic love is one of the most transient relationships you can have. Friendships? Yeah, you might drift away from each other, but reconciliation is usually easy and attachments more loose. Family? Yeah, they can be fucked up, but if they're good they're with you for life. But love, real love? Fuck, that only lasts for a few of us. The person who says they love me will be holding me, kissing me, making love to me and I know I love them too. But when they leave in the mornings I know there will come a day where I'll sleep with them for the last time. I know some people end up happy. But I see most people, married or together for ages, either bored, ignored, or complacent with their partners. So who's to say that won't happen to me (or to us)? I want to believe in happy endings. I just don't."

733,vulnerability,offmychest,Depression through a 20 year old female's perspective,47,2xthgi,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2xthgi/depression_through_a_20_year_old_females/,2015-03-04 06:27:03,"A few months ago, my SO introduced me to reddit and showed me some pages he thought may help me with my depression. I have occasionally scrolled through, contemplated contributing due to fear of being insignificant, but today I decided screw it  I might as well give expressing myself a go. My father was an abusive alcoholic. As soon as I was old enough to realise what was going on, I was immediately chucked into the deep end of the secrets that my mother had consistently tried her hardest to conceal from my brother and I. Every night my father would drink himself to sleep, which would consequently cause him to be in a terrible hungover mood each day. We were banished from the lounge every evening so he could have peace. From a very young age, my brother and I were smacked for misbehaving, which eventually became apparent that we were getting smacked for doing things that were actually good. An example that still remains vivid is when I was around 6 or 7, I was helping my mother clean the house by dusting every room. By accident I managed to push some keys on my fathers computer, causing him to lose the progress he had made on a computer game that day. He summoned my mother, my brother and I into the living room and lined us up. He asked us who had touched his computer. I happily volunteered the information that I had helped my mother clean that day. He screamed in my face that I should not touch his things, threw me over the sofa and repeatedly smacked me in front of the rest of my family who stood silently, feeling helpless. This happened a few times to both my brother and I. All too soon I was witnessing him throw a plate full of food at the dining room wall because it was served five minutes late; kicking my mother because she said something he deemed stupid; pushing her to the point which she would fall and hitting her for no real reason; strangling my brother on his own bed for staying in his own room too much; shouting daily abuse. Each week he would be physically abusive  it was just a guessing game of who it would be directed to and what form it would take. However when I got to a certain age, my father restrained himself from hurting me physically. I couldnt understand why I got the easy way out. There was only one occasion in my teenage years where he slammed my foot in the back door, but other than that he would just shout at me and stop there. Through his acts, my mother, brother and I became severely disconnected. My brother locked himself in his room, believing that if he wasnt in my fathers way, he would not get harmed. I would consistently put myself between my mother and father, knowing that for whatever reason, he would not hurt me. As a result, the roles of my mother and I reversed a lot. I found myself pre-teen years telling her everything was going to be okay, holding her whilst she cried, trying to give her advice to the best of my abilities. The environment was toxic. My brother and I even found ourselves emotionally bullying our mother; my mother hit me on one occasion for trying to leave the house; my brother would push and kick my mother and I if we annoyed him. Eventually at the age of fourteen, I couldnt face it anymore. I had countlessly tried to convince my mother to leave and to get us out of here, but she kept finding excuses over the years that we had to wait that bit longer or that she was looking at options. I attempted suicide by overdose. Within 6 months of the event, my father had moved out and the rest of us had found a new home. I received 2 years of counselling, group therapy sessions with NHS, anxiety medication and an anxiety disorder diagnosis. After a year of not talking to my father following the separation, I was able to rekindle with him and build a stable relationship. There is still a lot of distance between us and I only see him every few months but I genuinely believe he has changed. He appears to drink less and his temperament is very calm. He will now admit he still loves my mother to this day and regrets his actions. There is a part of me that will always resent him but I will always challenge that and try to make the best of what I do have. At the age of 18, I was raped by my best male friend. Since the beginning of our friendship, I had been aware he had always had on/off feelings for me, but I figured it was just part of teenage life. We were at a friends 18th birthday party. I was drunk, he was sober  he was driving. We went upstairs to talk. I consented to kissing him and some foreplay  but when it came down to it, I told him no. He playfully tried to convince me. I went cold and repeated my no. He did what he wanted to anyway and I was absolutely still in fear. To this day, he will argue that because I did not put up physical fight, it was consented. However I cannot describe to you what it feels like to be unable to move in such an overwhelming situation. And by law, saying no is supposed to be enough. For 2 months after, I was in complete conflict of how to feel. I didnt tell anybody because I wanted to protect him  I was in complete denial. I couldnt face the idea that one of the closest people to me could do this to me. However he used this time to manipulate me in secret, getting too close to me; telling me my friends liked him more than me; making me insecure. When he started telling the lads he lost his virginity to me, I cracked. I told my mother. I started telling my close friends. I told college who attempted to give me legal advice. Eventually it became clear that if I took this further, it would completely disrupt my family and my friends lives more than if I got over it in private  which especially was not worth it when I had no hard evidence. Unfortunately to this day, some of my close friends do not whole-heartedly believe me. He told our mutual friends first, therefore it looked like I was making it up. Ive learnt that the ones who do believe me are the only ones worth keeping close. I never pursued any help with this situation  I tried a counselling session, I tried helplines. I couldnt find myself to commit to anything. For the following year, I would find myself running out of a room if he entered it. I would avoid social events that I knew he would be at. I avoided any physical relationships for 9 months until I re-kindled with an ex-boyfriend who had no idea of the events and was so attracted to me that it made me feel normal again. A year after the event, I was at University. I had broken things off with my boyfriend at the time as we couldnt face the distance  however I will always appreciate what he did for me. I felt confident in my own freedom and felt able to engage in physical relationships with no concerns. Perhaps the freedom got too much, but by Easter of my first year, I had found myself in a deep depression. I couldnt leave the house, I couldnt face my friends, I was constantly circling through thoughts of no self-worth. My mother took me to the Doctors and I was put on anti-depressants for the first time. Following this, I took myself off after a few months believing I was perfectly fine. However 7 months later, I was falling back into the depression again. I couldnt face people or my university work. I seeked out help with my Doctor and was put back on anti-depressants. Now here is some key advice for people who are prescribed anti-depressants: Dont ever take yourself off them without advice of your Doctor. Do not take a few weeks or days off of them. The effect is dramatic. I learnt this through having a month off around Christmas due to running out of medication. Consequently, I became suicidal. I couldnt get out of bed, I saw no value in life and couldnt see past the dark haze that appeared to settle over me. It felt worse than it had ever been before. Fortunately, I have been blessed with an incredible support system who pushed me towards realising that life is worth living and got me back to the doctors for more medication and have pushed for me to receive NHS counselling. I definitely believe having on/off periods of anti-depressant medication worsens your mood entirely (I have not looked into the science of this). One very important thing I have yet to mention is the best thing that has happened to me so far. I wanted to end on this note so people know that this is the sole reason to why I am able to write this today. I met my significant other in the summer following my first year and at the end of my first bout of anti-depressants. At this point, I had gained an attitude that university guys werent really commitment types. I started off treating each occasion with him as if that might be all there is to it  and to just enjoy the moment without thinking of the consequences. It took me a few months, once he had travelled two hours to my hometown to meet my friends and family, when he was sat round a table with my mother, brother and I, to realise that perhaps what we had was actually something quite significant. Every moment with him is fun, relaxing and filled with blissful happiness. He accepts me when Im looking my best, but equally accepts me just the same when I havent showered for a few days, living in sweats, no make-up and eating junk food. Each time he looks at me, he has this look in his eye like Im the most expensive thing in the room. And each time I look at him, I cant get over how Ive managed to bag such an absolute goldmine (looks and personality). One of my favourite things about him is his knowledge. I could spend days on end just listening to him speaking about his recent discoveries or the odd fact hes been harbouring in his mind. Being in love and having depression is a completely different ballgame to just being in love. I have found myself unable to sleep at nights just wondering why he chose me; why he bothers; when he might eventually get fed up and leave; when I may screw up and do something that would ruin our relationship. I have wondered how can I feel so low when I have a relationship that other people only dream of. At times I have been incredibly wary of trusting him with my vulnerability, knowing that if I lost him I really do not know what I would do with myself. This has resulted in me getting angry with him, pushing him away and shutting him out. Despite this, hes always persevered to be there. He has taught me a few things that have completely changed my perspective on my life. First of all, through him being there for every second of my tears; my sleepless nights; my inability to get out of bed; my frustrations; my erratic behaviour and my suicidal thoughts  I have learned that I should trust his judgment. He has chosen to be with me, and I should not question him for that. He has seen it all, and he still loves me. Hes given me respect by WANTING to be there and taking it all  therefore he has earned my love and my respect in his judgment to be with me. Secondly, he has taught me self-worth. I know I will always fight with myself over my own value, but now I have another voice in my head, his, telling me I am really a valuable person. Ive realised he needs me as much as I need him. Even though I am the one usually in tears needing him by my side, I now have realised that if I did follow my suicidal thoughts, hed be just as a mess as I am. I want the best for him, and Ive now learnt that the best for him is for me to be well. So now I wake up and I will push myself to achieve something every day. Whether its from just doing some washing, going to the gym or doing university work  I will celebrate that Ive completed it. And even on the days when I cannot get out of bed  I celebrate the fact that Ive still managed to keep on going and not completely give up on myself that day. To anyone else suffering with depression: Celebrate your wins. Take a step back and evaluate your support network. It doesnt have to be a romantic relationship  heck it might just be the friendly shop assistant who asks how your day is every time you go in. Appreciate every ounce youve got. This is what will get you out of depression  such a vicious and long-term disease  but forcing yourself to even have one single positive thought each day will be a catalyst to many more positive thoughts. Eventually you will grow out of it, pushing new boundaries each day. I know its not easy, even on my good days I will feel numb and wondering what the point in life is. It constantly feels like there is a weight on my heart, dragging my whole body down. On my absolute worse days, I can only think of ending my life and nothing else. I feel so disconnected from myself and feel like I have completely lost who I am to depression. However Im starting to realise that I will eventually regain who I am one day. Im still trying to follow my own advice, and I welcome any comments with any further advice that has worked for other people with depression. Cheers for spending time to read my post  it really means the world to me. "
734,vulnerability,offmychest,Everything's just unbearable.,1,2xzy9l,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2xzy9l/everythings_just_unbearable/,2015-03-05 17:33:19,"How?! You feel a connection for a brief moment, the same connection that started everything. Playful banter, discussions about everything under the sun. You're not quite over her, because you haven't healed yet, in fact, you've done the opposite. You've gotten worse. What's truly terrible is that when everything returns to normalacy during the day time, you remember that the connection doesn't really exist. Youre not a priority. As much as your mind likes to think that it's the same connection, you have to remember that her's doesn't. And that hurts, because you know that she feels it too. Except that she's not letting herself feel it. Don't you think you deserve better? She gave up... why make it so easy for her to be friends. Remember how it felt whenever you wanted to connect, or just receive a letter in the mail back, and you were met with all the resistance? It felt almost as if your plans, your thoughtfulness was taken for granted. Respect and dignity would be kinda nice, but her exit plan involved neither of those for me. At the veey least, you should be let into her life before you allow her into yours. Ew. Theres something about you that just makes me feel so pathetic. I've noticed that I joke around and keep distant only because I know that when I get attached, there is a certain vulnerability, and perhaps expectations that come with it. I don't like to let myself get attached anymore.. because everyone that you've opened up to as a lover just... leaves you there, alone. hanging. blank. I don't think normal conversations or calls should end up with you appearing offline or blocking temporarily just to feel like you have your emotions in check, and to protect yourself.. You shouldn't have to feel so anxious or guarded. Surround yourself with people who help make you feel secure. I don't think I want to kill myself, but the feelings of sadness are still unbearable. You try to keep it together, but when you collapse during your circuits lab.. it's pretty difficult to ignore. All the school commitments, things that have piled up because I'm in such a state has left me feeling tired. There is a certain weight to everything that just keeps me from doing things. It's hard to describe, but you know it when you feel it. The only time when I'm able to function is when I'm angry. Angry at myself, angry at others, and angry at the situation. But that, in itself, is draining too. Everything outside of myself feels dangerous. It just feels safe to be alone. Sad, but safe. I can't help but constantly be aware of the notion that I'm getting the shorter end of the stick, or getting cheated out of your effort. Perhaps you feel like you're losing whenever you're interacting with women on a romantic level. It's hard to blame yourself, considering the things that have happened in the past. Although the past is just that, it tends to color your world views. Seeing her be happy and support everyone.. which is something that she didn't do for you and something that didn't go a long way. It makes you seeth. Your heart races. You're envious, angry. When you lose yourself, empty yourself, and become a shell of yourself loving someone just so that they could be whole and they don't reciprocate.. it hurts, bad. Especially when you see exactly what you wanted being handed out to others for free. It makes me want to barf. It, however, is silly to try to convince someone selfish in nature to take into consideration others, that is, to be selfless and sacrifice. At least you know that at the bottom of your heart, you were selfless and would do anything to make her happy. Be proud of that. Remember that she represented hope after your breakup with Cecilia. And she still kind of embodies hope in your situation right now. I don't think it's really a good idea to dig up old feelings that you haven't moved past, because at the end of the day, you'll only be disappointed. Although she likes to convince herself that she's moved on, she really hasn't. When you're able to have such an influence on her, how she feels, her day, and her emotions when she revisits things, you know. Maybe this is a bit of a shelter before you go out into the rain that is the storm brewing outside again. It's nice to take a break, but it could also be unhealthy. I dont know if this is relevant, but remind yourself that emotions are just energy in motion. Everything's just so confusing an unbearable. I want to go back to a simpler, happier time. A time where I had energy, sleep, vitality,was surrounded by people who respected me and was inspired. Ugh."

It helps that it's not a very big organization, and so it's not exactly forbidden. We anyway don't work together. His ex-girlfriend is a colleague, though. But I still dont want to mix personal and professional life. If I let him know how I feel, I just might put my job at risk. It happened on the very first day that I met him. The day of my interview. I felt this magnetic energy between us, and 8 months later, it hasn't disappeared. We have a connection that is hard to describe in words. He's insecure, shy, and vulnerable. He thinks I'm out of his league. He has no idea that I'm INSANE for him. And yet, when we make eye contact, he knows there's something there. A friend of mine who knows him tells me that I should be the one to initiate things if I want something to happen because he's never the first to approach girls. The insecurity, shyness, and vulnerability come into play here, I suppose. Alas, I don't have the courage. I've been single all my life. I'm 23 years old. This one time I see the potential for something happening, and yet I know that nothing will happen. It breaks my heart. I'm so incredibly tired and frustrated. For once in my life, I'm willing to break the rules and follow my heart. But I can't and I won't. I plan on leaving the country by the end of this year anyway. He has similar plans.

The problem is that its not in what I do or express but the exact opposite. Everything gets packaged up neatly and kept inside to be dealt with when Im all alone. Most of it is anger about me not doing enough or being incompetent. For this reason of keeping it all in, Ive gotten ahead in life you could say, seen as an energetic and helpful person, often relied on, and so on. Is it common that people with such low self-esteem and self worth gain notoriety and the respect of people so effectively? Every step of the way Im shocked that people like me. Absolutely stunned. I dont really know what to reference when I think about what defines good in a person. I dont try as hard as I should and yet people tell me Im such a hard worker. I spend my alone time (a lot of it) worrying and knowing that Ive had an easy life and havent really done much, and yet people have come to rely on me and think Im confident. Truth is Im not confident, Im terrified that people wont stick around if I dont make sure to care for them, so I do. Family life has never been good so I rely a lot on people for support indirectly. Ive made so many mistakes and been so selfish and withdrawn at times. All this is not to brag. I legitimately dont know how well people know me. That just makes me want to open up even less. I myself am uncomfortable with vulnerability and cant bring myself to have conversations where I can tell people about how anxious I am and miserable I can be. I just wish someone with super powers would see through it all and insist on pushing me to open up, knowing that theres always more than what meets the eye. I also know that thats not reasonable and people cant read minds. Its very cliche, but on the inside, Im a self-deprecating shut-in who has no idea what to do and worries too much about what people think. On the outside, Im outgoing, active, and ambitious. In reality, Im just terrified all the time. I admire so much those who can accept themselves and be confident just because they are a human being and exist. I dont know how to do that."

I've always been something of a deviant. I had weird mental fantasies of being tortured that started during puberty. I occasionally had fantasies of raping people too, although I felt guilty because I wouldn't want to hurt anyone. Despite this fact, I actually did wind up in a happy relationship for several years through high school and most of college. It was mostly vanilla, but as it went on I found myself exploring some bondage. I never did anything she wasn't into, but once I went too far when she seemed to be enjoying herself, and she randomly started crying. I immediately stopped, and felt horrible that I'd missed the cues. After that I didn't do any topping anymore, though we continued with me on the bottom for a while. None of this is particularly out of the ordinary, but my fantasies can just get *so* extreme. I read tons of nonconsent erotica. I like pictures on embarrassednakedfemales and happyembarrassedgirls. I like the idea of seeing a girl pushed beyond her boundaries and forced into an embarrassing situation. But at the same time I get disgusted and even nauseous if something is happening in real life. It's terribly confusing. I watched a forced orgasm video once, and halfway through the girl started crying. I almost threw up. Then I skipped to the end and saw the after-scene talk where she was super happy and said she had a blast. After that it became one of my favorite videos. On other occasions, certain real life torture events have served as fantasy inspiration. They bother the everliving shit out of me, but I often find myself wanting to be subjected to what they went through. Things like some of the written accounts of the treatment of American POWs, or a story I saw of a kid who was sexually assaulted by 3 older girls who stole his clothes and forced him to run home naked while they laughed at him. These events make me feel awful, and I want nothing more for these sort of things to never happen again. But the idea of being put INTO those situations is exciting as hell. I'd love to be humiliated like that, or to orchestrate a safe and consentually humiliation for someone else. I know I don't want to actually be assaulted. Hell I'd never lay a finger on a girl who hadn't talked about this beforehand, laid down safewords and boundaries, and hashed out all the details. But I still can't help but feel weirded out that rape or abuse erotica excites me, and that some morbid things which happen in the real world inspire my fantasies. I spend a lot of time thinking about how to create the most extreme scenes humanly possible without violating consent or putting a sub in any danger. Ways to completely humiliate someone without actually putting them at risk of public exposure or any unforeseen consequences. And I don't care where I am in this fantasy scene. Top bottom, don't give a fuck. I like the idea of extreme vulnerability and exposure. All I want is a happy relationship with someone I can explore this with, but my nonconsent and rape fantasies, and the extreme sources of inspiration just scare the everliving hell out of me. I know I'd never hurt anyone, but I'm terrified that these extreme fantasies make me a high functioning or ""really nice"" sociopath as opposed to just a very kinky guy. And it's eating at me because even though I'd never hurt a fly I can't help but be depressed at how extreme these fantasies are. I just want to feel a connection to explore this safely and consentually, but I'm afraid I'm too fucked up and not within the ""normal"" kink zone."

Why am I still letting him screw me, after all these years? On top of that, lately I've been grappling with the fear that I'll be alone forever. I don't think I'm capable of forming meaningful relationships with people anymore. Something inside me is broken, and I don't know how to even begin to fix it. I've been single for over 6 years since I broke up with my last boyfriend, and while I've been asked out by lots of people, gone on dates, had plenty of sexual partners, I haven't met anyone I consider ""worth"" being in a real relationship with. I know part of it is that I'm just picky, but I'm scared that the biggest problem is my inability to connect with others, the walls I've built up, the emotional distance I keep between myself and the world. I don't know how to be open and vulnerable, don't know how to reach out in positive ways. I used to think I was alone because no one wanted me, that the problem was external, but now I know the problem is me. I'm terrified of intimacy, but want it more than anything. I don't know how to fix this. I'm not getting any younger (though- thank god- I'm getting thinner), I feel like this giant clock is ticking, and I'm so tired of waking up alone. So tired of making frantic excuses to leave after I've hooked up with someone because I can't stand the vulnerability of sleeping next to them. So tired of being at odds with myself. I don't know what to do. Sorry, I just needed to get that out somehow. "

I have a very strong mentality and Im very self-aware (I like to think, at least). I know myself well, both the best parts of me and darkest, scariest corners of my psyche. I have no issue with admitting  only to myself, granted  the worst things about me. Ive rooted out the cognitive dissonance from my corpus callosum. For these reasons, I have always told myself that I dont need to talk to anyone about my problems; I know myself well, and any advice or help anyone could offer (in the realm of laypeople) would be unnecessary. Throughout most of my life, I could keep the really personal, dark things to myself and be okay with it. Im starting to feel like that isnt true anymore. I know myself better than ever before, but now its just getting to be too much to carry by myself. For example, theres a friend in my life whom I like very much (in a mostly platonic sense). It would be accurate to say I have a brocrush on him. This brocrush is fairly  but not totally  unrequited, and its a little sad. This relationship is very important to me, so its on my mind a lot. I would love to talk to somone about it, but the way I feel is that Im able to discern for myself my feelings and what I need to do, so I dont *need* to talk to anyone about it. I would be taking a great risk of revealing my vulnerability in my feelings for him, while at the same time burdening someone else with these feelings, which is sort of unfair, imho. I could just post all of my feelings online anonomously  like on this sub, where the community is wonderful  but I still feel like I would be burdening other people with my problems  which I can handle on my own  when everyone has their own issues to take care of. Also, I would be betraying the sanctity of my feelings and of my relationship with my friend for momentary relief. I would like to unburden my feelings to the person involved, but thats way too much (especially in reference to the subject of my brocrush). Is anyone else ever caught in this dichtomoy? You want to share your troubles with someone else because it would just be nice if someone else knew what you were going through, but you dont actually want to tell anyone because you dont want to trouble them? Ive always been comfortable with this, but now I feel really alone. I mean, here is this part of me that really very important to who I am, and this is the part that *no one* knows about. Sure, I have a great sense of humor and Im approachable, but those dont define who I am at a core level. Maybe Im being unnecessarily dramatic, maybe Im missing something, or maybe Im just reinventing the wheel. I dont know. Regardless, thanks. "

If anyone just so happens to read my rant and has any advice to offer, please leave a comment. Anyways, I'm just an average and confused teenager. I don't understand my ""friends"". I believe acquaintances is a more appropriate term for them. These people keep me around, but I don't think I contribute any true social value. Yet, they continue to invite me to different events but hardly say anything to me, nor do I say much to them. Why do you all keep me around? While all of you would much rather have a sarcastic or silly conversation, I don't want to participate in that. I'd like to have a more meaningful conversation ,which is why I'll speak when I have something meaningful to say. If not, I won't say anything at all. I don't feel like I have a genuine connection with any of you ""friends"". We're not close. My relationship with all of you feels artificial. Maybe everyone else in the group is close to each other but not with me. Maybe I got lucky through association or because we're on the same bus, so you as a group feel obligated to invite me. Anyways, is it entirely my fault that I don't feel close though? One of you called me a private person, which is a revelation to me. I know I don't say much, but it's not like I am not I'm willing to talk about more personal things about myself. None of you have ever asked. I have and always will try to help any of you in any way I can. Maybe because I try to help each of you, my own feelings get neglected in the process? I blame myself since as a guy I'm supposed to be stable, tough, and I am not supposed to show my vulnerability in emotion only words. Maybe I present a really developed facade of what society expects from a ""man"", so none of you bother asking. I don't know. Now, how does one become close with people? How am I supposed to become close to you ""friends""? Bringing up personal information seems so awkward especially after being with all of you for four years, yet I still know hardly anything if anything about you. Do people just casually ask personal things about someone after knowing someone for years? I understand that some people would much rather just stick to small talk, but I don't want that. Maybe, I should just embrace the silly or sarcastic banter to participate but that doesn't mean we're close. Maybe, offering personal information in conversation is too difficult or embarrassing, so people avoid it all together. The root of the problem may not only be from my own insecurities but stems from societal norms in regards to conversation. I'll blame myself for not wanting to engage in small talk and having such high expectations. However, I don't think it's entirely my fault for not having a close relationship with any of you friends because it takes two to tango. I don't understand. I don't understand your intent. I don't understand why you keep me around. I don't understand if our relationship is created out of pity or some other reason. Like what happened yesterday during Prom.The plan was to spend the night at a friend's house. I went with the intent of staying but left early because I felt so awkward and out of place. When I decided to leave late last night, all of you ""friends"" suddenly were concerned. Telling me: ""Be sure to text one of us when you get home."" In this instance, you all as a group seemed to care and were concerned. Why? None of you have ever seemed to care about my well-being before. Well actually that's not entirely true. Some of you in the group did ask if I was having fun during the day. However, what could I say? Was I supposed to say: ""No, I'm not enjoying myself. I have always felt awkward and left out of the group. I feel insecure.""? I don't think so. When some asks ""How are you?"", few people actually want to know. It's more of a formality, a greeting. Besides, I didn't want to be *that guy* who was such a downer while everyone else was enjoying themselves especially on the day of Prom. Maybe, I care too much, yet I still want to be considerate of everyone else's well being by not being negative. People have suggested to me that I make new friends. Yet, I don't think I can. Being in the International Baccalaureate program, I have been forced to be excluded from the rest of the student body. I could try to participate in more clubs and sports but living an hour away from school makes it difficult to go in early or stay after. Also, working at my job makes making new friends a little more difficult. I understand that if I truly want to find a way that I will. However with IB exams only a month away, I don't want to right now. Now, let me talk about that one girl in the group. I'll call her G for the sake of anonymity. G, thanks for caring and actually asking about me. I'm sorry I became so clingy to the point where you're avoiding me now. I never wanted that. All I have ever wanted is one true friend to be there for me. Someone who would be willing to listen to what I have to say, offer me some advice, let me feel accepted, let me be silly every now and then, and have interesting discussions with me as I learn from and you from me. I know that true friendships take work. G, from our chats I thought you would be that person for me, and I would be that person for you. Clearly not. I've told you, G, things that I have never told anyone else. I trusted you. Now, you're avoiding me. I understand being desperate and needy turns people away, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I've never had anyone to share how I truly felt about anything. I'm sorry that as soon as I felt that I could trust you with anything, I became infatuated with you, which is why you ran from me. If I could control my emotions better, I wouldn't feel infatuated. G, I know you won't ever read this, so I hope you know that I hid my emotions for years behind pornography and masturbation to feel some sense of intimate connection with ""someone"". Because I could feel some false sense of connection with ""someone"" in pornography, I could better not feel passionate about you or any other girl that I've liked. However, now I'm quitting pornography and masturbation because I want to better myself as a person. Now, I have to face my built up emotions that I've hid from for years. I can't help but feel passionate about you because I thought I had an intimate connection with you. Maybe, I actually did and ruined it. I wouldn't be surprised if this was the case. G, I hope you know that I'll still be respectful to you, but things between us will never be the same. I wish I could tell you that I genuinely do care about you and would like to pursue a romantic relationship with you, and I wish you felt the same way. You clearly don't. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I know other people are going through more difficult struggles, but this is my struggle. There are many things I don't understand socially. I don't understand my ""friends"", their intent, nor their reasoning. I don't understand how to handle the situation with G. I feel like I'm stuck in a situation where I'm lonely because I can't get close to people, and I can't get close to people because I'm lonely. If I miraculously do find someone to get close with, I become too attached and clingy, so people run away, which emphasizes my loneliness. I might be completely irrational and might suffer from social anxiety. However, I refuse to believe it's entirely my fault, but I do accept some responsibility for not being close, for being clingy, and my other insecurities. While I doubt anyone will bother reading this or even see it for that matter, I'm glad I got to rant, and I will appreciate any feedback or comments."

A work I consider a dream job. So 3 months ago, I was really attracted to her, she was really awesome. I was really bummed when I found out that she had a boyfriend that time. Then we started talking a lot, and we instantly had a connection. She told me she liked me because I was the complete opposite of her boyfriend (he verbally abuses her and is a meth addict). A week after she broke up with him, she asked me out. I should have said no, but I was being emotional about it and decided to pursue her. Fast forward 2 months after, I sort of believed we're both so happy. She was released by our company due to cost cutting and I didn't like it. So I filed a resignation as a protest. 3 weeks after, we're having trouble financially but we're still happy despite the difficulties we faced. I told her about my plan, that I'll start a business soon and we'll be fine financially. Talks about moving in together was circling around. She wants to leave her pad as it is owned by her BF's grandmother. We couldn't find a place to move in. She had to extend for another 15 days. So as a last resort, I sold all my stocks to make money for the mean time, stocks that I've been taking care of. Then this shit happened. A quick background for me. I've been engaged before from a relationship of 5 years, had 2 serious relationships that lasted a combined 3 years. So I'm fairly accustomed to the whole breakup baggage. I met her, and all the walls I built before after being single for almost 5 years was demolished. We just connected physically, emotionally, and spiritually. The past week has been the best for us, and this happened. I'm trying my best to see where it all went wrong. I want to find the linchpin, but I'm having a hard time finding it. I can't believe with just two months, my life turned. I hated planning for the future (despite the assets/stocks that I accumulated) since it cost me my relationship with my ex-fiance. She helped me open up, and albeit I opened everything up to her, I never had that feeling of vulnerability.. but rather a security. I'm sorry I'm just babbling and if I'm not making any sense. She's the only girl I saw myself spending my life with and this stuff happened. Even for just two months, I was at peace and I was really happy. I don't know what to do next. I've ruined my investments, I left a job that I've worked for for 5 years, and I don't have her. I've had bouts with depression before and I feel like I'm sinking. This really fucked me up. "

I used to love to snuggle, be intimate, shape my identity with another person and share my life. Now I want nothing to do with it. I feel like I'm broken, not really sad but not the same. I can't tell if I'm struggling because I am depressed and don't know it or because society deems my life sad and I am trying to conform.

I never felt beautiful.. Never felt like I had a huge ego.. never cocky. It's gotten to the point where.. When I hear compliments.. It makes me feel lonely. Instead of ""Wow you're funny!"" or ""Wow you're so sweet.."" I get.. ""You're so beautiful.."" or ""You're super cute.."" or ""You're so sexy."" Today.. I broke down and cried. My hearts been through hell this past week.. Met a guy a couple months back, Fell in love with a guy.. He took my virginity, I took his, and he dropped me on Monday and I haven't.. felt this vulnerable in so long. You see Reddit.. I've never been the clingy, emotional type gal. Yes this is true.. In fact.. I bottle my emotions and steer my pain into my studies.. But this pain was different. I actually asked for emotional support from the three closest friends I've had in my whole life. This is where everything becomes very numb for me. As I explained to all three, They all approached me in a different way that I haven't seen happen before. Aaron, my friend of 8 years.. Who has a girlfriend.. Asked if a kiss would make me feel better? He even tried to seduce me.. He said that his girlfriend had cheated on him and she wanted him to sleep with another gal. Of course.. This isn't what I needed.. So I turned to Jabari who was a online friend from 2010. He explained how he was there for me and for once I felt comforted.. But then.. He asked me to sex cam with him to make me feel better.. This was breaking my heart.. So I have only one friend left.. Completely shocked and confused to why this is happening to me.. My last friend Andrew.. (All guys, I know,I know.. But it's hard for me to make girl friends) Somehow said that I should've been with him instead.. And a part of me just shattered..All my life.. I've been complimented but this isn't what I need.. I wanted someone to be my shoulder to cry on.. But apparently I'm only a body and not a soul. I want someone I can talk to... Someone to love me for who I am. Right now.. I'm breaking apart. Today I walked through my campus and a man turned and said, ""You look pretty today."" (I was only wearing jeans, A puffy jacket and a scarf to hide myself so I was surprised) But instead of taking the compliment.. I just broke down and cried.. I.. I can't stress this enough.. I'm being awfully genuine. I look in the mirror and I cry on the inside because I hate my own face. Between you and I.. I often imagine mutilating or wearing a scarf around my mouth and sunglasses around my eyes. I don't like the attention. I don't get what guys see in me.. I don't even think I deserve compliments since I'm so chubby and bare face most of the time. I'm pretty ugly compared to most of the girls of SoCal. I'm weird.. I'm terrible at public speaking.. I like spiders.. I don't know.. Just a lot of bad qualities I own. Girls hate to be around me because they think I'm ""competition"" or ""too guy-like?"" I don't know.But anyways.. I just want a friend to talk to and someone that I can share my soul to. But after years and years of this.. I think I've just broken a emotional dam and I don't see the point in doing this anymore. I came from a broken family.. I have no family to be close with.. My three best friends or was, tried to take advantage of my vulnerability.. And since I just moved here.. I have no one to talk to. No one even bothers trying to be my friend. :-/ So yes. I had to get this off my chest because it's something I've struggled with for a long, long time. "
747,vulnerability,offmychest,A letter to my emotional baggage,1,2w144w,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2w144w/a_letter_to_my_emotional_baggage/,2015-02-16 12:43:38,"On your 23rd birthday, you physically assaulted me. You tightly grabbed me by my wrists and forcefully tried to pull me out of the bar we were in because I was trying to keep you from instigating a bar fight in your black out state of mind. I left immediately, went back to where we were staying. You came back not long after and in your drunken stupor didn't understand why I didn't want to be near you until I explained it in full and you came over to me and cried in my lap at what you had done. I stupidly stayed for five months after that, five months of my life I'll never get back. I've lost count of all the times you have left me to ""fulfill a promise"" you had to another person because ""keeping your word"" was more important than my feelings. I've lost count of all the times you would tell anyone who asked that we were ""just friends"" during the year we spent without a label because you didn't want to deal with the responsibilities of a relationship, but still wanted the sex and the companionship. I've lost count of all the times I lost a shred of my dignity defending you when people asked why you treated me the way you did in public, saying ""he's just drunk, he's not always like this."" I've lost count of all the times you would yell at me, even in front of my parents, when I was taking too long to get ready in the morning because I wasn't going fast enough for your liking. I've lost count of all the times you've pressured me to have sex even when I was exhausted or I didn't want to and told you no but you turned me over and turned me on anyways because you wanted to have sex. I've lost count of all the times I told you not to smoke around me, not to drink around me because you got needy and irrationally angry and accusatory but you did anyways because my feelings never mattered to you. I have realized how emotionally abusive you are. Four months after you abruptly broke up with me for absolutely no reason at all, I realize just how much abuse I went through at your hands. You used to treat me like shit in front of your friends, put yourself in positions where I was forced to be your caretaker, tout around the promise of being ""official"" again just so you could still take advantage of the sex, all the rides I would give your car-less ass, the emotional support... You recently accused me of being the abuser the last time we spoke. I knew you hadn't changed a bit when you then accused me of wishing you were schizo. I knew exactly what conversation you were referring to, the one we had in the car as I drove you home and in a moment of vulnerability you asked me if I thought you might be developing schizophrenia, to which I told you no, not at all babe, why are you worrying about that? I later texted you about a study linking schizophrenia and weed together because at the time you smoked every day and you flipped out because, to you, I was trying to control what you did with your spare time. We didn't work out because you wouldn't work on yourself. It was never because we weren't a good match. We were a perfect match. The geeky frat boy and the nerdy sorority girl, playing video games together, watching movies together and nerding out, planning con outfits together and enjoying all our likes and dislikes that meshed together so well. I supported you, you supported me, we loved each other, our intimacy was off the charts, we were so happy and our friends loved being around us. Until you started supporting me less and I started supporting you more, and your addictions worsened and I spent most days being your DD or cleaning up puke or sitting in the hospital for possible alcohol intoxication and you didn't see much farther past your own needs so you could help satisfy my own. You say you hate me for what I did to you (whatever that may be), but yet I still can't find a bit of hate towards you for what you did to me. And I should. But I'm not the hateful type. I still hold out hope that you'll come to your senses and realize how horrible you were to me and apologize, but I don't think you'll ever push past your delusions. Oh well."
748,vulnerability,offmychest,My childhood bullies were right,10,2wis7b,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2wis7b/my_childhood_bullies_were_right/,2015-02-20 17:00:01,"After a recent rejection I have realized things about myself that I wish I hadn't and it's killing me right now. For a little background, I am 22 and completely inexperienced. I mean there are twelve year olds who are more experienced in affection than I am. But it's not a ""choice"" thing. It's not because I'm super religious or have any particular morals, it's because I have a crippling fear of vulnerability and abandonment left over from a childhood of sexual and emotional abuse. The first time I was ever called fat, I was six. I was at a birthday party for a friend and it was ballet themed. One of the mothers called me the ""fattest little ballerina she had ever seen."" Ever since then, I was made fun of for my weight, my height, my looks, my personality--anything that could be made fun of. I was psychologically tortured on a daily basis at school, and it got worse with every year. I had things thrown at me in class, I was called every name in the book, told I'd die alone anyways so I should just do it myself, I was held down on a desk after class and spit on. Even my teachers abused me. In the eighth grade, my reading teacher named my breasts, referred to them in class, and publicly humiliated me by either grabbing the front of my shirt and yanking it to my chin or making me wear a hideous oversized shirt with the words ""I like to show myself off"" in big black letters on the front. I didn't wear inappropriate clothing, I just had large breasts. I wore sweatshirts every day for the entire year in the hopes that she would leave me alone, but she never did. And when my grades began to slip as I went further and further into depression, she sat me down in front of my mother and all of my other teachers and called me lazy and stupid. I thought I had gotten over all of that. I thought I was over all of the humiliation, psychological warfare, and anger from my childhood, but it just metastasized in my psyche over time. I developed severe anxiety when I started college, but I always insist on dealing with it alone. Any problem I have, I insist on dealing with it alone. I never allow people to see me upset; I am only ever the cheeriest one in the group. And unlike in my childhood, I have friends now. But even still, they don't know who I am. I don't let them in, I don't let them know how scared I am that they'll one day get sick of me and abandon me. I apologize for everything, I never ask for help, I never let them know when I am sad or angry or stressed. Because negative emotions could lead to me being alone again. Even worse, I push away affection, especially when I want it. Not that I get much affection in the first place, but when it is shown to me I immediately panic and pull away. I never understood why until my recent rejection. I am so afraid of being close to someone that I would rather reject myself before they get the chance to reject me. I never feel as though I am good enough, and I fear one day they will realize it too. And the more it happens, the more I close myself off. I am afraid my childhood bullies were right. Maybe I will be all alone. There are certain things expected when you are 22, and I can't give them. I don't even know how, and no one has the patience to help me figure it out, especially as I get older. As it is, no one has even found me good enough to want to hold my hand in public. I have only ever been rejected. I fear that's all I ever will be. "
749,vulnerability,offmychest,"I was forced, intimidated, and threatened into leaving my own home by my roommate. I called the police, but still feel unsafe in my own home.",6,2wt2vu,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2wt2vu/i_was_forced_intimidated_and_threatened_into/,2015-02-23 09:49:09,"I live in a townhouse with 4 other roommates. I live in the basement and the other 4 live on the second floor, with a common living room and kitchen on the first floor. This past Wendesday, craziness happened. Earlier that day, I had been cooking lunch with my girlfriend, we'll call her Amanda, and grabbed some plates from one of the drawers to put our food on. I didn't give it a second thought. She couldn't finish her food, so she brought it down to my mini-fridge to save it. Later on that day, my roommate, we'll call him Jerry, let me know that I had used his girlfriend's personal plates for lunch. I apologized to him and said that I had forgotten whose plates were whose (the kitchen drawer had no label). He said okay, not to do it in the future, and he wouldn't tell his girlfriend, we'll call her Stephanie. So fast forward to later on that evening. I get a rude text from Stephanie saying multiple times that I have no respect for her, that she told me on multiple occasions face-to-face that the plates were hers and not to be used by anyone else (I don't remember any such encounter), not to park my car in her spot (huh? I always park my car in the same place in the driveway, in my designated side of the driveway), not to put food on her shelf (I have no idea where that came from), and again stated that I have ""no respect for anything of hers."" Before I even had the chance to send a reply apologizing, I hear very loud stomping down the stairs and I hear Stephanie shouting at the top of her lungs, ""TheBlueSpikeyShell! GET YOUR ASS UP HERE NOW! YOU NEVER DISRESPECT ME! JERRY, GET HIS ASS UP HERE, DRAG HIM UP, BRING HIM UP HERE! I'M GOING TO TEACH HIM A LESSON! IF YOU DON'T GET HIM I'M GOING TO GO DOWN THERE AND GET HIS ASS MYSELF!"" As I'm hearing this, I'm quite frightened and shaken. I jump into my boots and sprint the hell out of there, opening the garage door and not looking back. As I was running out, I hear footsteps stomping down into my room. I called the police as I was running away, and I was able to find a public and well-lit place. I talked with the dispatcher, told them what happened, and they sent police out to come get me. Here I am, shaking and shivering in my pajamas (luckily I had the sense to throw a light coat on), waiting for the police to come by. They eventually did, and took some information about the incident. They said that since there was no violation of law (WTF? No explicit threat of harm I guess), there wasn't much they could do. They dropped me off at a warm place and I called my parents to come pick me up. We went and grabbed some stuff, and talked with one of the sensible and sane roommates, who wanted to have a roommate meeting to address it. My roommate also mentions that Stephanie went down into my room and took the plate from my fridge herself. Something I would have gladly done for her had she asked. She trespassed against my personal space, but I didn't know about this until after I'd called the police.As soon as we got some of my stuff, we left, and I spent the next two nights at my parents' place. I was able to go talk to my therapist that Friday, which really helped. I still felt terrified, but wasn't freaking out nearly as much as I had the days before. I also went back to my house that Friday. I've never felt this way before. I'm constantly on-edge, on high alert. I've been trying to manage my anxiety and tension since before this incident, but this made it 15 times worse. It's gotten to the point where the slightest noise that sounds like a person will rattle me. Just being able to go upstairs and use the kitchen without fear of what might happen has been a big step for me. I haven't used my desktop computer or my piano, as much as I might have wanted to, because it'll leave me with my back to the entrance to my room. Every time I even try to sit down in my desk chair my body just freaks out and I can't handle it. Until today, I couldn't put two earbuds in because of the fear of Stephanie sneaking up on me or something. Sleep has been difficult without using my as-needed medication because of the mounting anxiety and the vulnerability of being asleep. It's been hell these past few days, and the roommate meeting can't come fast enough. Fortunately, I've been very lucky to have my parents and Amanda support me 200% with this. Amanda especially has been fiercely protective and found time in her busy schedule to come over to my place to help me feel safer. I don't know when I'll feel normal again, but it doesn't seem like it'll go away super quickly. As long as Stephanie lives here, I may always feel on-edge to some degree. I've considered getting a protective order if things escalate any further; the magistrate is very close and easy to get to. I'm saving that for a last resort, though. The landlord also has my back, and he wants as peaceful and quiet a solution as possible. That might not be possible when dealing with unpredictable people, though. I don't know how things will turn out at the roommate meeting. I don't know if or when the fear anxiety will subside. But I'll be damned if I let someone force me out of my own home by threats and intimidation. **tl;dr edit: I have been threatened and intimidated by my roommate's live-in girlfriend to the point where I had to leave and call the police. I haven't felt the same since.**"
750,vulnerability,offmychest,/r/gonewild is my broken mirror,35,2wuwec,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2wuwec/rgonewild_is_my_broken_mirror/,2015-02-23 20:58:07,"this realization has hit me suddenly after spending hours on /r/r4r /r/cuddlebuddies /r/gonewild /r/gonemild (no fapping).... My employer has me in hotels for months at a time. I don't talk to people other than my coworkers and strangers at bars. I'm not really depressed. I just don't have any form of intimacy with anyone. I don't mean sexual, I just mean intimacy. In my life there is no closeness or sharing of feelings with anyone. Even through childhood I never lived anywhere longer than 4 years, and now in my professional career I don't have a home or even a lease. Everything in my life is so temporary that I've never made a lasting connection (other than my parents). As my career has progressed I have become consumed with work and am very easily distracted from this blight of contact, but given two or more hours of time away from a task this feeling starts creeping in like the slow rise of the tide. As it begins to consume me I try to find a connection with someone, starting immediately with my contacts and realize that there are very few people that would want to talk to me. The cycle starts up like someone who tells themselves that they are going to eat healthy for lunch today, but as time becomes an issue and hunger is pressing they opt for a burger and fries at the closest drive thru. I have never put the time in to make a connection, mostly due to circumstance. I don't want to settle in and make roots if I know I'll be ripped out of the ground within a month. I start to make my fast food compromises sending messages to women with common interests on dating websites or r4r. I'll ask them about their favorite book, or where is their favorite place to go within 100 miles. They might respond or they might not, but the response typically takes days and my empty well is growing deeper. Most times I get the feeling, that in this twisted world, they see my questions as some farcical and veiled attempt to play on their emotions and take them to bed, instead of my earnest attempt at a connection. It frustrates me. Not a frustration with the individual but with the social normalities that have created the need for such defense systems in these people. I always find my connection in the most peculiar and lopsided of places. It's not the kind of connection I'm looking for though. It has a taste that is so similar to what I need but there's something so hollow about it. It's like an artificial sweetener in place of sugar. I find the openness that I'm seeking from someone in a place that in which I am unable to reciprocate. /r/gonewild and all of its counterparts feel like some obscure and perverted mirror for me. I want to share myself with an individual. I want to bare myself to someone who will recognize the worth of my soul and my feelings. And here are people who must want something similar, they yearn for the same validation that I seek but where I want to bare my spirit and my psyche to establish a connection, they will bare their bodies. In this way they provide me the vulnerability that I'm after, but one sided ""nakedness"" provides this in much smaller quantities than the mutual sort. I consume and consume, wishing there was more to their stories than the pictures tell. Today I have clarity as to why, but still I thirst, and wish that I did not spend so much time taking without reciprocation."

I had to deal with my brother hanging him self 6 days before my birthday last year. My birthday day is in November and this happened in 2013. So all of 2014 I have been dealing with a lot of things. Dealing with almost getting Fired from my current job on 3 different occasions to be able to handle his death. Because all of my family is living on welfare except me. So naturally the son with a real career who decided not to follow the path of those before him. He is financially stable he can handle everything. I am really upset that a few days after we buried him the day after my birthday in 2013. Back it up a little bit..before he took his life I was interviewing for an position as an Security Anaylst for my current employer and the last interview for the position would have been on my birthday which is November 7th. I had to of course reschedule and instead of being understanding about the situatin since I had to fly from Illinois (where I stay now) back to va (where I am from) the schedules my interview for the following Tuesday which was the 12th. I was still in VA handling all things you need to when some one takes their own life We lay him to rest in the 10th. I take a plan back to illinois on the 11th and interview on the 12th. I guess my enthusiasm wasn't the best due to the very stressful 11 days I just had. I interview hit the key points I need provide an very easy to understand presentation and even show our head Anaylst a possible vulnerability that came out to be true later in the year about one programs we used at my current employer. I think I do well. Personally I had them laughing it was a good time had by all. So December 31st of 2013 comes around leaving work it's snowing in Illinois roads are pretty slick. I. Driving my normal route home which may I add my commute is an hour both ways too and from. A deer comes out while I am doing about 35 of course I tried to stop but I couldn't I hit the deer so hard that he breaks through my windshield and cause me to be veer off the road into a ditch and have my car flip over a few times before it stops. Needless to say I don't remember to much after that cause I woke up in the hospital like 2 or 3 days later. With Mainly head Trauma. I believe they said I had a severe concussion, brain contusions, would suffer from possible black outs and memory loss and a speech issues. Not the first time I ever been injured that bad In accident. I got hit by a car when I was riding a motorcycle when my daughter was 2 years old and shattered my left leg and cracked all my ribs and so on and so on. And this was in 2003. So it was while ago. But needless to say I am still here. This is the first company I ever worked for that offered FMLA. Also the first time I had to ever take it. I was told on Jan 15th that the position I applied for they went with some one else. And that was cool but the reason they told me they wouldn't Hire me for the position is because they needed some one dependable and that's going to be ready at the drop of a dime. I am like WTF! are you for real. I have been here for 5 years and this is the shit you come at me with. I am the person that people came to if they couldn't find a solution to something. I helped you create and update your new trouble shooting guides and even help your test and create your new cloud service you guys decided to roll out...but it's okay I understand the way I am now I am not going to help anyone for a while. So I don't get back to work till 5 months later and even then because of the head Trauma they are only letting me work part time. And needless to say of course money problems came in cause they felt like I shouldn't still get paid to stay home and recover. During this time sitting at home with my wife and kid I started falling into a deep depression due to the situation with my brother, money issues, and this shit with my job. Only thing kept me sane was playing GTAV on my ps3 and that's no lie. I don't know what it was about robbing stealing and killing but it made the depression bearable. When you have a head injury like this they make yes see an Psychologist...I am black..black people don't speak to psychologists. But I guess so. She said I never dealt with the mourning of my brother and I guess I still haven't almost a year later and probably will never deal with it properly. But you know it is what it is when it comes to that...but back to the work situation they tried to fire me for the amount of time I was out due to my manager not updating my time with the short term time properly or updating my fmla time properly. I am glad that I keep a track of all emails, text and people I call to make sure I am always covered in any situation. It was an whole ordeal this because of this going to HR. Showing them the info I have completely to let them see I am doing what I am supposed to gave Dr's sessions and psychologist session down dated stamped and everything. The end results is that they took my 5 weeks of vacation I had accrued from me so since July of this year I have had to work non stop plus overtime on my days off to make up for all the money I lost this year because some one else didn't do their job properly. I honest should have let them fire me and then turned around and sued the shit of them because they broke a law. But it's over with now and I am still employed for now with this company I am glad this year is over I am not going to say this year going to be my year! I am going to change every thing. No!!!! This year I am going to make sure that I leave this horrible ass company and either start my own business or get in a place that will appreciate everything I can do for them in the future. I am only 33. I still have plenty of time and I am not going to waste any more time then I have to do at this place that has killed my soul over the last year. And of course I can't say where I work at because they have tracking software that they use across the internet too see who is saying something about them. I know this much 2015 will change. It will change for me and I am no longer leaving my fate in anyone's else's hand but my own. This is /r/offmychest I had to get this off my chest starting this new year. I am going to leave this year behind and only look forward. I don't care about up votes I just needed to get this off my chest for my own sanity"

I watched my father murder my mother in front of me...... then everything sucked because adolescents was not kind to me in form of building confidence in my body, and now some 18 years later I still occasionally run to a party scene, mostly dance parties and bars where possible deep people hang out hoping that I will meet people that like/respect/admire/temporarily love me/ and ultimately drown my deep sinking sadness with momentarily validation....... "" it is sad, and still I have come a long way, but recently (3 days ago) the most amazingly deep and inspiring women called it quits on our parternship for reasons I find valid, but refuse to except that it is anything but the fact that I am living in a doomed existence where anything I bring close will leave me..... So I party, and I do it fairly well in the sense that I know how to dance well, I am charming, and the high I truly seek has nothing to do with drugs, but rather I seek excited people in in excited places to fill my void of trauma of feeling abandoned, left out, and overall not good enough. The stories go on and on..... I am the most abused human on this planet. I go through phases of taking care of myself and thriving, but that only holds true for a minimal time because deep in the richest part of spine exist a conditioned trauma of feeling sorry for myself..... and until that is tapped in deep meditation and sober like shamanism..... I find myself high on cocaine, alone, left with delicate words that I choose to abuse with the most daring love of anyone I know. I am like Tupac. full of contradiction-ary shit. I play all these peace and love cards, and consume attention while listening 20% of the time. I preach beautiful things, and I do so beautifully...... but here, as I pay my last attention to Reddit, I say: In the depths of my most sacred self, I am simply a cry for child help. I am stuck in between the mirror of reality thinking no one could ever truly see me.... instead, the reflect upon themselves leaving me here, empty, alone, to fend for myself...... man this is toxic.... god I love how cocaine makes vulnerability disappear so much that it is like it never existed... which is what makes this testimony somewhat fake..... I am high. A quote: ""The ghost of bad decisions makes mountains out of everything I feel...... it is time to go inward."" TL:DR...... I love you all, while struggling to love myself."
753,vulnerability,offmychest,I want to stop worrying about my friends dying [TW: Suicide],2,2seyta,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2seyta/i_want_to_stop_worrying_about_my_friends_dying_tw/,2015-01-15 03:53:05,"I saw an image yesterday that caused me to break down crying, and feel empty the rest of the day. It was of a man pressing a gun to his own head. I didn't really think I was that vulnerable, but frankly, I was also kidding myself pretty hard. My partner attempted suicide a few months ago, a more distant friend attempted at the beginning of the summer. I know a number of my friends, whenever I run an event on suicide, often bail out, saying that they can't handle it, that it's too personal for them, and many of them say outright ""You know I attempted suicide, right?"" I have friends in really, really dangerous places; friends in unsupportive homes that are likely to be kicked out if their parents learn what's going on. Fuck, there was a time in my life when I was suicidal. And off and on, I hear about a friend of a friend; never one of mine, but always someone close to someone I care about. A text in the middle of dinner, or before a meeting, or on one occasion a news story about a ""man"" jumping off a bridge somewhere nearby. (It always takes a while for the news to catch up with the fact that she identified as female... Sometimes it's a ""woman"" that the news crews later learn identified as male. Of course, not that that stops them from running old names and occasionally refusing to update the story in general.) In those cases, someone actually died. It's somewhat terrifying, knowing a number of your friends are teetering on the edge of another attempt and watching the looks in other friend's eyes as they lose someone. But, it's worse when they're jaded. It's worse when their eyes say ""I've seen this before, and I'll see it again."" It's worse when they aren't crying about the friend they lost. It's worse when they say ""I don't make close friends with other trans people. I invariably care too much, and then if they die, it's so hard to handle."" Of people like me, 41% of us who are still alive have attempted suicide. These are the scars we carry as transgender people. It's not just the dysphoria that kills us (Case in point: Only 4% of trans teenagers with supportive families attempt suicide during their teenage years. 60% of trans teenagers with UNSUPPORTIVE families attempt suicide during the same timeframe.) It's the rejection, the harassment, the feeling you don't really have a place. It's also, frankly, the scars of a sometimes shitty support community. The world outside invariably doesn't care and is cruel in ways that it refuses to see, but the world between us can be a terrible battlefield. There are numerous ideologies about who we should and shouldn't be, and sometimes it can be extremely cruel. Sometimes people say truly terrible things in those fights. Sometimes people see vulnerability and they attack one another because it feels like a chance to get ahead (we're still human, after all). Others say ""your identity isn't legitimate, you're a transtrender!"", mocking those who disagree. Sometimes it's ""If you're not dysphoric, you're just pretending to be trans because you're trying to be cool"" (not understanding that most trans folks struggle early in their transition to separate dysphoria from mere depression, and that even understanding what dysphoria is can be quite difficult for many of us. Also, seriously, do you think anyone actually WANTS the shit the world gives us? If you do, you're officially stupid. Seriously, who the fuck thinks anyone would pretend to be us to be ""cool?"") And then, sometimes people lash back and do things like LITERALLY TELL OTHER TRANS PEOPLE TO KILL THEMSELVES. That doesn't tend to happen in physical communities (in part because that'd get them kicked out of any physical community SO FAST) but even when it happens on the internet it can create bad blood. It's not like that community is particularly bad, either. Fuck, the trans community is a place where I've found friends and support and a lot of strength and ability to survive. It's just that we don't do well enough all the time and we don't have enough resources and we've dealt with a LOT of shit over the years as a community and some of it is still shit we're processing. We spend a lot of time being told who we were by a medical establishment that... maybe didn't have our best interests FIRST for a lot of our history and we forgot a lot of our history and disowned a lot of it when we were finding our own way. That, and the world outside is shitty. I don't spend a lot of time there. The community is occasionally nasty and unsupportive, but seriously the world outside that community will literally stab someone to death for being trans. Really, I care about the complex politics, but I care more that my friends are OK. I'm terrified I'm going to lose someone; I've build very, very strong friendships. And sometimes the price of those friendships is an inability to look at art without feeling broken and angry. I guess writing this made me feel a little better, at least, which was the point."
754,vulnerability,offmychest,I'm so sad about what I let my life become.,6,2siiv4,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2siiv4/im_so_sad_about_what_i_let_my_life_become/,2015-01-16 00:56:15,"I (31/F) dont know what to do. As a logical person, I know the right decision. As an emotional person, I lean in the opposite direction. Its tearing me apart. Ive been married for three years, never really happily, but I like my husband (31/M) and we get along very well. We married quickly, kind of swept along by external factors. He would say things like he wanted to marry me so it would be harder for me to leave him and our early relationship was definitely built on partying. Not completely wild, but a lot of drinking. Wedding planning was kind of miserable because of his family and by the big day, I was not even excited in the least. I remember thinking the best part was the adorable shoes I got. But still, I liked him, I thought we could build on that, and because of my family life, I just wanted to be married so so badly. I thought all of this was enough even though signs of long-term incompatibility were already popping up. Our sex life was on the decline by our wedding day. Ive always wanted children, but he is more like maybe down the road. I know hed give them to me if I wanted, but Id be very alone in raising them, plus taking care of him, and I cant see having a family with him. Which, as I get older, is becoming more and more upsetting. Like, I had to deactivate my facebook because another happy couple pregnancy announcement was going to result in my head in an oven. Irrational and immediate tears at celebrity pregnancies. Like, I dont want a baby right now, and Ive always wanted to foster/adopt, but its getting to the point where Im thinking about the future and that future seems really bleak. Ive tried talking to him about stuff, but he isnt a very emotionally open person. I know my discontent is hurting him, which I hate. I know he would let me have most anything I wanted, which feels more like disinterest and keeping the peace than affection. He doesnt want to do counseling because he says its too expensive, I might just go by myself so I have some tools to deal with all of this. Im a very physically affectionate person and we have barely kissed in years. There is little to no intimacy and sometimes I feel a little manic keeping things on the surface all the time so it doesnt all come crashing down. Also. I dont want to drink and go out all of the time. Im a homebody. And I want to make myself better. I want quit drinking pretty much all together. I want an organized life. He wants me to drink, he wants to indulge me and keep me the same, because thats the version of me that can deal with who he is. And I resent that so much. And Im just so mad at myself. All the things that are major problems now, were major problems from the start, but I thought I could manage. I thought this was the best I could do. And now I just feel very very alone. Which is where part two comes in. The loneliness. And essentialy all of my friends are mutual friends and as the marriage gets worse, I withdraw more from them. I felt like I had no one to talk to, even about casual things, because how I was feeling, so I took to the Internet. Tons of one off conversations with strangers that were really pleasant. A brief and pleasant connection, a little surge of I am not alone. Then one Sunday night I struck up a conversation with this charming witty also-married man, fell asleep, and assumed that was that like usual. But then he messaged me again and we talked about silly stuff and it was so much fun. And then we talked about more serious stuff. And we exchanged (completely clean) pictures. And within days I was having crying bouts because I realized THIS was the kind of person I was meant to be with. Not a personal thing yet, but he represented everything I actually wanted. Im an uneasy person and I was, from go, completely comfortable being myself with him. And then I fell in love. Feelings and emotional imtimacy Ive never had before, talking on the phone whenever we have the chance, lunch breaks and while running errands. Talking about our darkest parts and the light. THIS is what I was meant for. But its not all beautiful. I know I should end it because the guilt and shame is killing us both. But I want to love him more than Ive ever wanted anything. I want to take care of him and make him happy and I want him to do the same for me. I want to kiss and watch movies and bicker and raise babies and grandbabies. I want to explore each other with completely vulnerability. I want him. Ive never felt so close to anyone in my life. I want him. And Ive done all the self-reflecting and research on this situation that I possibly could. Countless relationship articles and personal stories. And on my end, Ive got it all figured out. Either we need to not ever speak again, or were following my carefully laid plan for eventual bliss and togetherness. Im not completely crazy. It has off ramps. But I cant continue to stretch myself between the unhappiness of what I have and the beautiful potential of what I could have with a little work and pain. We have this sad conversation regularly, with both of us miserable but neither able to let go. Id initiate this plan tomorrow. I know Im not doing the right thing. If I want to leave my husband, I should do it without taking this new love into account at all. Im being a coward and duplicitous and a dreadful human. I know. Everything is just very hard to deal with, especially when I feel like my life is already a shambles. And I have no one to talk to about it, so I just wanted to vent. I feel so heartbroken. "

She was a strong woman, yet with a sweet vulnerability, a woman I felt a connection with that I hadn't in a long time. I fantasized about seeing her again. I didn't think it would happen. I couldn't believe anything would come of it, but somehow I did, because I saw her, and from the start I wanted to see her, every day of her past, present and future. I fell in love with her, the moment I saw her, her strength, her beauty, her wit, her tact, her foresight, I was just fucking lost at sea the first time I listened to her talk. If I ever fully have my way in life, I want to spend it with her, because I can tell you that from listening to her listen and respond for 45 minutes about a research trial I knew she wasn't going to do, I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. She is without a doubt everything I could ever want in a woman, and if I get the chance I'll love and cherish her for the rest of our lives. I have met a woman who I know will not be equaled by time and circumstance. She is one of a kind. She is everyone I have ever wanted to be with, and everyone I have ever wanted to be. You stole my soul the moment we saw one another and I have wanted more of you ever since."

I walked by some guys the other day and they said I was mean and crazy. Wtf? I have never done anything to them, then they insult me, but oh I'm clearly the fucking asshole here. I have VERY severe social anxiety, maybe selective mutism, I don't know. I just know at work I clam up and can't think of anything to say and when I do, I worry that it's too stupid. A lot of times, my silence pays off because I realize that it would have been stupid to say that, or I get talked over. There's only a handful of us that speak my language anyway and I can only relate to one of them and I'm trying to talk to her more but I can't unless I have a ton of wine in my system. Apparently this is reason to throw everyone on hard times a bake sale except me (this isn't just a measly birthday party or something, I was out of work for 3 months with a potentially fatal. I just simply don't make small talk, that's it. I don't want to go broadcasting a mental illness either, and I don't feel obliged as long as the general public wants to stigmatize us, it's my right to protect myself, and to remain silent when things can be used against me. Maybe that makes no sense, but my ex kind of rubbed my issues in my face and called me ""crazy"" and reading all the things on here people say about people like me, I just can't share that part of me anymore. I REALLY don't like vulnerability, AT ALL. When I was growing up, I had people actually be mean, you know with words and actions and not; omg, going about their errands without paying me attention they OWE me because we happen to be next to each other. They want to call me self absorbed, that attitude of ""you owe me attention and small talk or you're a meanie!"" in a time when time is everything seems very self absorbed and entitled. I had one guy in a group I was in literally rip me a new one whenever I spoke and that was when I had enough. I decided the shit WAS going to stop, period and to do that non violently and without dropping out or switching, I had to shutdown an stay invisible and I've been this way ever since. It was more people than just him, but he was the straw and others came along and reinforced it. I've had people tell me to kill myself on camera so they could watch, and you want to call me mean for saying nothing? I'm simply terrified if I talk, something dumb will come out and I'll get made fun of and feel like shit the rest of the day and as pathetic as it sounds, I REALLY can't afford to invite that negativity in my life. Again, seems pretty self absorbed to just assume I fucking hate you because I didn't share my life story with you. You could say I am a bit self-absorbed for assuming that people care about me enough to judge, but experience tells me my beliefs are at least right as far as assuming that putting myself out there will only get me hurt and that my thoughts and feelings aren't valid. I mean those guys cared enough to say something so obviously you can't assume no one is going ever care enough to gossip about you. I know I should have a better out-look but when you've been told your whole life that you're an idiot and are belittled constantly, by other people, what are you supposed to feel? I was too young when it all started to have the wherewithal to figure out how to stop the bitterness from taking over and once it starts and isn't fixed, it reinforces itself over and over and then you add age and it just seems impossible. If the stove burns you when you touch it, you stop fucking touching it! People hurt me when I interacted with them, I fucking stopped that shit. What do people want from me? They won't let me be quiet, talk, get angry or sad or die if I wanted to...I'm getting REALLY sick of this fucking shit. I'm so tired of being told that I'm wrong, not my opinion but that me as a person is wrong. God forbid I should want to end it. Then I'd be so selfish for ending my ONE life so that I could simply hurt someone, it could never be because I wanted peace and finally had the push I needed. It's not selfish at all to want someone suffering from a permanent mental illness to suffer so that you don't have to grieve for awhile, let's just stigmatize mental illness also and then get mad when people want to literally kill their own self to get away from it all. This all makes total sense! "
757,vulnerability,offmychest,"My dad is weak, awkward, and submissive.",0,2tp0is,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2tp0is/my_dad_is_weak_awkward_and_submissive/,2015-01-26 16:28:21,"My dad is extremely feminine. He's extremely sentimental, gets stressed out really easily, and has been a pushover in every situation I've ever seen him in. He's also stupid and not very good at his job. He's never really taken charge in my family. I remember sometimes when I was a kid I would break the rules and my dad would get mad but he couldn't get himself to give me a spanking. Like, I would be laying on the bed with my pants down, crying, ready to be smacked by the ruler, and then my dad would just break down and say he couldn't do it. And then he would come into my bedroom later that night and apologize for being mad. He does everything my mom wants. No one likes him, he has no friends. His parents and siblings don't like him much. My siblings and I try to avoid him as much as possible, because he's so awkward and whiny. He is respected by absolutely no one. I could beat him in a fist fight with two hands tied behind my back, and I could beat him in an argument if you gave me a full frontal lobotomy first. And he can't really blame it on age. He's only 50, and he's been like this since he was 40, at least. That's when I started to be around my friends' dads and realized what an unusual dad my dad was. He may be a closeted gay man. I remember when he gave me the sex talk he really had this hesitation in his voice when talking about having sex with a woman. It was sort of like, ""Sex is...nice..."" I should also add that he's very homophobic. He pretends to sleep on the couch in the living room so he doesn't have to sleep with my mom in bed. I don't really care if he's gay...but it creates such a weird tension. Straight guys treat him differently than they would another straight guy. Everything that comes out of his mouth is so fake. He is always afraid of offending anybody, even my siblings and I. We're his kids for Christ's sakes, what are we gonna do to him? He also loves to engage in boring, pointless conversation, but that's probably common to all dads. Once, when I was 10 or 11, he broke down and told me that he and my mom hadn't had sex in 6 months. He also told me about the time when he just broke down and cried. I think it's okay to cry sometimes, but I don't think it's that common for a father to express vulnerability like that to his impressionable young son. On top of all of this, he still has no idea that we all can't stand him. Or at least he pretends to. He likes to pretend that there's nothing wrong with our family, when really we're pretty messed up, in no small part because of his lack of leadership and masculinity. If my family divorced, my siblings and I would regularly visit our mom, but no one would visit my dad. And if we did it would be a real chore. My family gets along much better when my dad isn't around and it's just my siblings, my mom, and I. I just can't understand what it must be like for someone to feel so awkward and afraid around his own family. His own children. His own wife. I seriously hate him for all of this. And it's not only for all of the reasons I listed above, which would be enough for any unrelated person to dislike him. I also hate him because I know that someday I'll be just like him: stupid, boring, weak, and submissive. And that knowledge makes me extremely depressed. Am I holding my dad to too high a standard? He's basically a woman in every way. Do you think he might be trans? I can't stand to be around him. I honestly just want to punch him in the face sometimes to watch him cry about it. Some father."

First of all, i got stolen 600 of shipment, and there was no recourse I could have had. Trying to drive around and go to the post office, my car broke down. One month later, I had a bill for 4500. I use my car to go to work, thanks to covid I can afford more remote work but in September I have to be back there. Society is so fucking expensive and I feel so fucked rn, I can't afford anything. Rent in paris is insane, I don't even go out, I am just so fucking lost. I am not poor by any means, I'll try to save up, but this being added to all my personal issues and the stress from working in a big 4 is just too much. I usually manage to buy myself something nice to treat myself when feeling that bad, but in this case, I don't even have 300$ to spare (#firstworldproblems) I was feeling the burnout coming a few weeks ago because of all of this, and my Director (earns 10* what I earn) told me that ""it's just a money problem"" but it could very well force me to sell my computer if things keep going this way ...

I really want to tell somebody. I dealt with a lot of abuse when I was a kid (physical and emotional). I didn't have a lot of friends. I was nerdy and awkward. I started playing videogames to cope. When I was 14 I started getting back into Minecraft again. It felt easier to make friends since I could be social with no repercussions unlike in person. I lashed out a lot because of my trauma so my way of getting attention online was by being annoying. I'd say outlandish things in chat because I wanted somebody, anybody, to talk to me. Eventually, I garnered somewhat of a popularity on one particular server. I made some friends and basically spent all my free time playing. Eventually, I became a ""staff member"" on the server which basically meant I would moderate in-game chat. I even had the Minecraft chat app downloaded on my phone so I was using it most hours of the day. It kinda became my life. The owner of the server was this I think 19-year-old dude. My trauma kind of led me to feel special by getting the attention of people who almost seemed unachievable. I did the same thing that I did to everyone else, I annoyed him in Skype messages until he paid attention to me. I don't remember all of the details here, but eventually, we became friends. At some point, we became romantically interested in one another (or as much as a 14-year-old could feel). I lied to him initially and told him I was 15. When he told me he liked me I told him the truth and he came around to say he didn't care about it. This turned into somewhat of an internet relationship. I am going to call him John for clarity's sake. We spoke of meeting up and me visiting him someday since he lived in another country. All of the server staff shared a general skype group. Most of the staff made fun of me and harassed me for being young. I was never taken seriously (which I partially deserve for just being annoying). John had to defend me many times but he was also very close with many of the staff closer to his age. John and I had our relationship go on for maybe 6-9 months (I don't really remember to be honest). It was extremely intense as far as relationships at my age could have gone, we exchanged ""I love yous"" and various talks of the future. It's worth mentioning I was a virgin and hadn't even had had my first kiss. I ended up exchanging nude photos with him, various ones, tons of times. I don't remember if he saved them or not but it was via Snapchat. I had never sent nudes before but this made me feel special. We sexted and we had sexual interactions via skype video calls. I turned 15 shortly after we started ""dating"". He had some issues and accused me of ""cheating"" on him multiple times. I remember the first time it was because I was in a skype call with 2 friends (a girl and a guy) and we were goofing off just reading bad pick up lines to each other. He found out and saw this as cheating and treated me horribly for it. He wouldn't allow me any space to explain and called me horrible names, told me nobody would ever love me and nobody could ever love me. At some point, he ended up breaking up with me because he had fallen for another girl from the server (who was my friend at the time). I was devastated because they were spending time together behind my back and I was extremely insecure and idolized this girl. He would lie about working on server stuff to go spend time with her. I hated how I looked and always thought she was beautiful. She was also older than me by a few months which intimidated me. This felt world-ending given I was in such a vulnerable state to begin with. Shortly thereafter, things went to hell. The server had a website on this platform called Enjin. It's basically a gaming forum. All the players had profiles on there and we used the forum to give feedback and communicate. One day a new account popped up on Enjin. It first appeared to be a troll account but then turned out to be somewhat of a ""Gossip Girl"" page. The account started by exposing the secrets of various users (I believe all were female). All were personal but none life-ending. It seemed like every target of the account got around 1 post and then the account moved on to another person. While I don't remember what all the secrets were, the account felt very focused on (sexist slur)-shaming. Soon, the account took a focus on me. I woke up one day and found my Snapchat had been shut down, my webcam had been hacked into, various social media accounts of mine were compromised. My fucking Microsoft email account was hacked into. I emailed Snapchat for an explanation and was denied one. Then hell came. This account posted nude photos of me publicly on Enjin (not on the servers page so the server staff couldn't delete it). My bare chest with my face in it is one I vividly remember. I know there were others but I didn't look because I felt so sick over it and just had people tell me what was up. There were various other photos posted, some I don't remember ever having sent to anyone, some I never even took myself. At the very least hundreds of people saw naked photos of me, a 15 year old. They also posted photos of me they got off my mom's Facebook page. One in particular was a photo of me I hated from my highschool semi-formal of me with friends. They told me I looked (r word) and ugly and basically focused on making me feel worthless. Whoever made the account knew I had issues with my parents (my dad was horribly abusive towards me). They found my dad's company, which contained his email, and then photoshopped emails they pretended to send calling me a (sexist slur) and saying they had my nudes, etc. These were never sent but I didn't know that at the time. They threatened to contact my friends, my family. This ended up being a fuck ton more than just 1 post about me. Nobody else was attacked even close to this level. This account just wanted to hide the fact that I was the main target. These photos were up for days at the very least before Enjin eventually took them down. I remember the account was deleted at least once, and then another would just pop up to harass me more. Once the account started posting stuff about me I was the only person they posted about. Nobody defended me. Nobody. They were either too scared or didn't care enough. People were worried for me and spoke to me, but that was all private. I later heard that John paid off the hackers in bitcoin to not target the girl he liked at the time (my old friend). Nobody tried to help me like that. If anything, I became a joke. I didn't tell anybody. I know one person reported it to the cybercrimes unit but nothing came of it. I was so fucking scared and embarrassed. This was the one time I truly wanted to kill myself and almost did. I didn't even so much as whisper a word to my parents because it would have turned out very bad for me. I basically handled all the pain this caused me alone and hid that pain from everyone I knew IRL. I don't know who did it and I don't know why. It hurts me to this day to know I'll die without knowing. I don't understand who I could have pissed off enough to do this. The worst I did was annoy people. I didn't hurt anybody and was never mean to anybody. I know the obvious answer is that John did it. I suspect/suspected that as well, but if he did do it, he wasn't alone. I asked him about it years later and he seemed genuine in saying he had nothing to do with it and don't know how they got the photos. I don't think he hated me enough at the end to orchestrate this, and he was definitely intelligent enough to know the massive risk of doing something like this. I'm not scared anymore. This experience drove me into a love for cybersecurity. I am now almost done studying to get my computer science degree and have won/done various hacking competitions, and once even for NASA (I didn't win but it was still cool to participate in). I help my friends stay safe online, and advocate for women's internet safety. One of my favorite books today is ""The Smart Girl's Guide to Privacy"" (14/10 recommend love the author). I'm not 100% secure with myself today, but I at least know I'm kind of hot now (I think I'm allowed to say this after so many years of people drilling the opposite into me as a kid). Regardless, I love myself more and have found myself as much as someone who recently left their teen years can. I don't hide the story because I'm pretending it didn't happen. I'm not even embarrassed by it anymore. I have shared vague details to a few people as a warning if they are doing risky things online. It just feels like a weird uncomfortable thing to share unprompted. I don't know if I'll ever fully come to terms with not knowing why I deserved this at the time, but I at least have John and whoever did this to thank for my current morale and drive towards my future career. I hope what happens to me never happens to anyone else. I wish whoever did this could know who I am now, rather than some pleading 15-year-old asking for my nude photos to be taken down so everyone else I knew online couldn't stare/jack off at my fucking breasts. Fuck you John. Fuck you strange Enjin account. And if anyone who knows who I am from this story sees this (specifically anyone who treated me like shit or was a bystander in all of this), I remember you. I remember every last one of you."

I recently quit my job at a hyper-growth mode cybersecurity company. I was a top performer. Making more money than I ever could've imagined, and offered much more (as in, six-figure gains). Liked my job and had a good manager. Was provided the opportunity to advance as well. A few friends at the company and met my boyfriend through the experience. But about a year ago, things were really different. I was in a lower role and was getting viciously bullied by multiple other people at the company. Management completely mishandled it in my opinion, as they basically took my bully's side (he ended up falling on his face when he was promoted; I succeeded well past him in comparison). But I can never forget the horrible, disrespectful personal attacks, nor the fact that I was completely neglected when all I wanted was for somebody to say ""stop."" (He had been making up rumors about me doing sexual acts for advancement, and saying that I was a fraud generally speaking). Now, I am leaving for a much lower paying job at Google.

Don't know if there's any way to really fix that either. Plus, I have been in an overly dependent relationship with the boyfriend I met through this company due to the emotional support he provided during hard times. I've wanted to break up with him for a long time, but have been having a hard time while we worked together. I know there are worse situations to be in, but I just feel pathetic for not being able to go on any longer, and wonder if I may be making a mistake..."

The comments were pretty much like ""I would like to have you in bed before you are off to school. I start stalking his profile and realize he has a lot of comments on young girls' posts, by young here I mean pre-puberty. some were really disturbing and lewd comments, so if you haven't realized by now it was clear he was a pedophile. Just a background I've had some training in the cybersecurity domain and hacking gullible people. I catfished him and sent him a fake link which I used to hack his details, telling it was child p\*rn just to check if he actually engages with the fake site, and he does. I know it was unethical of me but I wish it the story had ended here. I lock him out of his own account and open it to find disturbing images and legit child p\*rn. I was disturbed, so the next thing I did was the mistake i shouldn't have done. I screenshot his conversations and blurred images with the pornographic peddlers and share it from his account on his feed with the caption ""I'm sorry but I am not safe for the society and I watch child p\*rn"" and then he was locked out of his account for 2 days which was enough for it to go viral among his following and friends. then he deletes all the proof but his friends already started hating him and his family was in complete shock. Basically, I ruined his life by making it public. After a week I get to know he killed himself by hanging. I really regret my decision and I wish I hadn't done the mistake. The worst part is everyone celebrated his death by commenting badly on his profile and his parents are devastated as he was their only child. I cannot live with this mistake I have made."

Sorry in advance for any mistakes. Let me start by giving you some background... At the very start of 2019, I wasn't doing too well with job applications until I received a phone call oneday asking if I would be interested in undertaking some IT training with the prospect of gaining employment once I had gained all my qualifications and done my training. I initially thought this was too good to be true but after doing some research and speaking with some old friends/work colleagues who are now based in IT, it seemed that the training package being offered was comprehensive and a good place to start. I spent several months last year working on my training &amp; qualifications but once I came close to finishing this is where the problems began and how I've arrived where I am. The company (ABC for example) which was supposed to be offering me a job at the end of my training was unable to since I had lost access to my car. It was 16yrs old by the time it was scrapped and needed a 300 clutch replacement which at the time I couldn't afford, just to give you a bit of context. The company (XYZ for example) which had been providing me with my training etc was only partnered with one company (ABC) in the UK for recruitment and since they had rejected me on the basis that I no longer had my own car, this is where things started getting ""really"" bad. I was essentially left high &amp; dry, without any help. Company XYZ basically said there was nothing they could do for me. Since they were only partnered with ABC and didn't act like a traditional recruitment company, they weren't able to help me look for other jobs. Even after paying for the training materials etc, it was now all up to me to find a job etc. Since roughly October 2019, I have been applying for jobs left, right and centre. I've been looking at LinkedIn, Monster, Reed, Hays, S1jobs and many many more... In that time I have received one ""positive"" offer which was with an IT company here in Edinburgh but I had to reject that particular offer on the basis of it being shift work. They were asking for 4 days work but a combination of day/night shifts. As someone who would have been taking their first IT job, the prospect of working 7pm-7am didnt fill me with confidence. That was back in January and since then, I haven't received anything positive at all. I've applied to many local Edinburgh jobs which are IT admin or anything entry level, I've put my CV through different recruitment companies, I've applied to large Graduate Schemes and/or apprenticeships and still nothing. I even put out a plea on Facebook about 1-2 months ago asking if any of my friends might be able to help. I got a few responses, once of which was from an old university friend who now works for one of the UK's leading recruitment companies. While some friends had put me in touch with recruiters or offered help looking at my CV, I had really hoped that my old uni friend could have done a lot more for me. He asked that I send him my CV to take a look at and he'd get back to me but that was it. I still haven't heard anything from him via email or even Facebook and I sent him my CV in February, before all this Covid shit started happening. I am tempted to hit him up and see what he's got to say but at the same time I feel so let down. This is someone I've been friends with for 10yrs, used to party with, used to drive &amp; watch his Sunday football team etc. I always did a lot for him and he couldn't even be bothered to give my CV a quick look or ask any of his colleagues if they could help. They are a recruitment company after all. Anyway, I received another rejection email from a local university yesterday although I only noticed it this morning which is why I was inspired to write this post. It was the usual generic ""Thank you but you're unsuccessful this time."" I did send them an email back politely asking for any feedback they could give me as to why I was unsuccessful but tbh I doubt I will hear anything. It's gotten to the stage where I don't know what the fuck to do... The majority of jobs that I have seen within the Edinburgh market are all asking for experience and systems knowledge that I don't have whether that be Javascript, Python, C++ languages, Microsoft Azure or specific knowledge of certain Security Systems, Practices or Standards. I feel like all of the training/qualifications that I got were all for nothing. No one seems to want anything entry level, it's all advanced level stuff. I feel like my only option is to either knuckle down &amp; start learning stuff like Java, Python etc which will take a looooong while before I'm at a competent level where I can apply for jobs OR to just abandon everything that I've been doing with IT and take a look at doing something else with myself. Anyway, I'll leave it there since I've pretty much covered everything that is bothering me. I probably should have put this at the start but in case anyone is wondering about my qualis, here they are. One final thing to add, a friend/colleague of mine who has only **1** of the same qualis that I do, had no problems getting a job with one of the local councils and somehow I am STILL struggling.

I experienced them at most once a year. When it happened, I felt rather filthy, probably because I didn't regularly have it. I also feel disgusting when I sweat or other people sweat. I just thought it was dirty, and I never really did it (even when I worked out). I know, I am a bit obsessive-compulsive when it comes to cleanliness!) Well, not having female issues causes uterine cancer. Now, since I have cancer in the lining of my uterus... I get to take high doses of medroxyprogesterone to treat it, which has made me enter menopause (temporarily). I have never felt so disgusting in my life. Hot flashes 2-3 times a day/night, sweating... I have never felt more unattractive. I realize, most of you think... well, why not have a hysterectomy... I am 37, and I would like children. If I am honest, that whole process disgusts me as well. I love children when they turn into little people 3-4 years old, but babies themselves. I am not that into (I'll hire a full-time nanny when they are born)... nor am I into the whole being pregnant and having a living being grow inside. I would love to adopt, but my husband wants his own. I have offered to foster children (I would love to help young men and women in unfortunate circumstances chart out a career and possibly help them into a good college program. I grew up very poor and in adverse circumstances myself, and I would like to make a difference in the lives of children with similarily abusive backgrounds. The only good thing if the cancer treatment doesn't take is that I get to pay someone 90k to carry my babies. I am a graduate student in cybersecurity, and I have since started working in case I need to pay a surrogate. (I knew I needed IVF to conceive and was planning on that expense (I work part-time doing contract work), but I wasn't planning on a surrogate.) Luckily working in cybersecurity, I make fantastic money, so I will be able to afford a surrogate and a nanny if I work full-time. However, in the meantime, I feel so disgusting. Men have it so much easier. No menopause, no female issues, easy weight maintenance, and marry a nice woman that wants to raise kids under 2-3 years old. I realize this post is odd and that most people can't relate. I just had to get it off my chest instead of letting it build up inside. I apologize for the sensitive issues discussed."

I only work 18 hours at my college doing IT support but late shifts like this one I'm in is literally the most boring shit I have ever done. There are barely any classes going on so there is nothing to fix and the supervisor usually leaves when I get here so there are no projects for me to work on.

I believe if I keep going the way I am that I will eventually start making lots of money but I really don't know if I even care to get a job in the field I have been working hard to get. I want to make something of myself and stop wasting my life away sitting here in this windowless room, doing nothing productive other than studying, homework or watching youtube or reddit. I've been single for almost two years now. All I have done was workout to lose weight, go to school and work a lot to help me get over it and give myself some value. Well I lost the weight I wanted to lose, I am back to being in shape, my grades are through the roof but honestly a lot of it was because I got better at cheating on assignments. I've got an IT job that I have always wanted but I fucking hate it now. I just feel fucking lost and I wish I could restart and do newer things or at least anything but what I am doing right now. I want to have stories to tell my grandchildren. I want to see the world but I've barely left my home town. I want to meet people and experience different cultures and even make a change in other peoples lives for the better. I don't know what to do and as I am typing this I really just feel like banging my head against this fucking keyboard. I don't really have any close friends anymore and if I talk to my parents or family they'll just say I am being dramatic or some other bullshit.

Long story short, I was determined to end my life not long ago due to a lack of goal and motivation. I wanted to do something ""big"" before and decided to find a way to get money so I can spend one last day with some distant friends, and then take a one-way flight to spend few days at the beach and try to make peace before dying. While I was gathering information about the vulnerabilities exploited by modern fraudsters while trying to remain discreet (which is impossible in 2020, I had to trigger a good amount of Red Flag just to get infos), I caught myself thinking ""its pretty cool, I wouldnt mind working there"". I started getting interested in network management, network security stuff like that and which trainings in cybersecurity are available in my country. As expected, these formations are very far from the bloody mountain where I live and I would still need money to take an apartment elsewhere. So the problem remains the same. I was elaborating my plan without aiming much. But in the meantime, my goal changed, I found a field I liked. And if I'm not planning to kill myself anymore, doing something illegal would be stupid. Problem is, after coming back from working abroad, Im stuck since few months in a city away from everything where theres no work for me. I wanted to sacrifice everything to get few grand.

I got into a program that has a 70% fail rate due to extreme difficulty. Most students are lucky in some lower division courses to obtain a B-. For my final year, we have a matriculation exam and an 80 page thesis (plus a verbal thesis defense). Studying abroad is normal, but we have to time it very precisely or else we risk needing to stay an extra year. I had planned to go to Jordan until my nerves (and the draconian terms of the program) kicked in and I realized it wasn't a good plan. This next semester I'm entering into a class in Cybersecurity of all things to see about getting skills I can take to the job market that aren't just writing and economic analysis. I've taken a few web and app development classes before, as well as built a production app this last semester for a nonprofit. My mind says ""Go with programming, there's money in it"", but my heart still wants to delve into state development, international development, and write about China and the Middle East. I see all these programs in Europe, Asia, people studying abroad.. yet due to the small nature of my program we have virtually none of that. No alumni network to speak of. Virtually no international related courses on offer. I have been the last three years begging my parents to file citizenship paperwork for a nation we're eligible for in the EU because if I found one of these offers at the European Council I could actually obtain it. They refused up until a few weeks ago when they finally went ""Okay, this March"". So lo and behold, the person teaching my Cybersecurity course not only went on Erasmus but also studied in China, and ALSO has a degree in International Economics, and is now pursuing something in the CS field. Coming off of my last internship where I was pretty much stuck in a quiet room for 8.5 hours a day, functionally ignored by my superiors, and tasked with something that was not only totally out of my scope of work but also never given any mentorship on where to go, I feel more than a little jealous. I'm happy that this professor has done so well, but I feel like all this time has been wasted. I could've, in theory, just said ""fuck it"" and tried transferring to a university in the EU, but I tried that and my father told me he wouldn't be helping me with any of the visa paperwork or fees. I'm just hoping to leave for the EU in a few years. Going to, hopefully, teach English in China and learn Mandarin at the same time. I really don't see much light at the end of the tunnel here aside from graduating. My four years have been absolute hell, compared to being able to go on Erasmus and go to China and get work actually recognized, have a faculty that is able to produce research and not just waste away as another program gets millions of dollars and yours just languishes despite being a vastly more rigorous degree. Not to mention the roommates, the lack of social life.. I just want to get as far the hell away as I can. Work in the EU, do all the normal things I was supposed to do had my family not forced me to get a degree in the US because they thought it ""brings prestige to the family"" and ""America is the golden land of opportunity"".."

Backstory: When I was younger, I had a very ignorant childhood. I didnt learn to take a shower until I was 11 years old, I just started to trust my parents and I am starting to trust my friends. I never gained the necessary social experience I needed since no one talked to me because I was the weird kid. An old friend of mine even told me people told her not to talk to me because I was weird and annoying. I hated my life and I had a bad addiction to video games. I had panic attacks and temper tantrums well longer than I should have. I was taken to a psychologist before and nothing was wrong with me, none of us knew what was wrong. I had no friends at school and hated it there. I would have these episodes every morning. I tormented my mother and I even made her cry. We moved and I started to gradually get better. I still had an addiction to video games, but I was nonetheless, getting better. I still had episodes but not as frequent. Fast forward to my junior year of high school and I came to a technical college for my junior and senior year. First time in my life I started to try to open up and get to know everyone. I went there for Cybersecurity and that school changed me. I finally started to want to look good! I gained an interest in fashion and a larger interest in computers. I still felt like I was never good enough and felt like I annoyed everyone all the time. My episodes were now far and in between and i would only have around 2 or 3 ever since I came to the school. I'm now going to be going into my senior year and I'm trying to get my hygiene on check. I take showers everyday now and I'm trying to get into the habit of brushing my teeth and washing my face. I have a dry face so I'll need to get something for that, but besides that I'm nothing like how I used to be. I gained a large interest in video production and intend to go to a technical college for video production. I also hope to get a camera for my birthday and begin doing photography and some film projects to build a portfolio! I haven't had a single episode from spring to this far into summer and I intend to not have a single one this entire year! I still play video games but I have a lot of friends on the internet and I mostly play them to talk to them. A few friends know of my past but not many people do. I tried to progress too much last year but this year I'll finish the changes I wanted to make but couldnt get to last year. TLDR: I had panic episodes my entire life and had no social experience and I'm finally starting to move past it and improve my life."

Including election servers that had voter data. Nuke sites. Electrical grid. Its fucking scary! The DoD has policy now in place for settings scans and whispers. Those are responding to things China and Russia did 3 years ago to us. Thats how long it takes to make its way through the DoD to have a response. 3 fucking years ago. The other government agencies are just now starting to dip a toe into being more compliant like the DoD. Most of the public sector is no where close yet. The intel agencies are at the top however. The major leaks over the past 5 or 10 years have been due to exploits that were already known and patched. But the public sector mostly doesnt have any patch management system. The big guys in the public sector are coming along now, especially after all theirs leaks. It its still a low percentage and again they are trying to get to DoD standards WHICH IS 3 YEARS BEHIND.

778,cybersecurity,offmychest,I am extremely disappointed in where my life is at,2,bbvtdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/bbvtdq/i_am_extremely_disappointed_in_where_my_life_is_at/,2019-04-11 14:22:25,"Im 28, a divorced mom of 4 ( 6,5,3,2) and my youngest has CP and goes to 4 hours of therapy at a minimum a week and potentially other appointments. Im in school full time for my BS in IT/Cybersecurity and Im doing well. I should finish in 2021-2022 ish? Its online so my schedule is more flexible. I was just diagnosed with fibromyalgia and have been taking Cymbalta for a few weeks. Ive been abstinent for over a year ( havent even freaking cuddled someone other than my kids since February of 2018) I own my van, I own my house ( I mean I still owe like $75,000 so really the bank owns it but whatevs), my kids are all in school other than my youngest and they all do well. My mom just moved here from 16 hours away to help me. Idk, I feel like I should be relatively okay but I just feel like my house goes from spotless to TLC special in 4 days, I have to do literally all the planning and calling and organizing that goes into all 4 of their lives almost completely alone. My youngest still eats like a 6 month old and still wakes up to eat overnight. The last time I spent more than 24 hours child free was almost 2 years ago. Im lonely, but have no energy or desire for a relationship because they are complicated even under the best of circumstances, let alone my 3 ring circus. My new meds make me sleepy and spacey. I lose sentences halfway through and I have to go up and down the stairs 3 times sometimes to remember what I went for. I honestly know objectively that it will get easier, I will get through it, I will continue to strive for the things I need until this is just a treasured story of toil and love but right now it is just fucking heavy and hard. I feel alone. I feel cheated. I was supposed to have a partner for all of this, and I chose a shit one and was forced to make the only healthy choice available for me and my children. Im annoyed that the Universe decided that I, a scheduling challenged individual , would have a high needs child that I have to take to hella appointments and put through tests and procedures and all kinds of super not-fun things while balancing 3 other kids. I also have to give him and myself 3 medications daily because we have chronic conditions. I feel guilty feeling so burnt out because I am the engine that keeps this bus rolling. They depend on me and I am so dissatisfied with this role. I feel like my kids deserve better from me and I deserve better from me, but I have no tangible idea on how to get there other than making small and steady progress and letting time do its magic time thing.

Ive struggled a lot growing up, it really wasnt easy, I had a lot of hard work to do on both my mental health and my school performance. I was that kid that always got the highest grades because I genuinely enjoyed school, I love hanging out with my friends and life wasnt bad. However in the past 2 months the relationship between my parents severely declined, and Im not sad, believe me Ive wished for them to break up repeatedly over the years. My dad is not the worst person on Earth but he has done some things that neither mom or I can overlook. Ever since they separated (although we live in the same house) dad has acted nicer to me but completely horrible to mom, and I love mom greatly, shes the kindest person Ive met, she deserves the world not this. Ive told her before when they got into fights that she deserved better, especially now that she is 2 years cancer free. The big issue here is that mom is financially struggling a bit now, and we cant afford the whole world like we could with dad because he started earning more money in the past years and he was covering a lot of the costs. Im in my junior year and in my country I cannot get a job until Im 18, yet when Im 18 I will be in senior year and I need to focus heavily on my education in order to get into the university I want for IT and cybersecurity. Though, as soon as I get in I will look for a part-time job involving anything Im good at or anything I can learn to do quickly. Im praying that mom will be okay, and I wish I had the means to help her. Im glad however that this will be all over soon, and I know its not normal for kids involved in divorces to feel such relief but I do. Maybe my dreams of travelling the world and seeing other countries and cultures will have to wait, but it would be amazing to see mom happy. If you are in abusive/toxic relationship, please dont torture yourself, take a step back and ask yourself : Would I allow this to happen to my best friend? What would I do if this was happening to my sister/brother/close relative? What would other people who are not subjective think about this behavior? Do I deserve this?. Please listen to peoples advice because fuck am I glad that mom did, even if its years later and I cant tell anyone about this."

I just don't have the will to live anymore. I don't feel joy in anything, I don't feel excited about anything, not even things I once enjoyed like playing basketball or football. My life is basically on auto-pilot. Some background: I was diagnosed with Paranoid Personality Disorder so I've frankly isolated myself from the outside world and had very few close friends, with one standing out. A girl friend of mine whom I met in college and eventually became my best friend. She was my only source of comfort in my miserable life, showed me that perhaps I could also be normal instead of the paranoid recluse freak that I was and currently continue to be after I lost her. There is nothing more I want than to have her back, to show me the light again. Nowadays, I just drink and act normal to not worry my family. I also study Cybersecurity and am very good at it so that gives me some much needed distraction. I avoid talking about my issues because of my father, he just doesn't understand, he thinks it's ''all in my head'' and that I need to be more social, as if that would fix it. Being social is incredibly difficult for me. I love my father but he can be so fucking infuriating at times. At least my mother is more understanding and supportive. Now, going back to my mentioned plan, there is one complication that makes me seriously consider abandoning my plan. My sister and her children. I know my suicide would destroy my sister and my nephew and niece would grow up without an uncle. The thought of that shreds my heart. I think about doing it, I plan it, but I most probably won't carry it out. For them. I don't want to burden my sister with the pain I'm trying to get rid of. Just wanted to get this out there because holding it in makes me feel like shit. "

I'm a 19 year old college student at the University of Tokyo. I'm majoring in Cybersecurity and English language and my dream is to get a job as a translator for a large company like Nintendo. This last semester though I have only been taking cybersecurity classes. The problem is that I don't enjoy cybersecurity but my father, being Japanese, very much wants me to not have a job in translating video games. He wants me to have a well paying job in cybersecurity or as a doctor or anything that is science-ish and so my mother has been helping me pay for my English degree in secret. This has slowly made me become more and more depressed over time and two days ago it hit an all time high. I have a programming class in c++ and we had a project due. I could not figure out the project well so I turned in a crappy project. My grade in the class is 90% and the project is worth so little that even with a zero I'll still pass with an 80% or higher. But my father always talks about being the best so the thought of failing this assignment and disappointing him has made me just become super depressed within the last couple days. It's just a stupid assignment but my father has made it mean so much more, I just want to be done with cybersecurity because it's making me loose my mind."

Just 11 hours ago you were in another one of your stress-driven rants yammering on and on about how I was going to be a failure and that you wasted 19 years on me. I admit. I have been behind my peers as far as life accomplishments have been concerned but have you figured out whats been holding me back ? Its you. You and your entire family whove played with my emotions for the past few YEARS. Lets start You made a terrible choice in selecting your wife. You chose to marry a manipulative gold digger and cheater. She had no desire to be a mother. She neglected me for years because she was too busy having LDRs with white men online and cheating on you behind your back. I had nothing but a TV and primary school to turn to when I needed some form of companionship and care. She was a complete slob that left rotting fast food and dirty clothes strewn all over the house. Whenever you came back for the weekends from work overseas you werent much of a father. Whenever you attempted to tutor me in Math you would slap me and call me a pig for sneezing when the home was too dusty. Finally when I was 10, I realised something was way off about my mother. I gathered evidence of her affairs and turned them to you on my OWN volition. Putting my sanity at risk and ruining my sense of trust for years. You did the right thing in cutting her off and took the commendable choice in being a single father. But many times you have failed me. You constantly call me a retard and would slap me whenever I did badly for a test. I was bullied in school for my weight and my race. Whenever I brought it up you either told me to simply beat them up or told me I deserved it for being fat. I beat them up. It worked I admit. Though it made me an outcast from school. I wont go into much details because I would be here for hours but lets summarise what happened afterwards in the next 3 paragraphs. You branded me as a manipulative liar when I revealed what you did to me because I didnt want my newborn nephew to share my fate. You did not do anything to intervene when I spiralled into depression and struggles with an eating disorder for nearly the ENTIRE first year in Polytechnic (kind of like Community College in America ) You barely gave me support when my cousin falsely accused me of inappropriate touching. You continue to ignore the fact that I struggle with depression and suicidal ideation even in spite of the fact I told you I put up with it for YEARS and instead blame it on my laziness. There are PLENTY of online resources which you can turn to to educate yourself on what Im going through but no. You CHOSE to ignore them and play the tough parent. You refuse to give me any form of support or refer me to a professional but you either think its too much of a white person thing to do or I am a hazard to your mental wellbeing. You love me to ramble over and over about how much of a loser I am. But have you forgotten the times you decided to get close to me whenever I had a success or to ? You love to take some form of credit for my accomplishments yet you decide to pin all of my failures on me and me alone. In a few years time, after Ive completed my obligation to serve in my countrys army, Im simply going to disappear. I dont care where I go. Ill probably disappear to New Zealand and work at a convenience store there while pursuing valuable industrial certifications. Im going to save up for my OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) and the Microsoft Professional Program for Artificial Intelligence. Im not sure what other certificates to pursue but Ill figure it out soon. I may have done terrible in my polytechnic Cybersecurity course but Im going to persist in getting a decent job in IT. Im done with you. Im no longer going to allow myself to go into a depressive spiral when you chastise me or ramble about how your co-workers child is a better son than I am. Im no longer going to view you as a father or expect you to fulfil your responsibilities as one. For all intents and purposes, I consider myself an orphan. Some day, Im going to have a wonderful life and get into a monogamous relationship. Ill be sure to start a loving family comprised of a strong, loyal and honest woman and one or two children that Ill be working hard to gift them with the best the world has to offer. You wont be a part of it. Im going to succeed where you failed as a parent. If Im not getting a loving, supportive family Ill simply start my own when I get myself into a good job in IT. Im done with my rant about you. Im done letting my depression get the best of me. Im going to focus now on what I can do to get myself the future I want. Im not going to let you put me down any longer."

He's not a jerk or anything, and I actually agree with his decision in some respects - my original plan, which was work and put myself through school, wasn't really feasible at the time. However, I always felt like going to college wouldn't be a good investment of his money. I'm someone who barely got his high school degree, and suffers from perpetual laziness. It's gotten better over the years, though - and I do feel like I'm becoming more independent, responsible, and focused; however, the past couple of years feel like a waste in a sense. Sure, I've improved my character tremendously. As I mentioned, I feel more independent, responsible, and purposeful. I have a clearer vision of what I want out of my life, I've learned a lot about myself, I've become more positive, mature, and self-aware, I've had four different jobs over the course of two years, my credit score has improved, I have a decent amount of savings, and I've developed closer interpersonal relationships with the already established loved ones in my life, as well as other people. But it feels like a waste, because it took me four years to complete an associate's degree which I'll be done with in December...and very little marketable skills to show for it. Now I have to transfer or find a job in my field (which is computers). The latter of which will be difficult to do considering my complete lack of understanding of a lot of computer concepts, and the former of which will drag out an already unbearable and seemingly endless experience of college. I flip-flopped between majors. At first, I was general studies. Then I was in cyber security. Then political science. Then back to cyber security. And now, general Information Technology. Cybersecurity was painfully dry, political science was my original love but I learned it wasn't as enticing as I hoped, and IT was a field that sort of overlapped with cyber security and was the only way I'd finish community college by this year. Right now I'm utilizing a bunch of online learning resources (Cybrary, Udemy, Khan Academy, Coursera, edX, etc.) in hopes of at least getting some kind of worthwhile credential to bolster my resume and hopefully finally get at least an internship in IT. Then I'd work for a while and then go back to school. Still, it's a field that's deep and takes time to really get a grasp on concepts, even if you're working toward a merely ""eh, barely employable/intern"" level. I also took a web development class last year that I really enjoyed, and you only need an Associate's to work in it, but that also takes time. My savings account also isn't as big as I'd hoped it'd be by now, because I wasted a lot of money on food and other stuff. Seeing other people my age (friends and such) who are moved out, almost finished with their degree, already have their degree, or are in internships or established in their careers is also overwhelming to see. I'm not jealous, or at the very least I try not to be. But it does kinda get discouraging to see, and I feel so awful that I'm jealous at such a positive thing. What's worse is that my life is great, and I have minimal things to actually complain about. Yes, yes, I know I shouldn't compare...but I can't help but feel feelings of angst and regret. My goal in life is stability, an endless cushion of it. I know it's never guaranteed, but I wanna have the same source(s) of income, the same person to wake up next to, the safety of my loved ones, not having to worry about excessive uncertainty etc. And it sucks cause we live in such an awful world. High healthcare, education, and housing costs, mass shootings, sexual predators, and so on. I never want to have to bury someone in my family younger than me, and I never want anyone in my family who's older than me have to bury me or their kids/nieces/nephews/relatives in general. I wouldn't wish it on the world period and it upsets me that so many people have to live with such awful living conditions. tl;dr: (almost) 22 year old that wasted time in school (and a ton of time in general), feel like I'm overwhelmed with thoughts of comparison and being successful despite not having the work ethic to match high standards, get anxious by the world and the future, especially since a recession may be coming, and have immense feelings of uncertainty period.

I seriously thought he was the ugliest girl Ive ever seen. Then when he opened his mouth, it hit me that he was a DUDE. Im like damn, dude looks like a lady. Now you should know that Im very desperate and Ill date any and every guy who shows an interest in me, when he asked for my number so we could work in a team on a cybersecurity competition, I immediately jumped on it (then on his dick not much later). When we were in public together, people confused us for being two fat butch dykes. Then, worst part, he cheated on me with gay men. Multiple gay men from Grindr. Id estimate at least 10 in the span of a few weeks, but I didnt find out until a week ago. Now Im sick, I feel AWFUL, and I possibly have HIV. FML."

One of our accounts is a private Christian school and last semester we were doing it ourselves just fine, this year they kept us out of the loop and hired an IT manager to do most of the work of setting new teachers ready and helping with ordering things. She is so annoying! She texts me constantly asking for my help with things after hours and she is very neurotic and gets flustered when she has to deal with computer problems (which happen all the time of course). She was hired with no technical knowledge what so ever, we have already had to do a lot of work for her and show her how to do certain things yet she keeps bothering us with these things. It's my day off, yesterday after she asked me to do more things I told her I had to leave or else I was going to be going over time. Somehow she didn't understand, so she messaged me asking me when I would be in next and I said Monday. She said ""Okay, do you have time to talk today?"" I said call my dad if it's a tech issue and she said it's about my schedule, she was wondering what my schedule was going to look like when I went back to school and I told her. Then she wanted to know if I was flexible on certain hours and days for my schedule, I told her only on Fridays on the weekend.. It was really bothering me and I was trying to forget about it, and I thought it was the end but she just texted me again asking for more help! She said ""Sorry last question I promise!"" I DON'T FUCKING BELIEVE YOU. I'm ignoring her now, she can deal with it herself, if i'm not on the clock don't bother texting me about work related issues or scheduling just be patient. I need a new fucking job yesterday.."

This is something I can't even tell my own mother. Not for a few years, at least. Ever since I was 8, I've had terribly bad depression and nobody to talk about it with. Therapists didn't help much, neither would my parents, the rare times they were there. (Lets just leave it at that. I don't talk bad about people behind their back.) In freshman and sophomore year of school, I had no friends. Only an enemy. I kept a box cutter in my bag for him if he ever messed with me. Every day after school, I used to go steal things. I didn't care if I got caught, since I wasn't planning on living for very long. I had always hoped that some beautiful girl would come along and tell me that I was better than that. But she never came. So I kept stealing. Every time I did, I was wearing the same grey hoodie with the radioactive patch on the hood. This year alone I've traveled to Cuba, helped rebuild homes in New Orleans, gotten out of a toxic relationship, I'm planning a 90 mile backpacking trip this summer, and now, I'm a high school graduate. I'd cry, but nothing really phases me anymore. Besides, I think I've already cried all my tears out all those years ago Graduating high school may seem a small accomplishment to you, but it means the world to me, considering a few years ago I didn't think I would be alive or free by now. I just got finished with my last day of school not an hour ago. I did it wearing that grey hoodie with the radioactive patch on the hood. I can't say I've given up all my old ways. I still think of going back to my criminal ways occasionally. I still have my doubts and to this day, I get anxiety, just like I have right now. I've spent my entire life studying so hard, trying to get through school, never not having work that I need to do, and now... It's over. I'm free. No more studying. Well, I WILL be studying when I go to college, but I'll only study things that I want to study, and I don't really consider that 'work'. Even as I type this, I'm still wearing that same gray hoodie with the radioactive symbol on the hood. In a few hours, I'm gonna have an interview to get into a coding school that I feel like is way out of my league. I'm not gonna lie, I'm pretty nervous for this interview. Hopefully one day I can get a job in cybersecurity, or maybe even start my own gaming company. I don't know for sure where I'm going in the future. I plan to just roll with the punches. All I know now is that it's gonna be one hell of an adventure. And I'll do it wearing that gray hoodie with that symbol of hope on the hood."

I work part time as a police officer. I am either wanting to receive a grad certificate in Cybersecurity management or a Master's degree in Public Affairs specializing in Public Management. I am wanting to further my education while I'm still in the mindset and nothing in life is holding me back. I need advice from people who have obtained a Master's degree or a grad certificate after receiving a bachelor' degree. I'm not sure whether a graduate certificate is worth the money if it isn't as highly regarded in the professional world. Money is an issue when it comes to choosing between the two. I'm already in huge debt from undergraduate school. I know a graduate certificate would be cheaper and require less time than a Master's degree. I'd appreciate some advice and experience. 
793,cybersecurity,offmychest,Whats the fucking point?,3,6d4arm,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6d4arm/whats_the_fucking_point/,2017-05-25 05:12:08,"I've struggled with depression since freshman year of high school and now that I'm 19 years old and finally got something in my life to go my way its all going to be taken away from me because some shit-head cop couldn't just let me and my friend mind our own business. A couple weeks ago me and a friend of mine were in my car in a park after night watching netflix on his phone through my car speakers and a cop decided he was gonna roll up and pressure us and ask us where our weed is. Now of course that day was the first day ever I decided to try smoking weed but we hadn't even smoked yet. We weren't high and we were just watching netflix because neither of us wanted to go home, him coming from a shitty family and me being a concerned friend, so we were just in a park because it was the closest place to park. The second the cop starting asking questions I gave up everything and now I have a court date to face two charges of possession of marijuana and one for paraphernalia and of course it was in Naperville illinois the shittiest city in the state that still has a ridiculously high fine for possession even though the state law makes it a max of $200 for each citation. Not to mention I could lose out on my eligibility for student loans, it's going to go down on my record, and for the rest of my life people are going to see that I have a drug charge because one fucking time in my life I wanted to try something that everyone I know has been doing for years. I'm literally a good kid, I went to ASU for computer science and am transferring to purdue for cybersecurity with a minor in electrical engineering or some other engineering im not even sure yet. I don't drink, I never smoked but of course the one time I want to try I get caught and fucked over. None of this helps the fact that I already hate being alive more than anything else and have already attempted suicide 4 times, and can't afford to get therapy or medication let alone pay almost $2,000 in fines for this stupid ass drug charge. Not to mention, everyone I know will look at me differently because of this and nobody will trust me to babysit or anything which was a huge source of my summer money. Honestly, what's even the point of being alive? My whole future is fucked because of one decision I made when i didn't even smoke. They have the weed, bowl, and grinder and they almost pinned me with a DUI until I passed their sobriety test. Theres honestly not a point to even being alive anymore because after my court date I'm going to lose my eligibility to be a security officer in Illinois &amp; Wisconsin, so there goes my summer job and any chance of paying for my school next year. Honestly, fuck being alive. If I even live past my court date, I'm not raising kids in this shitty world because what's the fucking point?"

I had my second interview with the real-world Allsafe Cybersecurity equivalent. I'm getting closer to making my dreams a reality on a daily basis. Why aren't you here? Why did you have to lose your shit? Why did you stop giving me any affection whatsoever? Why did you keep saying that we were 'friends' and when I wanted more (not from you, I respected your feelings and wishes), you went crazy? Why could you not see that I didn't need much, just a hug that didn't feel like an obligation? When was the last time that you called me and just wanted to hang out? Not go filming or accomplish anything, just be around each other? It's been... I don't remember how long. We talked for hours upon hours on the phone, but you always said that you were too busy to hang out in person. Why couldn't you spare the time for me? You think I wanted to go back on OKC? I was desperate for some kind of physical contact with someone. Could I have told you? Yeah, but do you know how you act when you hear something that you don't like? You're fucking brutal. I was drinking so much that weekend, just to try to numb the pain. I finally conjured up the self-respect to realize that I deserved more. Better. But jesus, I wish it was you that actually wanted me. I'm not even going into how terrible the things that you said or didn't say made me feel about myself. How you flipped me shit through both of our trips. How miserable I really was. How I had to take xanax every time that we talked so your inquisition like questioning didn't cause me to dive into depression and anxiety. How terrible the things you said made me feel inside. How you used to dangle the string of 'someday we could be together' infront of me, and how that hope made me feel so messed up inside. How you told me that I wasn't allowed to say that I loved you or call you my best friend. Who says that kind of shit? I was still willing to be friends with you. I was still willing to be your cameraman. I was still willing to spend all my free time and extra money trying to help you. I was still willing to help you move a thousand miles away from me. I was still willing to put your needs ahead of mine, like I always did. All I needed was just a little affection. A little effort on your part to make me feel how I made you feel. It doesn't take much. I know I'm a doormat. I know I'm a punching bag. I know that I deserve better. I deserve more. But god damn it... Why did you act this way?"

796,cybersecurity,offmychest,Worried about my job in the new administration,1,5k59aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5k59aw/worried_about_my_job_in_the_new_administration/,2016-12-25 08:48:31,"I'm going to start by saying I may be overreacting. I know this. I'm really stressed out about this and need to get it off my chest. Also, when I talk about the parties, I am NOT dismissing one group or trying to add my personal leanings. I am strictly talking about historical policies and how they may be impacted by the new administration. Factual, not emotional. Background: I am a social worker by trade. I currently work in a job that is contracted through Medicare and Medicaid. I live in Texas. I travel statewide extensively for my job. All the talk from the new administration of cutting social program funds and Medicare/Medicaid makes me scared that I will be unemployed relatively soon. I always worry in a Republican run government because they don't fund social programs like the Democrats do. If Medicare goes away or gets privatized, I don't see how I will keep my job. And, as a social worker (and a BSW at that, which even now limits my options), I don't think I will find a new job if I am laid off. I have a Master's degree in Public Administration, which, again, does little good in a small central government. I also dont have any expwrience in city/local government, who would normally place more value in an MPA. I am afraid it won't help much. I am the breadwinner for my family. My husband doesn't work, and is in school, for probably another 2 years or so. We have a respectable savings account but I don't really want to depend on it. So I'm wondering if I should change careers entirely. It's something I've been tossing around for awhile, and now may be the time to do it. I'm thinking IT- cybersecurity, database management, or network management. I already own study guides to get some basic certs, which should help me get into a program. Cons: I have no professional experience in IT, and don't know if I can take the pay cut while I spend my time gaining experience. Teaching, which would be an easy transition, would be a bad idea, even special ed. I would have the same worries about cuts and lay offs that I do now. Anything healthcare related may be a good choice. I have extensive experience with the healthcare field, and have several fields that interest me, from HIM to PTA to PA (and several more). Cons: Would cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and the ACA lead to reimbursement issues and, again, lead to an unstable employment market? Plus these programs are very competitive and may require classes/clinicals from 9-5, which of course is when I do my current job. I am going to hunker down for now, taking the wait and see approach, but I feel I need to start making plans. My anxiety is in full force right now. I ask my husband, and all he sees are the times I get to work from home, so he tells me not to change jobs because then I can't work from home. (Whew. Long sentence.) Thanks for reading this long stream of consciousness. Any advice would be apppreciated. Tl;dr: Current social worker worried new administration will obliterate my career field, and wondering if I should change careers."

I started programming when I was 17 working for a media firm making advertising games, which for a time, was fun. But money overcame their senses and I was offered a better job as a web developer. The first year of my new job were great and the pay was better, but a new supervisor was hired who was decked out in a sparkly PhD and years of Javascript experience. He lead the new projects, and I had no problem with that. It's come to the point, a year later, where I am still working on my undergraduate degree, trying to make side money to afford my home, a car, insurance, and school because the system believes my lower class white family should pay for 100% of my school expenses. However it's come to the point where my supervisor doesn't approve of my work anymore. He doesn't like my code but he won't tell me up front, he's not transparent. He communicates his anger in passive aggressive GitHub issues. I try to confront him in real time (he works remotely) but I get the 'I'll send you an email later' response. So when I wake up the next morning, it's another passive aggressive response. My boss is now his puppet, when my supervisor says jump, my boss does a backflip. My supervisor is paid almost 3x more than I am, at only 20/hr, and the expectation is that my code must be identical to his and at the same quality for the same pay. Recently I was told I must also be spending my free time researching and reading, and I do as much as I can, but it is not enough. My University increased fees and tuition again this year, so for the first time I have to ask my parents for money so I can still go to school, even through working as much as I do. I've been trying to get back into game development to make side money so I can stop penny pinching and reducing my meals down to nuts and fruits. My boss and my supervisor are peering down on me like a hawk, comparing my work to a newer hire, also decked out in a fancy PhD in computer science. I'm so tired of being a web developer. I'm beyond sick of it. I could make more money, doing less, as a system administrator, which, in truth, I seriously would prefer. I came into this wanting to be a programmer, but programming in this environment is so beyond stressful that every day in the office is a weight on my shoulders. All I can think about each day is what I can make outside of this work, with what I know, so that I can finish my degree peacefully and successfully. Maybe an HTML5 game, or a series of browser games and advertisements. I'm already a full time employee working on a full time class schedule. I've considered dropping it all, joining the military and getting cybersecurity training and working for the federal government, doing what I think will be a rewarding career, but I just don't know for sure. I know I shouldn't complain about being employed, but when every day is making me this miserable, I had to get it out somewhere. "
