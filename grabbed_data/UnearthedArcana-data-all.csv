0,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,(HELP) My first homebrew creation. The Elemental College of frost,1,i4nx81,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/i4nx81/help_my_first_homebrew_creation_the_elemental/,2020-08-06 18:24:00,"I was thinking of making elemental bard colleges for all elements. I started with ice. It's probably really bad and unbalanced. Please help me out. This is my first homebrew creation (also, some of the wording in strange. Bear with me here.) Bards of the college of frost have learned to transcend and channel power from the elemental plane of frost. The have the ability to withstand, nay, thrive in the coldest of tundras. They have become one with the cold and often don't need to wear heavy clothing while deep in the winter storm. They tell stories about their adventures in the cold and keep lore about the creatures of the artic. Master of the Artic Arcane At 3rd level, you gain resistance to cold damage as well as vulnerability to fire damage. You dont take any exaustion due to cold temperatures. You may have any melee attack do cold damage (must be stated before the attack hits). You also gain the ability to learn the spells Cone of cold, frost bite, ice knife, ice storm, Investiture of ice, ray of frost, sleet storm, snilloc's snowball swarm and wall of ice. Proficiencies When you join the College of Frost at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with survival, nature and one more of your choice as well as a musical instrument. Frozen melody At 6th level, you're able to use the power of music to drop the temperature. When you use bardic inspiration or a performance check, you're able to make the air around you in a 5-30 foot sphere very cold for 3 rounds. if you use it again while it's still active, the cold area dissipates and spawns where you reactivate it (you get to change the range again) any one who enters the sphere takes 1d4 cold damage. Any attacks that deal cold damage deals an extra d4. Any attacks that deal fire damage have disadvantage. Ice Sheild At 14th level, you gain the ability to protect yourself and your allies with a sheild of ice that hovers around them for 1 minute when you use bardic inspiration and a second level spell slot. Anyone that attempts to hit the player with the sheild has disadvantage. If they hit, the ice sheild dissolves. If they miss, the ice sheild scatters into ice shards that dig into the opponent doing 3 D6 plus the bards charisma modifier in cold damage. If a fire attack misses, the sheild melts and no damage is done to the opponent. (You're now immune to cold damage)"
1,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Cryomancy: 8 Ice- and Snow-themed Spells for anybody but Wizards,1,i9jkx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/i9jkx4/cryomancy_8_ice_and_snowthemed_spells_for_anybody/,2020-08-14 20:33:22,"Seriously though, screw wizards. Those bastards have more than enough spells already. These spells are meant for sorcerers, druids, and some clerics (Nature and Tempest). Everything uses a d6 because they're ice cubes, get it? NB: All Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage (DMG 247). **Ice Cube** *1st level evocation* 1 action, 30 feet, VS, Concentration up to 1 minute You trap one creature in a blast of icy mist. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw or become trapped in ice for the duration. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 cold damage and is restrained by a mass of ice. While the target is restrained in this way, you can use a bonus action on subsequent turns to deal 1d6 cold damage to it automatically. The mass of ice is an object that lasts for the duration, or until it is destroyed. It has an AC of 14 and 5 hit points, immunity to cold damage, and vulnerability to fire and thunder damage. At higher levels, t he ice's AC increases by 1 and it has 5 more hit points for each slot level above 1st. (5hp/Lvl, AC 13+Lvl) **Cold Shoulder** *1st level abjuration* 1 reaction to taking nonmagical B/P/S damage, Self, VS, Instantaneous Ice crystals briefly form on your skin and absorb some of the force of a blow. You reduce the triggering damage by 1d6. At higher levels, you reduce the triggering damage by an additional 1d6 for each slot level above 1st. (1d6/Lvl) **Frigid Welcome** *2nd level transmutation* 1 bonus action, 30 feet, VS, Instantaneous Ice crystals form around one creature you can see within range, briefly preventing it from entering combat. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or its initiative count decreases by 10. You can cast this spell only against a creature that has not yet taken its turn. At higher levels, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. (1 target/Lvl-1) **Igloo** *2nd level abjuration (ritual)* 1 minute, Self (10-foot radius hemisphere), VSM (a small round crystal), 8 hours A 10-foot-radius dome of ice and densely packed snow forms around you and lasts for the duration or until it is destroyed. Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to cause an opening to appear or disappear, large enough for a Medium creature to crawl through. As long as the entrance is closed, the atmosphere inside the dome is comfortable and dry, and any creatures inside the dome have total cover against attacks and other effects outside the dome, and vice versa. The igloo is an object with 30 hit points, an AC of 15, immunity to cold damage, and vulnerability to fire and thunder damage. The spell ends if the igloo is destroyed. At higher levels, the igloo's hit points increase by 15 for each slot level above 2nd. (Lvl*15) **Sela's Sparkling 'Cicles** *4th level evocation* 1 action, 60 feet, VSM (a shard of broken glass), Instantaneous You create 3 enormous icicles and hurl them towards targets in range. You can direct them at the same target or different ones. Make a ranged spell attack for each icicle. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage and 4d6 cold damage. At higher levels, you can create one additional icicle for each slot level above 4th. **Iceberg** *5th level evocation* 1 action, 60 feet, VS, Concentration up to 30 seconds You batter a creature you can see within range with a series of progressively larger hailstones. As part of the casting of this spell and as an action on each of your turns for the duration, you force the target to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 1d6 cold damage, plus 1d6 cold damage for each round you have maintained your concentration. When you initially cast the spell, the damage is 1d6; on your next turn, it is 2d6, and so on. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The maximum duration increases by 1 round for each slot level above 5th. [Might be an AoE instead: cf. Destructive Wave p.231, Meteor Swarm p.259] **Avalanche** *8th level evocation* 1 action, 150 feet, VS, Concentration up to 1 minute A crushing wave of snow and ice buries a large area. Each creature in a 50-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained as the snow buries it. On a success, it takes half as much damage and is knocked prone, but is not restrained. Whenever a creature ends its turn restrained by this spell, it takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage. A creature restrained by this spell can use its action to repeat this saving throw to try to break free. Structures within range fail this saving throw automatically, and may collapse. Whether it succeeds on its saving throw or not, each creature in range takes 4d6 cold damage. A creature also takes this damage when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A flying creature has its flying speed reduced to 0 as long as it remains in the spell's area, and may take fall damage if it is airborne when it enters the area. The spell's entire area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. **Glacier** *9th level evocation* 1 action, Self, VSM (a thin sheet of rock crystal at least 3 feet across, which the spell consumes), Concentration up to 8 hours You manipulate the environment within 1 mile of you, causing it to take the form of a barren, icy wasteland. At the start of each turn for the duration, each creature within range takes 1d6 cold damage, and it has disadvantage on all Dexterity and Constitution saving throws. The entire area becomes difficult terrain for the duration."

He ideally should have some tree features, like bark growing on his skin, love of sunlight and birds, and sprouting leaves and mushrooms on his body. Totem Spirit - Level 3 Tree. While raging, your skin becomes more akin to bark, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and resistance to all damage, except for fire and slashing damage which you gain vulnerability to. Aspect of the photosynthesis - Level 6 Tree. Your affinity to nature grants you healing capabilities whilst in sunlight. If you move 0 feet during your turn and are in sunlight you can use your bonus action to give another creature within 20ft of you and yourself hitpoints equal to half your level in this class of d6s. Once you use this feature you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again. Totemic Attunement - Level 14 Tree. While raging your size grows to Large, your weight is multiplied by eight, and your strength score and maximum is increased by 2 until your rage ends. What do you think?

4,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Some special zombies I'm working on for my upcoming Fantasy Zombie Apocalypse campaign,1,hqbwua,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/hqbwua/some_special_zombies_im_working_on_for_my/,2020-07-13 18:59:52,"I actually created a Loathsome Limbs zombie for a friend's campaign well before Curse of Strahd came out and found it was far too broken when I gave every limb the Undead Fortitude trait and 10 HP, so I like the changes the design team made with CoS. I borrowed and changed it a bit to fit my zombies, and added a lot of abilities borrowed from various creatures from different source books. Basically, when I have 10 variants, I'll roll a d20 for every zombie in a horde they encounter, 1-10 will be standard zombies, but 11-20 will each have one of the special variants assigned to a number. Some locations they encounter will have more of a specific type, like Spore Zombies in the Underdark, Rot-Plague zombies in swamps, Ash zombies near volcanoes, etc. A lot of inspiration was taken from Left 4 Dead and 7 Days to Die, my dad's two favorite games. He's one of those nutty Doomsday preppers and zombie enthusiasts, so I figured it was time to run a campaign he would really love, since he's been humoring us for the last few months playing in our more traditional high fantasy campaign and Shadowrun-ish cyberpunk fantasy campaign. **Zombie** Medium Undead, Unaligned Armor Class 8 Hit Points 30 (4d8 + 9) Speed 20 ft. STR 13 (+1) DEX 6 (-2) CON 16 (+3) INT 3 (-4) WIS 6 (- 2) CHA 5 (- 3) Saving Throws Wis +0 Damage Immunities poison Damage Vulnerability radiant Condition Immunities poisoned Passive Perception 8 Challenge 1 (200 XP) Languages understands the languages it knew in life but can't speak Virulent Plague. A humanoid slain by a melee attack from the zombie revives as a zombie on its next turn. Loathsome Limbs. Whenever the zombie takes at least 6 slashing damage at one time, roll a d20 to determine what else happens to it: 1-10: Nothing else happens. 11-14: One leg is severed from the zombie if it has any legs left. 15- 18: One arm is severed from the zombie if it has any arms left. 19-20: The zombie is decapitated. If the zombie is reduced to 0 hit points, all parts of it die. Until then, a severed part acts on the zombies initiative and has its own action and movement. A severed part has AC 8. Any damage it takes is subtracted from the zombies hit points. A severed leg is unable to attack and has a speed of 5 feet. A severed arm has a speed of 5 feet and can make one grapple attack on its turn, with disadvantage on the attack roll unless the zombie can see the arm and its target. When the zombie loses both arms, it loses its grapple attack. If its head is severed, the zombie is killed instantly. The zombie's speed is halved if it's missing a leg. If it loses both legs, it falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can't benefit from bonuses to speed. Undead Fortitude. If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+ the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead. ACTIONS Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage. Grapple. Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, one target Hit: The target is grappled and any zombie within 5 feet of the target may use its bite attack. Bite. Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, one target Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target contracts the Virulent Plague. Zombie Variants gain the following abilities: **Ash Zombie** Damage Immunity Fire Heated Body. A creature that touches the zombie or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (1d6) fire damage. Ash Burst. When the zombie dies, it explodes in a cloud of ash. Each creature within 5 feet of it must then succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw on each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. **Burster Zombie** Death Burst. The zombie explodes and is destroyed. Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 12 (4d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A humanoid creature killed by this damage rises as a burster zombie after 1 minute. **Zombie Husk** Vulnerability to Bludgeoning Damage Dust Burst. The first time the zombie takes damage, any living creature within 5 feet of the zombie must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or gain disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it early with a successful save. **Rot-plague Zombie** Immune to Necrotic Damage Rancid Degeneration. At the end of each of the zombies turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes 7 (2d8) necrotic damage, unless the zombie has taken acid or fire damage since the end of its last turn. **Spell-plague Zombie** Antimagic. The zombie has advantage on saving throws against spells, and any creature making a spell attack against the zombie has disadvantage on the attack roll. If the zombie succeeds on its saving throw against a spell or a spell attack misses it, an additional effect might occur, as determined by rolling a d6: 12. If the spell affects an area or has multiple targets, it fails and has no effect. If the spell targets only the zombie, it has no effect on the zombie and is reflected back at the caster, using the spell slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster. 34. No additional effect. 56. The spellplague converts some of the spells energy into a burst of destructive force. Each creature within 30 feet of the zombie must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 1d6 force damage per level of the spell on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Teleport (Recharge 46). The zombie magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 40 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Before or after teleporting, the zombie can make one grapple attack. If the zombie teleports while grappling a creature, the creature is also teleported. **Spore Zombie** Distress Spores. When the Spore Zombie takes damage, all other Spore Zombies within 240 feet of it can sense it. Hallucination Spores. The zombie ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target is Incapacitated while it hallucinates. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. **Venom Zombie** Poison Splash. When the zombie takes damage of any type but psychic, each creature within 5 feet of the zombie takes 7 (2d8) poison damage. **Virulent Plague** When a Humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected. It takes 1d4 days for virulent plagues symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of Exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of Hit Points from spending Hit Dice and no Hit Points from finishing a Long Rest. At the end of each Long Rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of Exhaustion. On a successful save, the characters Exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creatures level of Exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease. Homebrewing is one of my passions, and this has been a lot of fun to work on, so I hope people find it interesting!"

Essentially immortal, golems have long since figured out the mechanical secrets of their own creation, and without the control of the society that created them, they have become sentient. Usually crafted from fine clay, though occasionally carved from stone or cast from iron, each golem is a work of art and statuary to be admired. Their animating energy comes from a magical scroll writ with the words that guide their existence, most importantly since their own independence is the sentence THINE MASTER IS THINE OWN MIND, though typically their parent or creator will have additional words inscribed that guide their offspring's development. At their coming of age ceremony, when a golem has been judged to be mature and educated on the nature of the world sufficiently to care for themself, a golem is able to add some more words to their chem (the name for the scroll that animates them) that will be the guiding provisions for their future. It is important to note that while the amount of words a chem can hold is limited they can be reasonably freely changed. Being a stone golem gives +2 strength and +2 constitution but inflicts a -1 to intelligence and -1 to dexterity. A movement speed of 20ft, vulnerability to cold, and resistance to lightning, and resistance to falling damage. A stone golem has 12+dex modifier for its natural armor. Being a clay golem given +2 to intelligence and +2 to constitution. It inflicts a -1 to dexterity, and a -1 to charisma. A movement speed of 30ft, a vulnerability to lightning, resistance to fire, and resistance to falling damage. A clay golem has 10+dex for its natural armor. Being an Iron Golem gives +2 to Strength and constitution, and inflicts a -1 to charisma and intelligence. A movement speed of 25ft, vulnerability to fire, resistance to cold, resistance to falling damage. An Iron golem has 14+dex for its natural armor but cannot wear other physical armor. All golems can breath underwater but move at  speed underwater instead of half. In melee a golem deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage if unarmed. A golem lives technically forever so age is more or less irrelevant to them, as such they do not count the years. A golem looms above normal humanoids at between 7  and 8  feet tall. Golems do not have a gender as such, though individual golems may adopt a masculine or feminine or neutral personality."
9,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Blood Ooze [need advices],1,hil9t0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/hil9t0/blood_ooze_need_advices/,2020-06-30 21:06:20,"So, I'm a new DM with a group of 7 new players. We are playing through LMoP and I decided to make some changes. Instead of Venomfang, the party will be going against a night hag and some shadows (she won't be immediatly hostile towards the party and they can get out without having to fight). The party will be lvl 2, or even 3 by the time they reach Thundertree. Between her minions I decided to put some kind of blood monster (I made a map with a little prison and there is a blood pool in a cell with a statue on it). I didn't find anything online so I decided to homebrew something. Here's what came out. &amp;#x200B; # Blood Ooze Medium Ooze, unaligned **Armor Class** 8; **Hit points** 30 (4d8+12); **Speed** 10 ft., climb 10 ft. **STR** 12 **DEX** 6 **CON** 16 **INT** 1 **WIS** 6 **CH**A 2 **Skills**: Stealth +2; **Damage Vulnerabilities**: necrotic; **Damage Immunities**: lighting, slashing; **Condition Immunities**: blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, prone; **Senses**: blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this radius), passive Perception 8; **CR**: ? **Amorphous**: The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. **False Appearence**: While the ooze remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a blood pool. **ACTIONS** **Pseudopod**: melee attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6+1) bludgeoning, plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. **REACTIONS** **Split**: When an ooze that is Medium or larger is subjected to lightning or slashing damage, it splits into two new oozes if it has at least 10 hit points. Each new ooze has hit points equal to half the original ooze's, rounded down. New oozes are one size smaller than the original ooze. &amp;#x200B; Basically I took an Ochre Jelly and a Grey Ooze and put them toghether, trying to add something new (necrotic damage instead of acid, since I think that blood should ""sicken"" the targets, and necrotic vulnerability to help the party and also because since blood is something ""living"" it should be more affected by necrotic damage). What do you think? Will the party wipe it out in a round? Will it be a TPK (the hag will use this and some other shadow-minions to gain some time to escape if she start to loose, and use only one Shadow during the fight)? What CR should it be (I know there are tables and rules to calculate it, but I didn't understand them really well)? Any help in bettering this monster will be really helpful. I want my players to have fun."

I'm not talking like a constant thing all of the time. Like a magic weapon that if it hits, the next attack that does X type of damage, the monster is weak to it? Or an item with charges so you can expend a charge and give something vulnerability to a certain damage type? Or, alternatively, giving monsters weaknesses and invulnerabilities that they may or may not otherwise have (an example would be a Siren being immune to frost damage, but weak to fire and or electricity)? &amp;#x200B; I'm a newer DM and thinking of running a Cyberpunk/Supernatural (like the TV show)/Lovecraftian (maybe? if I can get things to go my way?) sort of setting and I know that only 20 some creatures have ""weaknesses"", and most magic can get past stuff. I think this gives an element of ""do your research"" to know what you are going up against, but also rewards players for cooperating (""I'll make him weak, you slash him to pieces!""), rewards the players for planning/strategizing and resource management. I'm just wondering if I'm perhaps biting off more than I can chew, if its a cool idea, if its just really really dumb... &amp;#x200B; TIA! Sincerely, a DM that really doesn't know what to do"
11,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,The Bloodforged: a Blood Hunter sub-class inspired by Crona from Soul Eater. C+C welcome,1,ghgf4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/ghgf4y/the_bloodforged_a_blood_hunter_subclass_inspired/,2020-05-11 14:05:15,"Order of the BloodForged Not many know of the dangers that can lie in the seemingly inanimate. The Bloodforged, however, give there lives to the study and retrieval of cursed objects. They have seen first hand the devastation of nearly indestructible weapons that drive their wielders to madness and mass destruction. Seeing themselves as the worlds diseased healers, member of the order of the bloodforged take the curse into themselves so that it may die with them. It is only through the excruciating process of melting these weapons to their liquid form and replacing there own blood with this cursed molten metal that they can exclude the rest of the world from this danger. It is suggested that you take a curse for your character when you take this subclass. You and your DM may work together to come up with a curse or you can choose one from the table below. Curses: 1- You constantly hear the voice of a demon telling you to slaughter every one around you. You dont know how long you can keep resisting their will. 2- You are aging at a rapid rate. You are unsure if you will be able to be of any help to those you care about before expiring. 3- Body is in constant physical pain. You have grown dependent on a concoction that numbs it 4- During the transfusion ritual the weapon almost took over your body. You had to amputate in order to keep its influence from spreading 5- Your appearance is warped and beastly. It is hard for you to look non-hostile. 6- Your race has changed to that of a mostly evil aligned race. You feel more and more like one of them every day. 7- Whenever its quiet you hear the last cries of every person who was killed with the weapon. As a result you prefer loud environments. 8- A voice is offering you information on where to find more cursed items. You just have to do a few things for it first... ***Rite of War:*** you learn the esoteric rite of war (detail below) Rite of War: your rite damage is your choice of Bludgeoning, Piercing or Slashing type. ***Blood Iron:*** Starting when you join this order at 3rd level you have undergone the procedure that makes you one with your blade. You are able to summon your rite weapon from your own blood as a bonus action by taking your crimson rite damage. This weapon can take the form of any melee weapon you are proficient with. You may choose a different form each time you summon it. When you summon your rite weapon in this way it automatically is under the effect of one of your crimson rites. This weapon loses its heavy, or thrown tags if it has one and is considered light if it is not two-handed. This weapon lasts until the end of your next short or long rest. ***Sanguine Armor***: Starting at 3rd level you are able to use the liquid metal in your veins. When you are hit with an attack or targeted by an effect that deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, Poison, Thunder, or Slashing damage you may use your reaction to harden your veins to gain resistance to the damage of that attack or spell. You may do this a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier per long rest. You may not use this ability to resist damage from your own blood hunter abilities. ***Consuming Transfusion:*** At 7th level, you are able to consume a magic weapon into your rite weapon by performing a special ritual. Over the course of 1 hour, while you hold the weapon, you perform the ritual. After this ritual is completed your rite weapon gains any magical properties the weapon you consumed had. When you consume a magic weapon in this way it takes one of your attunment slots whether or not the absorbed weapon required attunment. You may unattune a weapon as a bonus action in which the weapon is also destroyed. Additionally, when you absorb a weapon in this way you ignore all race and class requirements on use of this item. Bonuses to hit, such as with +1 weapons, do not stack with each other. You use the bonus of the weapon with the highest bonus. ***Tempered Blood:*** At 7h level your symbiosis with your weapon has become stronger. While not wearing armor your armor class becomes 14+Dexterity modifier. ***Brand of Destruction:*** Beginning at 11th level, your Brand of Castigation now directs the ire of your blood weapons curse. Any attack roll you make against the branded target is a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19 or 20 on the d20. Additionally the branded creature has vulnerability to any rite damage you deal to it. ***Morbid Puppeteer:*** At 15th level the cursed weapon in your blood has learned much about your body. If you reach 0 hit points, and are not killed outright, your blood puppeteers your body for 1 minute afterward allowing you to keep fighting. You still must make death saving throws every turn and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws or taking damage, you due not die until the end of that minute. This process is extremely draining. If you are healed in any way during this minuet you only gain half the hit points (rounded down) that you would normally receive. You cannot receive healing after you have failed all three death saving throws. ***Dark Spike:*** At 18th you learn to control your blood even outside of your body. Once per turn you may use one or both of your attacks to make a special attack. This attack must originate from a space where you have taken Bludgeoning, Necrotic, Piercing, Slashing, or Thunder, damage or damage from your own blood hunter abilities in the last hour and that you can see. This attack uses your Intelligence to hit, has a reach of 20ft. deals 2d10+Int modifier piercing damage and is considered magical for the sake of overcoming damage resistances. ##### Blood Curse of Retaliation *Prerequisite: 15th level, Order of the Bloodforged* As a reaction to being hit with a melee attack, you sharpen your blood and launch a counter attack Dealing 2d6 piercing damage to the creature that hit you. This damage is considered magical for the sake of overcoming damage resistances. ***Amplify:*** The targeted creature takes extra damage equal to twice the damage you take from your hemocraft die for amplifying."
12,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,The Assassin - Revised,1,gja6m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/gja6m4/the_assassin_revised/,2020-05-14 09:12:29,"I always thought the assassin was a subclass with a strong mechanical and flavor identity that suffered from early-development jank. Its ribbon features (Infiltration Expert and Impostor) are so situational and narrow that even in an RP heavy campaign you would have to work hard to ever make them relevant, and they seem more like something that gets in the way of gameplay rather than enabling it. Effectively, if you pick the assassin, you are probably picking it for its excellent DPS options, but these options require you to consistently perform well on initiative, and the base class does nothing to help you with that. To address these problems I made the following main changes: * I changed the two ribbon features to use mechanics that are much simpler and less incredibly situational while still being relevant to social gameplay. They don't add much power to the class, but that is by design. * I gave it advantage on initiative checks at level 3 so it can land its assassinate crits more reliably * (less important) I changed the death strike to take advantage of the vulnerability mechanic like similar class features (path to the grave was an inspiration) to make it better integrated with the rules and less prone to insane multiplier effects. Let me know what you think! ### Assassin You focus your training on the grim art of death. Those who adhere to this specialty are diverse: hired killers, spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed priests trained to exterminate the enemies of their deity. Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your foes with deadly efficiency. #### Bonus Proficiencies When you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner's kit. #### Assassinate Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on initiative rolls, and on your first turn during combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit. #### Infiltrator At 9th level, you have learned to use trickery and lies to get close to your targets and slip away unnoticed. You gain the following benefits: * You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks to maintain a cover or provide an alibi. * You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to conceal a weapon or item. * You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to don a disguise. #### Poisoner At 13th level, you become a practiced hand at working with poisons. You gain the following benefits: * You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage. * You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to administer poison. * You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to apply poison to a weapon. #### Death Strike Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you hit a creature that is surprised with a weapon attack, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage."

I have not found an instance of this house rule or anything similar to it online. Here's how I came about thinking up this house rule. I play a Druid of the Spore, Forest Gnome who embodies fungi, but his greatest fear is forest fire. No trees or plants = no fungi to form a symbiosis. The house rule: PC's have the **option** to have innate *Immunity* to any 1 damage type (no status effects). Choosing an *Immunity* mandates that you must choose a *vulnerability* as well. I feel like this is balanced and can add some nice flavor using pre-existing game mechanics. My Forest Gnome could walk into a room filled with deadly toxic mushroom spores completely unharmed, but if they get hit with a dragon's fire breath they'll get roasted. Please let me know what you think of this house rule and if you think it needs any fine tuning. Feedback is greatly appreciated. :)"

This sword was originally the weapon of the MC of a book I'm writing. He is a Greek-inspired monster slayer who can see the spirits of others. Since I have a lot of time on my hands because of the plague, I thought it would be fun to try and recreate his weapon. If you are confused as to why the sword is named Remembrance, it is specific to my MC's character and his backstory, so you can name it whatever you want. Oh, and you can change the form of Remembrance to whatever melee weapon you want- the bastard sword (in 5e terms, longsword) was the original form of it. Now, time for the good stuff. **REMEMBRANCE** *Weapon (bastard sword), legendary (requires attunement by a creature with proficiency with bastard swords)* It is said that the weapon makes the hero. Every single hero has a weapon that they are known for. Leonidas and his spear; Thor and his hammer. Some like Drizzt Do'Urden, have multiple. Remembrance is one of those legendary weapons, created by a monster slayer to combat the ever growing tide of otherworldly creatures invading his reality. The blade is identical to a normal bastard sword, except it has black stains on it that resemble scorch marks and intricate runes running along the edges. It also exudes the slight smell of smoke when activated. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Whenever you are in combat with non-humanoids, that bonus increases to a +3. The attuned creature may also add their proficiency modifier to damage rolls made with this weapon. It also has the following properties. ***Ignite.*** You can use a bonus action to will the blade to ignite, activating it. Small flames start on the blade, originating from the now red-hot runes, growing as *Remembrance* remains active. These flames are harmless to the creature attuned to it. The flames shed light in a 10-ft radius and dim light out an additional 10-ft, gaining an additional 5-ft of light for every minute it is active. While *Remembrance* is activated, it deals an additional 1d10 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames will only end if it is commanded to do so by the attuned creature, if the attuned creature is unconscious, or if it is more than 30-ft away from the attuned creature. ***Engulf.*** Once activated, the wielder can access *Remembrance's* full power, accessible only by the attuned creature. Whenever you hit a creature with *Remembrance*, it gains 1 charge. If the hit was a critical hit, it gains 2 instead. Whenever you slay a creature with *Remembrance*, it gains 4 charges. At the end of each turn, *Remembrance* loses one charge if the wielder did not hit a creature that turn. As the number of charges increases, the wielder gains additional benefits and the color of the flames on *Remembrance* is indicated in parentheses. The wielder loses a benefit if they do not have the necessary number of charges or if they end their turn without Remembrance in their hands. * 2 charges (Red): Add an extra 1d10 fire damage to the damage of *Remembrance*. * 4 charges (Orange/Yellow): Your movement speed increases by ten feet. * 10 charges (Blue): You score critical hits on a 19-20 with *Remembrance*. * 20 charges (Purple): You comes under the effects of the *investiture of flame* spell (no concentration or spell slot required) for one minute as soon as you have 20 charges. This state can be accessed once every dawn. To recharge this ability, every dawn, roll a d10. On a 7 or higher, the ability comes back. On a 1, the ability stays inert for 1d10 days and recharges at the end of that time period. * Alt. 20 charges (White): You gain the ability to burn things that wouldnt normally burn. If a creature has normally immunity to any damage dealt by *Remembrance*, treat it as resistance. If a creature normally has resistance, ignore it. If it does not normally have resistance or immunity to damage *Remembrance* deals, it has vulnerability to that damage as long as they are within 10 feet of you. This ability is active as long as you have 20 or more charges. This is my first time seriously creating a magical weapon, so any feedback on balance is greatly appreciated."

Elemental ascension Once you reach 18th level you learn to enter the truest state of the elements. Once per long rest you can enter a state where you do not feel emotion you gain the elemental creature type and cannot expend any element points. Elemental techniques The elementalist follow a system of creating their own elemental techniques. To do this you choose one feature from each of the elemental controls categories then decide how many damage and range points you want to invest in your technique. When the technique refers to damage this damage is of the damage type associated with the elements which you are using to fuel the technique. To make this process simpler we are going to follow whiskey the kenku elementalist as he creates his signature technique the green dragons breath. First he chooses the cone from the shape category then he chooses to also take the condition add on and chooses the poisoned condition. Finally he decides he wants a 30 ft cone so he starts with his 10ft cone and adds 1 point per 10ft bringing him to 3 points. Then he chooses to have 3d6 damage, because 1d6 damage costs 1 point he adds 1 point per d6 past the first bringing him to 2 and a total of five. And the poisoned condition cost him 2 meaning he spent 6 points of the same element to conjure the green dragons breath. Shapes effects cone as an action for 1 point your technique can be in the shape of a cone that stretches out from you forwards and deals 1d6 if a creature fails your technique saving throw (dexterity). To add range each point is 10ft, to add damage each point is 1d6 past the first. cube as an action for one point you create a cube of your elements spanning 10ft on each side dealing 1d6 damage or half as much on a successful dexterity save against your technique save. To widen your cube by 10ft add one point, to add 1d6 damage add 1 point. cylinder as an action you create a tube of your element for two points that has a diameter of 10ft and a length of 15ft and deal 2d6 damage if a creature fails a dexterity saving throw against your technique saving throw dc. To add 10ft of range on either side spend 1 point, to add 1d6 damage add one point line as an action for one point you eject a line of your elements for 15ft dealing 1d6 damage if a creature fails a dexterity saving throw against your technique save dc or half as much on a successful one. To add 10ft of range add one point, to add 1d6 damage add on point. melee as an action for one point you attack a creature within 5ft of you. This attack deals 1d8 damage. To add 1d8 damage is one point per d8 past the first. sphere as an action for 1 point you create a sphere with a 10ft diameter. Any creature in this range must make a dexterity saving throw against your technique save dc or take 1d6 damage. To add 10ft to the diameter it costs on point to add 1d6 damage it costs 1 point past the first. effect details condition for 2 points you add a condition into your technique. This can be any condition from the back of the players handbook. To resist the condition they must make a constitution saving throw against your techniques save dc. They remake the saving throw every turn. freeze When you use this effect the creature must make a constitution saving throw against your technique save dc or have their speed reduced to 0ft for 1d4 rounds. remain When you use this effect you begin by rolling a d4. This is your point cost. This roll is also the amount of tuns that your technique remains active. This requires concentration. link when you do this effect for 1 point you may choose a second shape for the technique. For every link the point cost goes up(1:1 2:2 3:3..). Preparing elemental techniques You can prepare a number of elemental techniques equal to either your strength or dexterity modifier (whichever is higher(minimum of one)) plus your elementalist level. Learning elemental techniques You learn a number of elemental techniques equal to your elementalist level doubled. Elemental technique bonus Technique save dc: your proficiency bonus + 8 + dexterity modifier or strength modifier(whichever is higher) Technique attack bonus: your proficiency bonus + dexterity modifier or strength modifier (whichever is higher) NOTES The class table refused to work so the only important thing of note is that the primary element has points equal to 3 times your elementalist level. And your second has points equal to 2 times your elementalist level."

Looking for something that is outside of the current design space for Warlocks. C&amp;C welcome. Is it balanced? **Pact of the Spinner** Your patron connects you to the flow of life and fate allowing you to glimpse aspects of its influence on the world around you and intervene in minor ways. Your brief glimpses enable you to, as a reaction, aid one willing creature you can see within 30 feet of you granting the creature advantage on a saving throw. If this feature is used on a death saving throw the result is an automatic success. You may use this feature a number of times equal to half your Charisma modifier, rounded up (minimum 1), regaining all uses at the end of a short or long rest. **Invocation: Spinner's Shield** *Prerequisite: Pact of the Spinner feature* You can cast shield of faith at will, without expending a spell slot or requiring components. **Invocation: Stutter** *Prerequisite: Pact of the Spinner feature* Your connection to flow of fate enables you to interrupt a creature's fate or future. As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, disrupting the creature's fate until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage, and then your influence on its fate ends. **Invocation: Beguiling Fate** *Prerequisite: Pact of the Spinner feature* You can cast blur once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. **Invocation: Fate's Blessing** *Prerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Spinner feature* Your ability to see Fate's path has granted you inexplicable luck that seems to kick in at just the right moment. When a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force that creature to reroll. The creature must use the new roll . Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you roll initiative at the start of combat or until you finish a short or long rest. **Invocation: Fate's Custodian** *Prerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Spinner feature* You gain the ability to impede death's progress. As a reaction when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can turn that hit into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest."

22,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,"Divine Claw Conclave, an oath bound hunter and assassin (BETA)",1,ex8gtu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/ex8gtu/divine_claw_conclave_an_oath_bound_hunter_and/,2020-02-02 03:23:10,"[URL **Overview and Roleplaying Theme** The Divine Claw Ranger combines the divine magic and spell casting of a Paladin with the stealthier, survivalist tool set of the Ranger-base class to create a unique role playing opportunity for players. While Paladins tend to be extroverted forces that inspires fear, awe or respect from the world around them. Divine Claws tend to be introverted forces that are driven solely by personal honor, service and duty to the world around them. **Mechanical Role and Identity** Mechanically, the Divine Claw Ranger has strong supportive spells from the Paladin spell list and excellent exploration skills from the Ranger base class. In battle, the Divine Claw Ranger is a sturdy and versatile combatant with an affinity for the single target striker/assassin role that is made all the deadlier while tracking a Favored Enemy on Favored Terrain before the first initiative roll. To perform its role as a striker/assassin, the Divine Claw Ranger relies on the resource intensive consumption of spell slots and limited class resources to go super nova on unwary targets. This is in contrast to other striker/assassin archetypes like assassin rouges or gloom stalkers which tend to rely on re-triggerable or inexpensive means of burst damage through things like Assassinate or Hunter's Mark + Dread Ambusher. **Balance and Multi-Classing** This has been through a basic play test at level three with a party comprised of a Divine Soul Sorcadin, a Storm Cleric, a Samurai Fighter, a Arch-Fey Warlock and a arcane trickster with the occasional tweak and tuning made here and there. Anything else beyond that is the wild west at the moment with the philosophy of getting the role-playing and mechanical foundations on solid ground first and tuning exact numbers later. With that said, time to discus potential multi-classing. Based on my internal theory crafting, ranged or dexterity based melee divine claws have a natural affinity for a three point dip in assassin rouge for cheaper and more re-triggerable bursts of damage. Strength based Divine Claws on the other hand seem to have a affinity for the Cleric Subclass, the guidance cantrip improves stealth and tracking skills, compensating for some of a Strength Ranger's MADness and with a 3rd level investment into cleric, the ranger can get access to 6th spell spell slot. The Grave Domain gets a special note here as Vulnerability + Hunter's Vendetta + Double Smite + Eagle's Courage has the potential to set up devastating nova damage in the legendary tier of play (Level 15-20) of adventure if your party cooperates and you have the round needed to set it up. Other potentially good multi-classes include the Druid if your heavy on paladin spells for the same as the cleric plus plus the ability to ambush targets using wild shape or if your feeling crazy and a little lucky, Divination Wizard for dice master shenanigans that mesh well with many of your subclass abilities. With that said, thank you for bearing with me and feel free to take inspiration."

School: Divination Level: 8 Casting Time: One Action Components: V,S,M\*. Duration: One Hour. Range: Thirty Feet Class: Wizard For the duration, you have proficiency in the insight skill and you double your proficiency bonus for any check using it. As an action while the spell lasts you can extend your gaze into a target's soul provided it is within range and you can see it. For the purposes of this spell, you can see through magical and non-magical darkness. This ability to see through darkness does not apply to anything outside of this spell's activation requirements. When you do so you must make a Wisdom(Insight) check contested by the target's Charisma(Deception) check. If you win the contest a number of events occur: First, You learn a total of three things about the creature. These three things can include: a stat/check/saving throw value, a damage resistance, immunity, or vulnerability, a condition immunity, class levels, alignment, or whether it has legendary resistances/action. Second, you may ask the DM three questions about the creatures past. The DM answers in a cryptic but honest and detailed fashion as you gaze upon on the marks left on the creature's soul by its past. Lastly, you may end the spell when you do this to show the creature the darkest recesses of your soul. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, it takes 10D12 psychic damage and is stunned until the end of your next turn. On a success it takes half damage and is not stunned. \*special eye paints worth three thousand gold which the spell consumes. Once a creature succeeds on its saving throw against this spell it cannot be subjected to it for twenty-four hours."

How would you value a resistance versus a vulnerability in a PVE setting which includes homebrew? As in: You pay points to get resistance vs cold and you get points if you take a vulnerability to fire. Are the points a) the same amount or b) one is higher - which and in which scale. If you want to explain your reasoning, even better. (You cannot buy resi and vuln to the same type.)"

It is somewhat lighter to heft than its size would suggest, but when swung it quickly develops a terrifying momentum and emits a deep, menacing thrum. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. You can use an action on your turn to activate the runes on Breach's face, which glow a bright, misty green until the end of your next turn. While the runes are active, you can use an action to make a special melee weapon attack with Breach against a door, wall, or other tangible, stationary obstruction. If the attack hits, it is a critical hit and the target has vulnerability to all damage from it. If the target is held shut by mundane locks or is stuck or barred, it becomes magically unlocked, unstuck, and unbarred.

So, I figured taking a sorcerer and just ""retexturing"" one of the origins to have that spider *feel*. I basically just took the Draconic Bloodline and replaced ""dragon"" with ""spider"" but it didn't feel right so over the next week I wrote down some ideas. This is the draft I was going to send to the DM to look over but I thought I'd run it by some veteran players before then. So, here it is. Give me your thoughts, especially on balance. (I yoinked the Eyes of the Dark and Shadow Walk from the Shadow sorcerer origin, because I felt like they fit the spider/assassin thing I was going for. If that's not allowed on the sub let me know.) &amp;#x200B; **Araneid Blood** Living in the shadows. Living in the hunt. Your magic comes from the blood of the Shadow Spider Queen. However you were exposed to it, by bite or by birth, you have been transformed by it. The lineage of an Araneid can be strange to behold. Some are beautiful, some have a ghastly pallor. Almost like everyone else, but something is off. You may choose or roll for a trait from the list below. Arachnid Sorcerer Traits d6 Trait 1 You can only eat liquid food. 2 Your blood is thin and pale blue, and when cut you bleed very little. 3 You have additional eyes. 4 You sometimes salivate when looking at other people. 5 You have two thick, black, razor sharp fangs. 6 You do not blink (nor do you need to). **Eyes in the Dark** From 1st level, you have blindsense with a range of 10 feet and darkvision with a range of 60 feet. When you reach 3rd level in this class, you learn the Darkness spell, which doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. In addition, you can cast it by spending 2 sorcery points or by expending a spell slot. If you cast it with sorcery points, you can see through the darkness created by the spell. **Spider Climb** Starting at 1st level, your arachnid heritage gives you incredible physical ability. You can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. **Hunters Venom** At 6th level, you gain the ability to mark enemies with your venom. As a bonus action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to envenom a creature you can sense within 120 feet of you. It as now your quarry. For the next hour, you deal an extra 1d6 poison damage to the target whenever you deal damage to it, and you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find it. If the target drops to 0 hit points before this effect ends, you heal 1d6 health. **Spiders Silk** Also at 6th level, you learn the Giant Spiders: ***Web Walker.*** Ignore movement restrictions caused by webbing. ***Web (Recharge 5-6).*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* range 30/60, one target. The target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage). **Shadow Walk** At 14th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. **Relentless Toxins** Also at 14th level, you may change any magical damage you deal to poison damage instead. Any creature with poison immunity is treated as having poison resistance instead; any creature with poison resistance is treated as not having it. **Terantular Form** Starting at 18th level, you can spend 6 sorcery points as an action to use the druid ability *Wild Shape* to transform yourself into a Giant Spider. In this form, you have resistance to all non-magical attacks (that arent adamantine). Otherwise, this acts exactly like the druids *Wild Shape* ability at level 18 (including *Beast Casting* and 2 uses per rest)."

Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object's damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the object's hit points. Threshold: 20 Damage **-------------** &amp;#x200B; **Beatdrop** Once every two rounds, at initiative step 20, the Discoball of Death initiates a Beatdrop, which triggers a random effect, determined through the roll of a d10.Once initiated, an effect lasts for two turns, until the end of initiative step 20, and depending on the effect, may change the targeted location or creature(s) If a 10 is rolled, roll two more d10s, using the subsequent effects and ignoring any further 10s rolled. Additionally, each time a Beatdrop is commenced, a Flying Sword is summoned at a point within 30 feet of the Disco Ball of Death &amp;#x200B; **1: Walls of Fire** Walls of Fire burn to life in the room, going from the floor to ceiling. Roll 2d8, and number each direction from the orb in a clockwise manner, this determines from which directions the walls of fire spew. A creature which begins its turn in the wall or goes through a square occupied by the wall takes 4d8 fire damage. (This one can optionally be set up by the GM intentionally, depending on how much work you want to do, it is possible to line up a set of walls of fire with predetermined paths and activate these instead if a GM is so inclined) **2: Dancing Lights** 4 Dancing Lights are summoned at 4 separate points within 30 feet of the Disco Ball of Death. These lights begin floating towards the creature nearest to them with a movement speed of 10 feet. When they reach a creature, they deal 4d6 radiant damage with no save. These fires will stay around even after the Beatdrop ends. **3: Fountain Wave** The Fountain at the center of the room (where the Disco Ball should be) suddenly overflows in a violent wave and crash of water. All creatures within 30 feet of the fountain must make a DC 16 dexterity save, or take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked back to the edge of the waves radius. Once they reach that point, they are knocked prone. On a successful save, the damage is halved, and are not moved or knocked prone. (This requires a fountain as part of the setup, but it pays off, trust me) **4-5: Light Beams** Light Beams of various colors emit from the orb in random directions. Roll 1d8 and number each direction from the orb in a clockwise manner. The number rolled and each number above it are the directions in which the beams appear, these beams continue until they hit something, forcing creatures which are in the path to make a DC 18 dexterity save, dealing 4d6 radiant damage on a failed to save, and no damage on a successful saving throw. &amp;#x200B; **6-7: Electric Tiles** The tiles on the floor light up, flashing and bursting with various colours at random intervals. Depending on the rolls two d6s two of the areas predetermined by the DM will light up with electric shock, all creatures touching the tiles must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. The effects deals 4d6 lightning damage or half as much on successful save. (This one requires to set up by the GM, I recommend creating a grid of 6 (or more) sections of your battle map where the tiles can be lit up) **8-9: Sound Burst** As the beat drops, the speaker creates a wave of sound perfectly in tune with the beat. All creatures within 30 feet of a speaker must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, on a failed saving throw they take 4d6 thunder damage and are knocked back 10 feet, or half as much damage and no knockback on a successful one. **---------------** &amp;#x200B; Hope you guys enjoyed this, have a good one y'all"
28,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,"Landshark, my interpretation of the Bulette",1,dousa1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/dousa1/landshark_my_interpretation_of_the_bulette/,2019-10-30 06:26:17,"[GM Binder Link: The Landshark](URL This is me trying to find how I like to design monsters, specifically monsters that are not minions. Any creature that deserves the spotlight should follow these ideals. Here's my thought process: * Stat block should flow. Ability A sets up Ability B. * Streamline stat block as much as possible. Remove things like CR and languages, those are either distractions, or things that only the DM needs to know. * My stats describe a single creature, so frequently have fixed HP and other modified stats. * Monsters should always be acting. This means actions, bonus actions, and reactions for all monsters. * Monsters are designed for tactical play using minis and terrain. Interesting movement, abilities to change the environment, and abilities that manipulate the movement of players are strongly encouraged. * To compensate for these additional strengths, players must have opportunities to learn about the monster before and during combat. * All monsters must have weaknesses. No exceptions. * Weaknesses should be tailored to each creature. * Dungeon Master must be explicit about the monster's abilities and how it reacts. * Players must understand what actions are effective and be able to form plans around these weaknesses. So with that in mind, lets look at my take on the Bulette, the Landshark, a roaving beast that has been terrorizing the North Road. * She has tough armor! This isn't represented by resistance to physical damage, but instead by a high AC and higher-then-average hit points. * Her armor however can be cracked! Critical hits OR bludgeoning damage (must take 10 or more) will deal extra damage and reduce AC as the hit splinters some of it's natural armor. * While players dealing bludgeoning damage get to feel good about smashing down it's armor, anyone who gets a crit also gets to share in the fun, not just melee fighters. * Lower AC feels good because players get to hit more, but doesn't totally change the math of the encounter like vulnerability does. * It also doesn't create any floating modifiers for the PCs, which is great. * She has a lot of things that she can do, but they all feed into her loop: knock prone, bite, drag away. * Earth Furrow is her sprinting, while setting herself up for success on future rounds by knocking prone. * Churning Dive is her evading, while setting herself up for success on future rounds by knocking prone. * Bite is her signature move.

Any creature that deserves the spotlight should follow these ideals. Here's my thought process: * Stat block should flow. Ability A sets up Ability B. * Streamline stat block as much as possible. Remove things like CR and languages, those are either distractions, or things that only the DM needs to know. * My stats describe a single creature, so frequently have fixed HP and other modified stats. * Monsters should always be acting. This means actions, bonus actions, and reactions for all monsters. * Monsters are designed for tactical play using minis and terrain. Interesting movement, abilities to change the environment, and abilities that manipulate the movement of players are strongly encouraged. * Big inspiration from 4e in this regard. * To compensate for these additional strengths, players must have opportunities to learn about the monster before and during combat. * All monsters must have weaknesses. No exceptions. * Weaknesses should be tailored to each creature. * Dungeon Master must be explicit about the monster's abilities and how it reacts. * Players must understand what actions are effective and be able to form plans around these weaknesses. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ So with that in mind, lets look at my take on the Bulette, the Landshark, a roving beast that has been terrorizing the North Road. &amp;#x200B; * She has tough armor! This isn't represented by resistance to physical damage, but instead by a high AC and higher-then-average hit points. * Her armor however can be cracked! Critical hits OR bludgeoning damage (must take 10 or more) will deal extra damage and reduce AC as the hit splinters some of it's natural armor. * While players dealing bludgeoning damage get to feel good about smashing down it's armor, anyone who gets a crit also gets to share in the fun, not just melee fighters. * Lower AC feels good because players get to hit more, but doesn't totally change the math of the encounter like vulnerability does. * It also doesn't create any floating modifiers for the PCs, which is great. * She has a lot of things that she can do, but they all feed into her loop: knock prone, bite, drag away. * Earth Furrow is her sprinting, while setting herself up for success on future rounds by knocking prone. * Churning Dive is her evading, while setting herself up for success on future rounds by knocking prone. * Bite is her signature move. Automatically grapples a prone target. She then tries to burrow off with them. * It says something about injury, don't worry about that, that's just for me. * Struggle is the creature using it's huge bulk to it's advantage.

30,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Homebrew Race: Seimvolk (Slime People) -- Need Balancing Feedback!,11,d1lzbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/d1lzbm/homebrew_race_seimvolk_slime_people_need/,2019-09-09 14:21:48,"Hello! I am fairly new to DnD -- been wanting to play it for a long time, finally joined a weekly campaign some months ago -- and I made a homebrew race with the help of some experienced DnD friends, and have been playing as an individual of this race for the aforementioned weekly campaign. The race is named ""Seimvolk,"" and is essentially a race of slime people. The DnDBeyond page for the race can be found [here](URL the page describes all the properties and information in prose, but does not supply the numerical and objective information for some reason, although I input that information into the website when making the race. As such, I'll be describing the race's more objective information here, since I am looking for balancing feedback in particular (but all feedback is welcome!). &amp;#x200B; \----- &amp;#x200B; **Origin** Seimvolk come into being when an Ooze obtains enough ""soul energy"" from consumed victims -- or a being with a strong ""soul"" -- and after a process over the course of months, the Ooze gains its own sentience, becoming an individual distinct from the ""absorbee(s)."" (In other words, even if the ""absorbee"" is a legendary Paladin, the resulting Seimvolk may not necessarily be a Paladin, although it might make more sense lore-wise) The Seimvolk does not readily know any information from any absorbee(s), but to account for the plausibility of making History checks, any memories absorbee(s) may have could faintly be recovered, at the DM's discretion. When a Seimvolk gains sentience, they already have some sense of identity -- they give themselves a name, etc -- and though they are amorphous, they tend to keep a humanoid shape as their ""default"" appearance. They know Common as well as Primordial, as they are a ""fringe"" type of elemental, of sorts. The nature of the origin of Seimvolk can lend to direct ties into a DM's story, if a player playing one allows the DM to make certain decisions about how the Seimvolk gained sentience. For example, an important character who went missing prior to the campaign's beginning may have ended up being a player character's ""absorbee."" &amp;#x200B; **Ability Scores &amp; Vulnerability/Resistances** The Ability Score impacts are based on the stats of Oozes; +2 STR, -1 DEX, +2 CON, -2 INT -- but my DM is suggesting perhaps a nerf to the CON, seeing as how my Barbarian Seimvolk has 93 HP with 15 AC at Level 8, and has never really had the threat of death yet. One of my friends who helped me create this race disagrees with this notion, being a DM himself. Furthermore, because they lack specific vitals to be pierced or slashed through, Seimvolk have resistance to piercing and slashing damage -- ""damage"" on a Seimvolk can be visualized by losing slime mass, we've been thinking. That said, freezing to death is a huge plausibility for Seimvolk -- they have a vulnerability to cold damage. &amp;#x200B; **Racial Traits** *Slimy Physique*: Counts as one size smaller for the purpose of fitting in places; Advantage on Grappling Saving Throws (getting out of a grapple); Immune to the Prone status condition (as a Seimvolk can change shape easily according to whatever direction is ""upwards"" without difficulty -- one does not simply fall over prone). *Slimy Stretch:* Can make melee attack attempts at double melee range, but at the cost of making the roll to attack with disadvantage. (But attacks within normal melee range is not disadvantageous) For the purpose of Attacks of Opportunity, which can be attempted whenever an opponent leaves melee range willingly, the attempt can be made either at normal melee range or the doubled melee range, but the latter is disadvantaged. *Phagocytosis:* Advantage on Grappling. &amp;#x200B; **Subraces** When I was first making the race on DnDBeyond, my understanding of subraces was slightly incorrect, so the logic for the subraces may be slightly incorrect. That said, at the moment there are two subraces; the ""normal"" Seimvolk (based on normal Gelatinous Cubes/Oozes) and the Swamp Seimvolk (based on Gray Oozes). The regular Seimvolk matches all the above information, whereas the Swamp Seimvolk has the following additional attributes: * \-1 CHA * Immune to Poison damage, the Poisoned status, and disease * Additional Vulnerabilities to Fire and Radiant damage * *Noxious Physiology:* Because melee weaponry is coated in own poisonous matter, on (own) successful physical attacks, target makes a Constitution saving throw (beat 10+Your STR modifier). On failure, target takes 1d6 additional poison damage. If the target rolls a critical failure, they are Poisoned for 1 minute. A planned but unfinished subrace is a Cave Seimvolk, based on Ochre Jellies, which broadly trades bulk for dexterity, and gains the Ochre Jelly's Spider Climb trait. &amp;#x200B; **Thoughts and Concerns** So, the Seimvolk I have been playing in my weekly campaign is a Barbarian, specifically because I felt the Unarmored Defense feat was fitting; it didn't make a ton of sense to me for Seimvolk to wear armor, given they don't have vitals to protect -- though I suppose they can't *not* wear armor, if one chooses to. On that note, I have always been thinking of giving them a racial trait of a similar vein to a race-wide ""Unarmored Defense."" Speaking of Barbarian, though, that brings me to my biggest concern; I'm currently afraid that the ""meta"" pick is so strongly Barbarians of the Path of the Storm Herald subclass. My Seimvolk character happens to be this subclass, and starting at Level 6, if the Tundra aura is chosen, the Barbarian gains a passive, resistance to Cold damage. With this passive choice, the bulky Seimvolk cancels out their single counter, Cold damage, with minimal effort or trade-off. Even if the Seimvolk's racial resistances of Piercing and Slashing causes two of the three resistances granted by Rage to be redundant, this makes me uncomfortable if my homebrew race has one very specific ""meta"" build that is so much more objectively better than any other class option. As such, I was thinking of somehow adding a racial trait similar to ""Unarmored Defense"" that could perhaps override other AC factors, such that it acts as a nerf to the overly-bulky Barbarian builds if necessary, while also potentially providing otherwise-squishier class options with a slight buff, such that a Seimvolk build of most classes (that are not INT dependent, of course) could be fairly-equally viable. Before making any such decision, however, I'm very much seeking feedback on this matter of the Seimvolk race's stats. &amp;#x200B; \----- &amp;#x200B; Thank you for taking the time to read through this! I have become pretty attached to this homebrew race, and I would love to hear any and all positive and negative feedback you may have on this."

Hearing the groans of zombies in the next room, a halfling moves past his companions in the shape of an undead cat. Scythe in hand, a half-orc cries out against the god of fertility and blights the hill giant bearing down on her. Most druids fight against the corruption, but you fight so hard it consumes you. Circle of Plague druids embody entropy and decay, seeking to expedite the natural end of life. These druids are dangerous mages that at their best are grim heroes that kill the living corruption in nature, and at worst at harbingers of barren lands. Subclass made by u/ibrokemynailgun | Druid Level | Circle of Plagues Features | |:----:|:-------------| | 3rd | Circle Spells, Undead Shapes | | 6th | Devour Life | | 10th | Inverted Substance | | 14th | Plague Bearer | ### Circle Spells Your inversion of natures magic infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

You determine whether you are zombified or skeletal. While using your undead shape, your type is undead. Undead creatures with an Intelligence of 6 or lower are not hostile towards you unless you move with 10 feet of them. If you are already in combat or engage in combat with these creatures, this effect ends. ### Devour Life Starting at 6th level, when you kill one or more creatures with a druid spell, you regain one druid spell slot. The spell slot must be one level lower than what you had cast and can't be higher than a 5th level spell slot. ### Inverted Substance At 10th level you no longer require food or water to survive, and you are immune to poison and disease. ### Plague Bearer At 14th level you become the bearer of horrible diseases. When a creature with 30 feet hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to afflict it with a plague. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or become afflicted by a random disease for 1 minute, determined by the Plague Bearer Table below. Creatures afflicted this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn. Creatures immune to disease success on this save automatically. ##### Plague Bearer Table | 1d4 | Plague | |:----:|:-------------| | 1 | **Blinding Sickness:** Pain grips the creature's mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded. | | 2 | **Filth Fever:** A raging fever sweeps through the creature's body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength. | | 3 | **Flesh Rot:** The creature's flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage. | | 4 | **Seizure:** The creature is overcome with shaking.

A large roller will increase its size to huge when it reaches 91 hit points. A huge roller will divide into 3-6 medium rollers when it reaches 160 hit points. About The abominable roller is a fleshy ball that is covered with legs and eyes of many creatures. These legs stick out at evenly spaced intervals from the entire surface of its outside. Between these legs are found a myriad of eyes. It can move in any direction without turning around. It travels in a rolling motion and seeks out prey to increase its size. They are not particularly stealthy but make no vocalizations. Any creature it comes into contact with is attacked with its flurry of feet. *Mysterious Origin.* No one knows where the abominable roller came from. Some have theorized it was a magical experiment gone wrong. Others assume some other plane of existence. *Bizarre Biology.* The abominable roller seems to live for one purpose, to engulf enough creatures to increase its size to the point it can divide into 3-6 smaller ones (a huge roller divides into medium rollers). Fortunately, they cant climb trees, are stymied by walls and dont dig. Most creatures instinctively run away or hide. Without creatures to sustain it, an abominable roller will starve to death in a few days."

I welcome any and all feedback! &gt;Bollix Self &gt;Cantrip; 1 bonus action; Self; VS; 1 minute &gt;You throw your essence into chaos, enhancing certain abilities and forgetting others. Roll a d6. The ability score designated by that roll falls to a 5. Roll a second d6. The ability score designated by that roll rises to 30. This spell cannot be ended early without the use of a Remove Curse or Lesser Restoration spell. ' &gt;Speeding Vision &gt;1st level; 1 action; touch; VSM, a small fake eye made of wood, glass, or stone; 1 hour &gt;You touch a creature and enhance their instincts and vision. The target gains advantage on perception and investigation checks relying on sight, and advantage on initiative rolls ' &gt;Orb of Force &gt;2nd level; 1 action; 60 ft; VSM a small jewel worth 50gp; Instantaneous &gt;You conjure an orb of contained kinetic energy that explodes in all directions. Each creature within a 15 foot radius must make a Con saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the center. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed. In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spells effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet. &gt;When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd. ' &gt;Transposition &gt;2nd level; 1 action; 60 feet; VS; Instantaneous &gt;You cloak your form in tendrils of the chaotic element and teleport up to 30ft to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places. An unwilling creature makes a Cha saving throw. Upon a fail, the swap happens, on a save, you teleport into that creature's spot. You take 1d6 force damage and are forced into to the nearest unoccupied space. &gt;When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the range increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to move the duplicate up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you. As an action, you can swap places with your duplicate. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target. A creature can spend an action to make an insight check against your spell save DC to ascertain the illusory nature of the duplicate. A creature makes this check with advantage if it cant see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight. A creature automatically succeeds on this check if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight. ' &gt;Elemental Sword &gt;3rd level; 1 bonus action; Self; VS; Concentration, up to 1 min &gt;You draw energy from the planes of elemental chaos to form a shimmering sword in your hand. This magic sword lasts until the spell ends and it counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. It deals 2d8+1d6 damage on a hit. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on the die determines the attacks damage type, as shown below. &gt;1 Acid &gt;2 Cold &gt;3 Fire &gt;4 Force &gt;5 Lightning &gt;6 Poison &gt;7 Psychic &gt;8 Thunder &gt;If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again. A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4nd level or higher, each target takes 1d6 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 3st. ' &gt;Mind Splinter &gt;3rd level; 1 action; 30ft cone; VSM a rough, uncut gem; Instantaneous &gt;A wave of reverberating energy invades the minds of targets in range. Each creature within a 30ft cone makes an Int saving throw. One a failed save, a target takes 4d8 damage and is stunned for one round. On a successful save, a target takes half damage and is not stunned. &gt;When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd. ' &gt;Swirling Cloud &gt;4th level; 1 action; 150ft; VSM a fluff of cotton; Concentration up to 1 min &gt;A 20-foot-radius sphere of swirling gas of shifting color springs into existence centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spells duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Con saving throw or take 2d6 poison damage and reduces their speed by half. On a save, the target takes half damage and retains full movement speed. You can use a bonus action to deal this effect to a target. For each target, choose one of the d6s. The number rolled on that die determines an additional effect, as shown below. &gt;1 A psychic shock grips the target's mind and forces it to stagger in a random direction. It takes 2d8 psychic damage and moves 10 feet in a random direction. &gt;2 A static spark ignites part of the gas. The target takes 3d6 fire damage. &gt;3 A flash of light dazes the target, forcing them to drop what they're holding. &gt;4 Shapes in the gas creates illusion of hostile creatures. The target approaches a random creature within 10 feet and makes a melee attack against them. &gt;5 The gas begins to decay the target's flesh. The target has vulnerability to all damage for 1 round. &gt;6 The gas begins to burn the eyes and lungs of the target, putting them off balance. The target takes 2d8 acid damage and a -2 penalty to AC. The target can't take reactions. &gt;At Higher Levels.

39,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Arachnomancer Warlock,10,cxlfp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/cxlfp4/arachnomancer_warlock/,2019-08-31 05:11:07," Rough Draft! Semi-based on the 3.5 class (but probably not faithful to it, since I don't have those class materials, and on Mike Mearl's [Lolth Warlock Pact](URL I like the idea of spider magic, is all. This homebrew subclass features an expanded spell list that allows your arachnomancer to communicate with and emulate the natural abilities of spiders, with especial emphasis on their web-spinning abilities. Thoughts/criticisms are appreciated! # Arachnomancer Warlock Arachnomancers are largely, but not exclusively, devout followers of Lolth who use their powers to advance her aims. In the gloom of the Underdark, many may also seek to make a pact with the Dark Queen or some ancient spider simply to better stalk their prey and carve out a living by making goods with their silk. Combative arachnomancers rely on their spidery characteristics, powerful webs, and their ability to summon spiders to subdue enemies and defend their web-spun homes. Their ability to speak to spiders means that its likely theyll have a number of them strategically placed as spies and scouts. Drow elves, half-elves, and Driders make for powerful arachnomancers, but its not unheard of for the odd Ettercap to exhibit these powers as well. **Expanded Spells (listed by Spell Slot):** 1. Animal Friendship (*spiders only*), Jump 2. Rope Trick, Web 3. *Spiders Only*: Conjure Animals, Phantom Steed 4. *Spiders Only*: Giant Insect, Polymorph 5. Awaken (*spiders only*), Cloudkill **Magic of the Underdark** At 1st level, you learn the Dancing Light cantrip, which counts as a Warlock spell for you and doesn't count against the number of spells you know. Additionally, you can speak to spiders, which can communicate simple ideas in response and be persuaded to obey simple commands. **Spider Shape** Starting at 1st level, you can use a bonus action to transform yourself into a Medium-sized spider (see the Giant Wolf Spider's characteristics) for a number of hours equal to half your level in this class rounded down (1 hour minimum). Your equipment and any items you carry are not transformed with you (not including your clothes). If you are killed in this form, your body will remain a spider. You can use another bonus action on your turn to change back. While in your spider form: * You retain all your skill proficiencies and ability scores. You can use any racial features that are physically compatible with your spider shape; however, you lack hands and cant manipulate anything that would normally require them, including tools, weapons, and magic items. * Your AC becomes 13 + your Dexterity modifier (this bonus does not stack with armor, shields, or other abilities that increase your AC). * You gain the spiders senses, movement speed, attacks, and other characteristics, assuming that you do not already possess them in your humanoid form. * You can speak any language you know from your race and background. * You can cast spells in this form without material components, but only those that you know from the expanded spells list provided for this class, including the Dancing Lights cantrip. Once you use this feature, you cant use it again until you finish a short or long rest. **Spidercraft** Starting at 6th level, you can now produce silk from your spinnerets while in your spider shape. You can spend time crafting one of the following items from your silk: * **1 action**: A single thread of silk up to 40 feet long. The thread can bear your weight, but will break after 1 minute, if a non-spider creature tries to climb it, or if it takes any damage. Using your movement, you can attach one end of the thread to a surface like a ledge or ceiling and move or descend up to its maximum length. You can detach yourself from the thread as a free action. * **1 minute**: A 10x10 square-foot spider web between two supporting structures. This web is only strong enough to catch mundane insects. You can spend 10 minutes to weave a short message of two words into it and 1 additional minute to alter the written message. * **1 hour**: 30 feet of silk rope; 1 net; or a 10x5-foot sheet of unadorned silk suitable for a blanket, shroud, hammock, cloak, or similar. These items require at least one supporting surface to hang the webbing from during their construction. At your DMs discretion, you may craft other things with your silk, provided you have the time and requisite materials to do so. All your silk creations are vulnerable to Fire damage. **Dark Queens Enforcer** Starting at 10th level, your spider shape becomes size Large, and you can now take on the senses, movement speed, attacks, and other characteristics of a Giant Spider (see Giant Spider stats). Additionally, your venom becomes even more potent: Creatures that are normally resistant to Poison damage take the full amount of damage dealt whenever you inflict Poison-type damage, and you can add your Charisma modifier to any Poison-type damage you deal. **Dark Queen's Protection** At 14th level, you gain immunity to poison damage and resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage while in your spider shape. Any attacks made in your spider shape are considered magical for the purposes of calculating resistance. # Arachnomancer Invocations: **Eldritch Snare** (Prerequisites: Ability to cast Eldritch Blast) You can cast Eldritch Blast in your spider shape. When you do, you forgo the spells damage and effects to instead shoot a blob of webbing at a creature in range. On a hit, if it is Medium-sized or smaller, the target is Restrained by webbing until the end of your next turn. As an action, the Restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; HP 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage). **Doom Weaving** (Prerequisites: 3rd level or higher) When another creature touches a web you're in contact with, you can use your reaction to send a pulse of venom-green magic through the web. Any other creature in contact with the web must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take d8 Poison damage  your spell slot level and can't use reactions for 1 round. On a success, it takes half as much damage and can use reactions. **Enduring Web** (Prerequisites: 5th level or higher) You can cast Web once per long rest without using a spell slot or material components. When you cast Web this way, you can can make the duration of the spell permanent and it no longer requires concentration to maintain. All the spell's other mechanics still apply. **Subtle Weaving** (prerequisite: 7th Level or higher) When you cast Web using a spell slot, you can use a bonus action on your turn to pluck a thread on the web, which then turns invisible. The web remains invisible until it takes damage or a creature caught in it succeeds on a saving throw to escape. As long as the web is invisible, you will also become invisible when you are in physical contact with it, until you make an attack or cast a spell. Once you use this feature, you cant use it again until you finish a long rest. **Web Stride** (prerequisite: 9th Level or higher) You gain the ability to enter a web youve created and move from inside it to inside another another web you created within 500 feet. Both webs must be in tact and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a web. You instantly know the location of all other spider webs within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the web, can either pass into one of those webs or step out of the web youre in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination web, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the web you entered. You must end each turn outside a web. You can use this transportation ability once per short or long rest."
40,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Long term transformation system.,3,cyfo41,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/cyfo41/long_term_transformation_system/,2019-09-02 07:14:21,"Hi all! This is my first foray into a new system design, and would love your thoughts and critiques. \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ This is a system that manages long term player character transformation from one state to another - physically, mentally, magically, or a combination of all three. The idea and goal behind it is simple - help a player manage transformation over a period of time, with mechanical and role play implications. The system is designed to be flavour free - you can essentially skin this Tabaxi any way you need, for any kind of transformation. **TL;DR (Executive Summary)** This is a deck based system for a player to draw random cards from during a session, which will have either temporary or permanent effects on the player's character. As their transformation grows in momentum, the GM shuffles more serious cards into the deck, representing the transformation approaching to its climactic **point of no return**. The player can manage their transformation over time by either leaning into the changes, known as **acclimatising**, or **resisting** the changes. When a player chooses to **acclimatise**, you increase your transformation tracker, and the reverse is true of they **resist**. **Acclimatising** more often will speed up the arrival of the **point of no return,** where the transformation is consider complete and permanent. **Resisting** will either keep the player in a state of change, or at the GM's discretion, **prevent the transformation entirely**. Lastly, and most importantly, it's designed to be fun for both the player and GM to use. We are all here to have a good time, not add hours of complexity. Once you have set up your **deck** and **rules of** **engagement** (more on that later), all you need to do is have it on hand for play. **Use Case Examples** *Kerria is a Half-Eladrin Ranger, with no idea they are anything but human. As they have adventured with their friends across the world, Kerria has been exposed to fey magic, which has slowly but surely awoken their Fey blood. Now, Kerria is beginning to experience strange mental states and physical changes, as their Eladrin blood goes to war with their human nature - which side will win? Will Kerria lean into their ancestry, and become a full Eladrin? Or will Kerria reject their nature, and attempt to remain as human as possible?* *Hanlon is a Aasimar Warlock, serving the Great Silver Kraken of the Northern Reach, Vizareshi the Monstrous. The more she exposes herself to the embrace and power of this master, Hanlon has slowly noticed that her skin has taken on a pale blue hue, her hair a faint, dark green tint. After a month, gills tear open on her neck in the night. Throwing herself headfirst into this new power, after six months, Hanlon is barely recognisable as an Aasimar, closer to a Triton or Sea Elf perhaps?* *Should Ignis have opened the jar with the ancient warning written in Modron? No. Did they? Well, duh, any Artificer with a pair of cogs would have. Turning into a Construct slowly from the arm down is a fascinating experiment anyway! I wonder what will happen when it reaches the heart? Or the brain?* *The stoic Firbolg druid Roki has long meditated on his spirit animal, as does his whole tribe. Now, it is time to complete his ritual, and take on the first characteristics of the great Owl Bear* and so it goes on. **The System** You need three things for this subsystem - the **rules of engagement,** the **deck,** and your preferred method of **tracking a score**. The former is the groundwork you need to complete before you build your deck. The deck itself is the in game tool youll be using to advance this system with your player. Representation of this is simple - put a timed condition on the card, or big red letters saying PERMANENT. **The Rules of Engagement** Lets build a transformation together! If you can answer the questions below, you are 90% of the way there. 1. Firstly, and most importantly, what level of involvement does your player want in this process? Ask them! If the answer is surprise me, cackle, rub your hands together menacingly, and move on to question 3. 2. What are your players boundaries for this? Do they have anything they expressly want to say No to now? 3. If your transformation was a sliding scale from -100 to 100, where is the player sitting now? What are the extreme ends of the spectrum? What is the midpoint between the two? 4. What is a trigger for a change to occur? Is it time based? Casting a certain school of magical spell? Exposure to a specific environment or object? A combination of several? 5. What is your transformations timescale, how long from point A to B? If the character retired to do nothing right now, would it continue progressing? **Building a Deck** Cards come into play in one of two categories - **Temporary** or **Permanent**. **Temporary Changes** There are two subtypes of temporary change, mental and physical. * **Mental**. These represent the purely alien way your brain is starting to work. A transformation into a Red Dragonborn will have vastly different mental effects to turning into a Construct. Mental changes are always temporary - no GM should have the power to permanently change a characters personality. Every mental card has four things: * A **timer**, for how long its in play in game, from the moment it is drawn by the player. * A **statistical bonus, malus, or combination** on **ability scores** or **skills**. This represents the effect in play on the character! *For example, the* ***Prideful*** *card increases your Charisma rolls by +2 for the day, but comes at a cost of -5 to Insight checks, representing your lack of interest in others.* * An **acclimatisation condition.** If the player can achieve this within a session, they gain the ability to **ignore the next mental card** they draw, and you must **resolve the card, removing it from the deck permanently**. Resolving a card gives you a boost to your transformation score, and in some cases, a GM discretionary bonus. *For example, the* ***Prideful*** *card demands that you intimidate or persuade three people in a session, by boasting about your own abilities. If you achieve this, you resolve the card.* * A **resist cost** \- you can choose to take a toll on your psyche, in order to resist the effects. Resisting a card resolves said card, and gives you a malus to your transformation score. *For example, the* ***Prideful*** *card can be resisted and removed from play, by taking -2 to Charisma rolls for the week, representing your rejection of confidence in yourself.* * **Physical**. The bread and butter, what we are here for! These transformations change a physical aspect of the character in line with the overall transformation. Perhaps antlers of obsidian rip forth from the Tieflings skull, or the Genasi turning into a Naiad gains vulnerability to lightning damage. All physical change cards have the following aspects: * A **timer,** as above. Physical changes should last longer than mental effects. * A **statistical** **plus**, **malus**, or an **activatable new ability**. *For example, the* ***Diamond*** ***Claws*** *card gives you an extra d4 of damage on unarmed attacks, a climb speed of 30, but disadvantage on DEX saves, as you arent used to having claws instead of finger nails. You can also use the hold on ability, which allows you to plunge your claws into a solid material, and only a strength check of DC20 can rip you free.* * **A removal cost**. This is a small, yet painful, cost to permanently take this card out of play, **removing it from the deck permanently**. *For example, the Diamond Claws cards removal cost is losing 1d4 Maximum HP permanently, representing the toll on your body to have a blacksmith or wizard remove them from your body in a complex and dangerous process they dont quite understand.* * An **acclimatisation objective.** If a player can achieve this before the card expires, the physical change **becomes permanent**. You resolve the card, and increase your overall transformation score. This is much harder than the condition set for mental changes, representing a harder challenge to keep a long term bonus. *For example, by killing 10 people with the Diamond Claws, you gain the ability to retract them at will. You lose the disadvantage on DEX saves, and you can opt to extend/retract the claws as a bonus action, giving you the additional d4 unarmed damage and the climb speed.* * **Special**. If it doesn't fit in the above two, it goes here. Perhaps you want a physical change that can be **resisted** as opposed to **removed**? Mix and match mechanics here to your hearts desire, and build something *ghaaaaastly*. **Permanent Changes** These are powerful boons, or your worst nightmares made flesh. To create a permanent change card: 1. A permanent change has a long term impact on your transformation, speeding it along. Permanent cards have **a flat increase to your transformation score** associated with them, **until resolved** and removed from play. Assign a number, decide how impactful this change is on the process. 2. Take one of the above card types, remove the **acclimatisation objective** and **timer.** Its permanent already. 1. If it is a physical change, make the **removal cost** a **serious negative**, that can be recovered from after a long period of time. *For example, the Ranger Kerria has sprouted impractical antlers. Clipping these off is a horrifically painful process. The player will be left with spurs of bone protruding from their skull, and a malus of -4 to their Constitution for 1 in-game month.* 1. If it is a mental change, add a **resistance counter**. The player must incur the resist cost a minimum of X times (your call!) in order to resolve the card from play, and clear the transformation score from their tracker. **Building a Tracker** Your tracker is your timescale - if you want the transformation to take a year of sessions it needs to be a larger number. Scale as you see fit! Use the t**racker minimum/maximum values** in combination with your **card transformation point values** to set your own timescale - more points on the cards will speed the transformation along faster, for example. Agree a set of **triggers** for a player to draw a card from the deck. Exposure to a certain type of magic, would be a classic example, but time based such as one draw per ingame week of time is also an excellent way to make a transformation feel consistent. Each tracker ranges from **-X to X,** with zero as the perfect midpoint between the two states. Characters can start **anywhere** on the tracker, in whatever position is appropriate for the start of the process. The last thing you need are flashpoints. How many **points need to be gained/lost for something significant to happen**? Is it every five or six points? When you reach a new threshold, create a few new cards and shuffle them into the deck. As a character moves towards either end of the tracker, build more permanent or serious cards in, representing the transformation approaching the **point of no return**. Your **point of no return** represents the transformation coming to its climactic conclusion. Once you push past the maximum score toward either direction on the scale, the transformation is considered **complete**. Narrate a bad ass scene for your player - or dont, its your game. **EXAMPLE TRACKER // Kerria // (-25) Human to Eladrin (+25)** * Temporary cards are worth 3 points in play. Permanent cards are worth 6. * Kerria started at **point 0**, slap bang in the middle of both races. * Current position is **+10.** * Deck flashpoints are at every **five points gained/lost**. * **Triggers** \- exposure to fey magic, five consecutive days in the wilds, one per in-game month. Therefore, if you are giving out a temporary card per session and the player is actively pushing toward becoming an Eladrin, youd complete the transformation on session 9. If the player pulled two permanent cards, and kept one, itd be session 7. \-------------------------------- Well that's that! I have an ugly as hell fillable card template you are free to use and edit as needed: Template: [URL Blank: [URL Any/all criticisms and improvements welcome! I think I've overbaked it a touch, and needs some stripping back, but from using the system with a player, it achieved exactly what we wanted!"

You have to give up your action to make the enemy vulnerable to the damage of the next attack by any of your allies. So you give up Toll the Dead (31 avg dmg at lvl 20) so that someone can make double damage. There are some issues: 1) You can't influence who comes next to you in the turn order. Could be a rogue or paladin (yay), the fighter (okay) or the druid who uses thorn whip (14 avg dmg). 2.) Depending on group composition and number of your allies, the usefulness of this channel divinity varies greatly. There ere a few options how those issues could be addressed: 1.) Just make it a bonus action. This way, you will not give up most of your damage. Doesn't resolve the other issues though. 2.) Make it work like Bardic Inspiration: You buff an ally of your choice with your bonus action and his next attack that hits get the vulnerability. 3.) Make it a reaction after an ally makes his roll. This could very easily lead to crit fishing, making it too strong, especially if the party contains a rogue or paladin. 4.) Using it as reaction before the ally rolls. This leaves the issue: what happens if the ally misses? Channel Divinity wasted? Doesn't feels so good either. I guess it is possible to let only the reaction go to waste but I don't think something similar is used anywhere as a mechanic. Goal would be to make it useful without making it completely overpowered. I think version 2 would solve the issues best. Would do you think?"

I tend to brew things that are overpowered, so I can pull it back after review. **TL;DR** There are two 14th level features cause I can't decide which one fits better, pls help me decide So please, take a look and let me know how this can be improved! Thank you everyone in advance &amp;#x200B; Click here for Google Doc version: [URL &amp;#x200B; # Druid, Circle of Contamination **Absorb Disease** At 2nd level, you are able to cure a creature of all diseases with a single touch. When you do so, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Druid level. You cannot use this feature again until after completing a long rest. &amp;#x200B; **Tainted Touch** At 2nd level, whenever you perform a successful melee attack on a creature, you may force that creature to succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw against your Spell Save DC, or be Poisoned for 1 minute. You may use this feature a number of times equal to one-fourth of your Druid level (minimum of 1). You regain all uses of this feature at the end of a long rest. &amp;#x200B; **Veil of Gnats** You are able to exert an aura of decay that attracts swarms of insects. At 6th level, as an action, you may summon a swarm of flying insects around you, granting you +1 to your AC and dealing piercing damage equal to your proficiency bonus to all enemies within 10 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you may move the swarm to another creature within 30 feet of you. When you do so, you lose the bonus to your AC, and you may either grant that creature +1 to their AC or have the swarm deal piercing damage equal to your proficiency bonus at the end of each of that creature's turns. The swarm moves with the creature it is attached to. Whenever the host creature takes fire or thunder damage, or if there is a gust of wind of at least 10 miles-per-hour, the swarm is dispelled until the beginning of your next turn. If the swarm is more than 60 feet away from you, the swarm immediately disperses and reforms around you at the beginning of your next turn. The swarm lasts for 1 minute, or when dismissed as a bonus action. You cannot use this feature again until after completing a long rest. &amp;#x200B; **Unleash Pathogen** Starting at 10th level, your body is riddled with bacteria that can be forcefully ejected from you. Whenever a creature hits you with a melee attack, you may use your reaction to attack that creature. On a hit, this attack deals extra Poison damage equal to your proficiency bonus. &amp;#x200B; **Infest Creature** At 14th level, your body has become a mass of compacted bacteria, viruses, and other microbial pathogens. As an action, you may expend one of your uses of Wild Shape to cast the *Gaseous Form* spell on yourself without expending a spell slot or providing any material components. When you cast *Gaseous Form* in this way, whenever you share a space with a creature, you may use an action to attempt to infest a creature. The creature must make a Constitution Saving Throw against your Druid Spell Save DC, or be Incapacitated and and lose control of its body. You now control the body but the target is not deprived of awareness. You can't be targeted by any Attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that cure disease, and you retain your Alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and any of your resistances or immunities. You otherwise uses the infested target's Statistics, but don't gain access to the target's knowledge, Class Features, or proficiencies. The infestation lasts until the *Gaseous Form* spell ends, the body drops to 0 Hit Points, you end it as a Bonus Action, or you are forced out by an effect like the Cure Disease spell. When the infestation ends, you reappear in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the body. You may use this feature once per long rest. # OR **Putrefaction** Starting at 14th level, you are able to Putrefy areas with rot and disease. With a touch, you begin to Putrefy an area with a disease in a 150-foot cube centered on the location you touch. After 1 hour has passed, the Putrefaction takes full effect. The area remains Putrefied for up to 7 days, unless you choose to lift the Putrefication, or if the area is magically cleansed with a *Remove Curse, Dispel Magic*, or *Greater Restoration* spell. You cannot Putrefy an area that has been Hallowed. When you first touch an area to be Putrefied, choose one of the following diseases to Putrefy the area: * ***Blinding Sickness:*** Pain grips the mind of afflicted creatures, and their eyes turn milky white. Creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom Checks and Wisdom Saving Throws and are blinded * ***Filth Fever:*** A raging fever sweeps through the body of afflicted creatures. Afflicted creatures have disadvantage on Strength Checks, Strength Saving Throws, and Attack rolls that use Strength. * ***Flesh Rot:*** The flesh of creatures decay. Creatures have disadvantage on Charisma Checks and vulnerability to all damage. * ***Mindfire***: The minds of creatures becomes feverish. Creatures have disadvantage on Intelligence Checks and Intelligence Saving Throws, and creatures behave as if under the Effects of the Confusion spell during Combat. * ***Seizure***: Creatures are overcome with shaking. Creatures have disadvantage on Dexterity Checks, Dexterity Saving Throws, and Attack rolls that use Dexterity. * ***Slimy Doom***: Creatures begin to bleed uncontrollably. Creatures have disadvantage on Constitution Checks and Constitution Saving Throws. In addition, whenever afflicted creatures take damage, they are Stunned until the end of their next turn. Excluding creatures of your choice, if a creature spends at least 1 minute in the Putrefied zone, they must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw against your Spell Save DC, or be afflicted with the selected disease. Creatures in this area must repeat this Saving Throw every minute if they are not afflicted with the disease. If you use this feature on a still body of water, the Putrefaction extends out to 1 mile from the point of contact. If you use this feature on a flowing river or similar body of water, the Putrefaction extends downstream up to 6 miles from the point of contact. Creatures who drink the Putrefied water must immediately roll the Constitution Saving Throw. You may only Putrefy one area at a time. If you Putrefy another area, the previously Putrefied area is immediately cleansed. You may use this feature once per long rest."

What are your thoughts? Homebrewery link is here: [URL School of Sugar Full of nervous energy, practitioners of the School of Sugar firmly believe that the early bird gets the worm and that decisive action is required to attain ones goals. They tend to be talkative and ambitious, always urging others not to fall behind. Sugar Rush Magic gives you an energy boost. Starting at 2nd level, when you cast a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, your speed increases by 10 feet for a number of rounds equal to the spells level. This benefit doesnt stack. Twitchy At 2nd level, you add half of your proficiency bonus to your initiative checks and Dexterity saving throws. Sweet Tooth At 6th level, you add the 1st level spell *Faerie Sugar*, 2nd level spell *Sugar Weapon*, and 3rd level spell *Conjure Sugar* *Animals* to your spellbook. *Faerie Sugar* acts like *Faerie Fire*, except that creatures that fail their saving throw are coated in glistening sugar instead of being outlined in colorful light. *Sugar Weapon* acts like *Spiritual Weapon*, except that instead of summoning a spectral weapon that deals force damage, you summon a physical weapon of hardened sugar that deals either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, which is chosen when you cast the spell. *Conjure Sugar Animals* acts like *Conjure Animals*, except that the animals summoned are not beasts; they are constructs made of hardened sugar. When you cast any of these spells, the movement speed increase of Sugar Rush is 15 feet. Sugar Fiend At 10th level, you add the spells *Expeditious Retreat*, *Longstrider*, and *Haste* to your spellbook, if they are not there already. When you cast those spells, you can improve them in one of two ways. *Expeditious Retreat*: A. You gain advantage on initiative checks and the spell now has a duration of up to 1 hour. B. While affected, you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws and opportunity attacks against you are at disadvantage. *Longstrider*: A. When you cast this spell on another creature, it gains the benefits of your Twitchy ability as long as the spell lasts. B: You can target an additional creature. *Haste*: A. The target gains advantage on initiative checks and suffers no ill effects once the spell ends. B. You can target an additional creature. Sugar Lord By 14th level, you have mastered many of the secrets of sugar. While you affected by Sugar Rush, you gain the Evasion feature. You can make a special sugary treat. This can take several forms. By spending an action and expanding a spell slot of at least 3rd level, you can create a wall of sugar that acts like *Wall of Sand*. If the spell slot is at least 5th level, you create a wall of hardened sugar that acts like *Wall of Stone*. By expanding a spell slot of at least 6th level, you can cast *Sweet Banquet*. By spending 1 minute and expanding a spell slot of at least 5th level, you can conjure a powerful construct of hardened sugar. This acts like the spell *Conjure Elemental*, except that you create a sugar guardian. This has the statistics of an earth elemental, with several differences. The creatures type is construct rather than elemental. It lacks the Earth Glide feature, as well as vulnerability to thunder damage. It cannot speak Terran or any language, but understands and obeys your commands. If the spell slot is at least 7th level, you can create a sugar knight. This has the statistics of an earth elemental myrmidon, but the creature is a construct rather than an elemental and it cannot speak, but understands and obeys your commands. If you lose concentration, the sugar guardian or knight immediately crumbles into delicious but ordinary sugar. The movement speed increase of Sugar Rush is 15 feet for these options. &amp;#x200B; Sweet Banquet *6th-level conjuration* * **Casting Time:** 10 minutes * **Range:** 30 feet * **Components:** M, S, V (exceptionally high-quality sugar worth at least 1000gp) * **Duration:** instantaneous You summon a sumptuous banquet that features outstanding food and drink which is all sweet, but not too sweet.. The banquet takes 1 hour to consume and disappears at the end of that time, and the beneficial effects don't set in until this hour is over. Up to twelve creatures can partake of the banquet. A creature that partakes of the banquet gains several benefits. The creature is cured of all diseases and poison and becomes immune to poison. The creature's speed increases by 10 feet and it makes all Dexterity saving throws with advantage. Its hit point maximum also increases by 2d10, and it gains the same number of hit points. These benefits last for 24 hours."

These bards will spend time in the wilderness studying creatures so that they may learn to recreate movements and behaviours. **Book of Creatures** At third level you have a book of creatures, which you can use to conjure shadow puppets based on a non-humanoid creature in your book. As an action, you can expend a spell slot to create a shadow puppet for one hour, and you may maintain a number of shadow puppets equal to your proficiency modifier. You may create a puppet based on a creature you have seen with a challenge rating of an equal or lower level than the spell slot expended (for example, to summon a Tiger with a challenge ratio of 1, you may expend a level one or higher spell slot). Creatures with a challenge rating of zero in your book may be summoned without expending a spell slot. Shadow puppets act on your initiative score. To add a creature to your book of creatures, you must spend one hour observing the creature in order to take notes on the creatures mannerisms. This process is similar to copying a spell into a Wizards Spellbook, but does not require material components. At level three, your book starts with notes on two creatures that you have seen. Shadow puppets are not an exact copy of the creatures they are based on. Although they share ability scores, health points, movement, armour class and actions as the creature they are based on, they lack senses of their own they do not speak a language, and lack any of the special traits a real creature would have (a shadow puppet Troll for example would lack the Regeneration ability, but may still make a multi-attack using the same statistics seen in the *Monster Manual*). Additionally, as shadow puppets are made of magical darkness, they gain a vulnerability to radiant damage, but are immune to psychic damage and effects of mind control. **Supporting Words** Also at third level, you may use your bardic inspiration dice to restore health points to your shadow puppets. **Shadow Swap** From level 6, as a reaction to being successfully hit by an attack, you may use your reaction to swap places with a shadow puppet within 30 feet of you. This puppet takes the damage from the attack instead of you. Once you use this ability you may not use it again until you complete a short or long rest. **Shadow Bomb** From level 14, you have learnt to weave destructive magic into your puppets. As an action you may detonate one of your puppets, causing necrotic damage to any creatures within a 30 foot radius. Creatures must make a dexterity saving throw, on a failed save they take 3d6 necrotic damage, plus 1d6 additional damage for every spell slot spent on creating the shadow puppet. The puppet is destroyed using this ability. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your charisma modifier, after which you may not use it again until you complete a long rest."
49,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Staff of the Soul Monger,1,bbuizj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/bbuizj/staff_of_the_soul_monger/,2019-04-11 12:00:11,"This isn't my first homebrew item, but it's certainly my most extensive and strangest! It's intended to be strong but I'm fairly certain it will be balanced enough for my game but it has yet to be used and will almost definitely be tweaked. I would love any criticism on the theme or balance of it. The world I'm using is a heavily adapted Eberron and this is a legendary item created with Dragonshards (from the setting) that the party will have to kill a lich (who is using it) to get. Staff of the Soul Monger Staff (Strong Necromancy; Legendary; requires attunement, cursed, sentient, true neutral) A macabre staff of sinew and bone, adorned with 4 skulls near the head which are carved from Khyber Dragonshards. 4 Large spines of the same Dragonshards pierce upwards to cradle an orb crafted from the very essence of Dolurrh. You can hear the baleful wails of the souls trapped inside the staff's apex. Curse: Long rests with the staff impose a DC12 con save or the bearer gains 1 level of exhaustion as the staff pulls at your mortal soul but otherwise benefits from the rest as normal, hungry to consume you as much as any other. Dying with 3 levels of exhaustion while wielding this staff causes the staff to consume your soul, leaving you as an empty husk with the stats of a zombie, having no memory of your life. You may not unattune to the staff without the aid of an 8th+ level Remove Curse spell. Denial of Respite: As a Reaction, whenever a creature of Medium size or larger with a natural soul dies, you may attempt to capture the soul within the staff. Roll a d20 and add your proficiency modifier to the roll. If the result is equal to or higher than the number of hit dice the creature has, the soul is trapped within the staff. You may hold up to 5 souls in this way. Latent Power of the Afterlife: when the staff has 5 souls trapped within, it provides a +3 bonus to your spell attack modifier and spell save DC. This decreases to +2 at 3-4 souls, +1 at 1-2 souls, and +0 when the staff is empty. As and action, you may expend 1 soul and preform one of the following. Expending a soul with 10 or more hit dice requires you to make a Constitution Save against a DC equal to the number of hit dice of the soul. Grasp of the Mournful: Make a Ranged Spell attack against a target you can see within 60 feet. If the attack hits, roll the hit dice of the soul you expended, dealing necrotic damage as you command a soul from the staff to free your target's soul from its body. Killing a target with this attack gives you advantage on your Denial of Respite on this target. Shattered Soul: Choose between 3 and 10 creatures you can see within 60 feet. They each make a Wisdom Saving throw against your spell save DC. Roll the hit dice of the soul you expended, each creature takes necrotic damage equal to rolled hit dice divided by the number of targets, or half as much on a successful save, as you draw a soul from the staff and shatter it, sending it to tear the essence of your targets. Spectral Shield(concentration up to 1 minute): You bind a soul to a target that you can see within 10 feet of you, commanding it to shield your target with its very essence. Roll the hit dice of the soul, the target gains half of the number rolled (rounded down) as temporary hit points. While shielded in this way, the target is vulnerable to radiant damage. (A single attack may surpass the shield, but the vulnerability fades after that attack is resolved.) Feast: You consume the essence of a soul from the staff, revitalizing your magical energies. You may regain 1/3 of the souls hit dice, rounded down, in spell levels (ex a creature with 10 hit dice grants 3 spell levels) Price: Priceless artifact, people might wanna steal/kill you for this. Again, this is the first homebrew I've done of its kind, and I'm excited to hear your comments and criticisms!"

Here are the Bread Dragons, the first perilous dive into Monster Mondays. I dunno if that's a thing already or what. But hey. Anyways, I hope you all enjoy this! Let me know what you think! Homebrewery link below for easier reading pleasure. URL # The Ancient Grains There are stories of a breed of dragons so powerful and old that even the most elder of the chromatic and metallic dragons fear their strength. They are known to most as grain dragons or bread dragons. When a bread dragon is born, most dragons will kill or attack them on sight, taking any and all measures to eradicate the bread dragons before they can mature. If a nest's location is known, dragons will often collaborate to destroy the nest. The power of the bread dragons is so fierce and potent that their mere presence can be known to alter and demolish the nearby landscape from their presence alone. The smell of mold follows the most ancient of bread dragons, while the younger bread dragons smell like freshly baked pastries and crisp delight as a way to invite unsuspecting travelers into their abode. Fumes of their deliciousness seep from the vents of their straight spiraled horns, daunting any wayfarer that is enticed by their scent. The dragons are large and have a shell that covers their back, similar to that of armadillos. The bread dragon is easy to track, fluffy flakes of their crisp crust falling to the ground as they trudge through the dry plains. Their eyes are grow more reminiscent of raisins as they age, instilling a primal fear in all who have mistaken a raisin cookie for a chocolate one. ***Lovers of the Sun.*** Bread dragons like to bask in the sun, taking residence in deserts and plains where the sun is unobscured. They also like to fly up to the peaks of mountains, coming into the territory of red dragons often. Though they try to avoid wasting energy, they are not against flying above the clouds to feel the sun on their back. ***Silent Destroyers.*** Bread dragons are silent surveyors, plotting their attack on the landscape to consume everything in sight. Bread dragons remember every occurance, every slight and insult against them. The bread dragon will sit and cultivate those feelings into a full blown swath of destruction, plotting insanely inventive and cruel ways to exert their dominion and power over other creatures. They view themselves as the true heirs to the world, contesting red dragons often when one tries to gain control over a territory that a bread dragon has settled in. Their territory spans for miles around, expanding whenever possible. ***Breeding Monsters.*** Bread dragons will only tolerate a few other creatures in its domain, with tolerate being a strong word. Bread dragons reproduce by budding, making smaller versions of themselves to patrol and protect the ever-reaching domain of the grain. Some especially ancient bread dragons can create small humanoid-esque bread forms, using them to infiltrate and sabotage humanoid settlements if the bread dragon is feeling bored. If the bread dragon is inventive enough, they can recreate creatures they've encountered through the same process. The idea of a bread creature army under the control of a bread dragon is horrifying enough an idea that chromatic and metallic dragons will cooperate for the sole goal of stopping such a thing. The spawn of the bread dragon will obey the original, for fear of reabsorption into the collective. This does not stop the younger bread dragons from plotting to overthrow or escape the clutches of the original. Most attempts end in failure, as the original is wary enough of their own kin to avoid such scuffles. ### A Bread Dragon's Lair Bread dragons make their home in a number of places, keeping to drier climates whenever possible. Ancient bread dragons know they are most vulnerable around wetter climates, their hard shell becoming soggy and mushy when soaked. Because of this, they avoid bodies of water whenever possible and make their homes in dry caves or arid depressions. The more powerful the bread dragon, the drier the area becomes and so much that water is all but nonexistent. The dragon will sleep covered in sand or hot ash, hiding itself completely away from any who would tread upon their domain. If awakened, the bread dragon will watch quietly and strike when the intruders are most unawares. #### Lair Actions On initiative count 20 (losing initative twice), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: - Spores kick up and fill a space that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 30-foot radius cloud. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud or enters the cloud for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature must repeat the saving throw if they take an action, wasting the action upon a failure. - Dust and ash from the area will spin into a 10-foot radius dust devil centered on a point within 60 feet of the dragon that it can see. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Any creature that starts their turn in the area or enters the area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 13 saving throw or swept into the dust devil. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone and thrown 10 feet in a random direction. - The dragon can turn up the heat like an oven, subjecting creatures within 60-foot radius of the dragon to intense heat. Each creature other than the dragon in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. #### Regional Effects The region containing a legendary bread dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the folowing effects: - A great drought affects the area, drying out crops and eliminating any sources of water. - The air is thick and heavy with the scent of freshly baked goods. - All wildlife and flora have distinct flaky growths on them, infecting them and allowing the bread dragon to control them from afar. If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d100 days. &gt; ##### Water and its effects on Bread Dragons &gt; Bread dragons have a great fear of water since they know that if they come into contact with enough of it, they become more vulnerable as their hard crusty exterior grows weak and mushy. The older bread dragons have are somewhat more resistant to it, their shells and scales composed of thicker and drier material like masterfully crafted and ancient rye. The younger bread dragons are unable to fight off the effects as easily, their shells akin to modern white or potato bread. &gt; &gt;If a bread dragon absorbs or is drenched with 10 or more cubic feet of water, their AC is reduced by 2 for 1 minute or until they take fire damage. ### Bread Creation Template A bread creation is a mimicry of any creature an adult or older bread dragon has encountered and formed through the shedding of their own shell. The following characteristics change or are aded to a creature that is a bread creation. **Retained Characteristics.** The creation retains its Armor Class, hit points, Hit Dice, Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. **Lost Characteristics.** The creation lo9ses its original saving throw and skill bonuses, special senses, and special traits. It loses any action that isn't Multiattack or a melee weapon attack that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. If it has an action or a melee weapon attack that deals some other type of damage, it loses the ability to deal damage of that type, unless the damage comes from a piece of equipment, such as a magic item. **Type.** The creation's type is plant, and it loses any tags. **Alignment.** The creation is unaligned. **Speed.** Reduce all the creation's speeds by 10 feet, to a minimum of 5 feet. **Ability Scores.** The creation's ability scores change as follows: Int 1 (-5), Wis 8 (-2), Cha 1 (-5) **Senses.** The creation has blindsense with a radius of 60 feet and it is blind beyond this radius. **Condition Immunities.** The creation can't be blinded, charmed, or frightened. **Languages.** The creation loses all known languages but it responds to orders given to it by the bread dragon that created it. **Attacks.** If the creation has no other means of dealing damage, it can use its fists or limbs to make unarmred strikes. On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + the creation's Strength Modifier, doing an additional 1d4 of damage for each size category above Medium the creation is. ___ ___ &gt; ## Ancient Bread Dragon &gt;*Gargantuan dragon, chaotic evil* &gt; ___ &gt; - **Armor Class** 23 (natural armor) &gt; - **Hit Points** 624 (32d20+288) &gt; - **Speed** 40 ft., burrow 40 ft., fly 80 ft. &gt;___ &gt;|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA| &gt;|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| &gt;|30 (+10)|7 (-2)|28 (+9)|19 (+4)|17 (+4)|23 (+6)| &gt;___ &gt; - **Saving Throws** Dex +5, Con +17, Wis +11, Cha +13 &gt; - **Skills** Perception +22, Stealth +12 &gt; - **Damage Vulnerability** slashing from serrated weapons &gt; - **Damage Resistance** cold, fire, force, thunder &gt; - **Damage Immunity** necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant &gt; - **Condition Immunities** diseased, poisoned &gt; - **Senses** passive Perception 32 &gt; - **Languages** Common, Draconic, Grain &gt; - **Challenge** 26 &gt; ___ &gt; ***Legendary Resistance (3/day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. &gt; &gt; ***Mold Production*** If the dragon receives necrotic damage, the dragon deals an additional 21 (6d6) poison damage on all of its melee weapon attacks for 1 minute or until it takes acid damage. &gt; &gt; ### Actions &gt; ***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence.

A creature infected with this endures an almost crippling pain when they try to move. &gt; &gt; A creature afflicted with *Yeast Infection* must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the start of their turn, taking 2d6 necrotic damage on a failure, has their movement speed halved, and makes attacks, ability checks, and saving throws with disadvantage until the start of their next turn. Upon a success, a creature takes half damage and only has their movement speed reduced by 5 feet. &gt; &gt; *Yeast Infection* can be cured with *greater restoration* or *heal*, or successful ingestion of a week long course of antifungal medicine created from a sample of a bread dragon. ___ &gt; ## Young Bread Dragon &gt; *Large dragon, chaotic evil* &gt; ___ &gt; - **Armor Class** 19 (natural armor) &gt; - **Hit Points** 241 (21d10+126) &gt; - **Speed** 40 ft., burrow 40 ft., fly 80 ft. &gt;___ &gt;|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA| &gt;|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| &gt;|25 (+7)|13 (+1)|23 (+6)|14 (+2)|13 (+1)|16 (+3)| &gt;___ &gt; - **Saving Throws** Dex +5, Con +10, Wis +5, Cha +7 &gt; - **Skills** Perception +9, Stealth +9 &gt; - **Damage Vulnerability** slashing from serrated weapons &gt; - **Damage Immunity** necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant &gt; - **Condition Immunities** diseased, poisoned &gt; - **Senses** passive Perception 19 &gt; - **Languages** Common, Draconic, Grain &gt; - **Challenge** 12 &gt; ___ &gt; &gt; ***Mold Production*** If the dragon receives necrotic damage, the dragon deals an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage on all of its melee weapon attacks for 1 minute or until it takes acid damage. &gt; &gt; ### Actions &gt; ***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its cronch and two with its claws. &gt; &gt; ***Cronch.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit* 18 (2d10+7) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. &gt; &gt; ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit* 14 (2d6+7) slashing damage. &gt; &gt; ***Yeast Breath (Recharge 5-6)*** The dragon exhales mold spores in a 30-foot cone.

51,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Help Balancing Homebrew Druid,2,bejn4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/bejn4q/help_balancing_homebrew_druid/,2019-04-18 19:48:48,"Hey all. Skip to the bolded text below if you want to skip my questions and preamble and get right down to the class in question. Longtime 5e DM here. I'm a big proponent of letting players play whatever kind of class they want. If the character concept they have isn't something that's covered in the books, I'm always down to homebrew something. This homebrew in particular is a variant of the Circle of Shepherd Druid. The player in question thinks the ideas of the totems is really interesting, but has zero interest in all the features past third level that buff summoning. The character concept we worked out is a Druid who can throw his totems down, but can expend his wild shapes to become his totems, becoming living embodiments of certain qualities. &amp;#x200B; Mechanically, this works a lot like vanilla WoW Druid forms; each form is highly specialized, and allows him to be very versatile, and change his skillset on the go. Ideally, he should be a jack of all trades, master of none, but able to fit any roll on the fly. Early on, fellow players in the campaign felt like some of the transformations outshine their own classes, which I felt was very fair; that's the last thing I want to do. Ideally, these transformations should provide versatility, but in ways that are mechanically different to the way other classes would do it. &amp;#x200B; At the moment, I have the Ancient Tree form (healing, gets a limited mana pool that allows for powerful healing), a Bear form (tank form; tanks via absorbing damage and willfully taking damage to mitigate incoming damage to allies), and a Griphon form (flying form that helps others do increased damage; this one feels the most balanced by far to me, and I don't really have any complaints with it, nor does the table, but I thought I'd get feedback on it all the same). &amp;#x200B; The healing and tank forms have been points of contention within the group, especially the healing one. The issue is that the party is quite poorly balanced, and they have no healers. In addition, resurrection is banned in my game, so I tried to allow that form to compensate for these differences a little; it should feel like the strongest. Options and versatility were also important for all forms, as this player loves the idea of creativity/having many tools at his disposal. &amp;#x200B; This has been a tough one to balance since there's multiple skillsets to keep track of (and he'll unlock more transformations with time), and I'm catching a lot of flak from the table for not having it properly fine tuned. The most common arguments I've heard are that the bear has too much health/too high AC, the tree heals too much (tough one since they don't have a healer and no resurrection), and it's unfair that these Transformations use wild shapes, as they're just better wild shapes. The final point is a tough one, because if I use a separate charge system alongside Wild Shapes, then I'm buffing this character even more. I'd like opinions on these points as well so I have a better idea of where to take this. &amp;#x200B; I've recently overhauled the balance once again, especially the tree, and wanted to get everyone's take here before bringing it to the table. I'd appreciate any and all constructive feedback. I apologize for the scattered thoughts. Thanks! The party is currently level 8, and they likely won't go past level 15. If it helps, the rest of the current party is a Oath of the Crown Paladin/Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer, a (DEX based) Purple Dragon Knight Fighter/Swashbuckler Rogue, and a Hexblade Warlock. Very rarely, we also have a drop-in Gunslinger. As you can see, they're horribly, horribly balanced; they have a decent tank in the pally (though he's multiclassing all the way into Sorc now), and then nothing but dps. Help me Reddit, you're my only hope. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Denebore Totemic Transformations** &amp;#x200B; You have 2 uses of Wild Shape per short/long rest. These uses may also be expended to transform into the visages of your totems. If you are defeated in one of your Totemic Transformations, that Transformation cannot be used again until a long rest is completed.

Eternal Giver: While in the Ancient Tree form, you cannot regain HP, even temporary, from any source whatsoever.  Ironbark: You have resistance to non-magical physical damage, and vulnerability to fire damage.  Healing Pulse. **Cost** - **7 mana:** At the beginning of your turn, you may expend 6 mana to heal all allies within your aura for 1d4 healing. &amp;#x200B; Actions:  Deep Roots: Take roots deep into the ground as an action and gain access to abilities, movement becomes zero. **Deep Rooted Actions:**  Regrowth: Roots cascade out from the Ancient tree and attach themselves to a targeted ally. These roots have a range of 65 ft, and may perform one of two functions: o Natures Messenger: Your roots act as a conduit for your divine natural magic, allowing you to cast any healing spell you have prepared, expending the appropriate spell slot. Any healing spell you choose to cast in this way is converted to a range of touch. While it takes your action to use Natures Messenger and deliver a spell, the normal rules for spellcasting still apply when using Natures Messenger; two spells may be cast in one turn using Natures Messenger, provided one is an action, the other is a bonus action, and one of them is a cantrip, though ONLY healing spells may be cast using Natures Messenger. Upon reaching 14th level, buffs may be cast through Natures Messenger as well. Once the spell(s) have been cast, the roots immediately return to the Ancient Tree. o Nature Cannot Be Resisted (*Recharge 6*). **Cost - 18 mana**: Roots fly out from the base of the Ancient Tree, attaching themselves to an ally, immobilizing them and giving them the restrained status condition. The ally must succeed a DC 10 Nature check. If they succeed, they gain HP equal to 1d12 + Wisdom mod + Druid level. If they fail, they regain nothing. In dire times, an ally may call upon more of the earths power. The DC of this check may be raised to 15, 20, or 25 to raise the potential healing to 2d12, 3d12, or 4d12 respectively, with all modifiers from the original heal. If the DC is raised to 20 or 25, and the ally fails their check but gets equal to or above 15 or 20 respectively, then they receive half healing. On their turn, an ally may choose to detach the roots from themselves as a free action. Another ally may attempt to remove the roots as well if they succeed on a DC 17 Strength check to pry the roots apart. Otherwise, the roots remain attached until the start of your next turn. If the ally has taken no damage since the roots attached to them by the start of your next turn and the roots are still attached, a Nature check and associated heal may be repeated.  Life Blossoms. **Cost  8 mana**: Blossoms bloom along your roots, growing flowers with potent healing energies. Flowers can be taken and consumed within the round for 1d4 healing + Wisdom mod. If they are not used before the start of the next turn of the creature who picked them, they wither. Roll a D6 to determine how many flowers bloom. This ability cannot be reused until all flowers have withered.  Cycle of Life. **Cost  10 mana:** If an ally is within your aura, you may target them to heal them for 1d6+Wisdom mod. If a secondary ally is within 5 ft of the original target and still within your aura, this healing will spread to them as well. This healing increases to 2d6+Wisdom mod if the target(s) are touching the Ancient Tree. &amp;#x200B; Bonus Actions:  Uproot: As a bonus action, you may uproot from the ground, gaining ten feet of movement, but losing access to all abilities. **Deep Rooted Bonus Actions:**  Rejuvenation. **Cost  12 mana:** Heal an ally for 1d6 + Wisdom mod immediately, then 1d4 + 1 for the next 2 turns. This healing occurs at the beginning of your turns. Only one ally may be rejuvenated at one time.  Servants of the Woods. **Cost  7 mana:** By rustling your leaves, you can awaken a small forest sprite, giving you command of a Seedling. These Seedlings act on your turn. They may be used to deliver Life Blossoms, take the Help action, or any other action you desire. They can understand basic commands, and follow your will without question. The limits to what can be done with a seedling is up to DM discretion. Only one Seedling may be active at a time until level 14 is reached, whereupon 2 may be active at one time. The Seedlings can carry 2 Life Blossoms without making any checks, but if you desire them to carry more, checks may have to be made. &amp;#x200B; **Seedling Stats:** **AC** 10 **HP** 10 **Speed** 20 ft **Resistances** All non-magical physical damage **Vulnerabilities** Fire STR: 2 (-4), CON: 2 (-4), DEX: 10 (+0), INT: 5 (-3), WIS: 12 (+1), CHA: 8 (-1) &amp;#x200B; Reactions:  New Life. **Cost  3 mana**: Grant advantage on a death saving throw to an ally in your aura. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Bear Totem: All allies in your aura gain a +1 to AC and have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws. &amp;#x200B; Bear Totemic Transformation: Passives:  Ferocious Defender: Gain 2 AC in this form and take your maximum character health + your druid level as your new HP maximum while in this form. While Strength based characters use Athletics for their grapples, thereby already incurring advantage due to the totems passive, allies within your aura who use Acrobatics for their grapples may also gain advantage on grapple checks within your aura, provided you choose to lose HP equal to your druid level in exchange. This choice may be made after the roll, but before the results are announced.  Noble Sacrifice: Once a day, if you succeed a saving throw and an ally within 5 ft of you fails the same saving throw, you may choose to automatically fail your saving throw to allow them to re-roll theirs.  Keen Smell: You have advantage on perception checks based on smell while in this form. &amp;#x200B; **AC** 19 (base 16, +1 from totem aura, +2 from Totemic Transformation) **HP** = max Druid HP + 2x Druid level **Speed** 40 ft STR +5, DEX +0, CON +3. Mental stats remain the same. &amp;#x200B; Actions:  Bite: Take a bite out of an enemy. Prof bonus +5 to hit, 1d8 + 5 piercing damage.  Mighty Paw: Lash out in front of you, forcing enemies back with your blows. Make a Strength check against your target(s). You may target up to 3 ft 5 squares in front of you with this ability, targeting as many creatures within those squares as you like. For every creature you target beyond the initial, the enemies get a +2 to their Strength check. If they fail their Strength check, the target(s) are knocked back 10 ft, taking 1d4+5 slashing damage, plus any additional damages for environmental effects incurred upon knockback.  Primal Rage: When below half health, you may active this ability to fall into a rage, gaining 2 attacks and temporary health = 5x the number of player character allies in your aura. Once you are in Primal Rage, you are able to use the Devour action and the Till the End reaction.  Devour (*Primal Rage Only):* Whilst in Primal Rage, you may use one of your attacks to attempt to mangle a target. This may involve grappling, disarming, crippling, etc, though what is possible is up to DM discretion. Prof bonus + 5 to hit, minimum of 1d8+5 piercing/bludgeoning/slashing damage. &amp;#x200B; Bonus Actions:  Imposing Stature: Standing on your hind legs, you tower over your enemies, and provide cover for your allies. While using this bonus action, you are considered one size larger, and medium allies may use you to gain half cover. Small allies that hide behind you gain three-quarters cover. Upon reaching 14th level, medium allies may attempt to gain three-quarters cover from you by taking the Hide action contested by the enemies Perception. Small allies may do the same to attempt to receive full cover.  Protective Spirit: Forgo your own passive AC bonus up to 2 and give the bonus to a single ally in your aura until the start of your next turn. &amp;#x200B; Reactions:  I Will Protect You: If you are within 5 ft of an ally being targeted by an attack roll, you may attempt to divert the attack to yourself. Make a DEX check against the enemy making the attack. If you succeed, you successfully shield your ally from a portion of the damage intended for them, transferring half of the damage of the attack to you. This reaction cannot be applied to AoEs or spells that are not physically shot towards the target (ie, attacks that cannot reasonably be physically blocked).  Till the End (*Primal Rage Only):* Whilst in Primal Rage, this improved version of *I Will Protect You* replaces the original. You may now use this reaction to move up to your speed to attempt to block an ally from harm, incurring possible opportunity attacks as normal while you do so. In addition, if you are successful on your DEX check to protect your ally, you now take 100% of the damage, shielding them from all harm. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Griffon Totem: When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirits aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura. &amp;#x200B; Griffon Totemic Transformation: Passives:  Altered Griffon: Gain the stats of a Griffon, but with 45ft of flight movement instead.  Keen sight: Advantage on perception checks based on sight. &amp;#x200B; **AC** 12 **HP** 59 **Speed** 45 ft STR 18 (+4), DEX 15 (+2), CON 16 (+3). Mental stats remain the same. &amp;#x200B; Actions:  Griffons Blessing: Add a +2 to an allys attack rolls and damage until the start of your next turn if they are within your aura. This ability also causes the allys weapons to be considered magical.  Griffons Glare: Attempt to slow an enemy within your aura through the cold fury of your mystical stare. The target must be able to see you, and succeed a WIS saving throw against your Spell Save DC, or be slowed until the start of your next turn.  Tailwind: Create a gust of wind, increasing the movement speed of allies in front of it by 10ft, and giving them advantage on all DEX saves until the start of your next turn.  ONE attack a turn, but 2 attack options: o **Beak**: Melee Weapon Attack: Prof bonus + 4 to hit, Hit: (1d8 + 4) piercing damage. o **Claws**: Melee Weapon Attack: Prof bonus + 4 to hit, Hit: (1d4 + 4) slashing damage. If this attack does its maximum damage (8), then the target is immediately grappled within your claws, provided all the normal rules for grappling are still followed. &amp;#x200B; Bonus Actions:  Piercing Eye: Select an enemy within 60ft, and use your piercingly analytical eye to attempt to scan for information about the target by making a Perception check with a DC relevant to the type of information you are trying to uncover, and how apparent it is. The information you are seeking must be available through sight. For example, if an enemy has the ability to rise from the dead, and they have no undead qualities, then information of this nature may be impossible to glean. Be incredibly specific about what you are looking for. This ability may yield resistances, AC, skill proficiency, immunity, etc, but a simple request for one of these categories will result in an automatic failure, and the usage of this ability does not always guarantee relevant information.  Griffons Mark: Focusing your natural hunters eye for prey, you may place a visible Mark upon an enemy in your aura. The next time this enemy takes damage from any source, they take an additional 1d4 force damage. The Mark disappears immediately after the 1d4 has been applied. If the target has not taken damage by the start of your next turn, the Mark disappears. At 14th level, the damage of this mark increases to 1d6 &amp;#x200B; Reactions: -Griffon Totem: As explained in the base ability for this totem, you may use your reaction to grant an ally advantage on an attack roll if the target of their attack is within your aura. The ally does not need to be within your aura for this ability to function."
52,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Circle of the Lycan v1.0 - Druid Circle,5,bk5chz,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/bk5chz/circle_of_the_lycan_v10_druid_circle/,2019-05-03 16:39:05,"# Circle of the Lycan [GM Binder](URL [PDF](URL I am back again with a new subclass! After some mostly positive reception of my [Everguard Fighter Subclass](URL and [Runic Scholar Wizard Subclass](URL revisions, and taking what I've learned overall from those, I've made a druid one now. And based it around everyone's favorite curse: Lycanthropy. **The Concept** While playing an Order of the Lycan Blood Hunter for a campaign I started to think about the bit of lore on Lycans in the Monster Manual. Lycan Blood Hunters achieve control over the curse through their blood magic, MM states that some control the curse through the sheer force of their will. And most of the NPCs that I've seen that have done the latter, that have been peaceful/neutral in nature, have been stereotypical wise old werebear druids. So I took that connection in the reverse: Lycans controlling their curse via Druidic magic and a link to nature. **The Mechanics** So I took a bit of inspiration from Mercer's Blood Hunter, and from the official Circle of Spores in the Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica. Your Wild Shape gets a new use in Hybrid Shape: A Melee-focused transformation that grants you natural weapons and changes your stats based on what kind of lycan cursed you. Maintaining this form is taxing, robbing you of your ability to concentrate on spells, but still allows you to cast and use your normal equipment while in it. As you grow in power, you channel your magic into your natural weapons, and eventually control a transformation into the beast of your curse, granting you even greater power. The usual drawbacks of lycanthropy are present, such as vulnerability to silver, and your creature type gains the *shapeshifter* tag for any effect that specifies, such as the *moonbeam* spell. **The Predicted Concerns** I'm sure I'm gonna miss a few concerns that'll pop up (this is an early draft, and first one I'm posting for this subclass), but these are the biggest ones I know will probably be brought up: &gt;Why would I pick any form *besides* Bear or Rat, they have 18 in their attack stat for their Natural Weapons Honestly, the stat changes are the part of the subclass I'm the least happy with, and the more I think about it the more I'm considering just scrapping them and having the Natural Weapons use Wisdom for their bonus mechanically. It would make no sense, since you're swiping claws/tusks/teeth at your enemies, but mechanically it'd be the easiest way. Especially since, right now, the stats don't change as you level up, and would technically overwrite any higher stats you have in STR/DEX/CON. As I write it out, I'm less and less happy with it. So I'm tossing out two solutions I'm thinking up, and welcome any other options: 1. Remove the stat changes altogether and have Natural Weapons use Finesse or Wisdom, making another stat you have to focus and making your choice 100% flavor rather than mechanical. 2. Have all the classes use the same array for the 3 stats (probably 18/14/13), meaning that some of them will have identical stat spreads, making the choice more flavorful but keeping some mechanical benefits to it. &gt;Half your HP Max, and then full HP Max for Embrace the Beast, is a lot of temp HP. I'm realizing now I didn't specify, but it should say that this is using your Hybrid Form's Constitution modifier (another reason I'd like to keep the stat changes). Taking an example of a level 2 druid who chooses Bear or Boar as their lycan curse to get the most: 8+3 for 1st level, 5+3 for 2nd, total of 19 HP. Round up, 10 Temp HP. 2 more than the 8 that Circle of Spores would give you. Higher levels, at 14: 11+13\*8 total of 115 HP. Round up for 58 Temp HP. Still 2 more than Circle of Spores' 56 at the same level. And if you picked Rat, Tiger, or Wolf, you're getting less than Circle of Spores (51 at 14th level). Getting your maximum for Embrace the Beast is a lot, but those only last for 1 minute (10 at 14) at most. It's an easier calculation in my opinion than ""What level am I again? Ok, times 4... This much temp HP."" Instead it's ""I have this much, halve it, done."" The only real differences are that losing the Temp HP doesn't end the transformation like it does for Circle of Spores (which is a choice I can understand, but still dislike when everything practically revolves around keeping it up) and that at 14th, you keep any leftovers when your transformations end. I may remove the latter feature from Mastery of the Curse in regards to your full beast form from Embrace the Beast, because I can see that much temp HP carrying over being an issue, but want to hear opinions first. &gt;If I'm a small character, chose Bear, and use Embrace the Best, I only go up to medium size, when I could normal Wild Shape into a large size bear. But if you chose Rat, you become a medium sized rat! Or if you're medium already, turn into a large sized rat! And with the wording, if you're large sized from an *enlarge/reduce* spell, you'll be a huge sized rat! ... But I do get it. I might make it say you turn into a Large sized version of the creature, regardless of its normal size when I make my revisions. At least then small characters jump 2 size categories and can then go to huge from *enlarge/reduce*. Food for thought. **The Conclusion** So... self-review I found some things that'll need work. But I'd love more feedback and input. If you have alternate suggestions to some of the solutions I gave myself, or if you find other issues that might need addressing. I'm all ears. Thanks for taking time to read all of this and the subclass."

I have most of the flavor stuff in as well as traits, though I have yet to come up with anything substantial for names. [Have a google doc.](URL It's probably more obvious than I'd like that this was inspired by the Sylvari from Guild Wars, though I hope I've done a decent job of not entirely ripping them off. Also, I feel like vulnerability to fire damage is a potentially *huge* weakness, but I thought I couldn't create something like this and leave that out. I tried to give them some pretty hefty abilities to compensate, but I'm simultaneously concerned that some of them are too much and not enough.

54,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Myrmidon: Humanoid Ant race for greco-roman homebrew setting.,15,b7gljv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/b7gljv/myrmidon_humanoid_ant_race_for_grecoroman/,2019-03-31 09:04:55,"Hello everyone, first post here. Its a bit long, so sorry in advance. I'm currently homebrewing a setting for a campaign based on ancient Greece and Rome, and decided to make Myrmidons a playable race since I noticed they weren't in the monster manual alongside things like the cyclops and manticore. &amp;#x200B; **Background:** In the setting, Myrmidons were created when a powerful wizard wanted to create a slave race that would be able to work tirelessly to build grand structures for him, while not requiring much work beyond their creation on his part. Using a profane enchantment and transmutation rituals, he created the first myrmidon from an ant queen. The wizard is long dead, and the myrmidons now live in matriarchal underground cities. &amp;#x200B; **Culture:** Most myrmidons live in underground cities rule by a queen. Myrmidons are naturally loyal to their queen, but their sentience also lets them branch out and explore the world on their own if they desire or the need arises. Due to their nature as a former servant race, myrmidons have a strong subconscious desire to please other humanoids, taking pleasure in praise. As a result they often build their cities underneath existing settlements. &amp;#x200B; **Appearance:** Myrmidons appear as taller, statuesque humans, with compound eyes, black chitin on their forelimbs, and several subspecies. &amp;#x200B; **Lifecycle:** Myrmidons are born from eggs laid by the sole fertile female of the city. These eggs are fertilized by males, and taken care of by workers. The eggs hatch in two months, and a myrmidon is mature after two years. The lesser species live at most 8 years, but queens and other elite types can live for up to 40 years. &amp;#x200B; **Ecology:** Myrmidons live underground, in excavated tunnels reinforced by obsidian-like amber resin, often shaped into bricks. They are nectarivorous, and often cultivate large groves of fruit-bearing plants above their cities. Being formerly natural beings perverted by magic, animals feel extremely uneasy around them, and areas where they have settle often lack animals more complex than insects. &amp;#x200B; **Basic Traits for all Myrmidons:** \+2 Strength Magic Vulnerability: Their magical origin has left them weak to magical effects that target the mind. They suffer disadvantage on all rolls to save against charm effects, and rolls to detect illusions. Proficiency: Axes, Spears, Shields, Light Armor. Enhanced Encumbrance: Like the ants that they were created from, Myrmidons are able to lift well above their body weight. Their carry weight is doubled. &amp;#x200B; **Subraces:** &amp;#x200B; **Myrmidon Aedifex**: (Based on the carpenter/weaver ant) Sterile female myrmidons that serve as the workers and foot soldiers in myrmidon society. The most common variety, with 1950 in 2000 being born as Aedifexes. The aedifex are timid as individuals, but when massed together are a bold fighting force that relies on strength in numbers. They prefer crowds wherever they live, and grow anxious when isolated. Due to their extremely short life span and cannon-fodder approach to combat, most are unfazed by death, short of that of the queen. They have the ability to produce resin from special glands in their hands, which they use to make tools and structures. Features: \+1 Wisdom Produce Resin: Once per long rest, a Myrmidon Aedifex can produce one cubic foot of resin. This resin may be sprayed on the ground, treating it as difficult terrain for non-Myrmidons. The Aedifex may also shape the resin into any simple weapon, tool, or item as a 10 minute action. The Aedifex is treated as having proficiency with the weapon or tool. &amp;#x200B; **Myrmidon Toxicon:** (Based on the bulldog and fire ant) Toxicons are identical in appearance to aedifexes, save for their bright red chitin and sharp teeth. Often called 'pit fiend ants', they are renown across the lands for their extremely painful poisonous bite, which paralyzes the muscles of those unfortunate enough to be bitten. They tend to prefer working by themselves, and often serve as scouts. Features: \+1 Charisma Bite Attack: The Toxicon's sharp teeth may be used to make as a natural weapon, dealing 1d6 damage. Paralyzing Bite: The bite from a Toxicon is so painful that the muscles of bitten targets seize up, paralyzing the creature. Once per long rest, the Myrmidon may use its bite attack against a target to inject poison. The target must make a constitution save of DC 10 + 1/2 Toxicon's level or be paralyzed for one round. &amp;#x200B; **Myrmidon Carnifex:** (Based on the tawny 'crazy' ant) Carnifexes are the most formidible looking, having spikes growing from their chitin. They are extremely violent and reckless in combat, though not uncontrollable or evil. They serve as the shock-troops of myrmidon armies, being the first into battle. They are very impatient, making them poor guards, and they are often out on patrol. They have a unique reaction when struck, releasing a highly powerful 'frenzy' pheromone, that makes them and other myrmidons more ferocious in combat. Features: \+1 Dexterity Frenzy Pheromone: When struck in battle the myrmidon releases a special pheromone that sends it and other nearby myrmidons into a short frenzy. Once per long rest, upon taking damage, the carnifex releases a 10ft raidus cloud of pheromone around itself. It and any myrmidons within range may immediately use their reaction to make a melee attack against a target within 5ft of them. &amp;#x200B; **Myrmidon Praetorian:** (Based on the door ant) Praetorians are the tallest, bulkiest myrmidons. Apart from their size, their most notable feature are their chitin plates, which are much thicker than a normal myrmidon, and cover the majority of their body. Their role in their cities is to serve as sentinels, keeping the peace and serving as the elite defenders of the myrmidons. They are often stoic and matter of fact, taking and disseminating orders with little to no decision making involved on their part. They have a notably higher attention span than other myrmidons. Features: \+1 Constituion Natural AC: 16 Harden Chitin: The chitin of a Praetorian is naturally thicker than that of other species, and it may harden it even further if pressed. Once per long rest, the Praetorian may use its bonus action to harden its chitinous shell, granting resistance to piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing damage for two rounds. &amp;#x200B; Praetorians, Toxicons, and Carnifexes are equally common, about 49/3 per 2000. They can be male or female, but are sterile. &amp;#x200B; **Myrmidon Legate:** (Based on the ant spider) The only fertile myrmidon species. Females are queens of a city, while males are consorts and gererals. Only 1 in 2000 myrmidons are legates, and less than half of those are female. Legates have a second set of arms, just behind and below their normal set. They are also much more intelligent than other myrmidons. Their longer lifespans make them best suited to magic among myrmidons. Features: \+2 Intelligence Four Arms: A Legate's second set of arms is not merely for show. Once per long rest, a Legate may gain an additional bonus action to make any sort of use object or non-verbal spell casting action, or attack. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for reading. Please let me know what you think about the concept, what information I could add, and the balance!"
55,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Implementing Levels of Insanity,1,aqmf0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/aqmf0b/implementing_levels_of_insanity/,2019-02-15 04:48:49,"*These are homebrew Insanity rules designed for a CoS campaign and inspired by the mechanics for Exhaustion. This is my first finished draft and is still being revised, so any feedback on how to improve the design (especially the levels of insanity table) is much appreciated!* &amp;#x200B; ## Psychic Attack Upon entering the Domains of Dread, you gain the ability to channel disruptive psychic energy into another creatures mind. As an action, you can use one of your mental ability score modifiers to make a ranged psychic attack against a creature (range 30/60). You are proficient with psychic attacks. You must be able to perceive the target, but you do not need to see it. The target uses its Wisdom score in place of its AC against this attack, and gains no benefit from cover. Being within 5 feet of the target doesnt impose disadvantage on the attack roll. On a hit, this attack deals psychic damage equal to 1 + your ability score modifier (minimum 1). This damage is non-lethal. The target is aware that you attacked it but does not automatically learn your location. A creature that drops to 0 hit points from a psychic attack falls unconscious and is stable. Whenever you score a critical hit on your attack roll, the target is also afflicted with short-term madness. # Sanity Sanity is represented by a characters mental ability scores. A character with high sanity is level-headed even in the face of insane circumstances, while a character with a low sanity is unsteady, breaking easily when confronted by eldritch horrors that are beyond normal reason. Whenever the DM asks for a Sanity saving throw, you may use the mental ability score of your choice. Sanity saving throws may be called for when you attempt to recall lore about madness-inducing creatures, to decipher the writings of raving lunatics, or to learn spells from tomes of forbidden lore. Sanity saving throws are made when your character is forced to resist succumbing to short- or long-term madness (DMG 258-260), subjected to spells that affect mental stability (such as the insanity option of the symbol spell), or resisting an effect conferred by an attack or spell that deals psychic damage. # Insanity Some creatures and environmental hazards, such as eldritch horrors and the effects of psychological torment, can lead to a special condition called insanity. Insanity is measured in levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of insanity, as specified in the effect's description. A creature gains 1 level of insanity whenever it fails a mental saving throw by 5 or more or when it is afflicted with a form of madness. |Level|Effect|Psychic Attack Damage| |:-|:-|:-| |1|You gain vulnerability to psychic damage|1d4| |2|You suffer the effects of the *confusion* spell during the first round of combat|1d6| |3|You have disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws|1d8| |4|You are afflicted with a form of indefinite madness|1d10| |5|You suffer the effects of the *confusion* spell during combat|1d12| If an already insane creature suffers another effect that causes insanity, its current level of insanity increases by the amount specified in the effect's description. A creature suffers the effect of its current level of insanity as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 insanity suffers the effects of the confusion spell during the first round of combat and is also vulnerable to psychic damage. An effect that removes insanity reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all insanity effects ending if a creature's insanity level is reduced below 1. Any spell that reduces exhaustion or produces mental stability may be used to reduce insanity instead. A creature's Wisdom score decreases by 1 for each level of insanity gained and is restored as levels are reduced. Whenever a creature's Wisdom score increases (such as by a normal ASI, a feat, or by magical means), its level of insanity decreases by the same amount. A creature can only gain a number of levels of insanity up to their normal Wisdom score. If a creature's Wisdom score reaches 0, it is stunned until it regains a point of Wisdom. An insane creature can use its shattered psyche to its advantage. A creatures psychic attack damage die increases with each level of insanity, up to 1d12."

Please let me know if this spell needs some fine tuning to be considered a proper Epic Spell. &amp;#x200B; **Lunar Lightning** *9th level Evocation* *Casting Time : 1 round* *Concentration (10 minutes cast, 30 hours ritual), Ritual (1 hour casting time)* *V/S/M (The full moon must be visible during the casting and maintenance of the spell)* *This spell is considered a Wizard, Druid, and Cleric Spell.* *This spell is considered Epic Magic.* &amp;#x200B; By directly channeling arcane power from a full moon, you draw a pillar of iridescent energy into your body from the heavens and radiate a powerful field of luminescence. When cast as a ritual, this spell is considered as 10th level. &amp;#x200B; In order to activate this spell, you must use your action and bonus action, and you may not use your movement or reaction. Starting at the end of the round, your movement becomes 0, you may not take any actions, bonus actions, or reactions, you become impervious to all damage types and conditions, and you emit extremely intense light for a radius of 15 feet, blinding light for a radius of 30 feet, daylight for a radius of 100 feet, and dim light for a radius of 200 feet. Each of these radiuses is centered on you, and any effects they convey overlap so long as an affected creature is within the radius of the relevant effects. The spell ends if you stop concentrating on it or if the moon becomes obscured for more than 1 minute. When this spell ends, the caster stunned for 1d10 rounds and takes 3 levels of exhaustion. Once this spell takes effect, no other spell or weather phenomena can obscure the moon unless caused by at least a 9th level spell or equivalent (lower level spells cast at 9th level do not qualify). In such cases, you may make an opposed arcana check against the phenomenon that is attempting to obscure the moon. The moon is obscured if you roll below the opposed check. If an effect obscures the moon, and the moon has been obscured for less than 1 minute, you may make an opposed arcana check at the end of the round to unobscure the moon. If your arcana check is equal to or greater than the opposing arcana check, the moon is no longer obscured. &amp;#x200B; Each radius of light conveys effects to those that are within them, and each radius of light also affects the equivalent areas of the Ethereal Plane, the Shadowfell, the Feywild, and the Material Plane when this spell is cast on any of these planes. &amp;#x200B; Within your radius of dim light, any creature that is obscured, invisible, or otherwise hidden will begin to softly glow, and any attacks made against them have advantage. Ranged attacks and ranged spell attacks made against friendly creatures within your radius of dim light from outside your radius of dim light automatically fail. &amp;#x200B; Within your radius of daylight, all hostile entities take 1d4 radiant damage at the start of their turn, and whenever a hostile entity uses an action, bonus action, or reaction, they take radiant damage equal to 2d12. They must also make a constitution saving throw against your spell save DC whenever they move within your radius of daylight. Upon success, they take 1 radiant damage for every foot of movement they take within your radius of daylight. Upon failure, they instead take 1d4 radiant damage for every foot of movement they take within your radius of daylight. If an entity re-enters this radius within the same movement, they must make a new saving throw if they had previously succeeded, or take 1d4 radiant damage per foot of movement if they had previously failed. Any damage dealt by friendly creatures against hostile creatures within this radius immediately causes the recipient of the damage to take radiant damage equal to half the damage they just recieved, rounded up. &amp;#x200B; Within your radius of blinding light, any hostile creatures that enter or start their turn within your radius of blinding light must make a constitution saving throw equal to your spell save DC or be blinded for 10 minutes. Creatures that have Dark Vision or vulnerability to radiant damage automatically fail this saving throw. All damage dice that deal radiant damage have their damage doubled within your radius of blinding light. Hostile creatures have their resistance and immunity to radiant damage and blindness negated within your radius of blinding light. &amp;#x200B; Within your radius of extremely intense light, all hostile creatures have vulnerability to radiant, fire, force, psychic, and lightning damage, and all friendly creatures take maximum damage from radiant, fire, force, psychic, and lightning damage dice. Any friendly creatures within your radius of extremely intense light instead regain hit points equal to any damage they would have otherwise taken from radiant, fire, psychic, force, and lightning damage. The first time per round that any friendly creature takes damage, deals radiant, fire, psychic, force, or lightning damage, or falls unconscious, they immediately regain hit points equal to your level + your spell casting ability score + your proficiency modifier (each friendly creature within your radius of extremely intense light may activate each individual trigger of this effect once per round, allowing a maximum of 3d4 healing per creature in a round). All friendly creatures within your radius of extremely intense light gain immunity to necrotic and cold damage. Any hostile creature that enters, starts its turn, or ends its turn within your radius of extremely intense light must make a dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 5d4 radiant damage, 5d4 fire damage, 5d4 psychic damage, 5d4 force damage, and 5d4 lightning damage. On a success, they instead take 1d4 radiant damage, 1d4 fire damage, 1d4 psychic damage, 1d4 force damage, and 1d4 lightning damage. Any friendly creatures within your radius of extremely intense light that are unconscious have +1d4 to their death saving throws, may stabilize with only 1 successful death saving throw, and may reroll any critical failures on their death saving throws. Any hostile creatures that are unconscious within your radius of extremely intense light have disadvantage on their death saving throws, and die if they fail any of their death saving throws. Any creature killed within your radius of extremely intense light is immediately disintegrated. &amp;#x200B; Certain lunar phenomena can grant this spell additional effects. When you cast this spell, you may roll a d100 to see if any of these phenomena occur as you cast this spell. &amp;#x200B; Selenehelion (1): The sun is visible during a lunar eclipse. The range of your radius of blinding light and your radius of extremely intense light are doubled. &amp;#x200B; Solar Eclipse (2-5): The moon blocks out the sun. The range of your radius of extremely intense light is doubled. &amp;#x200B; True Blue Moon (6-10): A lunar eclipse perfectly aligns with the atmosphere to cause the moon to appear blue. The range of your radius of extremely intense light is increased to 20 feet. &amp;#x200B; Blue Moon (11-16): An extra full moon has occurred in this season's lunar cycle. The range of your radius of blinding light is doubled. &amp;#x200B; Central Lunar Eclipse (17-23): The full moon falls perfectly into the shadow of the planet and appears much darker. The range of your radius of dim light is increased by 50 feet. &amp;#x200B; True Blood Moon (24-29): A partial lunar exclipse in which the moon appears to be red. The range of your radius of dim light is doubled. &amp;#x200B; Blood Moon (30-40): A partial lunar eclipse in which the moon appears to golden or orange. Increase the range of your radius of daylight by 50 feet. &amp;#x200B; Ordinary Full Moon (41-100): No additional bonuses. &amp;#x200B; If this spell is cast at exactly midnight, underneath the eye of a naturally occuring storm, or at any time on the Equinox when both the moon and sun are visible, you regain your 9th level spell slot when this spell ends. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"
57,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Looking for help on making a homebrew monster scary.,1,ax08r3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/ax08r3/looking_for_help_on_making_a_homebrew_monster/,2019-03-04 10:46:49,"I have a concept for a homebrew monster, but I have a very poor sense of how to set things like HP, attack damage, and other metrics to make it as scary as I want it to be, but not so impossible to defeat that it isn't fun for my players at their current level. Here's the concept as it stands (might as well solicit advice on all of it): **The Black Statues** Deep underground, the heroes discover caverns that have been sealed for so long that they are not mentioned in any written histories. These newly discovered caverns have evidence of a civilization older than any currently known. The only depictions of the former inhabitants are strange, glossy statues, made out of a blue-black metallic material. The subjects of these statues are not of any known race, possessing six eyes arranged in two columns on their face, no hair, and protrusions on their skin akin to an octopus' skin texture. They have no hands or feet, their limbs instead ending in sharp points. Artificial light is dimmed in any room with these statues, but they are illuminated with dim green ambient light that seems to lack any source. Explorers report feeling extremely nervous and uncomfortable around them. These statues are actually extremely dangerous predators. They stay perfectly still until they see an vulnerability (such as a person getting too close to examine one while the rest of the team isn't there to protect them). Their skin is extremely hard, but although they have the means of flexing and shifting it, it is very brittle to attack. Here are some aspects of their stat block I've decided so far: Immune to all damage besides force or bludgeoning until openings in the skin are made. Their HP can only be reduced by attacking through gaps creating with force/bludgeoning (inside their metallic skin, they are still just meat, although their biology is still very alien). They attack by moving swiftly to try to pin down and neutralize prey with their stabbing limbs. I'd like for this to be a creature that I can hint at as a threat, but that means it needs to make a good first impression. For example, in subsequent encounters, the PCs can encounter a room filled with dim green light, but not see the ""statue"" anywhere, and then have to worry about where it could be. Any advice for how to balance/create new enemies that are genuine threats?"

(from *true seeing*), Passive Perception 28 **Languages** Abyssal, Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Giant, Infernal, Primordial, Undercommon **Initiative** \+2 **Challenge** 23 (50,000 XP) (+7 proficiency) ## Traits **Special Equipment.** Raishan has woven powerful enchantments into her undead body, granting her the equivalent of wearing a *Black Robe of the Archmagi*. She wears a *Ring of Spell Storing*, which contains a *synaptic static* spell. She is attuned to, and often uses, a *Crystal Ball of Mind Reading* for the purpose of observing the world outside her lair. **Contingency.** When Raishan is subject to an effect or condition that would be nullified by *freedom of movement*, her *contingency* spell casts *freedom of movement* on Raishan automatically. **Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Raishan fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead. **Magic Resistance.** Raishan has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. **Rapid Spellcasting.** If Raishan casts a bonus action spell, she is not limited to casting only cantrips for the rest of her current turn and may casts levelled spells for her action and reaction normally and vice versa. **Rejuvenation.** If Raishan's physical form is ever destroyed, her spirit returns to her Soul Gem as long as the two are on the same plane. If the Gem comes into contact with another dragon's corpse, Raishan's spirit can take possession of that corpse and become active again, regaining all her Hit Points. If the Raishan's Soul Gem is taken to another plane, Raishan's spirit has nowhere to go when her undead body is destroyed and simply passes into the afterlife. **Innate Spellcasting.** Raishans innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 23). Raishan can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: * 1/day each: *divine word*, *freedom of movement*, *plane shift*, *project image*, *teleport*, *true seeing*\* **Spellcasting.** Raishan is an 18^(th)\-level spellcaster. Her Spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 24, +16 to hit with spell attacks). She requires no material components to cast her spells. Raishan can cast *shield* and *invisibility* at will, so long as she has them prepared. Raishan has the following Wizard Spells prepared: * Cantrips (at will): *mage hand*, *minor illusion*, *prestidigitation*, *ray of frost*, *toll the dead* * 1st level (4 slots): *absorb elements*, *detect magic*, *magic missile*, *shield* * 2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts*, *hold person*, *invisibility*, *Melfs acid arrow* * 3rd level (3 slots): *animate dead*, *counterspell*, *dispel magic*, *fireball* * 4th level (3 slots): *greater invisibility*, *polymorph* * 5th level (3 slots): *cone of cold*, *wall of force* * 6th level (1 slot): *chain lightning*, *contingency*, *disintegrate* * 7th level (1 slot): *forcecage*, *prismatic spray* * 8th level (1 slot): *feeblemind*, *mind blank*\* * 9th level (1 slot): *meteor swarm*, *wish* \* Raishan is always under the protection of *mind blank*, casting it before each of her long rests, and she casts *true seeing* on herself before Combat begins. **Undead Nature.** Raishan does not require air, food, drink or sleep. ## Actions **Multiattack.** Raishan can use her Frightful Presence. She then makes three attacks: one with her bite and two with her claws. **Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* \+16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (2d10 + 9) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage. **Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* \+16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (4d6 + 9) slashing damage. **Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* \+16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage. **Frightful Presence.** Each creature of Raishan's choice that is within 120 feet of Raishan and aware of her must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Raishan's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. **Poison Breath (Recharge 56).** Raishan exhales poisonous gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 77 (22d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. **Change Shape.** Raishan magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than her own, or back into her true form. She reverts to her true form if she dies. Any equipment Raishan is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (Raishan's choice). In a new form, Raishan retains her alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, innate spellcasting, class features, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Raishans statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form. ## Reactions **Absorb Elements.** When Raishan is hit with acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, she can use her reaction to have resistance to it until the start of her next turn, including against the triggering attack. Also, the first time Raishan hits with a melee attack on her next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 of the damage type. **Counterspell.** Raishan attempts to interrupt a creature in the process of Casting a Spell. If the creature is Casting a Spell of 3^(rd) level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is Casting a Spell of 4^(th) level or higher, Raishan makes an ability check using her Spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect. When Raishan casts this spell using a spell slot of 4^(th) level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot she used. **Shield.** An Invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects Raishan. Until the start of her next turn, she has a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering Attack, and she takes no damage from Magic Missile. ## Legendary Actions Raishan can take 4 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Raishan regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn. She can forgo using them, and she cant use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, Raishan cant use them until after her first turn in the combat. **Cantrip.** Raishan casts a cantrip. **Detect.** Raishan makes a Wisdom (Perception) check or a Wisdom (Insight) check. **Tail Attack.** Raishan makes a tail attack. **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** Raishan beats her wings. Each creature within 15 feet of Raishan must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. Raishan can then fly up to half her flying speed. **Cast a Spell (Costs 13 Actions).** Raishan uses a spell slot to cast a 1^(st)\-, 2^(nd)\-, or 3^(rd)\-level spell that she has prepared. Doing so costs 1 legendary action per level of the spell. ## Lair Actions On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), Raishan takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she cant use the same effect two rounds in a row. Raishan cant do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, she cant use one until after her first turn in the combat. * **Arcane Rejuvenation.** Raishan rolls a d8 and regains a spell slot of that level or lower. If she has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens. * **Destiny Bond.** Raishan targets one creature she can see within 30 feet of her. A crackling cord of negative energy tethers Raishan to the target. Whenever she takes damage, the target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, Raishan takes half the damage (rounded down), and the target takes the remaining damage. This tether lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round or until Raishan or the target is no longer in Raishans lair. * **Lament of the Dead.** Raishan calls forth the spirits of creatures that died in her lair. These apparitions materialize and attack one creature that Raishan can see within 60 feet of her. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. The apparitions then disappear. * **Charming Smog.** Magical fog billows around one creature Raishan can see within 120 feet of her. The creature must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by Raishan until initiative count 20 on the next round. ## Regional Effects The region containing a legendary green dragons lair is warped by the dragons magic, which creates one or more of the following effects: * Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the dragons lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round its in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns. Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. * Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragons path. * Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragons lair serve as the dragons eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator. If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within 1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns."

61,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Magical Items: Belt of the Wolf,1,ajj2bj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/ajj2bj/magical_items_belt_of_the_wolf/,2019-01-25 11:08:14,"In classic folklore, lycanthropes is nothing like the werewolves of Hollywood. Where fiction gave it the characteristics of ""forced transformation at a full moon"" and ""invulnerable to all but silver,"" the classic werewolf is much more consenting to transformation. In particular, they would put on a belt made of wolf skin to transform into a wolf. Now, I feel like doing something like that (though it doesn't require the wearer to be evil or make a deal with a demon), with a magical belt that allows the wielder to gain the attributes of wolves and even the power to transform into a wolf monster. So, here we go: # Belt of the Wolf *Wonderous item, very rare (requires attunement)* This magical belt is crafted from the skin of a wolf and enchanted with the very magic that transforms people into lycanthropes. While wearing this belt, you gain the following benefits: * You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. * You can communicate simple ideas with wolves. * During a full moon, your hit point maximum increases by 12. * You can't be cursed with lycanthropy. If you're already cursed with lycanthropy, the curse is repressed until attunement with this belt ends. As an action, you can polymorph into a wolf-humanoid hybrid or into a wolf, or back int your true form. Your statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying doesn't transform. You revert back into your true form if you die. While transformed, you gain the following changes: * In your wolf form, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. * You can attack using your claws (hybrid form only) or bite (wolf or hybrid), which count as unarmed strikes. Your claws deal 2d4 + your Strength modifier while your bite deals 1d8 + your Strength modifier. * While you're wearing no armor, you gain a +1 to your Armor Class. * You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks not made with silvered weapons. * In your wolf form, you can't speak but you can communicate with other wolves. ~~\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_~~ &amp;#x200B; Now that we have the basic belt provided, let's get into something a little more, um, bizarre. Like how the *bag of holding* as the *bag of devouring* and your *armor of resistance* has *armor of vulnerability*, the belt of the wolf has a cursed version that's identical in almost every way but comes with a hefty price... one that's very disturbing, uncomfortable, and dangerous. # Belt of the Big Bad Wolf *Wonderous item, legendary (requires attunement)* This belt superficially resembles a *belt of the wolf* and an *identify* spell or similar magic will identify it as a *belt of the wolf*. While wearing this belt, you gain all the benefits of a usual *belt of the wolf*. **Cursed**: Once you attune to this cursed belt and wear it, you can't remove it unless you are targeted by the *remove curse* spell casted at 9th level or higher or similar magic. While wearing this belt, a wolf head will sprout from your groin after 2d12 hours or during one of the following events: * It is the night of a full moon * You use the belt to polymorph * You make an attack roll or cast a spell that deals damage * You are attacked or take damage * You are charmed or frightened * You witness a creature be reduced to 0 hit points * You witness a creature polymorph * You have an emotional moment (romance, intense joy, anger) On your turn, the wolf head will make an bite attack on any creature within 5 feet of you, usually whichever creature caused harm to you or otherwise chosen at random. In addition, as a reaction, the wolf head will make a bite attack at any creature that enters or exits a space within 5 feet of you. The wolf head's bite attack is the same as your bite attack in wolf form, plus any humanoid hit by the wolf head's bite must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with werewolf lycanthropy. The wolf head demanifests when the cursed belt is successfully removed. &amp;#x200B; ~~\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_~~ # Your Wolf Head and You For those who must know all the rules and guidelines of how your wolf head works, here is a table on just that. * **Wolf Head's Mind**: The wolf head has the same Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores as a normal wolf. In combat, it acts on the same turn as you but it acts and reacts on its own. In addition, it can't be charmed or frightened, even if you are. * **Wolf Head's Health**: Any damage to the wolf head is damage to you. In addition, the wolf head doesn't need to eat, drink or breath so long as you're eating, drinking or breathing. * **Wolf Head's Temperament**: The wolf head is hostile to and will attack most any other creatures that're not you. The only exceptions are other wolves or wolf-related creatures, creatures with werewolf lycanthropy, and other creatures wearing belts of the wolf. Even then, if any such creature causes harm to you, the wolf head become hostile it. * **Hiding your Wolf Head**: You can't hide your wolf head within pants, and if you attempt to hide it within a cloak or robe, creatures have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice the wolf head moving. The wolf head can be hidden by magically means but it won't cease to act on its own. * **Controlling your Wolf Head**: As an action, you can calm the wolf head, which remains non-hostile until you are subjected to any event that causes your wolf head to sprout. * **Removing your Wolf Head**: You can attempt to have the wolf head removed from your body.

After being implanted by the transimssive form, the host doesn't notice anything aside from a nearly doubled appetite. During the next full moon, however, the host first feels the primal ""mind"" of the parasite wrestle with their own, and both make their first dominance check. Save for as described below, a wereooze only enters symbiont form when the symbiont feels it has not been sufficiently fed or when it feels threatened (meaning that whenever the host takes any form of damage, they have a percentage change to transform equal to the ammount of damage they took. For example, taking 13 points of damage from a *Lighning bolt* spell results in a 13% chance of the parasite getting angry and taking over. Reardless of the reason for the transformation, the wereooze only shifts back to humanoid form once the parasite feels that the problem has been corrected (when it has sufficiently fed or when all enemies are defeated). Upon first bonding to it's host, a wereooze gains access to three weapons from the list in the Players handbook in the Equipment section while in symbiont form, rolled for randomly. One one-handed or versatile melee weapon, one two-handed or versatile melee weapon, and one ranged weapon (ammunition or thrown). these weapons are formed from the parasite's own biomass and can be manifested at-will, and the symbiont cannot be disarmed while equipping them. If the symbiont rolls a weapon that can be used in multiple ways, such as a versatile weapon, then it can only use the weapon in the means for which it rolled. If for example it rolled a battleaxe for it's two-handed weapon, then it can only use the battleaxe two-handedly. If the wereooze rolls the same weapon twice (for example rolling a spear for it's one-handed weapon and a spear for it'ts two-handed weapon), reroll one roll. Note that ranged weapons are formed by the symbiont ejecting portions of it's own biomass, so when using these attacks it looses one point per projectile form it's max hit point total until the projectiles can be reclaimed. If the projectiles cannot be reclaimed, then the wereooze must spend a long rest in order to gather enough biomass (by eating) to replenish the lost hit points. If the symbiont ever reaches either extreme on the dominace score (7 or -7), then the two organisms merge into one. If it's, +7, then the parasite's mind fades into the afterlife, and the host can now change shape at will. They now retain their full intellectual capacity while in this form, as well as all their ability scores, skill checks, and proficiencies. If however it's -7, then the *host's* mind fades into the after life, and the creature now finally enters the reproductive phase of it's life cycle, the transmissive form. **Dual Nature.** The Symbiont has both the Ooze and humanoid (shapechanger) creature types. **Shapechanger.** As an action, the wereooze can enter it's symbiont form, which, um, well just look at the picture. **Uncontrollable Frenzy.** While in symbiont form, the wereooze's actions are strictly under control of the DM, even if they're a Player Character. **Dominance score.**Every given symbiont-host pair has a shared dominace score ranging from 7 to -7, starting at 0 when the pair first bond. Every full moon, the parasite and the host make a *dominance check,* which involves them both rolling Wisdom saves. If the Host rolls higher, the two move up in Dominance score, and the Symbiont has to pass a Wis save in order to manifest until the next full moon. If however the wereooze rolls higher, then thw two move down in dominace score and instantly transforms and goes on a night long rampage, and is entirely unable to turn back until sunrise. **Magic Vulnerability.** While in symbiont form, the wereooze has vulnerability to damage from all magical sources. **Nonmagic resistance.** While in symbiont form, the Wereooze is resistant to damage from all nonmagical sources, including nonmagical fire, acid, poison, etc. magic weapons are treated simmilarly to the barbarian's rage class feature. **Malleable form.** While in symbiont form, the wereooze can squeeze and contort it's body so as to fit through spaces and openings as though it was one size category smaller. In addition, a given symbiont has one of the following traits, rolled for randomly upon first joining with its host. **Tendrils.** While in symbiont form, the wereooze can project up to four tentacle-like pseudopods that can each be used identically to an instance of the *mage hand* spell, except that they have a range of only 15ft. **Spider climb.** While in symbiont form, the wereooze can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without having to make an ability check. **Grappling tentacle.** While in symbiont form, the wereooze can produce a single long tentacle-like pesudopod that, if the symbiont makes a successful attack roll, can latch onto a creature, object, or surface, and can then be used, where appropriate, to pull either the wereooze or the target into a space adjacent to the other. this ability can only be used twice per short rest. **ACTIONS** **Shapechanger.** As an action, the wereooze can take on it's Symbiont form. While in this form their AC is a flat 10 plus the host's dexterity modifier, and they have no access to any spells, proficiencies, or other such things the host might know. **Head Chomp.** As an action, While in symbiont form, the wereooze can regain health by biting a creature's head off. If used on a recently-killed creature, the symbiont is affect as per a 1st level *cure wounds* spell. Head Chomp can only be used in this way once per short of long rest. Alternatively, the symbiont can make an attack roll with disadvangate and at a -6 penalty against an adjacent still-living target. If the attack hits, then the enemy is decapitated and the wereooze is healed as per a 4th level *cure wounds* spell. Head chomp can only be used in this way once per long rest. Head chomp can only be used against organic targets that actually posses what can reasonably called a distinctive head. It cannot, for example, be used against stone golems or oozes. I haven't gotten around to statting the tansmissive form yet, but I intend for it to be very gaunt, looking like a black pudding wrapped around one of those skeletal malnourished people form the holocaust concentration camp footage, and for it to be quite the fragile speedster, designed to get in implant it's offspring, and get out."

If the target is a Large or smaller creature Grappled by Slarkrethel, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is Blinded and Restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside Slarkrethel, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of Slarkrethel's turns. If Slarkrethel takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside him, he must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of him.

If the target is Thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone. **Lightning Storm:** Slarkrethel magically creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target he can see within 120 feet of him.

Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Slarkrethel regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn. He can forgo using them, and he cant use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, Slarkrethel cant use them until after his first turn in the combat. **At-Will Spell:** Slarkrethel can cast one of his at-will spells. **Tentacle Attack or Fling:** Slarkrethel makes one tentacle attack or uses its Fling. **Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions):** Slarkrethel uses Lightning Storm. **Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions):** While underwater, Slarkrethel expels an ink cloud in a 60-foot radius.

A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the end of Slarkrethel's next turn. **Mind Burn (Costs 3 Actions):** Slarkrethel recharges his Mind Burn and uses it. &amp;#x200B; ## Lair Actions On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), Slarkrethel takes a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects. Slarkrethel cant do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, Slarkrethel cant use one until after his first turn in the combat. * **Tidal Push:** A strong current moves through Slarkrethels lair. Each creature within 60 feet of Slarkrethel must succeed on a DC 27 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 60 feet away from him. On a success, the creature is pushed 10 feet away from Slarkrethel. * **Lightning Rod:** Creatures in the water within 60 feet of Slarkrethel have vulnerability to lightning damage until initiative count 20 on the next round. * **Electrogenic Shock:** The water in Slarkrethels lair becomes electrically charged. All creatures within 120 feet of Slarkrethel must succeed on a DC 27 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. &amp;#x200B; ## Regional Effects The region containing a krakens lair is warped by the creatures blasphemous presence, creating the following magical effects: * Slarkrethel can alter the weather at will in a 6-mile radius centered on his lair. The effect is identical to the *control weather* spell. * Water elementals coalesce within 6 miles of the lair. These elementals cant leave the water and have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1 (5). * Aquatic creatures within 6 miles of the lair that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by Slarkrethel and aggressive toward intruders in the area. When a kraken dies, all of these regional effects fade immediately."

Here is my [original draft](URL &amp;#x200B; # The Barbaroi The barbaroi are decedents of humanoids that been warped by powerful wild magic. After that, they were largely limited to procreating among themselves. This resulted in a race of outsiders with random mutations. The race is complicated but makes it so that rarely is one barbaroi similar to another. **Kin Among Freaks**: The barbaroi are so mutated and different from humanity that they sustained extensive prejudice from more normal races, predominantly from humans. This disdain is what pushes the barbaroi away from most societies and hide away. To their benefit, the barbaroi hold respectable relations with other outcast races, particularly with dhampirs and tieflings (Note: the name ""barbaroi"" is really just a place-holder for this race. If anyone has a better name, notify me) # Barbaroi Traits Your barbaroi character has unique traits obtained through mutations. **Ability Score Increase**: Your Constitution score increases by 1, and one ability score of your choice is increased by 1. **Age**: Barbarois dont have an average rate of aging. At the closest average, a barbaro shares the same age-range of humans. **Alignment**: Barbarois are as varied as normal humans. Those of strong communities that rely on law tend to be lawful, while those who believe in survival and action tend to be chaotic. Those subjected to cruelty and become cold tend to be evil, while those who know of goodness and kindness are good in nature. **Size**: At average, barbarois are around human sized in size and weight. However, some individuals have unnatural sizes to them. Your size is Medium unless noted (See Minor Mutations) **Speed**: Your base walking speed is 30 feet unless noted (See Major Mutations, Minor Mutations or Negative Mutations) **Darkvision**: The ability to see into the dark is one of the only things to be consistent among the barbaroi. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cant discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. **Major Mutations**: Major mutations effects your abilities and attributes in the biggest positive way. Roll randomly from the Major Mutation table. **Minor Mutations**: Minor Mutations have a smaller impact than major mutations but can still grant you a strong gift. Roll randomly from the Minor Mutation table. **Negative Mutation**: Negative mutations have a negative effect on you, causing limitations or penalties to your capabilities. Roll randomly from the Negative Mutation table. **Languages**: You can speak, read and write Common and one language of your choice. &amp;#x200B; URL [\(Edit: For Gilded Skin, replace the #4 result with \\""Reroll\\""\)](URL URL URL URL URL &amp;#x200B; |*The Flavors of Mutation*| |:-| |As random as the mutations of barbaroi are, they're always more than just statistics and traits. For each barbaroi, their mutations go together to help identify them. For example, Kargal has the **Semi-Amorphous, Long Limbed** and **Infirm Strength** mutations. Rather than just being a semi-amorphous man with long arms and poor strength, Kargal is a being with clay-like physical qualities, including the ability to squeeze and stretch at will, but this makes him ill fit for heavy lifting.| |Even when two barbaroi have the same mutations, they way their mutations are flavored make each one unique. For example, we have Algoc and Benna. Both have the **Lesser Wings**, **Extra Limb** and **Cripple Vulnerability (Flammable)**. Algoc is a pteranodon-like humanoid with wings, a prehensile tail and oily skin. Benna, on the other hand, has prehensile hair that she can control; she can extend it out as a set of wing-like appendages to slow her fall or extend it out as a limb to move and manipulate objects, but is flammable as hair is. In the end, both have the same functions but are substantially different in looks and flavor.| What do people think of this? Is it fun? Is it balanced? How does it fair compared to the previous draft? Give me your inputs in the comments below. Extra Points: Roll up your own Barbaroi, then flavor him or her up in any way you want to."
66,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Sorcerous Origin: Wild Magic (revised),1,9xtfq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/9xtfq3/sorcerous_origin_wild_magic_revised/,2018-11-17 15:15:10,"It's your favorite Sorcerer fanatic, Specs, this time with a slight tweak to a preexisting origin. The Wild Mage is such a cool and unique archetype, but in 5e it's got some bizarre design choices that reduce it's effectiveness and appeal. My first course of action was to shift control of the character from the DM to the player. Some might argue that the class loses some it's whimsicality as a result, but I've noticed a very common trend where Wild Magic Surge is regarded as a rare ability, only to be used every once in a while. As a result, tons of well meaning DMs accidentally butcher the Wild Mage and make it ineffective at it's role (blasting and insanity) by limiting it's main feature. This revision avoids that issue entirely while still leaving some DM control to prevent players from cheesing the system by spamming spells to regain Tides of Chaos by surging in a controlled environment. The other big problem I have with the subclass is the surges themselves. Some of them have really neat effects, but others are real head scratchers, or just boring. Who in their right mind thought that a self-fireball at level 1, however small the odds, was even remotely a good idea??? For some this is just part of the fun, but for myself it's ludicrous that something that could destroy your entire party so utterly would even be considered. This new surge table retains much of the silliness of the old, but almost entirely removes the potential for anti-climatic self destruction while also ramping up the randomness factor. Also, many of the more flavorful surges have greatly increased time limits to encourage more interesting role play. Generally speaking, I'd say a few of the effects are stronger than before, but that includes the good and bad ones so I think it's still fairly balanced. Lastly, I gave Spell Bombardment a more satisfying punch, since it's previous effect was extremely underwhelming. Anything not listed was untouched, as I think that the class is actually highly effective in it's other abilities. Without further ado, here is my revision: **Wild Magic Surge** Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, the you roll a d20. In rare circumstances, the DM may have you forgo the roll in favor of avoiding a surge or forcing one. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table (at the end of the subclass description) to create a random magical effect. A Wild Magic Surge can happen once per turn. (note: Some surges require additional die rolls to determine the effect. In this case, the DM rolls that die in secret) If a Wild Magic effect is a spell, it's too wild to be affected by Metamagic. If it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration. **Tides of Chaos** Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, your Wild Magic Surge feature activates on any roll equal to or less than 10 + your charisma modifier (minimum of 0). You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again. If you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table any time before you regain the use of this feature, then you then regain the use of this feature. **Spell Bombardment** Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use this feature thrice per turn. &amp;#x200B; |d100|Effect| |:-|:-| |1-2|Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, rerolling this result on subsequent rolls.| |3-4|You regain all expended sorcery points.| |5-6|You cast blindness/deafness on yourself with both effects, automatically failing the saving throw.| |7-8|You cast fireball as an Xth-level spell centered on yourself, where X is the highest level of spell you can cast.

67,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,[Roguish Archetype] Trick Archer,1,9yriro,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/9yriro/roguish_archetype_trick_archer/,2018-11-20 22:56:24,"Trick Archers are mostly thieves, known for using gadgets in conjunction with their bows. Trick archery is a rare art among rogues, as it takes alot of know-how and skill with gadgetry to create effective trick arrows. However, any successful trick archer will tell you the pay off is quite worth the hard work. ##*Trick Arrows* You learn how to use 2 special trick arrows, you can only use one arrow per attack. You learn how to use one additional trick arrow of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn how to use new trick arrows, you can also replace one trick arrow you know with a different one. ##*Finesse Dice* You start with four finesse dice, which are d6s, and you expend one whenever you use a trick arrow. You regain half of your finesse dice rounded up during a short rest, or all when you finish a long rest. You gain another finesse die at 7th level and one more at 15th level. ###Saving Throws Some of your trick arrows require your target to make a saving throw to resist the arrow's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: Trick Arrow save DC: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier ##*Bonus Proficiencies* Also at level 3, you gain proficiency in acrobatics and tinkers tools. Additionally, you can add double your proficiency bonus to tinkers tools checks through your Expertise Rogue feature. ##*Improved Combat Finesse* At level 9 your finesse die becomes a d8, when you reach level 15 it becomes a d10. ##*Marksmanship* At level 13 you may choose one of the following features: - When you make an attack with a Trick Arrow, you can use your bonus action to immediately make an attack against any creature within range. - When you make an attack with trick arrow on a creature and it hits, you and your allies gain advantage on all attack rolls against that creature until the beginning of your next turn. - When you make an attack with a trick arrow and it lets you add your Trick Dice roll to the attack, you may add double the result of the roll to the attack. ##*Quick Cunning* At level 17, whenever a creature makes a saving throw against one of your trick arrow effects, you can expend an additional finesse die to force the creature to roll at disadvantage. ##*Trick Arrows* ###Wire Arrow You can fire an arrow that splits into two, with a wire in between each half. On a hit, you add the finesse die to the attack's damage roll and they must make a Strength saving throw or be restrained. They may make the saving throw again at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. ###Grappling Arrow You can fire an arrow with a grappling hook and rope attached to it. This rope has a length of 40 feet and can hold up to 300 pounds of weight. If you choose to attack a creature, then on a hit, you add the finesse die to the attack's damage roll and they must make a Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 40 feet in your direction. ###Firecracker Arrow As a bonus action, you can fire an arrow with a small explosive attached to it anywhere within 30 feet of you. Creatures within a 10 foot area centered on where you fired the arrow must make a Constitution save or they cannot take reactions and have disadvantage on perception checks until the end of your turn. ###Oil Slick Arrow As an action, you can fire an arrow with a glass vial of oil slick onto an area within 60 feet. This oil covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into difficult terrain. When the oil appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. If this oil is set alight via a fire arrow or fire based spell, creatures within the oil slick that fail their dexterity save also take 2d6 fire damage, or half damage on a successful save. ###Fire Arrow You can fire an arrow covered in wrappings and oil thats lit on fire. On a hit, you add the finesse die to the attack's damage roll as fire damage, and the creature must make a Dexterity save or be set on fire, taking the fire damage again at the end of its turn for 3 turns. They may make the saving throw again at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. Additionally, you can instead shoot this arrow at an oil slick you created, you automatically succeed on this attack, setting it alight. ###Blunt Arrow You can fire an arrow with a blunted tip. On a hit, you add the finesse die to the attack's damage roll, and the damage from the attack becomes bludgeoning damage. A creature hit with this attack must make a constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. They may make the saving throw again at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. ###Noise Arrow You can fire an arrow that makes a piercing loud screeching noise. You fire an arrow at an area within range, creatures within a 20 foot area must make a constitution save or take thunder damage equal to double your finesse die roll and become deafened for 1 minute. This noise is heard from up to 1 mile away. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not deafened. They may make the saving throw again at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. ###Glue Arrow You can fire an arrow tipped with a canister of sticky adhesive. On a hit, you add the finesse die to the attack's damage roll and the creature and others within 5 feet of it must make a strength saving throw or their arms are glued together, preventing them from performing the somatic compontents for spells, and have disadvantage on attack rolls towards other creatures. They may make the saving throw again at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. ###Water Arrow You can fire an arrow that has a small jar of water attached to the tip. This arrow can be used to extinguish nonmagical fires that are within the size of 5 square feet. On a hit, you add the finesse die to the attack's damage roll, the creature also has vulnerability to lightning damage and resistance to fire damage. ###Gas Arrow You may fire an arrow that has a canister of noxious gas at the tip. Choose a point within 60 feet, and roll your finesse die. Creatures within 20 feet centered on that point must make a constitution save or they start coughing violently, taking poison equal to the roll of your finesse die, and having disadvantage on all attribute checks."

The following if for a traumatized Oath of Vengeance Paladin who was once the captain of a group of hometown boys that were all mercilessly slaughtered by a mean old wizard, and their ghosts haunt him. Some more than others. The plan is during and encounter whenever he is hit by a critical or the first arcane spell cast or when he is dropped to zero one of the spirits has a chance to leak out and influence the battlefield. So he has to roll a Charisma Concentration check. If he succeeds he gains control and can decide whether or not to use the ability; if he fails the check, the ability goes off but in a way that may or may not be entirely useful. &amp;#x200B; Any input is welcome especially if there are glaring problems that jump out to anyone. I've told my players that these kinds of abilities may need to be tweaked or overhauled depending on how they play. &amp;#x200B; *The options below are a tweaking and aggregation of Wizards of the Coast products and the various components may be found in the Player's Handbook and Xanathar's Guide to Everything. The only thing I came up with is the interactions between the various ideas, not the ideas themselves*. &amp;#x200B; **Ghost Friends** ***Triggering conditions***: first time the character is struck by an arcane spell in combat, each time he is critically hit, and when he is dropped to 0 hit points. This occurs as a reaction. ***Mechanic***: as a reaction, whenever he is dropped to zero hit points or receives a critical hit or the first time you are struck with an arcane spell in combat, roll a d4 and reference the appropriate table, then roll a Concentration save ( using a situationally determined attribute, commonly Charisma, DC 10 or half damage whichever is higher) if passed the ability acts as he would like and he has control over whether or not to use it, however it is a use it or lose it you cannot hold on to the power and use at a later time. If the concentration save is failed the effect acts in a different way from fizzling to effecting everyone, and the character has no control over its use. **Dropping to Zero** Effect 1. Reckless Attack 2. Preserve Life 3. Second Wind 4. Strength of the Grave **On a Critical Hit or First Arcane Spell to hit you in combat** Effect 1. Fey Presence 2. Abjuration Ward 3. Path to the Grave 4. Radiance of the Dawn &amp;#x200B; **Specific interactions:** ***Reckless Attack***: The character can make one Strength based melee weapon attack at advantage as a reaction. On a failed Concentration save he still makes the attack but he automatically fails one death save from the exertion. On a successful save he drops to zero and makes death saves as per normal. ***Preserve Life:*** As a reaction, a nova of healing energy springs from the character that can restore a number of healing points equal to five times character level. On a successful save, choose any number of creatures within 30 feet of the character (including himself) and divide the hit points among them, except for undead and constructs. On a failed save, all creatures (himself, friendly, enemy and neutral) within 30 feet of the character receive the hit points evenly divided among themselves. This includes undead, who are damaged by the positive energy receiving the equivalent in radiant damage and which are normally not considered viable targets for this feature. This does not heal constructs. Any healing provided by this feature cannot exceed half of the creatures max hit point value. ***Second Wind***: As a reaction, on a successful save the character can gain 1d10 + character level hit points. On a failed, save the character gains nothing. ***Strength of the Grave***: on a successful concentration saving throw the character drops to 1 hit point instead of 0, on a failed save the character drops to 0. ***Fey Presence***: As a reaction, on a successful save the character may choose any number of creatures in a 10ft radius centered on him. They must succeed a Wisdom saving throw versus the character's spell save DC or be frightened until the end of his next turn. If he fails his initial concentration save every creature with in 10ft must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of his next turn ***Arcane Ward***: As a reaction, on a successful save, the character creates a magical ward that lasts until he finishes a long rest. The ward has a hit point maximum equal to twice the character's level + CHA mod. Whenever the character could take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. When the ward drops to 0 hp, the character takes any remaining damage. The wards hp total may not be recovered in anyway until the character completes a long rest. This ward may be interposed after the attack that triggered it but before calculating the damage. ***Path of the Grave***: On a successful save, the character may use his reaction to choose one creature he can see with in 30 feet, cursing it until the end of his next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack the creature has vulnerability to all of that attacks damage and then the curse ends. On a failed save, a creature (including allies) within 30 feet of you is chosen at random. The next attack that it receives that creature has vulnerability to all the attacks damage and then the curse ends. ***Radiance of the Dawn***: As a reaction, a nova of holy light springs from you, dispelling any magical darkness within 30 feet of the character. On a successful save, each hostile creature within 30 feet must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 + character level radiant damage on a failed saving throw and half as much on a successful one. If the character fails the initial concentration saving throw all creatures (friend, foe and neutral) within 30 feet must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 + character level radiant damage on a failed saving throw and half as much on a successful one. DC is the the characters spell save DC. A creature behind total cover is not affected. *Note for the above*: in all cases except the arcane ward the damage from the triggering attack is applied before the effect goes off. &amp;#x200B; ***Curtailment***: the character will be locked out of the Lay on Hands ability for the duration of the encounter once this ability is used. Also each spirits gift may only be used once per long rest. So if you roll in reaction to a particular action and you've already used that power, I guess he's up the creek, or should I allow one reroll? &amp;#x200B; ***Requirement***: each character that you get an ability from will require a backstory in regards to how they relate to you, commensurate with the reason they have the ability."

71,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Way of the Intercepting Fist v1.7/Way of the Patient Fist,1,a4copr,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/a4copr/way_of_the_intercepting_fist_v17way_of_the/,2018-12-09 04:38:13,"Ok, so a while ago I posted my attempt at a homebrew Monk subclass. After some tinkering and reflavoring, here is my current version. For those of you who have seen the previous versions of this class, it is still a mix of Battle Master, Inquisitive, and Cobalt Soul. Focusing on deflecting and countering attacks while learning an opponents weaknesses. Also, if anyone wants to help tweak the flavor text as well, that would also be great. I originally based it off of Jeet Kune Do, but I decided to simplify it so I wasnt bogged down with just trying to duplicate what Bruce Lee does. Let me know what yall think. Way of the Patient Fist While most combatants charge headfirst into a fight, monks who study the Way of the Patient Fist take a more defensive approach to combat. Rather than immediately attacking opponents, monks of the Patient Fist spend their time deflecting the attacks of their foes and studying their weaknesses. While some would consider this style to be passive when compared to others, those who have fought with practitioners of this style liken the experience of fighting them to a hurricane. Always calm and relaxed, when a monk of this style finally does attack, the result is a devastating strike that seems to bypass all defenses of the target. Dirty fighting Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd leveI, you learn strike at your enemys weakest points and leave them more vulnerable to follow up attacks. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target: It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be blinded. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be deafened. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be unable to speak or cast spells with verbal components. Deflect Strikes Additionally at 3rd leveI, you can use your reaction to parry when you are hit by a melee weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk leveI. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can spend 1 ki point to make a melee attack with a monk weapon or your martial arts as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency. At 6th level, you may use this feature on spell attacks if they have a melee or projectile component. Alternatively, you can spend a ki point to roll your martial arts die and add that to the total damage reduced. If you do so, you may not make an attack in addition. Relaxed stance Starting at 6th level, youve learned that a relaxed body reacts faster than a tense one. You can take a number of additional reactions each round equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum of 1), at the cost of 1 ki point per reaction beyond the first. You can use multiple reactions per trigger, as long as they are not the same reaction. (E.X. You may use Improved Deflection multiple times in response to each attack from a multi attack if you have enough Ki, but you may not use it twice on a single attack). At 11th level, these reactions become second nature to you, and you no longer need to spend Ki points to use them. Read opponent At 6th level, your study of ki has allowed you to become more aware of your opponents. This awareness allows you to observe fine details about your opponent and potentially discover their weaknesses. As a bonus action, you can select a target you are aware of that isnt incapacitated and make a Wisdom (Insight), contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your Ki save DC is higher than your Insight roll, you may use that total instead. On a failure, you learn two aspects about the target of your choice: * Creature Type * Armor Class * Extra senses * Remaining hit points * Damage Vulnerabilities * Damage Resistances * Damage Immunities * Condition Immunities * Condition resistances * Condition vulnerabilities * Class levels (If any) * Conditions it may have * Attacks it can make You know if the target succeeded or failed on their saving throw. Upon reaching 11th level, if the target fails their saving throw, you can choose four aspects to learn and six aspects at 17th level. Alternatively you may use this feature without a check if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with the target outside of combat. Opportune counter Beginning at 11th level, your relaxed muscles and study of your foe allows you to use their failure to your advantage. If a creature misses you with an attack, you can immediately use your reaction to perform one of the following: You may make a melee attack or ranged attack, against that target with advantage. If they are within melee range, you may use your Extra Attack feature with this ability. Alternatively, if they are within melee range you may make two attempts to shove them, knock them prone, or grapple them. These actions are not made with advantage. You may cause the attack to hit one target of your choice, other than the attacker, that you are aware of within 5 feet of you. If the attack has the Reach property, you may select a target 10 ft away. Crippling blow Upon reaching 17th level, you learn to put your full weight behind your attacks to devastating effect. Once per turn when you hit a single target with at least one attack, you can spend 3 ki points to give the creature disadvantage to their attack rolls until the end of your next turn, and they must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature suffers one of the following effects for 1 minute or until they regain hit points in any way. * They have disadvantage on their attack rolls and saving throws. * They have vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. * Their speed is reduced by half, this extends to all physical forms of movement. In addition, they must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw after using the Dash action. If they fail the save, they fall prone. * If they attempt an action in combat, they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they lose their action and can't use reactions until the start of their next turn. "

Surtr is foretold as being a major figure during the events of Ragnark; carrying his bright sword, he will go to battle against the sir, he will do battle with the major god Freyr, and afterward the flames that he brings forth will engulf the Earth. He is stationed guarding the frontier of the fiery realm Mspell, that he will lead ""Mspell's sons"" to Ragnark, and that he will defeat Freyr. In the poem Vlusp, a vlva divulges information to the god Odin. The vlva says that, during Ragnark, Surtr will come from the south with flames, carrying a very bright sword Size Huge CT Giant Alignment CE Rating 30 AC 29 Hp 1100 (1000+ 2d100) Sp 50 ft Str 30 Dex 7 Con 27 Int 14 Wis 17 Cha 16 Saving Throws: Strength, Constisution Skills: Athletics (+19), Intimidation (+12), Perception (+12) Cond Immu: Blinded, Charmed, Frightened, Grappled, Petrified Dmg Vulnerability: Cold, Thunder and Blunt. Dmg Resistances: Slashing Dmg Immu: Fire, Non-Magical Language: Giant, Common &amp;#x200B; **Aggressive:** As a bonus action, the creature can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature it can see. **Avoidance:** If Surtr is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to only take half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. **Bitflame:** The ground in a 10 ft radius around Surtrs feet is difficult terrain. Any magical surface Surtr walks on breaks after he steps off (if it is possible). **Burn Bright:** Surtr casts bright light in a 30 ft radius and dim light up to 70 ft. Surtr is at disadvantage for stealth rolls. **Fear of Ragnarok:** Each creature Surtr chooses (that can hear or see him) must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened for 1 minute. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this effect for 10 rounds. **Heated Body:** Touching or hitting Surtr while within 10 ft. of him causes 1d4 fire damage. **Legendary Resistance (4/day):** If Surtr fails a saving throw he can choose to succeed instead. **Martial Mayhem:** Surtr can deal extra damage (1d4) to a creature it hits if he is with in 20 ft. of a Fire Giant that isn't incapacitated. **Pack Tactics:** Surtr has advantage on an attack roll against creatures if at least one of Surtr's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated. &amp;#x200B; **Surtrs Blade** Requires Attunement. Heavy, Two Handed, Reach, Magical. 25 lb. You gain a +3 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with this Magic Weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores Resistance to slashing damage and Hit Points lost to this weapons damage can be regained only through a short or Long Rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means. When you Attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the Attack roll, that target takes an extra 2d6 slashing and fire damage and you cut off one of the creature's heads cauterizing it (to prevent regeneration). The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, is a God or Goddess, or the DM decides that the creature cannot have its head cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 3d8 slashing and fire damage from the hit. When you hit a creature with an Attack using this Magic Weapon, you can burn the target. At the start of each of the burning creatures turns, it takes 1d6 fire damage, and it can then use its action to put out the flames by rolling (ending prone), ending the effect of all burning on itself on a success. Alternatively, the burning creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to smother the flames with water or another substance, ending the effect on it on a success. Additionally, all creatures within 5ft of the target take half the rolled burn damage (rounded up) each turn. &amp;#x200B; ***Legendary Actions*** Surtr can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only on legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. Surtr regains spent legendary actions at the start of each turn. Attack (Costs 2 Actions): Surtr makes a melee attack with his blade. Tectonic Shift: A tremor shakes the ground in a 60-foot radius around Surtr. Each creature other than Surtr on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. &amp;#x200B; ***Lair Actions*** On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Surtr takes a lair action to cause one of the following affects; Surtr cant use the same effect two rounds in a row: **Eruption:** Magma erupts from a point on the ground Surtr can see within 60 feet of it, creating a 40-foot-high, 10-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geysers area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (9d6) fire and force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one as well as applicable fall damage **Pits of Mspell:** Surtr may command the the rocky earth to crumble as lava spills to the surface in a 50 ft. radius from him. All items in the radius are burned. Any character in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) saving throw or fall into the lava taking 9d6 fire damage. Creatures may use their action to make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to escape the lava. All movement by any creature without fire immunity needs to be made with a DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to avoid falling in the lava. On the next initiative the ground swells closed and all creatures in the lava become Restrained. Restrained creatures may make a DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check to break open the ground and climb out. Alternatively they may wait until Pits of Mspell is activated again. All Ground affected by this effect is difficult terrain for 1d6 rounds (stacking). The ground remains crumbled with lava if the counter is above 12 rounds and the ground is lava if above 20 rounds. **Sauna:** A hot mist sprays from fissures in the ground covering a 50x50x35ft area (lwh). All breathing creatures move at half speed while in the mist and the area is heavily obscured. The mist disperses after 4 (2d4) rounds (stacking). Creatures in the mist (except those with fire immunity) take 2 (1d4) choking damage. If the choking damage exceeds its constitution before exiting the mist (or it disperses), the creature falls prone and must make death saves until then."

I like the necromancer wizard, but started to wonder what sort of RP potential making it a sorcerer origin could lead to... and results were delightfully horrifying. The reaper is cursed with an inescapable affinity for death. They can consume and corrupt the life force of dead creatures and can create undead minions that, while less damaging and not as mass produced as a necromancers, are much more resistant to being incapacitated and can be created in an instant. I would greatly appreciate comments related to clarity and balance! **Sorcerous Origin: Reaper** You are a creature of death. Ever since you can remember, youve always had an eerie affinity for it. Most creatures wont realize what you are outright, but will often sense something off about you. At some point in your life, this affinity culminated in a horrific event that awakened your awareness to the inescapable magic within. You may roll on the table to decide the event, or come up with one yourself. 1. In a moment of anger, your magic ripped the moisture out of another creatures body, causing it to crumble in a dried husk. 2. In a moment of grief at the loss of a loved one, your sorrow re-animated their corpse as a hostile zombie. 3. In a moment of terror, grievous magical self inflicted wounds mutilated your body. 4. In a moment of anguish, your body convulsed with necrotic energy that caused all the life around you to wane. 5. In a moment of joy, you suddenly felt the icy grip of death pull you into a horrific nightmare that is forever burned into your memory. 6. In a moment of vulnerability, someone close to you saw into your soul and has treated you like a demon ever since Many of these sorcerers will try to fight against the death that permeates their existence, but as with death itself, escape is ultimately impossible... **Grim Magic** Starting at 1st level, when your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can alternatively choose any spell from the school of necromancy. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you. You also gain the following spells at the following sorcerer levels: 5th: Animate Dead 11th: Create Undead These spells do not count against your spells known, count as sorcerer spells for you, and cannot be removed from your spells known by any means. **Life and Death** Starting at 1st level, you are imbued with a degree of control over the life force of dying creatures. As a reaction to a creature that isnt a construct or undead dying within 60 feet of you, you can absorb that creatures dying life force to gain hit points equal to your sorcerer level + your proficiency bonus, or grant another creature within 60 feet of you with the same benefit. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your charisma modifier per long rest. **Unearthly Resistance** At 6th level, any undead you create may use your own intelligence, wisdom, and charisma for saves over their own. Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, its hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your sorcerer level. Additionally, you gain resistance to necrotic damage. **Defile** Starting at 14th level, when using your Life and Death feature, you gain a second possible use: You may corrupt the life force to cast Animate Dead on the corpse instantaneously, without expending a spell slot and expending 4 sorcery points. **Aura of Death** At 18th level, you can radiate your decaying magic all round you. As an action you spend 6 sorcery points to radiate an aura of death centered on you out to a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. This aura is clearly visible as a pale green mist covering the ground. While the aura is active, any creature that starts its turn in the aura or enters it for the first time takes necrotic, poison, or psychic damage (choose the damage type when you create the aura) equal to your charisma modifier. When you first create the aura, you may choose any number of undead and 5 additional creatures not to be affected by it for the duration. Nonmagical plants in the aura slowly wither and die. Additionally, any undead under your control gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls equal to your charisma modifier while within the aura."

Not only are they the ""weakest"" of the dragons, their piss-poor charisma coupled with their ""primal"" savagery makes them too dumb to be reasonable spellcasters. Well, screw that. Wisdom is a casting stat, and the Druidic arts is as primal as they get. So, here's a template for an Adult White Dragon that is a Circle of the Land (Arctic) druid. As an Adult, it is a 12th-level, but if you wished to scale it up to Ancient, just make it an 18th-level Druid. Remember, adding class-levels adds additional Hit Die to a creature (pg. 283 DMG), so an Ancient 18th-level druid White Dragon would have (36d20 + 144) Hit Points, 522 on average, which is significantly beefier than a normal Ancient White Dragon. Keep that in mind before throwing it at your party. **Adult White Dragon - 12th level Arctic Druid** *Huge dragon, chaotic evil* **Armour Class:** 18 (natural armour) **Hit Points:** 278 (28d12 + 96) **Speed:** 40 ft., burrow 30 ft., fly 80 ft., swim 40 ft. &amp;#x200B; |**STR**|**DEX**|**CON**|**INT**|**WIS**|**CHA**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |22 (+6)|10 (+0)|22 (+6)|8 (-2)|19 (+4)|12 (+1)| **Saving Throws:** DEX +5, CON +11, WIS +9, CHA +6 **Skills:** Perception +14, Stealth +5 **Damage Immunities:** Cold; Poison + Disease (Circle of the Land Druid) **Senses:** Blindsight 60 ft., Darkvision 120 ft., Passive Perception 24 **Languages:** Common, Draconic **Challenge:** 13 (10,000 XP) ## Traits: **Ice Walk:** The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement. **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. **Innate Spellcasting:** The dragons innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). The dragons Innate Spells are cast at the highest Spell level which the dragon can innately cast (4th-level). The dragon can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 1/ day each: *greater invisibility* **Spellcasting:** The dragon is a 12th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It requires no material components to cast its spells. It has the following druid spells prepared: * Cantrips (at will): *druidcraft*, *mending*, *poison spray*, *shape water*, *frostbite* * 1st level (4 slots): *cure wounds*, *fog cloud*, *faerie fire*, *thunderwave* * 2nd level (3 slots): **spike growth**, **hold person**, *heat metal*, *gust of wind* * 3rd level (3 slots): **sleet storm**, **slow**, *dispel magic*, *daylight*, *water breathing* * 4th level (3 slots): **freedom of movement**, **ice storm**, *polymorph*, *locate creature*, *blight*, *wall of fire* * 5th level (2 slots): **commune with nature**, **cone of cold**, *insect plague*, *tree stride* * 6th level (1 slot): *heal*, *bones of the earth*, *investiture of flame* ## Actions: **Multiattack:** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. **Bite:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* \+11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) cold damage. **Claw:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* \+11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage. **Tail:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* \+11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. **Frightful Presence:** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. **Cold Breath (Recharge 56):** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. ## Legendary Actions: The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. **Detect:** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check. **Tail Attack:** The dragon makes a tail attack. **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed. **Cold Breath (Costs 3 Actions):** The dragon recharges its Cold Breath and uses it. **Cast Spell (Costs 1-3 Actions):** The dragon uses a spell slot to cast a 1^(st)\-, 2^(nd)\-, or 3^(rd)\-level spell that it has prepared. Doing so costs 1 legendary action per level of the spell. ## Lair Actions: On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon cant use the same effect two rounds in a row: * Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies. * Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage. * The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the walls space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies."
77,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,...where I intended to get the players to think about which weapon they're going to use and why.,1,9v0i18,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/9v0i18/where_i_intended_to_get_the_players_to_think/,2018-11-08 02:45:09,"Just thought I'd share. I'm curious about some feedback, not about how horribly long this will additionally make combat, but if this would be a glaring break in balance would be appreciated. I think it's fairly common, right? You make a character, and you choose a weapon that's the biggest damage dealer - that's your primary weapon. And what does it mean to be your primary weapon? It's your go-to, there's no reason to ever pull another unless it's got some magical property, or your DM hinders your use of it - you lose it or break it or circumstance prevents it. But 99% of the time, you're pulling out ol' trusty, and that's what you're hitting the baddie with. We call this ""build optimization."" Well that's boring, isn't it? I mean, why would you ever use a dagger in any other circumstance? We all know that there are creatures that have resistance or vulnerability to certain attack types, but they're rare, rarer in 5e than before, and that's a lot of detail easily missed or dismissed. And that whole angle is moot if you're fighting baddies of the common races. MAYBE you have an amazing player group who are detail oriented and true to reasonable and common sense, maybe you as DM keep your players intellectually honest, but frankly, that's a lot of detail, and a lot of work, and it's hard to justify. And what I'm getting at is there's no rule mechanical necessity to do so. You can get backstabbed with a short sword just as well if not better than a dagger, without consequence... I want to change that. I want to give the players a reason to drop ol' trusty in favor of an otherwise inferior weapon because an alternative is actually a better choice under the circumstances. So I googled, and I found an old post around here that referenced \[this\]([URL table. Well, that's a start. The basic idea is that armor has different ratings against different weapon types. This gives the players the impetus to assess their foe and pick a better weapon from their inventory, should they have one. Chain mail and chain shirts have their highest defense against slashing, but are weakest against bludgeoning and piercing. Time to sheath the sword and pull out the dagger. You may not hit for as much but you're more likely to hit all. You could reduce the table further and go by armor type, but I think that's a bit too coarse grain. This keeps the weapon and armor tables fairly simple, because a matrix of every weapon interaction with every armor is far too complicated, and D&amp;D is slow enough, never mind what I'm suggesting here. But weapons can have exceptions, and indeed they should. From my understanding, a falchion is a family of cutting swords that might be considered glorified cleavers or machetes - long, thin, and sharper than most other swords would necessarily be; you can cut with a kitchen knife or a scalpel, but one is far sharper than the other, right? I would give a falchion an advantage vs. padded - no need for number adjustments because this isn't 3e and numeric adjustment is reserved for magic weapons. Since I'm on the topic of getting players to think about their weapons package based on the mission ahead or combat at hand, the halberd and the glaive - if I recall, and I don't have the PHB in front of me, they both have the exact same stats. WTF, man? Fine - I think it's the glaive? I get the two mixed up all the time, but one has a hook and I believe historically was used to dismount horsemen. Cool! So a successful attack of a mounted combatant comes with a free grapple check or opposed strength check vs. dismount! Speaking of horsemen, scimitars were popular, I forget the reason why. Advantage while mounted? Is anyone else surprised the Great Sword isn't a pole arm? It wasn't just a bigger bastard sword, it isn't a buster sword like in FF or Exalted... The thing was a reach weapon with a huge cross guard. It was shoved more than it was swung. I digress. I also like pole arms, they were a significant weapon on the battle field - most soldiers carried spears. I would make a slight change to AoO - again, I don't have the PHB in front of me, so maybe this is already true: a successful hit would prevent further movement into the threatened area. As I recall, you walk into range of a pole arm, the PC can use their reaction to stab you, but you can keep advancing right up to their face and attack them back. Pole arms historically made an intimidating wall that was difficult to get past - you either managed to not get stabbed and (initially) advanced past the point, or you were kept out. This makes the advancing enemy have to reconsider the full-frontal assault. A wall of pole arms held by the PCs would be formidable indeed, especially where there is overlap in threatened area. This would make the most sense if you employed facing rules (which adds a lot of overhead cost - yeah I know, but this is just a house rule exercise), so flanking suddenly becomes important, and now a party being literally surrounded leads to the classic ""circle the wagons"" stance, the party members back to back. How exciting! And of course, since you (typically) get only one reaction, you can be overwhelmed by superior numbers, which is a reasonable strategy indeed. My final thought is about the lance. I've played D&amp;D since AD&amp;D, and not once have I ever seen or had a player exercise mounted combat. What made English calvary utterly terrifying was that A) you might get a pointed tree trunk rammed through your chest, and B) you're probably going to get trampled to death by a wall of horses. What does the PHB say about mounts and lances? I don't think it says much. I would add that a hit from a lance incurs a strength check vs. being knocked prone. Then you have the horse that gets to roll a trample attack against you as you get ran over. If it's terrifying, if it stands a good chance of instantly killing the enemy, it should. But this isn't Nethack, no one brings their mighty steed down into the dungeon. Hopefully. So it's not that abusive. And of course you need the space to get up to speed, to stop the horse, to turn around... And if you miss your target, they get a reaction to cleave the legs right off the horse, or pull you down with a... is it the glaive?"
78,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Druid: Circle of the Volcano V1.0,3,9gfdv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/9gfdv9/druid_circle_of_the_volcano_v10/,2018-09-17 09:49:46,"Natural processes go beyond beast and tree and plant, they exist in the movement of rock. The formation of mountains and the currents of the mantle well below our feet. The idea behind this subclass was a Druid that focussed on these much slower and deeper processes, and how they might look. It was also borne out of a conversation that a Dwarven Druid mightnt fit in a society centred on mining and forging, unless they were rather different. So here is version 1.0, opinions and feedback very much valued, Ive tried to balance it with the other subclasses as much as possible! (As a first point, Im not sure whether to keep the additional spells...) =========================== **Circle of the Volcano** Druids of the Circle of the Volcano favour the destructive and creative processes found in the most explosive natural occurrences. While other Druids may favour forests and prairies, Volcanic Circle druids feel at home in deep caverns by magma lakes, or on the slopes of a volcano, dormant or otherwise. For them, nature calls to them in the slow steady rhythms of tectonic movements or the explosive power of an eruption. They like to keep their feet on solid ground, because it is with the earth itself they feel a kinship. **Volcanic Circle Spells** At 2nd level, you learn either the Produce Flame or Mold Earth cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of the Volcano Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. Druid Level Circle Spells 3rd *Maximillians Earthen Grasp* 5th *Meld into Stone* 7th *Stoneshape* 9th *Creation* **Volcanic Fury** You understand the power of a sudden outburst to affect much needed change. Starting at 2nd level, you gain a pool of d8s equal to half your Druid level. You can expend any number of these while making an attack, or casting a spell targeting a single creature. When you do so, roll the die and add that amount of fire or bludgeoning damage to any damage taken. If the spell causes the target to take  damage on a successful save, this additional damage is included before the damage is halved. **Natural Forge** Your affinity with the earth beneath has given you an appreciation of the metals it stirs at its core. At 6th level, you no longer shun metallic armour, seeing the earths strength dwelling within the forged work. However, any metallic armour you wear will gradually lose any polished sheen, taking on the appearance of dull rock with metallic fragments laced through it. Additionally, you gain the ability to forge your own weapon from the earth below. By spending 4 hours in a ritual, you can draw forth molten ore from the ground and shape it into a weapon of your choice. This weapon has the statistics of a quarterstaff, though it can take the shape of any simple or martial weapon, and uses your spellcasting attack modifier. In addition to bludgeoning damage it also deals 1d6 fire damage on a successful hit. If this weapon is removed more than 60ft from you it will crumble into stone dust and must be forged anew. Your Natural Forge weapon damage dice increase to d8 one handed/d10 two handed at level 10 and to d10 one handed/d12 two handed at level 14. **Earths Gift** Starting at 10th level, you can touch a metal or stone object and learn its history. You spend an amount of time concentrating on the object and can see and hear anything that happened within 5ft of it, know who or what it was touching, as well as understanding where it was in relation to where you found it. You can learn about 1 day of time for every minute spent concentrating, up to a maximum of one year, experiencing events at a sped-up rate. You can only use this with any given object once. Alternatively, you can touch a metallic weapon and empower it, tuning the forged metal to resonate with the earths presence below. For the next hour, all attacks made with this weapon will re-roll any 1s on damage dice. If the re-rolled value is also a 1, then roll again until it is not. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier, and all uses are regained after a long rest. **Molten Form** At 14th level, can use a wild shape charge to assume molten form for up to 10 minutes. In this form you take on the appearance of the surface of magma, appearing to be made of rock with a fiery core. While in this form you can still communicate, but normal Wild Shape rules apply for item use and spellcasting. + In your molten form you possess an AC equal to 15 + your constitution modifier, and you gain immunity to fire damage, along with resistance to non-magical piercing, bludgeoning or slashing damage. + You also gain vulnerability to cold damage. If you take cold damage in this form, your speed is reduced to 5ft until the end of your next turn. + You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice your druid level, but otherwise maintain your hit points before assuming this form. When you revert from this form, you do not regain any hit points lost while molten, nor do any of the temporary hit points carry over. If you fall to 0hp while in this form, you instead revert to your regular form with 5hp. + You use your own statistics for any saving throws or skill checks made while in this form. + While in this form, if you make an attack action, you choose any two of the three attacks listed below during your turn. You can choose an option more than once. An attack of opportunity as a reaction uses the Magma Punch attack. Attacks made in this form count as magical for the purposes of resistances, immunities and vulnerabilities. You cannot apply your Volcanic Fury dice while in this form. - Magma Punch: Make a melee attack with your spellcasting modifier. If it hits, target takes 2d12 fire damage and 1d12 bludgeoning damage. - Lava Throw: Make a ranged attack on a target up to 40ft away with your spellcasting modifier. If it hits, the target takes 3d8 fire damage. - Tectonic Shock: All creatures within 15ft radius of you must make a dex save against your druid spell save DC. If they fail, they take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. If they succeed, they take half damage and are not knocked prone."

81,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Community input for a 5e game mechanic,8,9j0oxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/9j0oxz/community_input_for_a_5e_game_mechanic/,2018-09-26 18:34:03,"Ive been working on a mechanic to add for my players who are all Melee based PCs, to make combat more tactical and dynamic. I would very much appreciate all feedback about my mechanics balance and usability, but on a more personal level if it is something that you as a DM or a PC would use in your own games. Thank you very much for your inputs. - background: Im currently running an all melee focused party with not a single spell caster element. The players wanted a dark, low fantasy world with semi-realistic combat; IE critical injuries like hands being removed from a battle. and additionally, the group are tactical war game enthusiasts so strategy and tactics are a favorite of theirs. With these all melee fighters they have, the suggestions came up to make individual combat more tactical instead of moving to an enemy and taking the attack action, heres what I have so far. - Game mechanic: stances - background explanation and reasoning: on its turn a creature and move up to its speed and take one action, a bonus action if available, and a free action. With all players being melee focused, boss fights would become everyone run to the one also melee oriented boss ( low fantasy), stand there and take the attack action, which they wanted to change up. So my thinking was if one of my players can run up to its speed every round (6 seconds), they could instead use that time saved from moving to focus on their technique when they got to their opponent ( when the fighter gets within weapon range of his opponent). - stances mechanic description: if a creature forgoes using its speed (flying or running), they may instead prepare their actions better and enhance them by entering a stance. Stances are the catch all term for a combination of footwork, posturing, quick strategic thinking and specialty weapon techniques done by a creature in the heat of battle. A stances effects start when they are first entered and last until the beginning of the creatures next turn. They can only be entered if the creature has not used its speed on its turn, so the turn after the fighter or barbarian has reached the fresh ogre and the 2 combatants are ready to start slugging at each other. - Basic stances usable by all creatures including monsters: 1. Guard: in world terms, this is the P.C or monster keeping their shield up, keeping their distance ( considering 2 squares together equals 10 ft long), and focusing on being able to dodge out of the way. - + 1 to AC, + 2 to checks on being knocked prone, forcibly moved, and saving throws against ranged spell attacks. - (-2) penalty to attack rolls of all types, and hostile creatures gain +2 to checks involving spells or actions due to the stance user Focusing on defense rather than attack. 2. Heavy attack: this is the creature throwing all their weight and power into the attack. - for melee and thrown attacks add either double your Dex or Str mod to the damage. - (-3) penalty to AC from opening yourself up from putting your force into the attack. 3. Focus: instead of necessarily hitting hard, a creature focuses on hitting a particular vulnerability in their opponents defense. - +2 to attack rolls/ target suffers a (-2) penalty to saving throws. Additionally, if a critical hit is scored while in this stance, the user may Pinpoint a specific point on the target (DMs) discretion. - the damage dice roll total is cut in half rounded up ( 1d8 longsword damage is rolled, 5 is rolled, dice roll damage is now 3, add all relevant modifiers.). - conclusion: stances are meant to give tactical players additional options, possibly giving a small but critical boost while also delivering penalties to consider when weighing options. In designing these, I wanted to make them a good option to use, but not necessary for play ( as in, no one would be penalized if they did not enter a stance every turn, just swinging away would still be viable). I hope these will give all characters, not just melee focused, a tactical option during combat along with the other stances for all classes Ive made. Also, if these are decent, I may include them in a for sale home brew I will release down the line for 5e SRD so I would greatly appreciate that mindset as well in your criticism. Thank you guys again, youre the best. "

I plan for each to have several minor and strong abilities, and at least one detrimental effect. This is not the whole suite of them, I have many more in the works but these are the ones I have properly written out in first-draft form. &amp;#x200B; \[Homebrewery link here\]([URL &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; #### Flame *Wondrous item, unique, very rare(requires attunement)* **A full length cloak of red silk with golden trim. It glows softly, resembling embers burning in the remains of a fire** As a bonus action you can cause this cloak to shed bright light out 20 feet, and dim light an additional 30 feet. The light persists until you dismiss it as a bonus action. If you enter a zone of magical darkness (as per the Darkness spell or similar) the light is dimmed, but persists as 5 feet of dim light around you. You may cast the cantrip *Produce Flame* at will This cloak has 5 charges, and regains 1d4+1 charges at dawn each day. You can expend one or more charges for the following effects: * One charge: Expend one charge as an action to gain resistance to cold damage for 2 hours * One charge: When you hit with a melee weapon attack you may expend one charge to deal an additional 2d8 fire damage to the target of your attack. You may only use this ability once per turn. * Two charges: You may cast the spell *burning hands* at second level, DC 17. * Five charges: As an action you may expend five charges to wreath yourself in flames for up to a minute, dealing 3d6 fire damage to any creature who begins its turn in or enters for the first time on its turn a space adjacent to you.

It is much heavier than it appears.** While wearing this cloak you gain +2 to your AC and strength saving throws, as well as resistance to slashing and piercing damage from non-magical weapons. You also have advantage on any saving throw or ability check to resist being displaced. You may cast the cantrip *Mold Earth* at will At the end of each of your turns, if you have not moved since the end of your previous turn, you gain an additional +2 to AC until the next time you move (willingly or not). Your movement speed is reduced by 10 feet while wearing this cloak. If you attempt to swim while wearing this cloak, you must succeed on a strength saving throw DC 17 or begin sinking at a rate of 40 feet per round.

You have sunlight sensitivity and vulnerability to radiant damage while wearing this cloak. #### #### Gale *Wondrous item, unique, very rare (requires attunement)* **This thin white cloak fades into a cloud-like translucence approaching the hem, and always appears to be blowing in a gentle wind regardless of the weather.** You gain +2 to AC against ranged attacks while wearing this cloak. You may cast the cantrip *Gust* at will. As a bonus action you may cause your voice to carry upon the wind, allowing anyone within a range up to 300 feet to hear you clearly. This cloak has five charges which recharge at dawn. You may expend charges for the following effects: * One charge: As a bonus action you may expend one charge to cast the spell *Zephyr Strike* * One charge: As an action you may expend one charge to gain a flying speed of 40 feet for up to 15 minutes or until you dismiss this effect * Two charges: You may expend two charges and take a minute to cast the spell *Wind Walk* with the following changes * The spell only targets yourself * For every additional charge you expend you may target one more willing creature (to a maximum of 4 including yourself, for 5 charges) * The spell lasts for 2 hours instead of 8 #### #### Light *Wondrous item, unique, very rare (requires attunement)* **This luxurious white cloak is threaded with strands of gold. Even in complete darkness it shines as though in direct sunlight.** You may cast the cantrips *Light* and *Dancing Lights* at will. If you cast *Light* targetting the cloak itself, it lasts until you dismiss it. This cloak has 5 charges and regains 1d4+1 charges at dawn. You may cast the following spells, expending one charge per spell level: *Faerie Fire*, *Moonbeam*, *Daylight*, *Beacon of Hope*. You may expend all five charges to cast *Sunbeam*.

83,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Class Idea: The Astral Knight,5,9cx2j0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/9cx2j0/class_idea_the_astral_knight/,2018-09-05 02:12:12,"URL So I saw this image (Okan by Johnathan Chong) floating about and I was inspired to make a class centred around conjuring animated swords, however I do not see myself having the time to fully develop it myself. It would have some sort of spellcasting, on lines with maybe a weaker Pact Magic or half casting. It's main ability is a pool of Animated Arcane Swords, which it can use in different ways depending on the Astral Practice subclass chosen (of which there are 4) The first is the Curser, which allows you to dissipate swords into people, giving them different effects based on the sword (paralyzed, curses, vulnerability, bane, reduced AC, etc.) The second is the Mage, which get more spell slots by using the swords up to cast the spells and more Astral Blessings (more on that later) Third is Shepherd, allowing the swords to be planted into the environment and used to create auras and bolts of energy, like a shaman's totems Fourth is Warrior, which get basic fighting progression abilities (Extra Attack, Fighting Style) and can telekinetically move the swords and wield them, even using their reactions to make more attacks with the swords. The image above would be of the Warrior. In addition, the class would receive Astral Blessings which act like Eldritch Invocations in a way but have 3 different branches that you can take blessings from as long as. The three branches are... Astral Form - similar to empty body thematically, having parts of the body gain astral form, such as the eyes gaining truesight or see invisibility, or a mage armor like thing Astral Movement - flying on top of swords, teleportation, etc Astral Mind - sensing through the swords, more spells, int/wis proficiencies These are just my ideas for the class. I'd love to see them developed and critiqued. In my world, the Astral Knights are the national security and secret weapon of a particular kingdom and so they are seen as powerful. Mechanically, they are most similar to Warlocks and Paladins with high customisability and versatility with a solid ability to be a fighter. It's the versatility, the various archetypes, and the setting context of them being a secret weapon that are mechanically foreign, even to the players, that makes this a class not a subclass for me"
84,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Spriglings; The Delicate Flower-Folk.,5,8yxmoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/8yxmoj/spriglings_the_delicate_flowerfolk/,2018-07-15 09:59:40,"# Sprigling Soft green flesh, big beautiful eyes, and bright petals in place of hair; no one can doubt the plant-like nature of the spriglings. # Tender Flowers Spriglings tend to live on the outside of civilization, deep in fey-enchanted woods, meadows or islands. They carve out small, idyllic grottoes filled with beautiful trees and flowers; oftentimes choosing places with a large amount of fey creatures. There they lounge in the sun, tend to their gardens, and enjoy themselves. If they do possess houses or structures these are usually only used to protect themselves from heavy rains and storms, or to avoid dangerous animals. Since many of these grottoes are led by powerful sprigling druids or are protected by fairies, these concerns are often a nonissue; leading many of the grottoes to seem simply like naturally occurring clearings (in forests) or stands of trees (in places like meadows,) rather than the dwelling place of a civilized race. Those that have had to fend off outside invaders, however, will often have barriers of wood or stone, as well as weapons; things that are very uncommon in most sprigling grottoes. # Encroaching Invaders Due to a sprigling's deep connection to plants and nature, they find the intrusion of other races to be a mild nuisance at best, and an abhorrent slaughter at worst. They work with the land to get what few things they need, causing as little damage as possible; when encountering outsiders, spriglings are usually appalled by the way they treat the surrounding land. Sprigling grottoes will usually try to warn the intruders away using any magical abilities they have or their fairy companions as threats if they don't possess weapons and other defenses, while the more well armed grottoes may either fight defensively, or simply attempt to wipe the intruders out. Depending on the nature and strength of the invaders, they may either leave the grotto alone, abandoning it to the spriglings, or they may simply kill and/or enslave all the spriglings (as best they can) and move on. Those that simply try to ignore or work around the grotto tend to run into trouble, as the spriglings, made aware of their presence, will constantly be attempting to make them leave; in some cases trying to wipe them out before they can do more damage to their home. # Spriglings in the Outside World While most spriglings live away from people in their wooded grottoes, many have ventured outside of their homelands. Some of them went willingly, driven by wanderlust or simple curiosity to see what else the world had to offer; however, many spriglings were forced to leave due to the destruction or loss of their home. Some had their grottoes attacked; those that survived either fled, were spared, or were enslaved. Others may have ended up becoming lost, either getting tricked by malevolent fairies or simply wandering too far into an unfamiliar area. However, most of the spriglings who live in the outside world are the descendants of these previous individuals, and many have fit in quite well in the wider world. While almost all feel at least a small connection to plants and to nature, you may come across the odd sprigling living in the heart of a metropolitan city. Many act as farmers, gardeners, or landscapers; while others use their intriguing and delicate appearance to great success as exotic dancers or escorts. And, sadly, in areas where slavery is legal you can find a few captured spriglings hanging on the arms of rich and powerful masters; in most places spriglings are praised by slave owners for their rarity and exoticism, and are shown off as trophies. # Sprigling Traits ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1. ***Age.*** Spriglings are naturally long-lived. They can usually live up to 600 years. ***Alignment.*** Spriglings grottoes generally prefer to just go with the flow, living lives of calm leisure. Spriglings tend towards neutrality. ***Size.*** Spriglings tend to stand between 5 and 6 feet in height, though they can be larger or smaller, and weigh between 60-100 lbs. Your size is Medium. ***Speed.*** Your speed is 30 ft. ***Floral Magic.*** You know the Druidcraft cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Goodberry once with this trait without expending material components, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the Barkskin spell once with this trait without expending material components, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. ***Day's Warmth, Night's Chill.*** While you need not fear the burning heat of the sun, you do need to worry about the chill of winter. You have resistance to Radiant damage, but you have vulnerability to Cold damage. ***Plant Physiology.*** You are counted as both a humanoid and a plant, and are affected by spells that effect either. ***Plant Speech.*** You can speak, somewhat, with plants. They can understand the meaning of your words, and they can communicate emotions and concepts to you. You have advantage on all Charisma checks you make to influence plants and plant-based creatures. You also have proficiency in the Nature skill. ***Photosynthesis.*** You can absorb energy from the sun instead of eating. As long as you spend at least 1 hour outside (whether it was in an overcast area or not,) you are considered fed for the day. If you spend at least 1 hour outside in the rain, then you are considered watered for the day. ***Languages.*** You know common and sylvan. #Edits: ***1:*** Removed the Rooted ability. "

It's a homebrew subclass for Matt Mercer's Blood Hunter Class (link below). My group is just starting a new campaign and whilst looking through the subclasses available I saw that there wasn't really anything I wanted to play. So I made one. The main theme of this subclass is shadows, and being a general sneaky person. Flavour text is still to come, I just wanted some feedback for the mechanics. After looking at it I'm worried that the 3rd level ability might be too overpowered, I was considering adding vulnerability to radiant damage but I'm not sure if this is enough. In addition to this I was considering swapping the 11th and 15th abilities, only because of the power levels of other Blood Hunter subclasses at those levels, the bad part about that is that Inescapable Fate feature references the level 7th one, and I think that they should be spread out in between. Anyway, I would appreciate any feedback you have for this. I will eventually be playtesting the class and will update it with flavour text soon. Thanks! Matt Mercer's Blood Hunter [URL"
86,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Some magical holidays,8,953gj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/953gj1/some_magical_holidays/,2018-08-07 03:48:42,"I'm working on magical holidays as a way to make the world, time, and religion more interesting in my world. I've got 8 months in my year and I'm working on at least 1 major holiday each month. These rituals only work on the specific holiday. I'd love feedback or suggestions especially if things seem overpowered or unclear. **The Dead Night (longest night)**  The longest night of the year is when the power of the dead is at its greatest and the greatest sacrifices may be made. At sunset you may swear an oath of vengeance against a creature and then kill yourself. At dawn you arise as a revenant with your sworn enemy as your target. If you die as a revenant your charisma score is reduced by 1. If your charisma score is reduced to 0 you do not rejuvenate. When you kill your target or at the dawn after the Dead Night you die. **The Gift to the Wind** - TBD need a wind themed idea here. **Slaughtering the Beast**  On this day Wild Beasts are all affected by the Enlarge spell. Killing an enlarged beast in single combat is seen as a sign of skill and hunting prowess. Killing an enlarged beast in single combat binds the animals spirit to your soul. For the remainder of the year you may shapeshift into the normal sized animals shape as though you had the druids wildshape ability. If the CR of the beast is less than your level divided by 3 (round down) you may shapeshift to the beasts form once per long rest otherwise you may shapeshift to the beasts form one per week. **Gemyndigurn**  On the day of memories it is possible to commune with the dead. By placing a bit of a persons bone into a pool of still water the soul of that person can be seen in the waters reflection. The reflected soul can see into the mortal realm and react to what it sees. A successful Religion check (DC 5) allows 1 minute of communication. Each time this check is made, within 24 hours, to communicate with any soul the DC increases by 5. Sunstede (longest day) **Fyrfoda Henge**  The Fyrfoda Henge involves the ritualistic slaughter of animals or intelligent creatures as a way to ensure the magical protections of the Henges continue for another year. **The Harvest Feast**  The day of the Harvest Feat is filled with games, song, and dance. In the afternoon each family, town, clan, or city gather together for the great feast. After eating the feast any creature that makes a DC 12 Religion check is affected by the Heroes Feast spell. **The Great Bonfires**  Fyrst Fyr, Twegen Fyr, and Stor Fyr are the three great bonfire celebrations of Brynmor. Each involves food, drinking, and dancing. Those who wish for the blessing of Brynmor undertake tests of faith. *Fyst Fyr * Jump through the fire. Athletics Check DC 10. Success: Gain resistance to fire on the rest of the month. Failure: 1d4 fire damage per hit die. *Twegen Fyr * Fire Dance. Performance Check DC 15. Success: You may breath fire as though you drank a potion of fire breath once per long rest. Failure: 1d6 fire damage per hit die. *Stor Fyr * Eating the Fire. A coal is picked up and swallowed. The eater makes a Religion Check DC 20. Succeeding grants advantage on all attacks that deal fire damage until the end of the month. If the creature fails it loses any resistance to fire it has and gains vulnerability to fire until the end of the month. The creature then suffers 1d8 fire damage per hit die. If this kills the creature its body is immolated leaving only ash behind. "

I bring you offerings of perfectly randomized dice and snacks. A while ago I decided to make my first homebrew for a Monk Subclass based on the principles of Jeet Kune Do and my personal martial arts training. I submitted it a couple of times here and on /r/DnDHomebrew, and have received some pretty good feedback. So I figured I should post my revisions here again for a semi\-final judgment. Let me know what y'all think! # Way of the Intercepting Fist Said to be the creation of a martial artist displeased with the traditional schools of Martial Arts due to their rigidity, the Way of the Intercepting Fist is as much a mindset as a fighting style. Choosing to take combat at a more defensive and reactive pace, those who practice this style shine when counter attacking foes. Waiting until just before a target strikes, masters of this style are said to be able to emerge victorious and unharmed from battles, with their opponents unable to even attack at all. **Deflect Strikes \-** Beginning at 3rd level when choosing this tradition, your training has allowed you to develop the ability to read small cues and the intent of opponents, allowing you to potentially stop an attack before it even begins. You can use your reaction to deflect or stop a melee attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 \+ your Dexterity modifier \+ your monk level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you may spend 1 Ki point to immediately counterattack with an unarmed strike or melee monk weapon as part of the same reaction. If you have the Extra Attack feature from the monk or any other class, you may counter attack twice. In addition, you may also spend an extra Ki point to trigger a Flurry of Blows. **Flow like Water\-** Starting at 3rd level, youve honed your awareness and reflexes through repetition and muscle memory. You can take a number of additional reactions each round equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum of 1), at the cost of 1 ki point per reaction beyond the first. In addition, you may use multiple reactions for a single trigger, so long as they are not the same reaction. (*E.X. You may use Deflect Strikes/Missiles and Uncanny Dodge if you are also a Rogue in response to each attack from a multi attack if you have enough Ki, but you may not use Deflect Strikes/Missiles twice on a single attack*). At 11th level, these reactions become second nature to you, and you no longer need to spend Ki points to use them. **Fill the Teapot \-** At 6th level, you become more fluid in your thinking and gain a new understanding of your opponents. This understanding allows you to learn things about your opponent and potentially discover their weaknesses. As a bonus action, you can select a target you are aware of that isnt incapacitated and make a Wisdom (Insight), contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your Ki save DC is higher than your Insight roll, you may use that total instead. On a failure, you learn two aspects about the target of your choice: * Creature Type * Armor Class * Senses * A piece of its history or one of its personality traits, if it has any. * If its hit points are at or below one of these thresholds: 100&amp;#37;, 75&amp;#37;, 50&amp;#37;, or 25&amp;#37; of their hit point maximum. * Damage Vulnerabilities * Damage Resistances * Damage Immunities * Condition Immunities You know if the target succeeded or failed on their saving throw. Upon reaching 6th level, if the target fails their saving throw, you can choose three aspects to learn. This increases to four aspects at 11th level, and five aspects at 17th level. Alternatively you may use this feature without a check if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with the target outside of combat. **Flowing Counter \-** Beginning at 11th level, your quick reflexes allow you to use a target's failure to your advantage. If a creature misses you with an attack, you can immediately use your reaction to perform one of the following: * **Attack by Combination.** You may make a melee or ranged attack against that target with advantage. If they are within melee range, you may use your Extra Attack feature with this ability. In addition, you may also spend a Ki point to trigger a Flurry of Blows with advantage. * **Redirect Attack.** You may cause the attack to hit one target of your choice, other than the attacker, that you are aware of within 5 feet of you. If the attack has the Reach property, you may select a target 10 ft away. * **Immobilizing Attack.** If the attacking creature is within melee range, you may attempt to Shove or Grapple them with advantage. * **Progressive Indirect Attack.** You may make a feint against the attacking creature, causing them to flinch. If you have an ally within attack range, their next attack is made with advantage against that target. * **Attack by Drawing.** You may attempt to goad the target into entering your range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Ki save DC. On a failed save, the target must use its next action to attack you with disadvantage. * **Finger Jab.** If the target is in melee range, they must make a Dexterity save or be blinded until your next turn. Alternatively, you may have your unarmed attacks deal piercing damage instead of bludgeoning. **Crashing Water Barrage \-** Upon reaching 17th level, youve fully embraced the ideals of your training and learn to overwhelm opponents like crashing water. Whenever you hit a single target with three or more attacks in one round, you can spend 3 ki points to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your Ki save DC. On a failure, the creature suffers one of the following effects for 1 minute or until they regain hit points in any way. * They have disadvantage on their attack rolls and saving throws. * They have vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. * Their speed is reduced by half, this extends to all physical forms of movement. In addition, they must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw after using the Dash action. If they fail the save, they fall prone. * If they attempt an action in combat, they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they lose their action and can't use reactions until the start of their next turn."

This just popped into my head, Ive still gotta whip up some fluff but these are dark Druids or necro-druids, sneaky forest assassins and boogie men. Not necessarily evil, simply frightening and sneaky. ##Circle of Shadows Those in this circle live where the canopy is thick. The crossroads where travlers lose their way in the forest and jungles. They see it as their sacred duty to be the necessary evil. Not a darkness born of necromancy or the nine hells but the cruel hand of nature herself. Written by u/BryanIndigo **2nd Level** ###Bonus Cantrip Upon joining this Circle you learn your the *Minor illusion* or *Chill Touch* Cantrip. *This is the optional ability, simply to get the theme across, though Im happy to remove it* ###Strength of the Shadows Your familiarity with the shadows and dark places has caused you to become resistant to necrotic damage, in addition you gain darkvision to 60ft, if you already have darkvision its range is instead increased by 30ft. *I find this Thematic, and reasonably strong, though Im keen to hear your thoughts* ###Shadow Form When you join this Circle at second level you learn the art of becoming a shadow. You may expend one use of your wild shape to become a *Shadow* (MM.269). The same rules apply as your regular Beast shapes and once youve used this ability, you cannot do so again until youve finished a long or short rest. At 10th level you may use your wildshape to assume this form as often as you wish. *before you panic, CR wise this is weaker than a moon druid, that said I know the potency of Shadows so until 10th level its limited to once per short rest, and from then till 20th its twice, in addition this form has a low AC and quite low health so I think its reasonable, though again criticisms are welcomed* ___ **3rd Level** ###Bonus spells At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the following circle spells whispered to you by the archdruid ghosts of the Circle of Shadows. Once you gain access a circle spell. You always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spelllist, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you, Druid Level | Circle Spells :-:|:-: 3rd |Shadow Blade, Darkness 5th |Bestow Curse, Fear 7th |Shadow of Moil, Evards Black Tentacles 9th |Mislead, Negative Energy Flood ___ **6th Level** ###Hound of Shadows Beginning at 6th level you may expend one use of you wildshape to summon a Shadow Mastiff (VGtM p.190) from the Shadows in an unoccupied space within 5ft of you as an action. The Shadow Mastiff is friendly to you and to your allies and acts on your initiative. You may command it telepathically as a bonus action on each of your turns. If you do not command it, the Shadow Mastiff will use its action to attack the nearest creature within sight that is hostile to you, if no hostile creatures are in sight it will instead stay within 10ft of you. The Shadow Mastiff lasts for 1 hour(?), or until it drops to 0 hitpoints or you dismiss it as a bonus action. Once you have used this ability you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest. *This, I feel, is awesome, and comparable in power to the Shadow Sorcerers Hound of Ill Omen whilst remaining different* ___ **10th level** ###Abyssal Enhancements At 10th level your ties with the Shadows have grown stronger, enhancing your abilities in the following ways, - You may Hide as a bonus action on each of your turns. - You may add double your Wisdom modifier to any stealth checks you make whilst in darkness or dim light. - When in darkness or dim light you have resistance to piercing, bludgeoning and slashing damage. - When you use your Shadow Form ability to become a shadow, you gain temporary hitpoints equal to your Druid level + your Wisdom Modifier, in addition that form loses its Sunlight Sensitivity and vulnerability to Radiant Damage. *This is the level where it all comes together, where you truly become the boogie man, I think it accomplishes that without being overly powerful* ___ **14th Level** ###Fear the Dark At 14th level the darkness brings you potency, if you hit a creature with a spell attack whilst either you or your target are in dim light or darkness, that spell deals additional necrotic damage equal to your Wisdom Modifier and the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Spell Save DC or become frightened of you until the end of its next turn. *i think this fits the theme, but may be too powerful, please let me know, also tell me if this adds too many rolls* ___ This is my first attempt at this class, written hastily before going to bed, please let me know what you think, all constructive feedback is deeply appreciated and I will make edits as per your suggestions!"

Here is the latest version of my Monk Subclass based on the teachings of Bruce Lee and my own martial arts training. As usual, let me know what y'all think! As a bonus, part of me is tempted to rework the flavor text to make the connection to Bruce Lee less overt, and make it sound like something a character in D&amp;D created.

I hope* This is a first swing, a rough draft, feedback is appreciated! ##**Path of the bermench** ___ *Often beginning their life as a wizards apprentice, they find their powers by the misfiring of a new spell or exposure to a strange liquid. Now with pure arcane energy flowing through their veins, their bodies begin to change and strengthen, granting them access to a variety of powers to be used for good or evil.* ___ **3rd Level** ###**Iron Fists** Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, your fists become imbued with raw arcane energy, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage. Whilst raging the arcane energy flows through them more intensely causing your fists to emit a slight glow. Unarmed strikes you make whilst raging deal an additional 1d6 force damage and count as magical for the sake of overcoming resistances and immunities. Both die increase at certain levels, 1d8 at 12th, and 1d10 at 18th. *punch things without sacrificing that 2d6 Greatsword, you still dont punch as much so I feel this wont step on the monks toes* ###**Arcane Fortitude** At 3rd level, the Arcane energies which flow through your body bolster you upon entering a rage. Whenever you enter a Barbarian Rage you become resistant to all damage types except psychic to which you gain vulnerability. *current thoughts are as follows as I dont want to step on totems toes ; add vulnerability to necrotic damage, save v exhaustion after taking psychic damage, save v frightened after taking psychic damage. Id love to hear your thoughts* ___ **6th Level** ###**Take Flight** At 6th level, whenever you enter a Barbarian rage the Arcane energy irradiates your body allowing you to fly. For the duration of your rage you gain a fly speed of 40ft.

In addition you may make an unarmed strike as a bonus action on each of your turns. *kinda a ribbon, but a powerful one, it links in with one of the nerfs for Arcane Fortitude* ___ **14th Level** ###**Arcane Surge** Starting at 14th level, upon entering a Barbarian Rage you gain one Arcane Surge. You may expend your Arcane Surge as an action to grant yourself one of the following effects, ***Laser Vision***. As an action you release deadly arcane energy from your eyes. A beam of white hot fire 30 feet long and 5 feet wide shoots from your eyes in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This fire damage ignores resistances and immunities. ***Arcane Flourish***. As an action you allow enormous amounts of magical energy to course through your veins. Until the end of your rage you are under the effects of the *Haste* spell, though it does not require concentration. ***Arcane Regeneration***. For the duration of your rage, your bodies natural healing is enhanced, at the beginning of each of your turns in combat you regain hit points equal to half your Barbarian level (rounded down), these hit points cannot exceed your hit point maximum. You may have a maximum of one Arcane Surge stored at any given time. *And now youre a superhero* ___ This is my first attempt, Ive tried to balance this against the Zealot Barbarian, let me know your thoughts and balancing concerns, and I shall try to address them!

Mosswing is based on an Adult Brass Dragon, and the party is four lvl8 players, probably with a few decent NPCs for company. **Mosswing/Koram, the Forest Dragon** (huge Dragon)CR14 11,500XP **Speed:** 40ft, climb 40ft, fly 80ft Blindsight 60ft, Darkvision 120ft, Passive: 21 **Languages:** Common, Draconic, Sylvan **Resistance:** Bludgeoning **Vulnerability:** Fire **Skills:** History +7, Perception +11, Persuasion +8, Stealth +5 **Saves:** Dex +5, Con +10, Wis +6, Cha +7 **AC | Str | Dex | Cons | Int | Wis | Char | HP** **18 | 23 | 13 | 21 | 16 | 13 | 14 | 230** **Plant Life:** While among foliage, Dragon can use Hide as a Bonus Action. **Legendary Resistance (3/Day)** If the dragon fails a saving throw it can choose to succeed instead. **Multiattack:** Three attacks, one bit two claws. **Bite:** +11 to hit, 10ft reach, 2d10 +6, piercing. **Claw:** +11 to hit, 5ft reach, 2d6 +6, slashing. **Tail:** +11 to hit, 15ft reach, 2d8 +6, bludgeoning. **Breath Weapons (recharge 5-6).** The dragon uses one of the following: **Acid Breath:** 40ft line, 10ft wide. Creatures make a DC18 dex save or take 10d6 acid damage, halved on save. **Sleep Breath:** Dragon exhales sleep gas in a 40ft cone. Creatures make a DC18 con save or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. They are woken by damage or another creature using their action. **Seed-bombing (recharge 6).** Dragon sheds seeds in a 50ft radius. Creatures make a DC14 dex save or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage. **Animate Tree (1/day).** create up to two Treants. They can only use slam, intelligence 1 charisma 1. **Photosynthesis:** If the Dragon has more than 0HP and starts its turn in sunlight, it regains 15HP. **Legendary Actions** The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. **Detect:** Dragon makes a perception check. **Tail Attack:** Dragon makes a tail attack. **Wing Attack (2 actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Creatures within 10ft make a DC19 Dex save or take 2d6 + 6 bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed. **Germinate (after seed-bombing, 3 actions).** Dragon forces extreme growth from fallen seeds. 1d6+2 30-40ft trees and 1d4+1 patches of vines grow instantly within seed-bombings radius. Trees have a 5ft base. Vines have a 10ft radius. Vines are difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC15 strength save or be restrained. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC15 strength check. "

I believe the feelings of anger, hate, disgust, etc. are an interesting vehicle for character development, and that there should be an option other than Barbarian - ideally, a more sophisticated approach - for characters who go out of their way to empower themselves with these feelings. I wanted to make this domain focused on offensive options while being distinctive from the current design of ""battle clerics"" (mostly War, but also Tempest, Arcana, and Forge) and ""blaster clerics"" (mostly Light, but also Death). I looked to offer a variety of combat options that would befit the tempestuous yet highly focused nature of this domain. This is my initial result. I'll start by saying that I had a lot of trouble finding thematic level 2 spells and kind of had to improvise there, and that I expect opinions on the power level of this homebrew to vary, since its approach is distinctive and a bit unconventional. \*\*\*\*HATRED DOMAIN\*\*\*\* Gods and mortal creatures parallel one another in their capacity for stress and frustration. Too, in parallel with mortals, some gods can become intensely preoccupied with anger, disgust, and the desire to strike down that which is distasteful to them. A few gods of hatred, such as Hoar, might be preoccupied by the concepts of vengeance or justice, seeking retribution for the wrongs done to them by the cosmos. More commonly, evil deities fixated on bigotry and doctrines of personal or racial superiority, like Gruumsh, Baphomet, or Bane seek to mercilessly and zealously attack, torture, annihilate, or otherwise subjugate others. Clerics in the service of these deities, in any case, are zealously violent, seeking to crush their most revolting enemies in any conceivable way and delight alongside their chosen god in the physical and spiritual downfall of such opposition. \*\*HATRED DOMAIN SPELLS\*\* \- 1st: Hellish Rebuke, Inflict Wounds \- 3rd: Shadow Blade, Spiritual Weapon \- 5th: Melf's Minute Meteors, Bestow Curse \- 7th: Blight, Compulsion \- 9th: Antilife Shell, Cloudkill \*\*BONUS PROFICIENCY\*\* At 1st level, you gain proficiency with the Intimidation skill. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses this skill. \*\*FORCEFUL ERADICATOR\*\* Also at 1st level, you can strike your foes with such viciousness that it hurts them in a manner that defies conventional logic. When you deal damage to a target that you can see as the result of an attack roll or spell that forces a saving throw, you can supernaturally channel your hatred of that foe into your attacks. When you do so, you inflict force damage instead of the normal element of the attack. \*\*CHANNEL DIVINITY: FOCUS VEXATION\*\* Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to single out an enemy that particularly disgusts you and focus your hateful energies upon it. As a bonus action, you harshly censure one target within 10 feet of you. You gain the following benefits against the target for 10 minutes when your ire is focused in this way: \- While you can see the target, it has disadvantage on saving throws against spells you cast. \- You add your proficiency bonus to damage rolls made against the target. \- If you would incapacitate a target by dealing damage to it, you can choose to leave the target at 1 HP. If possible, targets subject to this effect feel excruciating pain and are thereby incapacitated. Thereafter, any ability check made by any creature against the target is made with advantage. \*\*CHANNEL DIVINITY: INCITE HATRED\*\* Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to arouse anger, disgust, or bigotry against your enemies. As an action, for one minute, you make a zealously persuasive speech that viciously criticizes foes of an identifiable affiliation, such as cult membership or race, focusing your allies on a merciless stereotype of your enemies' most undesirable flaws and weaknesses. When the speech is over, choose a number of allies who heard it equal or less than your Wisdom modifier. Against subjects of your speech, these allies gain a bonus to damage rolls equal to their proficiency bonus for 10 minutes. You can use your Channel Divinity in this way once. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. \*\*POTENT SPELLCASTING\*\* Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip. \*\*AURA OF ACRIMONY\*\* Starting at 17th level, the essence of your hatred transcends your physical form, emitting an aura of negative energy in a 15 foot radius. While in your aura, enemies that are damaged by you or the effects of a spell you cast must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or have vulnerability to that instance of the damage. A creature targeted by Focus Vexation makes this save with disadvantage. "

If you attempt to attach a web to an unwilling creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid it. Non solid creatures, like oozes, fire elementals, or ghosts, automatically succeed on the saving throw. Whilst at least one web is spawned you can, on your turn and as part of your movement, extend them up to 50 feet, to a maximum length of 200 feet, and/or despawn them. You can also, as an action, retract them up to 50 feet. Whilst retracting, they can lift up to 400 pounds. If one object or creature hits another object or creature because of this, they both take falling damage as if they had fallen the distance the objects/creatures have uninterruptedly travelled. This damage adds together if two webs were used, either on the same or on each object/creature. The webs can be forced to detach from an object or creature with a successful DC 20 Strength check. The webbings also regain 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as they have at least 1 hit point. If they are destroyed, they cannot be spawned again until you finish a long rest. While you wear these bracers, you also ignore any movement restrictions caused by webbing. "
97,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Runecarver,12,8cmpbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/8cmpbw/runecarver/,2018-04-16 21:05:23,"This is my attempt to create a spellcasting class that departs completely from Vancian magic. **Level 1: Runecarver** You have the ability to carve stones with magically-charged Runes that can be activated by speaking a key phrase. You can carve these Runes over a long rest into any piece of stone that is large enough to be carved and small enough to be thrown, generally about fist-sized. You can prepare up to your Runecarver level of stones during a long rest, with a minimum of five. During or outside combat, you may activate the Rune to cast the imbued spell. Unlike wizards, you dont need to seek more runes to learn; you know them instinctively as you grow more powerful. Upon activation of a Rune, the stone glows with light. When the Rune concludes its effects, the stone breaks, becoming unusable. You learn 3 level 1 Runes at 1st level, 3 level 2 or lower Runes at 3rd level, 3 level 3 or lower Runes at 6th level, 3 level 4 or lower Runes at 9th level, 3 level 5 or lower Runes at 12th level, and 3 level 6 or lower Runes at 15th level. Hit Dice: 1d8 Hit points at level 1: 8+your CON mod 1d8+CON mod per level after 1 Proficiencies: light armor, simple melee and ranged weapons, longsword, shortsword, rapier Masons tools Saving throws: INT and WIS Choose two skills from Arcana, History, Religion, Insight, Perception, Nature, and Investigation. In addition to the equipment provided by your background, you begin with 1) either a longsword/rapier, or any simple weapon, 2) a dagger, 3) a set of leather armor, 4) either a Dungeoneering kit, or Explorers kit, and 5) a large leather belt pouch that can hold up to 20 Runes. **Level 2: Schools Of Thought** At level 2, you choose between two schools of thought: Worldsculptor and Augmentalist. Depending on the school you choose, you gain different benefits at levels 2, 3, 7, 10, 15, and 20. **Level 2: Runic Insights** You have begun your study of Runes in earnest, and as such, you can carve them more quickly. On a short rest, you may carve Runes equal to half your proficiency bonus. You cannot carve Transcendent runes this way. **Level 6: Runic Remnants** At 6th level, you become skilled enough to raise your Runes power. You may carve all Runes you know as their Advanced counterparts. **Level 14: Runic Echoes** At 14th level, your power has reached the point of using Runes to their fullest conventional state. You may carve all Runes you know as their Master counterparts. **Level 20: Runic Reverberations** At 20th level, you have reached the pinnacle of the Runecarvers art, and your Runes echo into and through creation itself. Choose three Runes that you know. You learn their Transcendant counterparts. You may only have up to three Transcendant Runes prepared at any given time, and only one may be active (with the exception of permanent effects) at any given time. Transcendent Runes must be carved into crystal. You may meditate on the Runes you know for eight hours to change the three Runes you know the Transcendent level of. ***School Of Thought: Worldsculptor*** The school of Worldsculpting is centered around the idea of manipulating the outside world. Whether that be with spells of fire or frost, the Worldsculptor is a master of the world. **Arcane Structure** When you select this school of thought, you gain insight into the very structure of magic itself. Once per long rest, when you would take magic damage, you can roll an INT saving throw of DC 15. On a success, you take no damage. **Runecloud** At 3rd level, your affinity with Runic magic becomes stronger. INT mod time per long or short rest, you can have a damaging Rune leave a cloud behind for 1d4 rounds after their effect ends. Creatures who start their turn in the cloud take 1d6 damage of the type of damage the Rune dealt, increasing to 2d6 at sixth level, 3d6 at 13th level, and 4d6 at 17th level. **Fracture** At 7th level, you gain more insight into the mechanism of Runes. You can set Runes as traps, only activating when a creature walks within five feet of them. **Blinding Discharge** At 10th level, you realize that the charged energy in a runestone can be dispersed in a blinding flash in front of you in case of emergency. When targeted for a melee attack within five feet, you can use a reaction to expend a runestone and force a CON saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the attacker is blinded until the end of the current turn. Using this ability deals 1d4 radiant damage to you. **Force Multiplier** At 15th level, you can force energy into a Rune as it activates, forcing it to take on more power. Whenever you activate a Rune, you can use a bonus action to add one die of that Runes effect on for a more powerful effect. You can use this with no negative repercussions up to INT mod times before taking a short or long rest. After that, each Rune you multiply has a cumulative 20% chance of backfiring and doing 1d10 of Force damage to you for each level of the Rune. This damage is unaffected by vulnerability or resistance. **Cataclysm** At 20th level, your Runes are capable of affecting multiple planes of reality at once. Whenever you activate a Rune that prompts a saving throw, you may roll a d10 and subtract the result from the saving throw. Damaging Runes also reduce the targets maximum HP by half the damage dealt. ***School Of Thought: Augmentalist*** The school of Augmentalism, by contrast to Worldsculpting, largely focuses not on influencing the world around you, but on you and your allies. It is a more supportive variant for those who wish to help others more than simply furthering their own goals. **Benevolent Force** When you select this school of thought, your Runes are empowered when affecting you or your allies. Whenever you activate a Rune that affects you and/or at least one ally, you grant whoever it affects 1d6 temporary HP. This amount increases by 1d6 at sixth, eleventh, and fourteenth levels. **Keen Mind, Keen Edge** At 3rd level, you gain greater knowledge in enhancing physical attacks, and learn to enhance your own attacks. You can take one hour to inscribe runes into a nonmagical weapon. That weapon will deal 1d4 additional force damage when you wield it. This increases to 2d4 at level 7, 3d4 at level 13 and 4d4 at level 17. **Break On The Shore** At 7th level, your healing Runes become bastions of magical fortitude, bolstering those touched by them. Whenever a creature is affected by a Rune you activate that heals, they also gain AC equal to that Runes level until the start of your next turn. **Deafening Blast** At 10th level, you become further attuned to your runes and learn to shatter them in stressful situations. Whenever you activate a Rune, you may have the stone it is inscribed on shatter with an intense burst of sound in addition to its usual effect, dealing 1d8 thunder damage in a ten foot area around it. Creatures affected by this blast must make a CON saving throw vs. your spell save DC or be knocked prone. You can use this feature a number of times per long rest equal to your INT modifier. **Fortitude Runes** At 15th level, you permanently tattoo yourself with defensive runes. Whenever you are targeted by an attack, you may use a reaction to increase your AC by half of your proficiency bonus. **Miracle** At 20th level, your Runes are capable of affecting multiple planes of reality at once. Whenever you activate a beneficial Rune, the target of that Rune gains advantage on their next attack or damage roll or ability check. Whenever a creature is healed by the effect of a Rune you activate, they also gain temporary HP equal to half the healing done. [Rune List](URL"
98,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,[Subclass] Arcane Tradition: School of Modification v0.1,4,86bedf,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/86bedf/subclass_arcane_tradition_school_of_modification/,2018-03-23 00:15:11,"**[PDF Link v0.1](URL **[GM Binder Link (Live Version)](URL --- This is my first draft for the School of Modification. It is based on the Lore Master UA. Like many people after playing around with it for a bit I started to understand the complaints of it feeling overpowered and maybe too good. While playing as a Lore Master though I noticed that I wasn't necessarily changing spells on the fly, but instead designing them beforehand with flavour text and basing them off previous encounters in the game. Then I could show it to my DM to get approval on them. This subclass expands on that idea by allowing you to modify spells during your spell preparation. The modified spells also take up a preparation slot, as if they are entirely new spells. --- **Design Thought Process** *Experimental Preparation* * Add a bit of a room to allow you to experiment with your *Spell Editing* feature. I feel if I don't have this then the disadvantages of the edited spells taking a preparation slot will feel a bit too harsh and restrictive. *Spell Editing* * The amount of ways you can modify you spell makes this incredibly flexible, which I think is really fun to allow the players to really think about the mechanics of their spell and how they could change it to benefit them for the day. E.g Stealth mission today? Lets make some of my spells not have verbal components. * If this is too flexible maybe I can limit the amount of edited spells you can have per day? Maybe limit of proficiency bonus world work well with the *Experimental Preparation* feature. * The spell range change could have some unforseen concequences with allowing Self spells to be cast on other people, but I really like idea regardless. Allowing you to change to touch means you don't get disadvantage in melee for the spell, which is niche but useful. * At the moment there is restrictions on changing damage type. Main thoughts here are that if you've done the research for the vulnerability of an enemy then you spend a long rest to edit a spell to take advantage of that weakness and then you actually manage to encounter that enemy and take advantage of the spell, then it doesn't really seem that overpowered, just that your players have put in the time to make that spell work. *Arcane Hijack* * Concept here is that at a certain point you become proficient enough so you can start modifying spells that don't belong to you. The fact that the spell retains the casted DC and casted level emphasizes that. * Its pretty powerful to effectively dispel magic and counter it on someone else so I made sure it requires a spell slot higher than the one casted. * If its determined to still be too powerful then maybe I can say it only works on spells 5th or below? Or make it a long rest ability. *Complex Spell Editing* * Basically allows you to make 2 modifications on one spell instead of 1. Increases possibility space of the Spell Editing feature so the player at this point should understand the in-and-outs of spells and how to effectively edit them. *Improvised Modification* * This is to bring back some of that cool flavour from the Lore Master or editing spells on the fly, and to curb a huge weakness of this subclass when you enter the late game: you have to have foreknowledge for what you're doing for the day for the spell edited prepared spells to be useful. * It is intentional that now you can effectively modify a spell 3 times before it gets casted. Let me know what you think of the subclass so far. --- **Changes to Make** * Adjust wording on *Complex Spell Editing* to make it clearer. (from /u/CaneClankertank)"
99,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,[Creature] Hangman's Tree,5,8c512d,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/8c512d/creature_hangmans_tree/,2018-04-14 13:32:49,"URL Sorry for not having a fancy monster template, but I hope this will suffice. A quick description of the Hangman's Tree: I wanted to create a monster that functioned similar to a Roper, but was a Tree like entity in flavor, and functioned slightly differently. This creature in particular is intended to make a good boss fight or surprise encounter as it will likely be assumed to be a regular tree. I believe that it is CR appropriate, going off of the Roper (intended to be slightly weaker) and some other similar, restraint-based creatures of similar CRs. I like the flavor of the optional rule listed that allows for a modified wall of thorns like ability, but I'm not sure how much harder that makes the encounter from a challenge rating perspective. The intention is mostly flavor behind that, as it allows the Hangman's Tree to trap victims into stay within it's grasp, and it also allows the Hangman's Tree an easier time at getting to its targets instead of faster ones simply being able to run away and kill it from afar. As far as aesthetics, this creature is intended to be a huge, normally looking tree while dormant. When awakened, or springing its trap, dozens of small eyes open around its trunk and it begins to unburrow from the ground slightly to allow dozens of tendril-like roots to allow it to walk, albeit slowly. I picture this tree being roughly 4 to 5 feet in diameter, and anywhere from 30 to 50 feet tall. It would occupy a 2 x 2 square in combat. Although looking like a tree, this is supposed to embody an entity that either is a fleshy, evil monster that only looks like a tree, or it perhaps was a tree at some point that was so corrupted by foul magic that it began to grow flesh and leave behind its original, tree qualities. After killing the tree and giving it a closer inspection, the bark would be revealed to be more of a carapace than actual bark, and its interior would be dense, fleshy tissue. This is the primary reasoning behind not giving it vulnerability to fire like one might expect from a creature with ""Tree"" in its name. It survives by waiting for prey to come close, sometimes after luring smaller prey with little berry bushes it sprouts out of the surrounding dirt, before grabbing and impaling them upon spikes branches high off the ground, thus giving it the nickname of a Hangman's Tree, as the body dangle lifelessly from its branches, and slowly withering into husks as their blood, organs and tissues are sucked out of them. Would love to hear feedback. Thanks! "
100,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,[Mechanic] D&amp;D 5th Edition Variant Mechanic: Exploit Vulnerability v1.0,0,7zd54d,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/7zd54d/mechanic_dd_5th_edition_variant_mechanic_exploit/,2018-02-22 18:38:02,"TL;DR When someone crits, randomly determine a damage type. The next attack that hits dealing that damage type is instead a critical hit. Long gone are the days of a 1 or 20 on your die being your divine judge before God. If you Critically Hit or Fail in 5th Edition it means nothing more than a confirmed hit and a slightly larger damage number, or a confirmed miss. This is partially because of the principal of bounded accuracy. TL;DR Since 5th edition didn't want to track the myriad of floating stat modifiers anymore they made it so your chance to succeed any given task or attack stays consistent with your level. In older editions, low-level characters will find themselves out of their depths in many situations. Sometimes a critical hit was the only way you could hit some monsters if you wandered off the rails. In addition, with the confirm the crit mechanic in 3.5 if you rolled two twenties in a row you dealt further increased damage. If you rolled three you auto killed. In 5th you're hitting pretty consistently, simply getting moderately increased damage doesn't give that same visceral thrill that veteran player remember and old players long for. Crits can be underwhelming when all you get is double of 1 + 1 or when your maximum crit damage is equal to another character's single cantrip. In the past, this has been addressed by having players who Critically Hit or Fail have a random amplifying effect on the attack. For reasons I go more into here I don't think that its a good idea for reasons of variance. As an alternative solution to your boring critical hits, try the Exploit Vulnerability Mechanic! When you crit on a monster, in addition to damage, you describe the immediate effects of the Critical Hit, then describe how that area seems to now be vulnerable to a described damage type. As Shubok smashes his gilded fists into the face of the Stone Golem you see a deep crack appear on the side of the Golem. You think that if you could get a thin enough (read piercing damage) weapon in that crack, you could pry apart a large portion of the Golem's form dealing another sizeable blow. Until the end of this player next turn, if someone hits with an attack using a weapon that would deal the specified damage type; that attack automatically crits. This critical hit doesn't expose another vulnerability. You can, however, expose and exploit a vulnerability in the same turn if you can deal both of the requisite damage types. You can determine damage type by either rolling randomly on a table or by the DM on a case by case basis. If a monster is already vulnerable to a damage type, consider automatically selecting that damage type Now, whenever you mess with the rules you want to ensure that the changes don't break the game. My immediate concerns are: Rogues potential damage output is increased by this homebrew more so than other classes Classes who Crit on a 19 or a 20 become better We run the risk of enemies rushing a PC and chaining crits Abilities that amplify Crit Damage or can add damage dice after a hit is confirmed get better In pondering these, my immediate responses are: I think rogues are balanced by the fact that the vulnerability type is not always going to be one that they can inflict. In addition, they already are built to eviscerate on crits. See reason 4. I think that this now allows those classes to express this part of their class identity more often. In addition, If this didn't break those classes I would give them an additional ability that would allow them if they would crit when exploiting a vulnerability they create a new vulnerability. When the vulnerability gets exposed the PCs can work to protect their vulnerable ally. I think if a party had allowed a large group of creatures to attack their damage dealers so unabashed the fight was likely lost for a different reason. Additionally, it's not unlikely that the enemy lacks the ability to exploit the weakness. If none of that convinces you, at the end of the day this is a mechanic for the player's enjoyment, it can easily be restricted to just the PC's. Follow me here. let's divide individual monsters our players will encounter into two groups. Group A are our BBEG, Epic NPS's and Boss Monsters. Group B are their chumps, The random spawns on your way to the final fight. If a Barbarian Crits a monster from group B that is of an appropriate CR for her it's unlikely that the monster will survive another hit if they even survived the encounter with the barbarian to begin with so what does it matter if the finishing blow is a crit? In Regards to group A, I think its simply a matter of adding an addition 10 - 20% HP for monsters you want to survive more than 2 rounds of combat with your party. A popular criticism of this method of balancing is that its very inelegant and can lead to slogs. I, however, disagree in this instance. I think having the opportunity to crit more often but having it gated in that way we've discussed so far makes combat about setting up the person in the team who is poised to deal the most damage in this instance. Imagine the following: ""The Goliath Paladin breathes heavily as the green light of the liches necromantic form hovers closer. he jumps back to he feet and with to concern for his life starts his final charge. He strikes and delivers a powerful blow to the Fiendish Lich with his greatsword, damaging the phylactery locket that the lich was recently reunited with. His squire, a dastardly Rogue the Paladin had taken mercy on years before, seeing the liches soul pulse behind the cracked locket saw his last chance to save his friend. He drops the hammer of his Knights god and for the first time in years, unsheaths the dagger he used all those years ago. In a single fluid motion, natural rhythm taking over he sends the dagger end over end at the small sliver of soul showing from the cracked casing. Suddenly the Paladin sees the noxious green aura surrounding the lich retract, then, with a burst of brilliant green light the liches form burns to ash, leaving behind nothing but ash and a tarnished locket with a rusty dagger through it"" My melodrama aside. I think this mechanic has a lot of promise and I know I'll be trying it out tomorrow in my game. If you have comments or criticisms let me know in the comments! If you end up trying it in a game you play send me dm or a tweet and let me know how it goes! Bonus Round: If one of your concerns is that spellcasters don't get to enjoy crits as much as a melee character you could expand vulnerabilities to include saving throws. The fighter strikes the head of the Red Dragon, the wizard notices that she seems to be dazed from the blow. She thinks its time to whip out the Hold Monster Spell she's been practicing. If you do include auto-failing saving throws as a possible vulnerability, I would advise that you select the vulnerability at random to ensure fairness. Adding spells to this leans it towards the hypervariable conditions I mentioned in the previous thread but if you like the idea I think it's worth exploring!"

Here is the latest compilation of the BoBH, my monster compendium: [Book of Beautiful Horrors](URL There are quite a few changes and novelties in that update, as you can see in the changelog below: **Version v1.8** - New style for all the monster statblocks. - NEW MONSTERS: 10 new monsters - New Content page with hyperlinks. - New Content by Challenge added at the end of the Book. - New Credit page for Artists. - Spelling mistakes and format changed here and there. Thanks to everyone for reporting them! **CHANGES TO EXISTING MONSTERS:** - Gorebull section renamed Minotaur. - Necrophage: section removed, now all monsters have their individual entry in alphabetical order. - Navigator of the Wild Hunt: changed again its Ice Orb attack to be a straightforward area blast. Finally happy with it and shoudn't change anymore. - Wraith Section: All the art of the Wraith section was pretty old and has been updated/replaced.

Added a bit of extra lore on how it operates. Regional effects slightly changed to make diseases harder to get rid off instead of harder to heal. - Pesta: Stat block entirely redone, not much is left of the previous mechanics, there was just too many effects to keep track of simultaneously, it should now play smoother. CR recalculated to 15. - Shambling Lord Zombie: Hive Mind feature rephrased and enhanced, allowing the Shambling Lord to hear and cast spells through its zombies. - Crowd: Small note added on possible ways to handle the dispersion of a crowd. **NEW MONSTERS PER CR:** - Botchling [CR2] - Lubberkin [CR2] - Myling [CR2] - Ghoul Skulker [CR3] - Shade [CR3] - Bone Ghast [CR5] - Oracula [10] - Shade Host [CR11] - Cenokian Wraith [CR16] - Ghoul Regent [CR19]"
102,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Monastic Tradition: Way of the Shadow Sun,4,82vzwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/82vzwt/monastic_tradition_way_of_the_shadow_sun/,2018-03-08 19:25:14,"Way of the Shadow Sun - 3rd level you gain these abilities: Touch of the Shadowed Sun: You may use an unarmed melee attack to deal necrotic damage up to your unarmed strike die + wisdom modifier. However much damage you deal in necrotic damage may then be transfered into a healing touch by using another unarmed melee attack. You may touch a willful target without an attack roll but must still spend your action. You must expend the healing portion of this ability before you can deal necrotic damage again. - 6th level you gain these abilities: Flame of the Shadowed Sun: By spending 2 ki points you gain the ability to cast a modified version of the absorb elements spell. It affects fire, cold, radiant, and necrotic damage. For every 2 ki points after the initial cost, you may have it absorb 1d6 more damage of the triggering type. If your spell reduced damage you would have taken, then as a bonus action on your turn, you may add the opposite damage type of the one that was reduced to your next non-spell attack or you may cast burning hands or firebolt as the opposite damage type (fire to cold, radiant to necrotic). - 11th level you gain these abilities: Child of Shadow and light: For 4 ki you gain the ability to cast a modified darkness spell. By using a bonus action on your turn, you can cause the darkness to transform into a blinding light, forcing all who are looking to make a wisdom save or become blinded. You may also use your bonus action to change the light back into a field of darkness. Darkness within Light: You know that while light cannot exist without darkness, the opposite is also true. By focusing your ki and closing your eyes, you view the world in a vague, shadowy form. Those also trapped within darkness appear clear and distinct before you. As a bonus action, you can close your eyes and willfully ignore any other senses that confer the ability to pinpoint the location of a creature (such as blindsense, blindsight, and scent). You become effectively blinded, but you gain a special benefit on attacks made against targets that are also blinded or effectively blinded. Against such foes, you ignore the drawbacks for fighting while blinded. Instead, you gain a +2 bonus on melee attack rolls and a +2 bonus on melee damage rolls against such enemies. In addition, blinded opponents take a 2 penalty on their saves to resist your stunning strike. You suffer the penalties for being blinded and deafened until the start of your next turn. The blindness cannot be negated through any means, magical or mundane, until that time. You gain the benefit of this ability if you willingly turn off your sense of sight or if some effect, such as a blindness spell, robs you of your sight. - 17th level you gain these abilities: Balance of Light and Dark: As a bonus action you may take on a terrible transformation becoming a creature of pure shadowy illumination. While in this form you gain these benefits. - Immunity to critical hits, Mind affecting abilities, Death attacks, and Necrotic damage. - Necrotic damage heals you. - +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made to creatures standing in areas of darkness. - Double your proficiency on hide checks. - Creatures damaged by you may not heal for one hour. At the end of your transformation, if you dealt more damage in this form than your maximum hp, your body dissipates into an inky cloud. Unless you are restored to life by true resurrection, you rise in 1d4 days as a vampire. Your alignment becomes evil, though your alignment on the lawchaos axis remains the same. You are now a dedicated champion of evil and an NPC. You retain access to all your abilities and lack a normal vampires vulnerability to sunlight. Your vampiric body forms in the spot where your mortal form perished. Legend holds that the souls of Shadow Sun ninjas who are corrupted in this manner are imprisoned within the Iron City of Dis, Dispaters capital within the depths of Hell. A successful quest to free the soul from its prison cell destroys the vampire and restores the Shadow Sun ninja to life. Legend holds that several mighty Shadow Sun heroes languish within Dispaters prison, waiting to be freed. "

Some strive to prove they are worthy of the same treatment as other races, but old grudges run deep throughout the Shadowfell. **Ability Score Increase:** Your Dexterity score increases by 1. Your Charisma score increases by 2. **Cantrip:** You know the Chill Touch cantrip. Charisma is your spell casting modifier for it. **Blend With Shadows:** You are proficient with the stealth skill. **Shadowborn:** Due to your wraithlike heritage, you are resistant to necrotic damage. **Shadow-Curse:** Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the necrotic energy that has cursed your bloodline, causing your body to transmute into a living shadow composed of necrotic energy. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you and each creature within 10 feet of you take necrotic damage equal to your half your level (rounded up). You also gain resistance to bludgeoning, piecing, and slashing damage, but cannot be healed with any spells, spell-like abilities, or magic items. You also gain vulnerability to radiant damage. Additionally, you can add necrotic damage to one attack or spell equal to your level. Once you have used this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. **Superior Darkvision:** You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cant discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, a Shadovar has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. ............................................................................................................................................................................ The ""forgotten goddess"" is that of Shar, as most 5th edition games seemingly prefer having the Raven Queen being in charge. I am not complaining. I gave them a pretty powerful ability that was based to be somewhat similar to the Scourge Aasimar's Radiant Consumption ability.However, I feel it has pretty good drawbacks to balance it out. If you disagree, please feel free to comment and help me balance this sucker. Happy Gaming"
104,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,First Magic Item on here: Sword of Sorrows (Advice?),9,7rpzei,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/7rpzei/first_magic_item_on_here_sword_of_sorrows_advice/,2018-01-20 22:52:36,"So Im a relatively new dm (1.5 years?) still on my first campaign (running 7 players, all levels 9-10 now). Ive homebrewed a handful of magic items before and for the most part they have turned out to be pretty decently balanced. Though now the party is having a time skip after losing to the last BBEG (+3 levels. Now our groups water genasi bard (College of the Maestro) has multiclassed into a Warlock of the Great Old One for couple of different reasons, but the prevalent one is that he wants to find lost, forbidden songs and knowledge for inspiration for his music. Hes going to do Pact of the Blade and I worked up a cursed sword his patron will offer him at some point later down the road when his story arc comes up. Advice on further balancing the weapon would incredibly helpful. Tips or ideas about other abilities the blade could have would be also super appreciated and encouraged! Sword of Sorrows Cursed Weapon (Shortsword), Rarity: Rare (Requires Attunement) Whenever this sword is struck or is used to strike, the wielder hears a fragment of ancient songs that tell of woe, of ruin and of terrible things to come... The Sword of Sorrows deals psychic damage instead of piercing damage and as you sheath the sword, your eyes darken and you can not help but shed a tear. Curse. A Sad Sword: When equipped, you have vulnerability to psychic damage. You cant help but feel sad when using the Sword of Sorrows. The Sword of Sorrows has 7 charges it can spend to use any one of the following abilities. The blade regains 1d6+1 charges at midnight. -Negative Slash (1 Charge): For but a moment, the sword becomes spectral, bearing a ghostly form, extending and reaching into the enemies mind. You can force a creature within 15 ft to make a DC 15 Wis saving throw or become extremely negative for 1 minute, losing all self confidence and begin to berate themselves. Someone who fails this save falls prone and for the duration they are considered poisoned, making saving throws at the end of their turn, whenever they take damage or another attempts a persuasion or deception check to cheer them up. A character who already has no self confidence is immune to this effect (DMs Discretion). -The Sound and Sight of Sorrow (4 Charges): As an action, the sword casts the silence and greater invisibility spells on you. Roll a d4 and suffer one of the following effects for as long as this ability is in effect: 1. You suffer disadvantage on all saving throws and ability checks and attack rolls against you dont have disadvantage. But you heal 1d4 hit points at the end of each of your turns. 2. You can only take a bonus action or an action on your turn and your speed becomes 10 feet. But you gain a fly speed of 10ft. 3. You take 2d6 psychic damage at the end of each of your turns. But you deal an additional 2d6 psychic damage on damage rolls with this weapon. 4. You become frightened of all your opponents. But you may teleport up to 20 feet in any direction at the end of your turn. You choose whether or not to end this ability at the start of each of your turns."
105,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,New Class: The Seer,5,7t42pi,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/7t42pi/new_class_the_seer/,2018-01-26 23:02:44,"A brief explanation on the power level of the class: I'm a huge homebrew fan and I tinker with basically everything in every game I run. In 5e, I've had to nerf/remove almost nothing, most of the time I've just added more things to classes that don't have a lot of versatility or power (I'm basically aiming to help everyone reach a high A-tier level, that's where I enjoy running games). This class was made with that in mind. It's almost Mystic-level in its power and versatility, and the sheer amount of stuff it gets. If you want to adapt this to a ""normal"" 5e game, remove the 3rd and 7th level features and the bit about turning into a ghost when you die in the level 20 capstones (though that's mostly for plot hooks). Also, Skill Empowerment and Passwall are level 4 spells in my game. But without further ado: ~*~ A young orc with painted skin and a necklace of small animal bones is performing his daily rituals to the spirits of the forest his tribe lives in. The woodland spirits return the favour by warning him of a group of bandits seeking to ambush him. The young shaman laughs at the bandits threats as the spirits of noble orcish warriors coalesce from the aether to protect him. They thought him alone. He is never alone. The old elven woman sits on an aerie at the top of a spire, telling the future of her visitors. She tells a noblewoman the one she loves most will betray her, and that sends the aristocrat into a rage, calling her a deceiver and false prophet. The wizened oracle is impassive as she dodges every swing until the temple guards come to her aid. The future held few surprises for her. A pair of goliath parents rush into a stone home with their sick child. The goliath witch inside, a man of many years and few words, examines the child and sees what others do not: traces of magic forming a complex pattern on the childs skin. He turns to his grimoire and finds, near the beginning, a match for the pattern: an ancient foe he had thought vanquished long ago. He cleanses the childs malaise with a spell and then leaves to convince the chieftain to muster a militia. A witchs work is never done. ~*~ **Sight Beyond Sight** Every seer is marked by their Second Sight. Some think of it as a gift, others as a curse, yet none can escape it. The Sight cannot be turned off: a seer always sees the world differently from everyone else. A shaman sees ephemeral copies of her surroundings superimposed onto the real thing, as well as spirits drifting across the Ethereal plane. An oracle sees ghostly projections of each possible action a person might take and the echoes of events past replaying on a loop. A witch sees the patterns of magic etched across people, objects and places, patterns he can understand and record in his grimoire for future reference. The Sight is divine in nature, but its not always bestowed by a deity. Sometimes, the soul reaches out into the unknown, often in a time of utmost despair, and the Sight awakens, the soul glimpsing for the briefest moment the nature of the cosmos. Most puzzlingly, however, is the fact that seers can have apprentices. Through years of meditation and training, its possible for anyone to awaken their own Sight, though such a process is never taken lightly. Once awakened, the Sight remains with the seer for the rest of her life. **Pillars of the Community** Seers, having access to magic and gifts that other divine classes dont get, find themselves as invaluable pillars of the community, with people naturally flocking to them for aid. Their magic offers them a suit of supportive tricks they can use to heal, protect and empower allies, as well as hinder enemies and solve problems. Seers tend to approach things unorthodoxly, their unique talents letting them solve issues from unexpected angles. Each type of seer has a different Sight, and so while they share the same core abilities and most of the same spells, they vary drastically when it comes to their specialty niche. Furthermore, powerful seers can learn mysteries of the cosmos and add even more variety to their arsenal. There are many reasons seers become adventurers instead of staying in their communities. Some might be wandering loners or read ill omens in the wind and seek to prevent disaster. Others need to understand their Sight, find an answer to a question that troubles them or solve a mystery. Yet others seek to escape the pressure that others put on them, atone for a failure or become stronger to better serve their community. [Seer Table](URL ~*~ **Creating a Seer** The backstory of a seer necessitates explaining how the character gained their Sight. Was it bestowed by a particular deity? Was it awakened after years of training under another seer? Or did it awaken after a traumatic event that changed the character forever? Once you have decided how the character obtained their Sight, you must determine how they feel about it. Is it a gift or a curse? Do they use it to help others or only to help themselves? Do they try to hide it or publicly advertise their talent? The type of seer the character is will deeply influence their personality as well. A shaman can see into the Ethereal and communicate with spirits. Are they incessantly chattering or do they leave the shaman alone and simply watch, expectant? An oracle can see the potential of the future and the echoes of the past. Does that make the character overconfident? Pessimistic? Aloof? A witch can see the patterns of magic. How do they feel, seeing the underlying weave of magic in the world, and how it affects others and themselves? **Quick Build** You can make a seer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by the ability score used by your Second Sight features. Second, choose the sage background. Third, choose the Blade Ward and Guidance cantrips, as well as Bless, Cure Wounds and Shield as your known spells. ~*~ ***Class Features*** As a seer, you gain the following class features. **Hit Points** *Hit Dice:* 1d6 per seer level. *Hit Points at 1st Level:* 6 + your Constitution modifier. *Hit Points at Higher Levels:* 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per seer level after 1st. **Proficiencies** *Armour:* None. *Weapons:* All simple weapons. *Tools:* None. *Saving Throws:* Wisdom, Charisma. *Skills:* Choose two from Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, Religion, Insight, Medicine, Perception, Deception and Persuasion. **Equipment** You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: * Any simple weapon. * (a) an arcane focus, (b) a druidic focus, (c) a holy symbol, or (d) a component pouch. * (a) a scholars pack, (b) an explorers pack, or (c) a priests pack. ~*~ ***Spellcasting*** The Sight that has awakened in you not only colours your perception of reality, but it also grants you the ability to call upon divine magic in your time of need. *Cantrips* At 1st level, you know 2 cantrips of your choice from the seer spell list. You learn additional seer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Seer table. *Spell Slots* The Seer table shows you how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these seer spells, you must spend a spell slot of the spells level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. *Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher* You know three 1st level spells of your choice from the seer spell list, which is detailed at the end of the class description. The Spells Known column of the Seer table shows when you learn more seer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the seer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the seer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. *Spellcasting Ability* Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your seer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a seer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. * Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. * Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. *Spellcasting Focus* You can use an arcane focus, a druidic focus or a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your seer spells. **Second Sight** Choose a Second Sight, which describes the type of seer you are: Shaman Sight, Oracle Sight or Witch Sight, which are detailed after the core class features. Your choice grants you features upon choosing it and again at levels 6th, 10th, 14th and 20th. **Seers Curse** The Sight does not come without a price. Choose a curse from the following list; this curse cannot be removed by any mortal means. You obtain the second part of the curse at level 7th. At level 11th, your curse is lifted, whether by deific intervention or due to your own conquering of it. You retain its benefits, but the downside is miraculously removed. *Curse of Blindness.* You cannot see and permanently have the Blinded condition. However, you also gain Blindsight 30 feet (you do not suffer from the Blinded condition within the area of your Blindsight. Any effect that requires you to see functions normally within the area of your Blindsight). *Improved Seers Curse:* Your Blindsight increases to 60 feet. *Curse of Deafness.* You cannot hear and permanently have the Deafened condition. However, you have resistance to thunder damage. *Improved Seers Curse:* You have immunity to thunder damage. *Curse of Despair.* You cannot shake off this suffocating, supernatural despair. You always have disadvantage on death saves, even if you gain advantage through some means. However, you have advantage on saves against Enchantment and Illusion spells and effects. *Improved Seers Curse:* If you fail a save against an Enchantment or Illusion spell or effect, you may save again the next turn. If you succeed, the spell or effect ends. *Curse of Dread.* You cannot help but come off as frightening and disturbing to others. You have disadvantage on social ability rolls against Beasts, Plants, Fey, Humanoids, Elementals and Monstrosities. However, you gain proficiency on Intimidation, and the curses effects do not apply to that skill. *Improved Seers Curse:* You can attempt an Intimidation roll as an action to frighten a Beast, Humanoid, Fey or Monstrosity. The DC is 15 + the creatures CR (creatures with CR lower than 1 have a DC of 15). If you succeed, the creature gains the frightened condition until the end of your next turn. Once a creature succeeds its save against this ability, it is immune to it for 24 hours. *Curse of Haunting.* You are haunted by spirits, memories or echoes of the past, which only you can see and are terribly distracting. You have disadvantage on concentration rolls. However, you have advantage on History and Religion checks. *Improved Seers Curse:* You also gain advantage on Arcana and Nature checks. *Curse of Misfortune.* Luck never seems to be on your side; if anything, bad luck follows you wherever you go. You have disadvantage on rolls with tools and skills youre not proficient with. However, you gain an additional skill proficiency from the seer list. *Improved Seers Curse:* You gain an additional skill proficiency from the seer list. *Curse of Tongues.* When you are in a stressful situation, you begin speaking in tongues. Choose an Exotic Language. When in combat or a similarly stressful situation, you temporarily forget all other languages you know. However, you add that exotic language to the list of languages you know and also add the Comprehend Languages spell to your seer spells known (it doesnt count against your total spells known). *Improved Seers Curse:* You add the Tongues spell to your seer spells known, it doesnt count against your total spells known. If you already knew that spell, you may instead choose a seer spell of 3rd level or lower. *Curse of Withering.* Your otherwise strong and hale body has been supernaturally withered, scarred or deformed in some way. You have disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity and Constitution saves. However, you gain 1 more HP at each seer level (including first level). *Improved Seers Curse:* You are immune to mundane diseases and have advantage on saves against poisons and magical diseases. **Immediate Foresight** Starting at level 2, your Sight allows you to use your magic to foresee and hopefully avoid disaster. As a reaction to an attack, spell or effect, you can spend a spell slot in order to gain a bonus equal to the level of that spell to either your AC or any one saving throw. This effect applies only against that specific attack, spell or effect. **Mystical Gift** When you reach 3rd level, you choose one of the following boons. If a gift outlines that you are under the effects of a spell or allows you to cast a spell, you use your own spellcasting ability, DC and attack bonus for it. At level 13, you can change your Mystical Gift if you so choose. *Gift of Dark Mists.* While you are within mist or fog (whether natural or magical), you can cast the Misty Step spell without spending a spell slot and without needing to have it among your spells known, but you must target a location with mist. Once you use this feature twice, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. *Gift of Divine Intuition.* You can cast the Augury spell as a ritual without needing material components, spending a spell slot or needing to have it among your spells known. Once you use this feature twice, you cant use it again until you finish a short or long rest. *Gift of Abjuring Glyphs.* While you are wielding no weapons or shields and wearing no armour, your skin glows faintly with magical glyphs, shedding dim light 5 feet around you, and you are under the effects of a Mage Armour spell. If you ever reach your carrying capacity, you lose this effect until you finish a short or long rest. *Gift of Inviolate Presence.* While you are wielding no weapons or shields and wearing no armour, you are under the effects of a Sanctuary spell. If you deal damage to a creature, you lose this effect until you finish a short or long rest. *Gift of Warded Sanctums.* You can designate a room or building no larger than Huge size as your sanctum. Those who seek to enter it uninvited must succeed at a Charisma save against your spell DC, failure means they cannot enter it, though they may try again after one hour. You can change the designation of your sanctum in a 10 minute ritual, but you can only do so once per week. *Gift of Closing Wounds.* After you take damage, if you are still conscious, you immediately heal 1 HP per seer level you have. This can only trigger once per round. **Ability Score Improvement** When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. **Cosmic Mystery** At level 15 and again at level 18, you learn a mystery of the cosmos. Each time you gain this class feature, choose one of the following mysteries. *Mystery of Nature.* Spells you cast that target Beasts, Plants, Elementals or Fey have their range and duration doubled. These creatures, unless controlled by a hostile force, attacked or provoked, regard you positively. *Mystery of the Skies.* Whenever you cast a spell, you gain a flying speed of 60 feet that lasts for 10 minutes per level of the spell you cast. If you cast spells while this is already in effect, you add more minutes to your flying speed duration. *Mystery of Destruction.* Your spells that deal damage ignore resistance (but not immunity). *Mystery of Creation.* You can replace the material components of spells that bring back the dead or create undead for a single item of at least the same value. *Mystery of Life.* When you would normally roll dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. *Mystery of Death.* Whenever you finish a long rest, you gain the effects of a Death Ward spell, lasting for 8 hours. *Mystery of the Elements.* While in contact with earth, fire, water or wind (not merely still air), you have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning and thunder damage. *Mystery of Light and Dark.* You have resistance to necrotic and radiant damage. Spells you cast that create light or darkness have their areas doubled. *Mystery of the Ephemeral.* You have resistance to force, poison and psychic damage. *Mystery of Magic.* You can recover a single spent spell slot of 3rd level or lower when you finish a short rest. ~*~ **Second Sights** Each type of seer is different, and that difference is determined by the type of Sight they possess. Though other, rarer types exist, the main three are Shaman Sight, Oracle Sight and Witch Sight. ~*~ ***Shaman Sight*** A Shamans Sight allows them to see into the Ethereal and lets them communicate with the spirits that dwell therein. They are tougher than other seers and can beseech the spirits for aid. **Ethereal Sight** At 1st level when you choose this Second Sight, you can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when you are on the Material Plane, and vice versa. As an action, you can choose to open your senses, which allows you to hear the speech of creatures that are 60 feet around you in the Ethereal Plane. You are immune to the Horrifying Visage and Possession abilities of ghosts. **Spiritual Bargains** Starting at level 1, you can perform a 10 minute ritual in front of a totem (which you can fashion out of natural materials like twigs, leaves, bones and rocks in 10 minutes) to bargain with or entice the spirits that dwell in the Ethereal, which are usually Fey or Undead. Once you perform the ritual, you then have 12 hours to call upon spiritual aid, which you can do as an action. When you do so, a Fey spirit materialises adjacent to you in a place of your choosing. Treat it as a satyr (no pipes) with a flying speed of 30 feet and the Ethereal Sight, Etherealness and Incorporeal movement abilities of a ghost. The spirit acts on your initiative (including the turn you summon it) and remains at your service for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier or until its HP reaches 0, after which it fades back into the Ethereal Plane (regardless of what spell or effect it was subjected to while in the Material Plane). Once you perform the bargain ritual, you cannot perform another until you finish a long rest; once you call for spiritual aid, you cannot do so again until you perform another bargain ritual. When you reach level 5, and again at levels 10, 15 and 20, you can summon an additional spirit when you call for spirit aid. When you reach level 12, you may choose to summon a ghost instead of a Fey spirit. However, if you do so, you summon 2 less ghosts than you could summon Fey spirits. **Unarmoured Defence** At 6th level, while you are not wearing any armour or wielding a shield, you add your Constitution modifier to your AC. **Spiritual Authority** At 6th level, you are known and respected by the nature and undead spirits you traffic with. Undead, Fey, Elementals, Beasts and Plants have disadvantage on attacks against you and you have advantage on social ability rolls against them. However, you have disadvantage on attacks against these creatures as well. **Revered Ritualist** Starting from level 10, whenever you cast a spell as a ritual or perform a ritual granted to you by a class feature, race or feat, you gain a spiritual blessing. When you complete the ritual, you gain the effects of a Protection From Evil and Good spell for 1 hour afterwards. **Shamanic Totems** Starting at level 14, you can conjure a special totem in a 10 minute ritual. These totems are sculpted of aether (in the shape of animal heads, stylised plants or entwined humanoid/monstrous figures) and do not take damage, but are instantly destroyed by a Dispel Magic spell (of any level). A created totem lasts for a number of hours equal to your Constitution modifier and can be picked up and carried only by a shaman (it is weightless and Small size), as it is incorporeal to others. You can have up to 2 totems active at any time and they must be of different types. If you create a new one, the oldest is instantly destroyed. Choose from one of the following options: *Totem of Endless Rivers.* You and your allies, if within 10 feet of the totem, heal 1d8 damage per round, but only up to half of maximum HP. *Totem of Fearless Wings.* You and your allies, if within 10 feet of the totem, gain a bonus of 10 feet to all movement speeds. *Totem of Burning Hearts.* You and your allies, if within 10 feet of the totem, are immune to the charmed and frightened conditions. *Totem of Unbroken Stones.* You and your allies, if within 10 feet of the totem, are immune to the prone and petrified conditions. *Totem of Dark Mists.* The totem emits a thick mist (as per the Fog Cloud spell) in a 10 feet radius around it that you and your allies can see through perfectly. *Totem of Astral Lights.* The totem emits bright light 10 feet around it and dim light 10 feet further. This light counts as sunlight, starlight and moonlight all at once. Shapechangers and Aberrations have disadvantage on attack and ability rolls while under the light of this totem. *Totem of Tamed Beasts.* Beasts that enter an area 30 feet around the totem must make a Wisdom save against your spell DC or be charmed for the duration of the totem. Once the totem is destroyed, the beasts regard the shaman and their allies positively unless attacked or frightened. If a beast succeeds on the Wisdom save, it is immune to the effects of that totem (but may be affected by a different Totem of Tamed Beasts). *Totem of Sacred Blooms.* The ground around the totem is constantly sprouting magical plants and flowers, and it rains softly with flower petals and leaves around it. A 10 feet radius around the totem is considered difficult terrain by all but you and your allies, and gases, smoke, winds, rain and mists cannot penetrate the serenity of the area 10 feet around the totem either. **Shaman of Legend** When you reach level 20, you finally take your place amongst the shaman legends of old. You gain the following benefits: You no longer age and cannot die of old age. You cannot be magically aged (but you can be de-aged up to young adult). * As an action, you can enter the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane or viceversa. However, unlike using the Etherealness spell, you are visible to the Material Plane while in the Border Ethereal and viceversa, though you cant be affected by creatures or effects from the plane you are not in. You cannot remain in the Ethereal Plane with this ability more than a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier. Once you use this ability twice, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest. * You have resistance to the damage dealt by Undead, Fey, Elementals, Beasts and Plants, and they have disadvantage on saves against your spells. * You automatically identify other seers and what type of Sight they have. * Should you die, you can choose to automatically become a ghost (you retain your ability scores and are in control of whether you show your Frightening Visage). However, you can still be resurrected or reincarnated if you are willing. ~*~ ***Oracle Sight*** An oracles sight allows them to glimpse into both the future and the past. They are wiser than other seers and can avoid disaster before it happens. **Danger Sight** At 1st level when you choose this Second Sight, you have the ongoing effects of the Find Traps and Detect Poison and Disease spells, but only in the area you can see and up to 30 feet of distance. **Visions of the Future and the Past** At 1st level, you can attempt to see what the future holds in store for you. After performing a 10 minute ritual where you meditate or use a divinatory instrument (like a deck of cards, a crystal ball, a mirror or the like), you receive a vision of an event that could potentially happen within the next 24 hours. Once you perform this ritual, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At level 5, you begin to receive brief glimpses of a persons past or current troubles when you look at them, giving you advantage on Insight rolls. At level 10, whenever you step into an important location for the first time, you receive a brief vision of the most salient event that happened there in the last millennium. At level 15, instead of gaining a vision of a potential future, you may use the ritual granted by this ability to duplicate the effects of a Divination spell. At level 20, instead of gaining a vision of a potential future, you may use the ritual granted by this ability to duplicate the effects of a Legend Lore spell. **Unarmoured Defence** At 6th level, while you are not wearing any armour or wielding a shield, you add your Wisdom modifier to your AC. **Heartsight** Starting at level 6, you gain the ability to touch a creature to learn its current emotional state. When you do so, you can force the creature to make a Charisma save against your spell DC. On a failure, you learn the creatures alignment and the most pressing concern it currently has. On a success, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours. Aberrations, Celestials, Constructs, Fiends and Undead automatically fail this save. **Unmatched Instinct** At level 10, you can see events unfolding seconds before they happen. You add your Wisdom modifier to your Initiative and Dexterity saving throws. Additionally, you can always act in a surprise round and cannot be surprised. **Oracular Epiphanies** Starting at level 14, you can invoke a special epiphany. Once you invoke an epiphany, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest. *They Were Never There.* As a reaction to yourself or an ally you can see being in the area of a spell, you can invoke this epiphany to move that target outside of the area of that spell, but no further than the fastest of the targets speeds. *The Wound Was Never Mortal.* As a reaction to an ally you can see being reduced to 0 HP by damage, you can instantly reduce that damage by 2 per seer level you have (but no lower than 0 damage). This can prevent death due to massive damage and any effect that triggers if the target reaches 0 HP. *It Was Only A Warning.* As a reaction to yourself or an ally you can see failing a saving throw, you can invoke this epiphany to immediate reroll the save. You or the ally must accept the new roll. *You Struck True.* As a reaction to an ally you can see missing a weapon attack, you can invoke this epiphany to immediate reroll the attack. Your ally must accept the new roll. *I Dont Think So.* As a reaction to an enemy you can see choosing to succeed on a save without rolling, you can invoke this epiphany to force that enemy to roll the saving throw instead. The enemys attempt, if it has a limited amount, is expended anyway. *There Is No Escape.* As a reaction to an enemy you can see that is adjacent to one of your allies attempting to escape (whether its through the use of teleportation magic, the disengage action, or any other means), you can invoke this epiphany to force the enemy to roll a Charisma saving throw against your spell DC. On a failure, the enemy wastes their attempt to escape and remains where it is. **Oracle of Legend** When you reach level 20, you become recognised as a legendary oracle. You gain the following benefits: * You no longer age and cannot die of old age. You cannot be magically aged (but you can be de-aged up to young adult). * Your Danger Sight also gains the benefits of the Detect Evil and Good and the True Seeing spells, with the same limitations. * When you finish a long rest, you gain the benefits of a Foresight spell for 16 hours. * You automatically identify other seers and what type of Sight they have. * Should you die, you can choose to automatically become a ghost (you retain your ability scores and are in control of whether you show your Frightening Visage). However, you can still be resurrected or reincarnated if you are willing. ~*~ ***Witch Sight*** A witchs sight allows them to see the unique patterns that magic makes on people, objects and places. They are smarter than other seers and can twist magic on itself to hex others. **Arcane Sight** At 1st level when you choose this Second Sight, you have the ongoing effects of the Detect Magic spell. Additionally, each spell or magical effect currently affecting an object, person or place appears as a distinctive pattern that you can copy down in your Grimoire (a process that takes 10 minutes per unique pattern). Each spellcaster has their own unique pattern, so consulting your Grimoire allows you to make a DC 15 Arcana check to recognise a magical pattern youve seen before and identify its caster. **Grimoire of Witchcraft** At 1st level, you create or inherit a Grimoire of Witchcraft. This object uses the statistics of a spellbook, but does not contain only spells. It also functions as a place for you to document important information and inscribe the magical patterns you find in the world. As you grow in power, your Grimoire becomes more useful. Should your Grimoire be destroyed, you can recover it through an hour-long ritual that imposes 3 levels of Exhaustion on you. At the start, it gives you an additional cantrip from either the seer or the wizard spell lists and adds the Find Familiar spell to your spells known. You only gain these benefits while consulting the Grimoire (though you can hold the Grimoire in the same hand you use for your component pouch or spellcasting focus). At level 5, it gives you proficiency with the alchemists kit, herbalists kit and poisoners kit while consulting the Grimoire. At levels 10, 15 and 20, it allows you to add a spell of a level you can cast from the wizard list to your spells known. You only have access to these spells while consulting the Grimoire. **Unarmoured Defence** At 6th level, while you are not wearing any armour or wielding a shield, you add your Intelligence modifier to your AC. **Eye for Magic** At 6th level, you automatically identify spells and magical effects without needing to make Arcana rolls if they are of a level you can cast. If they are higher, you have advantage on Arcana rolls to identify them. You also know when a spell is being cast within 60 feet of you, even if you cannot see the caster or the casting. **Witchs Cunning** Starting at level 10, whenever you use Immediate Foresight against a spell, you also add your Intelligence modifier to the bonus you gain. **Witch Hexes** Starting at level 14, you can twist magic to hex others. All hexes are performed as an action targeting a creature you can see within 30 feet, they use your spell DC and last until the end of your next turn. Once you perform a hex, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest. When you wish to perform a hex, choose from one of the following: *Hex of Ill Omens.* The target must make a Charisma save or have disadvantage on all rolls and saves. Regardless of whether the save is successful or not, the target takes 4d6 necrotic damage. *Hex of the Shattered Mind.* The target must make an Intelligence save or be incapacitated. Regardless of whether the save is successful or not, the target takes 4d6 psychic damage. *Hex of the Frozen Tomb.* The target must make a Constitution save or take 8d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Regardless of whether the save is successful or not, the target is restrained by ice. *Hex of Strength Undone.* The target must make a Constitution save or lose all resistances. If that save fails, the target must immediately make another Constitution save or also lose all immunities. *Hex of the Iridescent Night.* The target must make an Intelligence save or be mentally overwhelmed by shimmering darkness, rendering them Blinded, Deafened and unable to speak. *Hex of the Broken Seal.* The target must make a Charisma save or gain vulnerability to the damage of spells and become unable to cast spells. **Witch of Legend** When you reach level 20, you join the ranks of the witches of legend. You gain the following benefits: * You no longer age and cannot die of old age. You cannot be magically aged (but you can be de-aged up to young adult). * You have resistance to the damage of spells. * You add your Intelligence modifier to your Perception, Insight, Survival, Medicine and Concentration rolls. You automatically identify other seers and what type of Sight they have. * Should you die, you can choose to automatically become a ghost (you retain your ability scores and are in control of whether you show your Frightening Visage). However, you can still be resurrected or reincarnated if you are willing. ~*~ ***Seer Spell List*** These are the spells available to the seer class. *Cantrips* Blade Ward, Chill Touch, Guidance, Light, Mending, Message, Prestidigitation, Spare The Dying, Thaumaturgy, Toll The Dead, True Strike, Vicious Mockery. *1st Level* Absorb Elements, Bane, Bless, Comprehend Languages, Create or Destroy Water, Cure Wounds, Detect Evil and Good, Detect Magic, Detect Poison and Disease, Dissonant Whispers, Faerie Fire, Feather Fall, Fog Cloud, Identify, Protection From Evil and Good, Purify Food And Drink, Sanctuary, Shield, Shield of Faith, Speak With Animals. *2nd Level* Augury, Blindness/Deafness, Calm Emotions, Darkness, Darkvision, Detect Thoughts, Enhance Ability, Find Traps, Healing Spirit, Hold Person, Lesser Restoration, Locate Animals or Plants, Locate Object, Mind Spike, Misty Step, Moonbeam, Phantasmal Force, See Invisibility, Silence, Zone of Truth. *3rd Level* Bestow Curse, Catnap, Clairvoyance, Counterspell, Create Food and Water, Daylight, Dispel Magic, Fear, Magic Circle, Nondetection, Protection From Energy, Remove Curse, Revivify, Speak With Dead, Speak With Plants, Tidal Wave, Tongues, Vampiric Touch. *4th Level* Arcane Eye, Banishment, Confusion, Death Ward, Dimension Door, Divination, Freedom of Movement, Locate Creature, Mordenkainens Private Sanctum, Phantasmal Killer, Skill Empowerment, Stone Shape, Stoneskin, Watery Sphere. *5th Level* Commune, Commune With Nature, Contact Other Plane, Dream, Greater Restoration, Legend Lore, Mass Cure Wounds, Modify Memory, Raise Dead, Rarys Telepathic Bond, Scrying, Synaptic Static, Telekinesis. *6th Level* Contingency, Find The Path, Forbiddance, Globe of Invulnerability, Heal, Mental Prison, Primordial Ward, True Seeing, Wind Walk, Word of Recall. *7th Level* Crown of Stars, Etherealness, Mirage Arcane, Plane Shift, Regenerate, Resurrection, Sequester, Teleport. *8th Level* Antimagic Field, Antipathy/Sympathy, Control Weather, Feeblemind, Maddening Darkness, Mind Blank, Power Word Stun, Telepathy. *9th Level* Astral Projection, Foresight, Invulnerability, Imprisonment, Mass Heal, Psychic Scream, Time Stop, True Resurrection. ~*~ Thank you for reading this far!

106,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,The Sword of Sorrows (UPDATED),1,7tj6db,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/7tj6db/the_sword_of_sorrows_updated/,2018-01-28 19:35:09,"A little while ago I posted a magic item on here and after some super helpful feedback, Ive tweaked the item a bit. Any feedback is incredibly encouraged as is ideas on altering existing abilities or entirely new abilities! The Sword of Sorrows Cursed Weapon (Shortsword), Rarity: Very Rare (Requires Attunement) Value: ??? The Sword of Sorrows is a sharp, silver blade of elven craft engraved with the carvings of weeping visages, lost souls and a tide of tears. Whenever this sword is struck or is used to strike, the wielder hears a fragment of ancient songs that tell of woe, ruin and terrible things to come... The Sword of Sorrows deals psychic damage instead of piercing damage and as you sheath the sword, your eyes darken and you can not help but shed a tear. Cursed. A Tragic Legacy: The bereavement, despair and grief that drove the first bearer of the Sword of Sorrows haunts all her successors. When wielding the sword, you have vulnerability to psychic damage, whenever you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll with this weapon you take 3d6 psychic damage and you become stunned until the end of your next turn. If the curse activates for the third time in a single day, you begin to take 1d6 psychic damage at the end of each of your turns until you fall unconscious. When you do fall unconscious this way, the closest creature within 15 feet of you must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be drawn to take the sword themselves and continue its Tragic Legacy. -Negative Slash: For but a moment, the sword becomes spectral, bearing a ghostly form, extending and passing through an enemies soul. As a bonus action when you hit a creature, you can force them make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become extremely negative for 1 minute, losing all self confidence and begin to berate themselves. Someone who fails this save falls prone in tears and for the duration they are considered poisoned, making saving throws at the end of each of their turns or whenever they take damage. -A Tide of Tears: As the blade becomes infused with negative energy, wisps of crying souls begin to emerge from the crying sword. The energy is then unleashed in a torrent of weeping, volatile spectral visages. After rolling a natural 20 on an attack roll using this weapon, you can activate this ability as a reaction, conjuring a wave of psychic energy. You create an area effect that can be up to 30 feet long, up to 10 feet wide, and up to 10 feet tall. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 4d8 psychic damage, its speed becomes 0 and it is incapacitated until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half damage, doesnt have a speed of 0 and isnt incapacitated. Heres a link to the original post. URL Honestly, this subreddit is great!"
107,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Dark Sun Dragonborn : The Dray,6,7v2fxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/7v2fxx/dark_sun_dragonborn_the_dray/,2018-02-04 09:01:34,"One of my players is a big 2e fan, especially of the Dark Sun setting. As such he set out to try and stat them up for 5e. After a lil bit of discussion and moving things around, here we have the first draft. What do you guys think? Dray (Dark Sun 5e Dragonborn) Created many centuries ago by Dregoth, the undead Sorcerer-King of the ancient city of Giustenal to serve as his chosen race, the dray are a strong, resilient race of dragon-like humanoids. Most first-generation dray were cast out of their home and into subterranean depths or the open wastes by their creator for their imperfections, and many of the perfected second generation of dray survived when Giustenal was destroyed and went on to build the subterranean city of New Giustenal where their Sorcerer-King now rules. From those ancient refugees and survivors arose a race of mercenaries, magicians, psychics, priests, warriors and slavers known for their ruthless, warlike, and sometimes treacherous ways. DRAY TRAITS. * Size. Dray are tall and lean, standing between 6 and 8 feet tall and averaging around 200 pounds, they also have a long tail. Your size is Medium. * Age. Dray are a long-lived race, reaching maturity around 50 years, and may live upward of 1000 years naturally. * Draconic Ancestry. You dont have this trait. * Breath Weapon. You dont have this trait. * Damage Resistance. You have resistance to fire damage. * Damage Vulnerability. You have vulnerability to cold damage. * Bite Attack. Your fanged maw counts as a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of bludgeoning damage. * Claw Attack. Your claws counts as a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of bludgeoning damage. * Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. Heat pits along your visage make your darkvision unusual: everything you see in darkness is in shades of red. * Efficient Hydration. You only need to consume 1/2 the amount of water per day as a human when active, and only 1/4 when inactive. * Languages. You can speak Common (Athasian) and Giustenal. You cannot read these languages unless a background gives you this trait. Subraces: The Dray are split amongst two different generations, the first one having a greater strength of body, while the latter bears a stronger strength of mind. First generation: * Ability Score Increase. Dray of the First Generation get +3 to Strength, +1 to Constitution, -1 to Intelligence and -1 to Charisma. * Resourceful brawn. You are proficient in the Intimidation skill. Second Generation: * Ability Score increase. Second Generation Dray get a +2 to Strength, +1 to Intelligence and +1 to Charisma."
108,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Warlock Patron: The Symbiote [Inspired by yesterdays Venom Trailer],16,7wh1w2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/7wh1w2/warlock_patron_the_symbiote_inspired_by/,2018-02-10 09:09:27,"I was watching the Venom trailer yesterday and I was getting waves of nostalgia as to how cool Venom was and symbiotes in general, and I got inspired to make a Warlock Patron as a symbiote. So here it is! URL I had a lot of influence in the ideas for this subclass, from Venom, to Blue Beetle from Young Justice, to Alex Mercer from Prototype. Mechanically, its very similar to a Bladesinger for Warlocks, but other classes provided inspirations, (Monk, Barbarian, Blood Hunter, and other warlock subclasses). This is my first homebrew, so Im willing to take any ideas you guys have to rework into a future version. It was just a really fun exercise to make. I had some more ideas to nerf or buff the class as needed: - Making the Unarmed Strikes proficiency and damage baseline to the armor - Unable to cast spells other than cantrips while in the armor - Armor grants certain resistances - Armor has Thunder/Fire Vulnerability - Regenerate might be too strong as a capstone, so moving Enlarge to Level 14, and maybe adding the Rogues Uncanny Dodge as a reaction at level 10. Just some ideas, but I would love to hear what you all think. "
109,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Blood Hunter Archetype: Order of the Peerless Flame,21,7wvfr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/7wvfr3/blood_hunter_archetype_order_of_the_peerless_flame/,2018-02-12 07:45:03,"This is the first subclass I've ever made, so feel free to be critical. I hope you all like it! **Order of the Peerless Flame** The darkness that creeps through the world is deep, foul, and brimming with unspeakable horror. Many a Blood Hunter sets out upon their crusade with vigor and zeal in their heart, yet the abominations from without and the corruption from within cause them to lose their way. It is so easy to forget what you fight for, to become so tainted that everything bleeds together. Members of the Peerless Flame never forget. The Peerless Flame is the fire of creation that burns radiant within all living things. Members of this order have submitted themselves to the transformative properties of the blood hunter so that they may tap into their own connection with the Peerless Flame without it searing their form away. They are the polaris of humanity, guardians and guides to them through their perdition towards a brighter future. And if to better bear that light they must sacrifice their own humanity, then so be it. **Exalted Firebrand** Upon joining this order you now speak with the authority that only the Peerless Flame can grant you. At 3rd level as a bonus action you may encourage an ally, granting them advantage on a single roll. You can not use this ability again until you complete a long rest. You also gain permanently gain proficiency in either persuasion or deception. **Ash Wards** At 7th level you have come to understand the craft of mixing your blood with ash to create protective wards. You are now able to apply resistance of one known damage type to yourself or an ally. Each resistance has a corresponding vulnerability which is also applied. Only one ward may be active at a time. A ward will last for 1 hour and another cannot be applied again until you take a long rest. You automatically know the ward for fire and one other damage type of your choice, and you learn a new type at 11th, 15th, and 18th level. *Damage types* (resistance) - (vulnerability) Acid - Poison Bludgeoning - Piercing Cold - Fire Fire - Cold Force - Psychic Lightning - Thunder Necrotic - Radiant Piercing - Slashing Poison - Acid Psychic - Force Radiant - Necrotic **Persistent Phosphorescence:** By 11th level the more the abominations of the shadow try to snuff out your light the brighter it shines. If you are below half health (rounded down) blood curses only do half damage when you amplify them. You may also learn one of the Order of the Peerless Flames blood curses. This will not count against your blood curses known. *Blood Curse of Hellfire:* As a bonus action you may choose one enemy you can see within 60 feet. That enemy must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your wisdom modifier) or you will roll your crimson rite die twice to inflict fire damage. Amplify: The damage is now max and you may choose for it to be either fire or radiant damage. *Blood Curse of the Shared Ember:* As a bonus action you may roll your crimson rite die to suffer the resulting damage and heal an ally within 30 feet for the same amount. Amplify: You may add the amplification die rolls results to the initial rolls results. *Blood curse of the Blazing Visage:* When an enemy within 100 feet is about to make an attack on an ally you can make a reaction. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your wisdom modifier) or they will become frightened. Amplify: The blood curse automatically succeeds. **Raging Infernum** The burning hatred of the monstrosities who seek to harm those you protect has only grown. At 15th level if an ally is attacked within your line of sight you may choose to take half (rounded up) or all the damage they would receive from that attack in their place. If you take half damage, your attacks critical roll range becomes 19-20; and if you take full damage your attacks critical roll range becomes 18-20. This ability lasts until you are healed or you take a long rest. **Enkindled Soul** You and the Peerless Flame are now as one. Fire runs through your veins and the light of a thousand raging coals emanates in your heart. At 18th level one of your ash wards becomes permanently applied to you, resistances and vulnerabilties, and does not count against other active wards. A vulnerability can be countered with a resistance, but then you will have neither. Additionally, you may amplify a blood curse without spending hit points once per short rest (excluding Blood Curse of the Shared Ember). "

A couple of days ago, I posted my original draft for my homebrew of a [Warlock subclass, the Symbiote Patron](URL Thank you all for your help in tweaking and modifying it to balance it out and flesh it out more thematically. Presenting, the [Revised Symbiote Patron for the Warlock](URL Changelog: * I modified the extended spell list to be less effective on others and more focused on the symbiote and its host. * The Symbiote is such an imporant part of the subclass, the patron being attached to you the whole time, so I really wanted to focus on what the symbiote was all about. I created a table on the Symbiote Purpose, its reason for wanting survival and goals for its existance, and the Symbiote Dependency, for an alien creature is attached to you, it would affect your cravings and personality in some way. Additionally, I posted on how the symbiote might be physically attached or bonded with your warlock. * After many of you had pointed out, I decided that Primal Savagery and Thorn Whip are thematic enough to the Symbiote, and making Unarmed Attacks like a Monk aren't necessary. I upped the power those cantrips do at level 6 and 14. And instead of creating claws, the Weapon from Pact of the Blade is created from the Symbiotic Armor, so you cannot be disarmed. * Another point all of you have made, I decied to not front load the Symbiotic Armor, and giving it a significant upgrade at level 6, but still making it powerful with vulnerabilities at level 1. I added piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing resistence, while adding a fire and thunder vulnerability, like the Venom symbiote from the comic books. I made the AC = 13 + Charisma to allow for strength and charisma builds, and shifted the movement speed increase to level 6 with advantage on dexterity saving throws. The number of uses of Symbiotic Armor now is Charisma Modifier of times per long rest (minimum of 1). * I combined the previous level 10 and 14 features into one. I still don't believe it is too overpowered, but I would love to hear from you all as to balancing the power vs the thematic influence of the class. * With bumping some traits from level 1 to level 6 and shifting level 10 and 14 together, I made Mnemokinetics a level 10 feature, a free cast once per long rest that increases in power the more you level. Thematically, I think its perfect and although at level 18, you'd have the ability cast this spell at level 9 and a mystic arcanum at level 9, this spell would at least not be busted and break the game at that point. Once again, thank you for your recomendations and I would lvoe to hear from you more as to any changes I should make now."
111,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Blood Hunter Archetype: Order of the Peerless Flame V1.2,6,7x2bps,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/7x2bps/blood_hunter_archetype_order_of_the_peerless/,2018-02-13 04:23:59,"[Homebrewery Link](URL So, after some more polishing I have created an updated version of the Order of the Peerless Flame. Changes: - Exalted Firebrand: The limiter for this ability has been changed from a long rest to a short one. Not only that, but you gain incrementally more uses of it at each subclass level milestone. I think the utility found in this ability because of that will be more realized. - Ash Wards: Ash Wards underwent a complete overhaul. No longer are they flat resistance/vulnerabilities, but rather a risk/reward chance. Their reception was somewhat mixed though, so depending on how this new version is received I may go back to the original and see if I can't get that to work better. - Blood Curses: Blood Curse of the Blazing Visage has had a turn counter instituted into it to avoid confusion. Blood Curse of Hellfire no longer does damage but instead imparts vulnerability. And Blood Curse of the Shared Ember had its amplification description re-written for clarity. - Raging Infernum: 1. You now need to use it as a reaction *before* damage is rolled. 2. It only lasts for 1d4 turns, or at least until you get to Enkindled Soul and it increases to 2d4. - Enkindled Soul: I'm hoping my changes to Ash Wards will be enough to make this less of a shoddy capstone. Speaking of, your chosen permanent ash ward will automatically be considered without downside. I also added the aforementioned increase to Raging Infernum. Thank you to everyone who gave me feedback on my first version of this subclass. I appreciate it greatly and I hope that this latest version strikes some chords that the last didn't. Likewise, if it is failing in any aspects feel free to let me know. "

I've been working on some wording for a few things and I'll probably always be tinkering with it but any major changes look to be done. The only large update left is adding art at some point and changing the name of the Blood Frenzy ability since sharks have an ability called that. I'd still love some feedback about what you guys think about the balance. If you have played the race I'd love to know how it went. I took the race through detect balance and had to guess for a few scores but here's what I got (These are all for the Demon Blood subrace because that would be the more powerful of them. I thought that the increased DCs of Blood Frenzy would counteract the lesser Purification damage.): All ASI +1 - 16 [Half human and their other half is supposed to be superior to humans so it made sense] Languages - 0 [Youkyn is homebrew and can easily be switched for Abyssal] Speak with Limited Animals - 1 [Because its only animals of a certain species such as canines or felines. May be changed still to a lesser form of communication.] Darkvision 60 - 3 Proficiency (2) - 4 Unarmed Strikes &amp; Claws (Synergy-) - 1.5 Demon Blood - 1.5 (DB says to halve the least valued option) Advantage Hear and Smell (Situational) - 2 (So far I haven't had this one used much at all. It was for flavor since it made sense to something with heightened demonic beast heritage. It can still be useful though) Blood Frenzy (Drawbacks Heavy) - 2 (A great fallback but afterwards this could give disadvantage on ability checks and possibly halved speed. Definitely a last resort. A DM can even use this for good story if its used in front of a crowd.) Purification - -3 (Negative because I didn't want to give the race a vulnerability and non-reducible damage damage for every radiant attack can definitely be deadly if your not careful. Any amount of radiant damage triggers this. You could take 2 or 50 and still take an additional 12 form Mortal or 20 from Demon.) Score - 26.5 like this but 27 just to be safe URL

It can still be useful though) Blood Frenzy (Drawbacks Heavy) - 2 (A great fallback but afterwards this could give disadvantage on ability checks and possibly halved speed. Definitely a last resort. A DM can even use this for good story if its used in front of a crowd.) Purification - -3 (Negative because I didn't want to give the race a vulnerability and non-reducible damage damage for every radiant attack can definitely be deadly if your not careful. Any amount of radiant damage triggers this. You could take 2 or 50 and still take an additional 12 from Mortal or 20 from Demon.) Score - 26.5 like this but 27 just to be safe URL

Unlike a lot of people, I really enjoy the basic mechanics of the 5e Mystic, though I think parts of it should be siphoned off into subclasses. Since the Psychic Warrior in 3.5e was literally just a Fighter with psionic powers, I figured it made a lot of sense to turn it into a 5e Fighter archetype. I've never done homebrew before, but I had a few basic design goals: - Create a subclass roughly in line with the Eldritch Knight, but that doesn't feel like a Psionic copy+paste - Incorporate the key mechanics of 5e psionics: disciplines, talents, psi points/limits - Create a subclass distinct from any of the current Mystic Orders in flavor and mechanics - Build a 1/3 caster table for psionics (which was actually very easy using the DMG spell points system) So I looked at all the other fighter archetypes I could get my hands on (PHB/UA) and compared what each ability does at each level, and looked especially close at Eldritch Knight. I'll pretty this up with Homebrewery and some flavor once I get to a decent state but I think it looks alright for a first draft. *** #Psychic Warrior --- 3rd - Psionics: See the Mystic v3 UA for all the basics on Psi Points, Psi Limits, Disciplines, Focus, Talents. I'm only listing the sections that have changed. - Psionic Talents: At 3rd level, you know three psionic talents: Blade Meld and two others of your choice. At 10th level, you learn one more psionic talent of your choice. - Psionic Disciplines: At 1st level, you know 1 psionic discipline of your choice from the Psychic Warrior Discipline list. The Disciplines Known column of the Psychic Warrior table shows when you learn new disciplines. Each new discipline you learn must be from the Psychic Warrior discipline list. The discipline you learn at 11th level does not have to be from the Psychic Warrior discipline list. - One With The Blade: Beginning when you select this archetype at 3rd level, when you use the blade meld talent, you may gain several special benefits. You may use it with a two handed weapon, fusing one or both hands. You may draw the weapon into your body as a bonus action, freeing your hand and making the weapon impossible to detect without magical means; you may undo this with another bonus action. You can choose to use it on a shield. Finally, you may also use it on two weapons or a weapon and a shield at the same time. 7th - Focused Retaliation: Beginning at 7th level, you learn how to maintain use your concentration to strike back against your foes. If you succeed on a concentration check caused by taking damage, you may use your reaction to immediately make a melee weapon attack or use a talent against the creature that caused you damage. If you hit the weapon, it deals psychic damage instead of its normal type. 10th - Cleave The Consciousness: At 10th level, your weapon strikes open mental weaknesses on your foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, they have vulnerability to the next instance of psychic damage they take before the end of your next turn. This effect can only activate once per turn. - Intellectual Endurance: You gain proficiency on Intelligence saving throws. 15th - Consume Pain: At 15th level, you learn how to repurpose the psychic waves created by your opponent's most primal instincts to your own ends. When you deal fatal damage to a target with a weapon attack, you may use a bonus action to gain temporary psi points equal to half your fighter level. If not used, these psi points disappear at the end of your next turn. You may use this ability once, and it refreshes with a long rest. 18th - Mind Replaces Matter: At 18th level, your mental mastery over your body has reached extreme heights, enabling you to withstand enormous punishment at the cost of your mental fortitude. When you would drop to 0 hit points, you may use your reaction to expend 10 psi points. You instead drop to 1 hit point, and deal 5d12 psychic damage to all enemies in a 10 foot radius. They may make an Intelligence save against your discipline save DC; if they succeed, they take half damage. Until the end of your next turn, you are immune to all conditions and damage other than psychic damage, but you may not take reactions or bonus actions during this time, and the only actions you may take are Dodge or Dash.

I used most of it but rewrote parts. Recently getting into World of Warcraft again and having players getting to medium levels I have been pondering on spell rewards. So i decided to look around and then create more Power Words. This is not balanced at all and will most likely be changed over time. You utter a single word of supreme power, calling on the targets soul to shield them from harm. A protective bubble of energy instantly envelops the recipient, shielding them from harm by absorbing up to [2d6 +1/2levels (max +10)] damage. At higher level spell slots the shield increases by 2d6 This spell can be cast as a reaction or action, preventing a target from taking a degree of damage (and even saving it from death, if the target would otherwise have dropped to 0 While the shield holds overtime effects such as poisoned or on fire instead drain the shield. The shield also blocks magical effects that would move the target or disrupt spellcasting (exempt in an antimagic field) The spell only affects living targets, who have a soul present. After casting this spell, both the caster and recipient gain the Weakened Soul ailment, preventing them from both casting and receiving another Power Word: Shield spell until the next short rest or a lesser restoration. Weakened soul gives you vulnerability to necrotic damage and disadvantage on saves against charmed effects. It also makes the soul harder to detect."
117,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,"Beastmaster Hooks, Flying Plate Armor, Cursed Mask",5,7jdgqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/7jdgqu/beastmaster_hooks_flying_plate_armor_cursed_mask/,2017-12-13 06:59:21,"I've been adjusting a couple homebrew items for my campaign, and wanted the subreddit's opinion and feedback on a few of them. **Highlander Hystoria** turn back now. ## The Items #### Beastmaster Hooks *Requires Attunement.* These magical paired handaxes resemble climbing hooks, and are secured to the wielder's wrists with 20 foot chains. As a bonus action, the wielder may pull the axes back to his/her hands. If the axes are held or embedded within another creature, the wielder must succeed a contested Athletics check. Once per day, as an action, the wielder can cast *Dominate Beast*, with a duration of concentration, up to 24 hrs. To do so, you must successfully hit the target with both Beastmaster Hooks, lodging them into the target, and must remain within 20 feet of it. If you maintain the spell for the entire duration, the effect becomes permanent and the hooks may be removed. Once per 10 days, as an action, the wielder can cast *Dominate Monster* instead of *Dominate Beast*, with a duration of concentration, up to 10 days. To do so, you must successfully hit the target with both Beastmaster Hooks, lodging them into the target, and must remain within 20 feet of it. If you maintain the spell for the entire duration, the effect becomes permanent and the hooks may be removed. The save DC for both of these spells is 8 + Proficiency + Charisma. The effects can be ended by *Dispel Magic*, *Greater Restoration*, or *Wish*, and are suppressed within an *Antimagic Field.* #### Platinum Guardian Platemail *Requires Attunement.* A gleaming suit of plate armor, trimmed with platinum, bears the design of dragon scales and wings. It stands nearly 8 feet tall, clearly built for a warrior of great stature. Once per day, the wearer of this armor may spend an action to cast *fly* without concentration on themselves, sprouting shining mirage dragon wings for the duration. The wings emit light as per a *light* spell. In order to do this, the wearer must either have an oath to Bahamut, or must succeed a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check each time they attempt to use it. This check can only be attempted once per day, resetting at dawn. #### Mask Without Trace *Require attunement.* This featureless black mask contains a subtle magic, but is more powerful than it lets on. As an action, the wearer can cast *Pass Without Trace* without concentration. The wearer also has advantage on deception checks. While wearing the mask, the wearer is blind and has vulnerability to Radiant damage. If they attempt to remove the mask, they must succeed a DC 25 Charisma saving throw. This save can only be attempted once a day. The mask can be removed by *Remove Curse*, *Greater Restoration*, or *Wish* spells. ## Design Rationale The **Beastmaster Hooks** were designed as tools for one of the BBEGs in my campaign, a Pit Fiend with a distrust of other fiends. They allows him to accrue an army of beasts (and other things) that serve him permanently. The save DC uses Charisma because of this, but I am also open to the idea of using a flat DC 15-20. The effects are much less powerful than they look on paper: in order to cast the dominate spells, the target must have been wounded successfully twice with the axes, meaning they would have advantage on the saving throw. Also, they get to re-make the saving throw whenever they take damage. That coupled with the spell being concentration definitely mitigates some of the power of this item. The **Platinum Guardian Platemail** was designed for a Goliath paladin of Bahamut, but has been adjusted to be usable by other classes. The spell does not require concentration, which is pretty powerful. The **Mask Without Trace** is a cursed item, intended to test how players deal with the downsides and upsides it provides. It is incredibly powerful, but also comes with a huge drawback. The spell does not require concentration, which is pretty powerful, and also can be cast at-will. Please let me know what you think!"
118,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Path of the Chaos Weave,3,76z677,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/76z677/path_of_the_chaos_weave/,2017-10-18 02:15:27,"I want to thank /u/skoeger in URL for the idea and much of the content. I have a player that wants to use a wild magic barbarian at my table, but I'm trying to make it into an actual subclass as opposed to just making a magic item that does wild magic surges. Can you guys give me your reaction on the proposed subclass idea? Does it seem unbalanced? I tried to keep it in line with Path of the Totem. Bear totem and Eagle totem grants some incredible bonuses, so I figured these should be decently powerful as well. Thoughts? **Path of the Chaos Weave** Some barbarians have a rage so great that it shatters reality in places, opening unstable rifts of wild magic. Whether they're a freak of nature, from a cursed bloodline, or got caught in a magical mishap is irrelevant; when in pain or under great emotional discord, reality can snap under the weight of the barbarians frenzied mind. **Fraying Threads** Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, the depths of your rage and extreme physical exertion awaken an unstable connection with the weave. While raging, after you attack or are hit by a magical effect, the DM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the Chaotic Magic Surge table. **Forcing Fates Hand** Starting at 3rd level, as a bonus action you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to force an enemy within 60 feet to have disadvantage on one attack, ability check or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again. Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Chaotic Magic Surge table immediately after you attack or take damage. You then regain the use of this feature. **See what is not Seen** At 6th level, your unconscious connection to the magical weave allows you to sense things others cannot. You can feel the weave bend around you while raging, allowing you to see invisible creatures within melee range of you. **Tearing the Weave** Beginning at 10th level, if a creature within melee range of you casts a spell, you can use your reaction to overload your rage and break the weave around you. Your rage ends on using this ability. This has the effect of the spell Antimagic Field, centered on the ground you stood on at the moment of the reaction. The effect lasts for one round, then disappears as the weave repairs itself. This can be used once per short rest. **The Fabric of Reality** At 14th level, as a bonus action, you can sacrifice an equal amount of movement to instead teleport up to a maximum of 30 ft in any direction to an unoccupied space. **Chaotic Magic Surge Table** 01-02 Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls. 03-04 For the next minute, you can see any invisible creature if you have line of sight to it. 05-06 A modron chosen and controlled by the DM appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later. 07-08 You cast fireball as a 3rd-level spell centered on yourself. 09-10 You cast magic missile as a 5th-level spell 11-12 Roll a d10. Your height changes by a number of inches equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you shrink. If the roll is even, you grow. 13-14 You cast confusion centered on yourself. 15-16 For the next minute, you regain 5 hit points at the start of each of your turns. 17-18 You grow a long beard made of feathers that remains until you sneeze, at which point the feathers explode out from your face. 19-20 You cast grease centered on yourself. 21-22 You have advantage on your next saving throw. 23-24 Your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue. A remove curse spell can end this effect. 25-26 An eye appears on your forehead for the next minute. During that time, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. 27-28 For the next minute, if you take the attack action, you may make an additional attack as a bonus action. 29-30 You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see. 31-32 You are transported to the Astral Plane for the next minute, after which time you return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. 33-34 Maximize the damage of your next attack that hits in the next minute. 35-36 Roll a d10. Your age changes by a number of years equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you get younger (minimum 1 year old). If the roll is even, you get older. 37-38 1d6 flumphs controlled by the DM appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are frightened of you. They vanish after 1 minute. 39-40 You regain 2d10 hit points. 41-42 You turn into a potted plant until the start of your next turn. While a plant, you are incapacitated and have vulnerability to all damage. If you drop to 0 hit points, your pot breaks, and your form reverts. 43-44 For the next minute, you can teleport up to 20 feet as a bonus action on each of your turns. 45-46 You cast levitate on yourself. 47-48 A unicorn controlled by the DM appears in a space within 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later. 49-50 You can't speak for the next minute. Whenever you try, pink bubbles float out of your mouth. 51-52 A spectral shield hovers near you for the next minute, granting you a +2 bonus to AC and immunity to magic missile. 53-54 You are immune to being intoxicated by alcohol for the next 5d6 days. 55-56 Your hair falls out but grows back within 24 hours. 57-58 For the next minute, any flammable object you touch that isn't being worn or carried by another creature bursts into flame. 59-60 You regain 1 use of rage. 61-62 For the next minute, you must shout when you speak. 63-64 You cast fog cloud centered on yourself. 65-66 Up to three creatures you choose within 30 feet of you take 4d10 lightning damage. 67-68 You are frightened by the nearest creature until the end of your next turn. 69-70 Each creature within 30 feet of you becomes invisible for the next minute. The invisibility ends on a creature when it attacks or casts a spell. 71-72 You gain resistance to all damage for the next minute. 73-74 A random creature within 60 feet of you becomes poisoned for 1d4 hours. 75-76 You glow with bright light in a 30-foot radius for the next minute. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you is blinded until the end of its next turn. 77-78 You cast polymorph on yourself. If you fail the saving throw you turn into a sheep for the spell's duration. 79-80 Illusory butterflies and flower petals flutter in the air within 10 feet of you for the next minute. 81-82 You can take one additional action immediately. 83-84 Each creature within 30 feet of you takes 1d10 necrotic damage. You regain hit points equal to the sum of the you necrotic damage dealt. 85-86 You cast mirror image. 87-88 You cast fly on a random creature within 60 feet of you. 89-90 You become invisible for the next minute. 91-92 If you die within the next minute, you immediately come back to life as if by the reincarnate spell. 93-94 Your size increases by one size category for the next minute. 95-96. You and all creatures within 30 feet of you gain vulnerability to piercing damage for the next minute. 97-98 You are surrounded by faint, ethereal music for the next minute. 99-100 You cast Time Stop on yourself.

But I did end up making a few items which I think had a very good and bad impact. Critique if you guys don't mind. **Amulet of the Frost Wyrm -** Amulet (Rare) Requires Attunement. A silver dollar sized amulet of solid sapphire which gives off a faint snow fall near the gem itself. You are vulnerable to fire damage while attuned to this item. Once per long rest, As an action, you can lift the amulet to your mouth and blow into the back of the amulet, allowing you to cast the Cone of Cold spell at base level (5) with a spell dc of 15. If you do, you lose your vulnerability to fire until you finish a long rest (Which recharges the amulet) **Gaia's Tear -** Magical Item (Gem) - No attunement. A palm sized, tear shaped gem made of a mixture of Lapis and Cobalt. This gem is warm to the touch and gives off very faint light, no more then a match heads worth. Dropping this item into any form of non defiled soil, sprouts a bountiful feast that can feed up to 5 creatures. The feast grants the creatures who eat for at least 10 mins, immunity to the poisoned status and resistance to poison damage along with 2d10 maximum hit points for a duration of 8 hours.

Dullahan resemble undead due to their headlessness but both head and body are kept alive by a curse. Inclined to travel at night by Unseele magic and their own appearance, grim folklore has sprung up about them. Dullahan are created by Unseele fey when they decapitate a human as part of a dark ritual. ###**Physical Appearance:** Dullahan resembe humans with either dark tan or pale blue skin. Their eyes are black and their hair can be any natural color but is frequently black, gray, or white. Dullahan's mouthes are very wide and reach the sides of their heads. ###**Dullahan Names:** Dullahan true names tend toward repeating syllables. They don't willingly reveal their true names to any but another Dullahan, simply because they don't like to appear foolish to the mortal races. Some dullahan take on human names or nicknames when interacting with other races. **Male**: *Mnoh Vis, Khit Tuc, Frur Tor, ...* **Female**: *LaLa, MeiMei, ViVi, ...* **Nicknames**: *Grim, Celty, Headless Nick, ...* ###**Dullahan Traits:** **Ability Score Increase:** Your Charisma increases by 2 and two ability scores of your choice increase by 1. **Alignment:** Dullahan tend toward neutral alignments. **Size:** Dullahan are about the height of a human. As a Dullahan you are a medium creature. **Speed:** Your walking speed is 30 ft. **Languages:** You speak Common and Sylvan. **Darkvision:** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in Darkness as if it were dim light. You cant discern color in Darkness, only shades of gray. **Intimidating:** You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill. **Trance:** You do not need to sleep. Instead, you enter a dormant state remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. **Headless:** You cannot be killed by decapitation. You may attach or detach your head at will. You always know the distance and direction to your head unless it is on another plane. Your head does not take damage while it is separate from you. When separate, both head and body can see and hear. Your headless body cannot speak but can eat and drink as well as cast spells, even spells with verbal components. **Unseele Magic:** You know the thaumaturgy cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level you can cast *'find steed'* once per long rest. The mount conjured is considered a fey creature, can be stored in your shadow as an action, and can be retrieved as a bonus action. Once you reach 5th level you can cast *'knock'* once per long rest. **Weakness to Gold:** You have vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from gold plated weapons. If you are carrying or touching anything made of gold make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or drop/release the item. Repeat this save every turn you carry the gold. ###**Dullahan Quirks** (1d6) If you want to roll randomly. 1. I hate when people watch me. A glance is forgivable but staring is insufferable. 2. I have vague memories of the life I lived before becoming a Dullahan. 3. I get an itch when someone nearby is close to death. 4. I am restless at night and prone to wandering. 5. I'm comfortable around gore, I'm rather gruesome to look at myself. 6. I always call people by name."

Your size is Small. ***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 30 feet. ***Amphibious.*** You can breathe air and water. ***Brave.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. ***Nimble.*** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours. ***Noodle Arms.*** You have disadvantage on attack rolls you make with weapons that have the *heavy* property. ***Poison Resiliency.*** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage. ***Swimmer.*** You have a swimming speed of 30 feet. ***Tongue Action.*** As an action, you can use your tongue to perform certain actions. You can treat your tongue as a 5 foot rope, and you can use it to grapple one creature within 5 feet of you. If your tongue is being used as a rope or to grapple, taking any kind of damage immediately retracts the tongue back into your mouth. ***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Aquan. ***Subraces.*** Choose one from Creek, Toad, or Tree. &gt; **Frog Variant: Tall Frog** &gt; &gt; Some frogs have an ancestry of being taller than their smaller counterparts. If your DM allows, you can choose to remove the Nimble and Noodle Arms traits, and your size becomes Medium. Your height becomes 5 to 6.5 feet tall, and you can weigh between 70 and 170 pounds. **Subraces** &gt; **Creek** ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity, Intelligence, and Wisdom scores each increase by 1. ***Alignment.*** Lawful, Good. ***Better Swimmer.*** Your swimming speed is increased by 10 feet. &gt; **Toad** ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution and Strength scores both increase by 1. ***Alignment.*** Chaotic, Neutral. ***Acid Resistance.*** You have resistance to acid damage. ***Acidic Skin.*** When you are hit with a melee attack, or are willingly touched by a creature, you can use your reaction to activate this trait. For 1 minute, any creature which hits you with a melee attack, or willingly touches you, must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, the creature takes acid damage equal to your Constitution modifier, or takes no damage on a successful save. Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest. ***Breath Weapon.*** You can use your action to vomit a toxic fluid. This produces a 15 foot cone, dealing acid damage. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the vomiting must make a Dexterity saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest. ***Boiling Point.*** You have a vulnerability to fire and lightning damage. &gt; **Tree** ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2. ***Alignment.*** Neutral, Good. ***Frog Legs.*** Your standing jump distance is equal to your running jump distance. ***Tree Climber.*** You have a climbing speed of 20 feet. ***Acrobat.*** You gain proficiency in Acrobatics."
123,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,My Rework for Lore Mastery Wizard,1,76jvr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/76jvr4/my_rework_for_lore_mastery_wizard/,2017-10-16 03:20:21,"Hello, folks! I personally love the flavor text of the lore master wizard: the idea of studying the underlying core of magic is unique and something that needs to be emphasized in a subclass. However, we can mostly agree the original was very loaded and overpowered, so I went about making a rework that still kept the mechanics I thought defined the subclass, but tweaked them and also deleted any unnecessary mechanics. I made this with homebrewery: URL And now for an overview of my thought process for each of these features: Lore Master: This feature I kept, as I don't think it is necessarily too harmful. It provides a few nice non-spell-related capabilities for this subclass, so I think it works fine. Magical Formula: I pretty much took Spell Secrets and expanded it into two traits. Since the original lore master had the ability to bypass any resistance, negate any immunity, and exploit any vulnerability a monster had by swapping the damage to anything, I decided to restrict different damage to ""damage suites"". They can still sometimes bypass these resistances and immunities, such as swapping cold to fire damage for trolls. Spell Transmutation: The biggest new trait I've made. I think by making the new saving throw forms new spells that have to be prepared, this restricts ""on-the-fly"" changes. Even at 20 Int at Maximum Level, you could only get all 6 save types for 4 spells, and then you would have 1 spell left to prepare. So this trait now has the trade-off of negating versatility in exchange for its powerful features. Prodigious Memory: This made lots of sense flavor-wise, and now actually made more sense mechanic-wise due to Spell Transmutation, so I kept it. Master of Magic: I think the original Master of Magic trait. was one of the most over-looked pieces of OP in the Lore Master. Now they have to think before hand about what spells they want, and have to prepare them. So, overall, I'd say the big changes I made were taxing the Lore Mastery Wizard's number of prepared spells in order for them to get the full output from their traits. I personally love the flavor, as I've said before, but I know very few DMs (myself included) allow the original, so I hope this version is far more balanced. I made sure to think whether or not I, as someone who loves playing wizards more than anything else, would enjoy the abilities, but feel free to critique how fun they are. Also feel free to critique balance, or really critique any part of my rework. I just ask that you attempt to offer some alternatives or suggestions to supplement your critique."
124,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,[class] The Revenant - a bloodknight/bloodmage scrapper empowered by their ancestors. Feedback appreciated!,0,6voltp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/6voltp/class_the_revenant_a_bloodknightbloodmage/,2017-08-24 14:45:39,"URL As I mention in the title, this would benefit from your feedback. I'm brand new to making a Homebrew class and I figure that must be apparent to you veterans. Considerations I had while trying to balance: - Health costs should temper an eager player's brash decisions, to a point. - Intended as a high risk, high reward character... Akin in flavor to a Barbarian, somewhat. - Action Economy is meant to interfere with itself at some points, making particular use of Bonus Actions to force players to choose between utilities that would be too much if taken together. Now, I could use help or suggestions on particular subjects. The following areas are things I've gone back and forth about, in revision after revision, and I still don't know how they should finally sit. Mostly these relate to the Revenant's survivability. - Hit Dice, currently listed at 1d8 but for the longest time my drafts had it be a 1d6. Thoughts? - Armor Proficiencies include Heavy, mostly because they are not skilled in using Shields, meaning they'll expect to cap out at 18 AC for a warrior who needs to be in melee to replenish the health they're spending on special abilities. How do you see that working -- too high, or just the right amount of vulnerability? - Contempt is their go-to damage mitigation, but the ""shielding"" used to be about half as powerful in previous drafts. What is chosen should be directly impacted by how often the Revenant should get hit, and it will directly inform the player of how risky to be with their Sigil use. - Some of the Sigils definitely smell like they're too powerful, but I ran out of creative juices for how to keep their spirit intact while still gently balancing them. I could impose a Level restriction to most of them, but that feels increasingly artificial. I welcome any errant thoughts you have. This thing's the product of weeks of work, I want to try and balance it well. Thanks! Edit: I'm still finding a lot of typos and areas where I could clarify something better. Balls..."
125,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Race: Lesser Treants [5e],7,6wnja7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/6wnja7/race_lesser_treants_5e/,2017-08-29 10:08:16,"Hey guys! I've been working on this homebrew. I'd love your feedback. Check it out. **[Homebrewery Link](URL I have created this race after that I have discovered that Warforged couldn't be able to become druids as, according to the general rule, they were made of metal, and we all know that the druids do not like that. And so I came up with Lesser Treants which evolved into this! I hope you all liked this and have fun in your future campaigns playing as lesser treants! I accept feedback about this, which would give great help. Edit! 1.1? I have heard feedback and edited the Race. Here is some big changes! - You do not need sunlight to have a long rest, however, if you wish to have a quicker long rest, you must be at sunlight. This changes to each subrace however, Ashenbark needing a heat source and Sunshy just needing at the dark or digesting organic material (such as food and... well.. corpses) - Renamed Strong Bark to Iron Bark. No longer there will be a vulnerability to fire, as seems to be a bit too much, instead they take one additional die of fire damage when they take the fire damage. However, if you, the DM, wish you may give it to the player, however the Ashenbark will not receive the vulnerability. - The Sunshy gained a new trait! Defensive Spores! To compensate the Sunlight Sensitivity. - I separated improved Unarmed Strikes from Powerful Build for Ashenbark, calling it Strong Branches. Plus they now have 25 feet speed instead. There are other changes I have made but I thought they're too minor to be talked about. So, see for yourself! And as always, feedback is always welcome!"
126,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,The 5e Psion (1st draft),10,6zov0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/6zov0r/the_5e_psion_1st_draft/,2017-09-13 04:28:23,"**Class Features** --- As a psion, you gain the following class features. Hit Points Hit dice: d6 per psion level Hit points at 1st level: 6 + your Constitution modifier Hit points at higher levels: 1d6 (or 4) per psion level after 1st *Proficiencies* Armor: none Weapons: Daggers, darts, slings, quarter staffs, clubs, light crossbows Tools: None Saving throws: Intelligence, Constitution Skills: Investigation *Equipment* You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: *(a) a quarter staff or (b) a club *(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any two simple weapons *(a) a scholars pack or (b) an explorers pack Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment here and in your background, and buy 3d4  10 gp worth of equipment from chapter 5 in the Players Handbook. **Telepathy** --- At 1st level, your mind awakens to the ability to communicate via telepathy. You can speak telepathically to any creature within 60 feet of you. The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language. You can speak telepathically in this way to one creature at a time. **Unarmored Defense** --- At 1st level the power of your mind both works to subtly deflect blows and solidify your bodily form. When not wearing any armor or shield your AC is equal to 10 plus your intelligence modifier plus either your wisdom or charisma modifier. **Psionic Spell-casting** --- At 1st level your psionic powers awaken. Psions do not unitize arcane, divine, or primal magic. Instead you stare the universe in the eye and will it to blink first through understanding mystic truths that give you power over the world. However, to the layman there is not really much of an observable difference between what you can do and any other magic. These spell-like effects may have a different root cause but the effect they create is made of the world and its constitute magic and is thus no different from any spell initiated by any other type of spell caster. Things which effect normal spells also effect your psionic abilities. *-Cantrips-* You know 3 cantrips from the Psion spell list. You can cast them without material components.You learn additional Psion cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Psion table. *-Psionic Power-* At 1st level you have a number of power points equal to your Psion level. You can spend power points to cast spells or to augment your Psion abilities. You may cast a spell you know by expending a number of Power Points equal to the spell's rank (cantrips are spell-rank 0). You may expend additional power points to cast a spell of 1st rank or higher at a more powerful spell-rank. You do not need material components to cast spells. You regain power points up to your maximum after a short or long rest. *-Spells Known of 1st level or Higher-* Starting at 1st level, you know a number of spells from the psion spell-list equal to half your psion level rounded up. As you gain levels you learn new spells at this same rate but each new spell you learn must have a spell-rank equal to half of your psion level rounded up. *-Spellcasting Ability-* Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your psion spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psion spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier **Mental Discipline** At 1st level you choose a psionic discipline. The epiphany which provoked your psionic powers was brought on by dedication to a certain school of thought, a way of thinking, or a conceptual lens through which to view existence. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. **Mental Focus** Starting at 2nd level, as an action you can begin to concentrate on one of three mystical concepts as you would on a spell. You can maintain this focus until your concentration is broken or you become unconsciousness. While maintaining a focus you may also choose to concentrate on up to one spell that requires concentration, however if you fail a constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, both the spell and the focus end. While maintaining a focus you gain the following benefits and you are also considered to know spells from the following list according to your psion level. You retain the benefits of your selected focus for as long as you maintain concentration on it. **-Focus of Mind-** You are proficient in the skills Insight and Persuasion. If you are already proficient in either or both of those skills your proficiency bonus doubles. You have advantage on initiative rolls. Your telepathy range increases to 120 feet. ... | *Spells* --------- | --------- 1st level | *Dissonant Whispers, Command* 3rd level | *Phantasmal Force, Suggestion* 5th level | *Fear, Major Image* 7th level | *Confusion, Phantasmal Killer* 9th level | *Modify Memory* **-Focus of Power-** You are proficient in the skills Athletics and Intimidation. If you are already proficient in either or both of those skills your proficiency bonus doubles. You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls and your spell save.

If you are already proficient in either or both of those skills your proficiency bonus doubles. You have a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws. Magic cannot create difficult terrain within 5 feet of you against your will. .. | *Spells* --------- | --------- 1st level | *Earth Tremor, Expeditious Retreat* 3rd level | *Enlarge/Reduce, Enhance Ability* 5th level | *Counterspell, Hunger of Hadar* 7th level | *Polymorph, Evard's Black Tentacles* 9th level | *Passwall* **Augment Technique** --- At 3rd Level you gain the ability to stretch and modify your Psion abilities. At any time when you cast a spell you may apply one of the following affects. *Burst Augmentation* When you cast a psion spell that targets only one creature and doesnt have a range of self, you can spend a number of power points equal to the spells rank to instead target two creatures within 15 feet of each other, as long as both are within range of the spell (1 power point if the spell is a cantrip). *Expertise Augmentation* When you cast a psion cantrip that does not deal damage you may spend one power point to cast it as a bonus action. *Force Augmentation* When you cast a psion spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 power points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell. **Ability Score Improvement** --- When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you cant increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. **Potent Psionics** --- At 7th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon attacks with psychic energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon, you can deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to that target. When you reach 14th level, this extra damage increases to 2d8. In addition, once per turn you may add your Intelligence modifier to any damage roll you make for a psionic spell. **Power Reserves** --- At 11th level your expertise at meditation has allowed your power to grow by leaps and bounds. You gain 6 Reserve Points which can be spend just like Power Points to cast or augment psionic spells. You only regain these reserve points after a long rest. *At 13th level your reserve points increase to 13. *At 15th level your reserve points increase to 21. *At 17th level your reserve points increase to 30. **Universal Translator** --- Starting at 12th level, you learn telepathically interact with other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand your speech. **Eternal Watch** --- Starting at 13th level you no longer need to sleep. To gain the benefits of a long rest, you can spend 8 hours engaged in light activity, rather than sleeping during any of it. **Uncarnate** --- At 18th level you begin to become something more than mortal. You gain the following benefits: *Difficult terrain no longer hinders you. *You are immune to disease. *You no longer need to eat or drink. **Expert Meditation** --- At 19th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power to regain power points. You can spend 1 minute mediating to regain all your expended power points from your Psionic Power feature. Once you regain power points with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. **Psionic Body** --- At 20th level, your mastery of psionic power causes your mind to transcend the body. Your physical form is infused with psionic energy. You gain the following benefits: *You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. *You no longer age. *You are immune to poison damage, and the poisoned condition. *If you die, roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, you discorporate with 0 hit points, instead of dying, and you fall unconscious. You and your gear disappear. You appear at a spot of your choice 1d3 days later on the plane of existence where you died, having gained the benefits of one long rest. **Subclasses** -Telepathic Discipline- --- The key of intellect is the ability to control one's own mind. A regimented system of thought has allowed you to achieve great clarity, not just in your own head but in others' too. Other creatures are so distracted by notions and instinct and their own false perceptions that it sometimes feels like you are the only seeing person in a land of the blind. With that ability you can gently those around you to a better future, or you can send them all walking off a cliff. The choice is yours. **Private Reality** You gain the Delusion cantrip. When you cast it you may choose for it to effect two creatures at once. This does not count against your psion cantrips known. **Distract** Starting at 1st level, on your turn as a bonus action you can psionically influence one creature you can see within 30 feet. The next attack roll or charisma check made against that creature before the end of your next turn is made with advantage. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your ability twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. You may spend a power point to regain a single use. **Master of Minds** 6th level, you learn the spell Detect Thoughts and can cast it without expending power points and without verbal or material components. If you already know this spell it still gains these benefits but you may instead learn one psion spell of equal or lower rank. **Mindlink** At 10th level any creature you are aware of within range of your telepathy cannot benefit from concealment against you or your allies. You also gain resistance to psychic damage. **Very Distracting** At 10th level you can choose to be invisible to creatures targeted by your distract ability until the end of your next turn. **Thrallherd** At 14th level, you gain the ability to overwrite a humanoids mind with your own will. You can use your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid. That creature is then charmed by you until a remove curse spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, or you use this feature again. You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. ::: -Telekinetic Discipline- --- Your psionic epiphany was exhilarating. Just by a thought, your hand reaches out to grasp a cup and lifts it. It is the thought that initiates the motion, not the hand. Sure enough, your thought went out and the cup was lifted, while your hand did not move. In that moment the entire universe was at your fingertips. All the world was within reach, if only you could figure out how to grasp it. **Mind over Matter** You learn the cantrip Mage Hand and can cast it as a psion cantrip without verbal components. This does not count against your psion cantrips known. When you cast Mage Hand, the spectral hand is invisible. You can have two of these cantrip effects active at the same time. **Force Push** Starting at 1st level, on your turn as a bonus action you can choose a creature or object medium size and smaller you can see within 30 feet of you and slide it 15 feet in any direction, but not into hindering terrain. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your ability twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. **Mental Grasp** At 6th level, you learn the spell Levitate and can cast it without without verbal or material components. If you are the target of the spell, while held aloft you can move up to 5 feet horizontally per turn as part of your move. If you already know this spell it still gains these benefits but you may instead learn one psion spell of equal or lower rank. **Warp the World** At 10th level your raw mental force can bend space around you. Once on your turn you can teleport up to 30 feet to a spot you can see. Each foot of teleportation uses 1 foot of your movement. You can also use this feature to teleport someone else. As an action, you can teleport a willing creature you touch to a spot you can see within 30 feet. Once you use either option you can not use this feature for 3 rounds. **Interdicting Space** At 10th level hostile creatures can not teleport within 30 feet of you while you are conscious. **The Way is Open** Starting at 14th level your ability to assert your will against the world has grown to terrifying levels. As an action you may cause a five foot rift in reality to appear in an unoccupied space within 60 feet. When it appears, the black void begins to suck in unsecured creatures and objects. Creatures that begin their turn within 30 feet of the rift must make a strength saving throw or be pulled 15 feet towards the rift. If this movement takes the creature inside the rift it is removed from play and takes 3d10 psychic damage. At the beginning of the creature's next turn, if it is conscious, it claws its way out of the rift and appears in an adjacent space. Within 30 feet of the rift, moving 1 foot away from the rift costs 2 feet of movement. The rift persists for 3 rounds, after which it vanishes. You regain use of this ability after a long rest. ::: -Shaper Discipline- --- Many philosophers have stated that the most fundamental idea is ""I think, therefor I am."" You have taken this one step further to arrive at the conclusion, ""I think, therefor I decide what is."" Not only is the world a matter of opinion, but so too is your own existence. Followers of this psionic disciple view all of reality as pure thought, fragmented aspects of a cosmic Over Mind. All of reality is an illusion, you are just one of the few to comprehend that. Individuals of this mindset strive to peer beyond existence to see the essence of truth, but sometimes things in the darkness beyond existence peer back. **Minor Creation** As an action you can conjure a nonliving, nonmagical object that appears within 5 feat, either in an unoccupied square, in your hand, or in an allys hand. The object lasts for one minute or until you dismiss it as a free action. The object you conjure is a single weapon or an item listed under Adventuring Gear, page 150 of the Players Handbook. At the Dungeon Masters discretion, you can create some other nonmagical object no larger than one that a Medium creature can carry. **Shard of Consciousness** At 1st level as a bonus action conjure a fragment of your consciousness that lasts for one minute, or until you lose your concentration as if you were concentrating on a spell. The fragment appears as a swirling mote of light in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As bonus action on your turn, you can move the fragment up to a distance equal to your speed to a space that has line of sight to your body, but it must remain within 60 feet of you. For the duration, you can see, hear, and cast spells as though you were in the fragments space. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your ability twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. You may spend a power point to regain a single use. **Mutable Flesh** 6th level, you learn the spell Alter Self and can cast it without expending power points and without verbal or material components. If you already know this spell it still gains these benefits but you may instead learn one psion spell of equal or lower level. **Avatar** Starting the 10th level you gain the ability to more perfectly manifest your mind outside your body. When you use your Shard of Consciousness ability you can choose to instead manifest an Avatar. The avatar shares your true appearance and your defenses. It lasts, until it takes any damage, you fall unconscious, you dismiss it as a bonus action, or until you use this power again. Your avatar shares all other traits of your shard of consciousness ability, except it does not need to remain within 60 feet of you and does not require line of sight to your body. You remain in constant contact with it as long as you are on the same plane. You may have only one avatar manifested at a time. **Limited Omnipresence** Starting at 10th level, as a bonus action you can teleport, switching places with your avatar. **A New Realm** Starting at the 14th level you begin to change the properties of the world around you. As an action psionic energy washes out from you transforming all surfaces within 30 feet into a tangle of warped ground, glowing crystal spars, and wisps of black smoke. This area is difficult terrain. Creatures within 30 feet of the casting point have a thin coat of the crystals begin to grow over their body, giving them vulnerability to all damage until after the first time they take damage. All these changes last for for one minute after which the crystals waver out of existence. You may choose any number of creatures to be immune to these effects. You regain use of this ability after a long rest. "

The first weapon(Vi'Keesh) is intended to be found ""naturally"" during an adventure while the second weapon has to be sought out by the PC's in a separate adventure and is optional. Twin kukri of the ancient serpent king, ThyDol. ThyDol, the 1,000 year king ruled over the yuan-ti in the early days of civilization. Uniting the Yuan-ti as a single kingdom - he was responsible for the near extinction of The First Elves in the Jade &amp; Emerald War. ThyDol, wielding his twin kukri, tore apart the elves in battle. Every blow he struck inflicted them with a deadly venom, felling elves with ease. After ThyDols fall in battle the Great King of the Yuan-ti collapsed, as the survivors fought amongst themselves, clashing for power. AKeesh, the once great capital of The Kingdom of Jade is the last remnants of ThyDols legacy. ViKeesh, The Serpents Maw - A deep crimson runs through the black hilt of the blade, flowing into the blade like veins in your arm. The metal comes to a fine, sharp point. The slightest touch draws blood. +1 kukri (Scimitar). Eviscerate (Once per long rest): On hit you can use this effect to give advantage to the next attack you make with any weapon. In addition, this enemy is susceptible to poison until the end of your next turn. Poison Immunity -&gt; Resistance Resistance - &gt; Normal Normal -&gt; Vulnerability Dastal, The Scorpions Sting - This jade dagger glows a faint green. Yellow gemstones are embedded within the snake skin hilt. A, small droplet of light-green liquid coalesces at the tip of the blade, that sizzles with anything it makes contact with. +1 kukri(Scimitar) Envenom: All attacks made with this weapon deal an additional 1d4 poison damage. Attunement to both kukri gives PC slight Serpent properties -Eyes turn a light-green w/ black slits as pupils -Ss are pronounced with more emphasis -Able to speak Draconic I'm hoping to synergize the two weapons so that they are stronger together."
128,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Looking for Feedback on a Homebrew Monk Tradition for 5e,4,6rjcbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/6rjcbc/looking_for_feedback_on_a_homebrew_monk_tradition/,2017-08-04 19:22:38,"First off; some backstory on the idea for the class and why I made it. We're getting ready for a new 5e campaign and with so people wanting to play spellcasters, I took it upon myself to play a martial class for diversity (I really wanted to play a Wizard though). I'm a huge Monk fan, but noticed that we didn't really have a real tank in the party so far, as our Fighter was opting for a ranged fighter, and our ""cleric"" is actually going to be a Favored Soul Warlock. So we needed a tanky frontline character, but I don't like playing mindless Barbarians, we already had a fighter and Paladins aren't my style. Dodge tank Monk is all I have left but still too fragile for my liking. Before I got around to actually doing class work on the character, some members of the party just started hashing out character concepts, and I knew I wanted to be a monk by then. After talking about how people normally see monks, I explained to them why the Monks I had played in the past were never from real monasteries or very religious and had an overall theme of ""self-empowerment"". To me; [this is not the image](URL that pops into mind when I think of a monk. I don't think of the monk who seeks to follow a code, empty their mind and train their body in search of enlightenment. [This is the image](URL that pops into my head. A person who tries to prove just how resilient the body can be with enough training and willpower. The person whose version of meditation is sitting under a waterfall in the middle of winter and being able to shrug off the pain and resist the worst that nature can throw at him. With specifically the example of the waterfall in the middle of winter, and idea for a tradition came to mind that focused less on wisdom, insight, and mediation; and more on willpower and physical resiliance. I'm crap at naming things, so the pending name is the Way of Natures Endurance, and the class is outlined [here](URL --------------------------- **Everything below this line talks about the features in the link above, how they are supposed to function and my logic for designing them as such. Don't read past this unless you have read the source page.** Overall, the standard Monk wants his ability scores in the following priority: Dexterity > Wisdom > Constitution > Literally Everything Else with minor exceptions due to flavor. Dex is obvious because its your damage stat, initiative provider, an excellent save and a buff to your AC. That doesn't change. However, the order for the Natures Endurance monk switches the priority of Constitution and Wisdom. By changing your Unarmored Defense, your Constitution stat buffs your health, AC, a save, and your overall healthiness because of Hit Dice rules and later tradition rules. Wisdom is still more important than other stats due to it being an important save and your Ki save DC still running off of it, but with the AC shift the priority quickly shifts as well. You're still MAD like most monks, but the priority is switched around to gain more tankiness in exchange for greater mental weakness. I firmly believe that the role of ""Tanky Damage Dealer"" belongs to the Barbarian, and did not want to encroach upon his territory. To do so, I made it so that the Natures Endurance Monk has to choose between offense and defense. Since a Monks damage output is enhanced by his bonus action (Martial Arts and Flurry of Blows both use your bonus action), I made the Natures Endurance monk use that action whenever buffing his defenses. To solidify its position as a flexible off tank, I also built in incentives to not just tank constantly, and rather to switch things up. Spamming defensive abilities consumes more and more Ki as they're used consecutively. For example, using your Empowered Body resistance to Piercing, Bludgeoning, and Slashing damage for 3 turns takes up a bonus action for every turn its used, and a total of 6 Ki points for those three turns (1+2+3 Ki points per turn). The basics are available at 3rd level for a Ki point and bonus action. One gives you resistance to Cold, Fire and Lightning damage (common elemental damage). The other gives you resistance to Bludgeoning, Slashing, and Piercing (standard physical damage). To provide some utility, I also gave the Tradition access to a way of absorbing additional AoE damage to party members within range of himself. Essentially he can reduce the damage done to nearby allies on reaction, and then take that damage total damage himself at a reduced total. For example; suppose a 8d6 fireball hits Mr. Monk and his 3 friends within 10 feet of him. Assuming average damage of fireball per person each would take 24 damage. Mr. Monk reduces the damage to each of his friends by 7 since he's a 7th Level monk. They each take 17 damage. He totals the damage he prevented, and gets 21 (3 friends, 7 damage reduced each). He then reduces that total by his Monk level for a new total of 14 damage. He then takes that damage himself for 38 total damage (Original 24 plus the 14 ""mitigated"" damage). Under normal circumstances, he would have taken 24 and the party have taken 96 total. With this ability, he takes 38 damage and the party only takes 89 damage. Since he's 7th level, he also can evade the damage, and if successful further reduces this damage down to 0 to himself and 51 to the party, cutting the total damage done almost in half. Its a decent way of providing some utility to the party by absorbing some damage and then mitigating it if they're within range of him. With all of this focus on taking hits and waves of vulnerability, I also gave this tradition access to a form of recovery at level 6, but not at will. You get to triple the constitution bonus when using Hit Dice, once again giving incentive to have a high constitution score. I drew inspiration from the Way of the Open Hands healing ability and used it as a baseline since its normally considered an okay form of recovery for a monk (At will, decent HP). Since the healing is not at will, and you only regain half hit dice on long rest compared to Wholeness of Body fully recharging off long rest, the healing needs to be greater overall to have a meaningful effect compared to Wholeness of Body. At level 6 and +3 Con you get a total of 36 extra healing, contrasted to Wholeness 18 at will. At level 12 and +4 Con you get 96 points of extra healing (Since you get 8 ""extra"" healing per hit die compared to the normal 4. 8x12 is 96) compared to 36 at will with the Open Hand Monk. **This is however, assuming that you use the entirety of your hit dice every long rest.** If you consider longevity and only using half the hit dice, it gets more reasonable; breaking even in the first scenario and only 12 ahead in the second. Overall, if things get really bad it gives the Monk access to a rather large health pool when all things are considered. At level 12 and +4 Con at Second ASI you have 104 health if you don't roll for HP. Using all Hit dice with average rolls you get 296 HP to burn through fully if you're good at managing it. Consider the fact that you also can throw in resistance a decent amount of time (lets say half the time, or 1.5x effective HP), and you get roughly 446 raw HP of damage that you can tank at that point (For comparison, Way of Open Hand with +2 Con at level 1 gets 87 HP, 72 average HP from Hit dice, and 36 from Wholeness for a total of 195 HP to burn through since you lack resists. You're noticeably tankier if you have to burn all your resources). At this point though, you can't calculate the damage mitigation from dodges or evasion. Overall, you're pretty tough to take down if **you use your abilities right and do so over a period of time. You get zero self healing in combat, only during rests** As you get more experienced, you become more formidable. By 11th level you can use 5 Ki points to gain resistance to all forms of damage (once again using a bonus action), and increasing by 2 for each consecutive use. Or you can use your reaction and 5 Ki points for advantage on the next Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or Wisdom saving throw (Physical saves and what I consider willpower, makes sense thematically). More overall tankiness and saves. You also become very hard to move by force, gaining advantage on any save to do so, and granting a save if there is none. DC is equal to the typical formula for DC Saves, 8+Prof+Mod. For example, Pushing Attack from Warmaster would be 8+Prof+Str/Dex for the DC and you would get advantage on that save. If you were being pushed by Repelling Blast from a Warlock though, you would normally not get a save, you just get pushed. This ability grants you a save, against the spellcasting mod from the Warlock. Make sense? For the 17th level ability I took inspiration from the Barbarian and gave you a way to shrug off dropping to zero by just refusing to fall unconscious when your body should long ago have fallen apart. For 8 Ki points and a reaction you can stay conscious until the end of your next turn. If you get hit again however, you basically start making additional concentration saves to keep the ability going. Can only be used once per long rest, so no short rest never dying shenanigans. If you would instantly die, you don't get to use this ability. Gotta maintain some form of realism. That overall sums up the combat applications. To enhance flavor, I also included some non-combat resilience to showcase your absurd endurance. As you progress, you gain access to these abilities, they're not all from the get go. For a Ki point you can hold your breath for much longer than normal (Think Jedi-Like), basically adding your monk level to the normal suffocation equation of 1 + Con Mod minutes. You don't gain exhaustion from extreme heat or cold. Additionally, you start exhaustion differently from others, starting at -2 instead of 0, meaning you get two free levels of exhaustion before things start going bad. You also regain 2 exhaustion from a long rest instead of one. Most people don't get to play with exhaustion, so I consider it more flavor for when it does pop up. The first time you do a forced march with little water could have your character acting like nothing is wrong while the rest of the party is suffering from 2 levels of exhaustion. -------------------------------------- And that's pretty much the gist of it. Overall, this Tradition has less overall damage when compared to other Monks, and should not be relied upon for consistent damage. However, with smart combinations of abilities, you can have windows where you can tank like a madman by gaining resistance and taking a dodge action to drastically reduce damage done to you. You don't have access to at will healing but can handle yourself well through hit dice if needed. You're not as tanky as a true tank, but you're definitely more tanky than the average monk and still embrace the flexibility and mobility that makes sure you still *feel like a monk* while playing a more tank oriented build. Any comments or complaints are welcome and I'd be happy to talk about tweaks. "

130,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Reworked Contagion (long post),9,6j8i5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/6j8i5y/reworked_contagion_long_post/,2017-06-25 00:46:14,"Hey folks. I'm unsure whether I should post this here, but here goes: If you've watched episode 102 of critical role, you'll appreciate the conundrum the party faced when one of them tried to cast Contagion on a 'baddie'. I wasn't aware that WotC originally intended to play the spell as a ""only works after the three failed saves"" and realized soon after that the spell wasn't really worth taking because of the iffy success rate and very long-winded fail rate (i.e. it takes ages until the player succeeds or fails). As a result, I decided to rework the spell so it's a little more spontaneous, while maintaining the effectiveness of the spell. To be clear, the first effect on the chosen effect activates automatically and lasts until the target succeeds on the save and each effect afterwards is only applied after the number of failures specified with each effect is met. Blinding Sickness Pain grips the creatures mind, and its eyes turn milky white. Initial- The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks. 2F - The creature is blinded. If the creature has magical sight such as truesight, it is unaffected. 3F - The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws. Filth Fever A raging fever sweeps through the creatures body. Initial- The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks. 2F - The creature has disadvantage on Strength throws. 3F - The creature has a -2 modifier to their strength attribute, and if it is wearing heavy armor its speed is halved. Flesh Rot The creatures flesh decays. Initial- The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks. 2F - The creature has disadvantage on Charisma saving throws. 3F - The creature has vulnerability to all damage. Mindfire The creatures mind becomes feverish. Initial- The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks. 2F - The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence saving throws. 3F - The creature cannot concentrate on spells. Seizure The creature is overcome with shaking. Initial- The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, and attack rolls that use Dexterity. 2F - The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws. 3F - The creature gains no AC bonus from a shield, and their Dexterity bonus to AC is halved, rounded down. Slimy Doom The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. Initial- The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks 2F - The creature has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws 3F - Whenever the creature takes 20 or more damage from a single attack, it is stunned until the end of its next turn. Note: On three successes, the creature becomes immune to THAT PARTICULAR effect for a week (same applies to three failures); if a creature is cured of the disease through restoration/etc. the creature may be subjected to the effects of the spell again (logic being, they didn't develop an immunity). What do you think?"

Each of these metamagic options have a metamagic option that must be already known in order to learn these options. You can use only one metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted. &amp;nbsp; DELAYED SPELL (requires *Quickened Spell*) When you cast a spell that has a casting time of longer than 1 action you may spend 3 sorcery points to delay the spell effects until a time of the casters choosing. A delayed spell is activated as a spell with a casting time of 1 action using both verbal and somatic components. The spell duration is counted from the moment of activation. Delayed spells require concentration to maintain the delay and may not be delayed longer than the spells usual duration. The metamagic option *Subtle Spell* may be used when the spell is activated to suppress the verbal and somatic components, but no other metamagic options may be applied. &amp;nbsp; DURABLE SPELL (requires Extended Spell) When you cast a spell that requires concentration, you may spend 1 sorcery point per level of the spell to make the spells duration last until the end of your next turn if you lose concentration on the spell. &amp;nbsp; ENERGIZED SPELL (requires *Empowered Spell*) When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 2 sorcery points to count any result on individual dice that are less than your spellcasting modifier as being equal to your spellcasting modifier. You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different metamagic option during the casting of the spell. &amp;nbsp; EXPLOSIVE SPELL (requires *Twinned Spell*) When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesnt have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spells level to target all creatures within 5 of the caster. (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip). &amp;nbsp; FARCASTING (requires *Distant Spell*) When you cast a spell that has a range of 30 feet or greater, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change range of the spell to 200 feet. If the spell already has a range of 200 feet (or more) the range increases to 1 mile. You can use Farcasting even if you have already used *Distant Spell* during the casting of the spell. &amp;nbsp; POTENT SPELL (requires *Heightened Spell*) When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 2 sorcery points to give one target of the spell vulnerability to the damage type of the spell. You may use *Potent Spell* if you have already used a different metamagic option during the casting of the spell. &amp;nbsp; PRECISION SPELL (requires *Careful Spell*) When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spells effects. To do so, you choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) and spend 2 sorcery point for each. A chosen creature is immune to the effects of the spell. "

133,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,More Item/Weapon Ideas,17,6dcouh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/6dcouh/more_itemweapon_ideas/,2017-05-26 07:39:08,"A few more item ideas I had, bundled into one post: **Lightning Rod** *Used by a crazed engineer to power his golem workshop - this rod draws latent electrical energy from the air on even the calmest day.* - Shortsword, magical, +1 to attack and damage rolls - Upon a successful attack against a creature that is Medium or larger, and is not incorporeal, the rod becomes lodged inside its body. Unless the creature is fully immune to Lightning damage, it then becomes *vulnerable* to Lightning damage and has disadvantage on any saving throws made to resist spells that deal Lightning damage, even if it previously had Lightning resistance. On its turn, the creature can use its action to attempt a DC 17 Strength check to dislodge the rod. On a success, the vulnerability effect ends, but the creature takes 1d12 slashing damage from the weapon. The Lightning Rod then drops to the ground, undamaged. (The shortsword cannot be wielded when it is lodged in a creature's body.) - Alternatively, the rod can be used as a grounding rod if fastened to any footwear, giving the wearer resistance to Lightning damage as long as their boots are in contact with the ground (i.e. they are not flying, levitating, swimming, etc.). This weapon encourages teamwork, especially between a melee character and a lightning caster. If the caster is feeling brave enough, they could try using it themselves - especially if they are a Valor Bard or another half-n-half class (Is this called a ""Gith""?). ---------- **Tightly-sealed Jar** (Not a magical item itself - this puzzle container holds some magical substance, such as a potion.) The jar's lid is firmly sealed shut. A character that attempts to open the jar must succeed on a DC 25 Strength check. The character sprains their wrist on a failure, taking 1 point of damage, and is unable to try again until they have taken a short or long rest. The players can use their own knowledge and ideas to solve the puzzle, or can attempt an Investigation check to determine how to open the jar. They come to a conclusion based on their score: - 0-4 - ""The jar looks fragile enough to break open"" (If the character follows this idea, the contents of the jar spill out, and only half of the substance can be salvaged) - 5-9 - ""The lid may slide more easily if the neck of the jar is clean"" (If the character follows this idea, reduce the DC by 2) - 10-14 - ""The jar may be easier to hold if the lid is wedged inside a crack"" (If the character follows this idea, reduce the DC by 3) - 15-24 - ""The jar may be easier to open if something is tapped against the lid"" (If the character follows this idea, reduce the DC by 10) - 25+, or a natural 20 - The character tries twisting in the opposite direction, and the lid slides open. ---------- **Hair Wax** The nature/name of this item should not be immediately obvious to the players at first. It appears as a slimy grey substance, smelling faintly of resin. If applied, a character can spend 10 minutes shaping their hair into one of four styles: - **Neat and formal** - The character gains advantage on Persuasion checks - **Slicked back, greasy** - The character gains advantage on Deception checks - **Fabulous quiff** - The character gains advantage on Performance checks - **Wild and spiky** - The character gains advantage on Intimidation checks The character can reshape their hair as many times as they want, but must spend 10 minutes each time doing so. Only one effect can be active at once. A character with very short/no hair cannot use this item, but otherwise the length of hair doesn't matter (even if it would look a little odd with very long hair...). A jar of wax usually contains 5-10 uses/portions. Multiple characters can use the wax simultaneously, but one portion is expended per character. A portion of wax loses potency once the character finishes a long rest or becomes submerged in water. --------- **Bubble Amulet** When worn, the amulet produces a bubble that envelops the wearer. The bubble is invisible, and can only be seen with a ""See Invisibility"" spell or with Truesight. To anyone that can see it, it appears as a faint translucent sphere around the wearer. - While active, the bubble increases the wearer's AC by 2, and reduces all nonmagical slashing, bludgeoning and piercing damage by 3 per attack. - Once it has absorbed 15 damage in this way, the bubble bursts and becomes inactive. - The bubble regains 2d4 'hitpoints' whenever the character takes a short rest, and is fully restored at the end of a long rest. I'm entirely happy with this particular idea - I thought it up as a way to boost a low-level caster (thinking of trying to become a DM myself, and asking my friend who is already a DM if I can run a campaign for him), especially if they are in a solo/small party. It's basically just 2 AC plus Heavy Armour Master though, so I don't feel like it's as interesting as it could be. --------- **Ferocious [Weapon]** Once per turn, whenever you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon, you may take one extra action on that turn, in the same way as with the Fighter's ""Action Surge"" ability. This does not expend a use of Action Surge, and can be used on the same turn as a normal Action Surge. This effect ONLY triggers on a natural 20 - it does not stack with the Champion's ""Improved Critical"" feature, the Rogue's ""Assassinate"" feature, or any other feature/ability that lets you crit without rolling a 20. If you roll a 20 on a reaction (i.e. on an Opportunity attack) then the effect carries over to the next turn. In this (rare) situation, it would be possible to get two additional actions from the weapon (and then use a normal Action surge on top) in the same turn. This effect does not replace the normal Critical Hit mechanic - on a crit, the weapon's dice are doubled (or whatever other effect happens) in addition to gaining the extra action. If this item isn't already powerful enough, then: - Take off the ""Once per turn"" limit - so, if multiple 20's are rolled in the same turn, the character gets a free action for *each* - and so get another 1-4 chances of rolling even *more* 20's. - Let the effect trigger even on 18's and 19's with Improved/Superior Critical - so making the weapon extremely powerful for one of the less-popular subclasses. - Do *both* - and let the Champion regularly use 3+ actions per turn...

With their fish tails and long hair. This has not been truth. But a mere illusion of the waves. Short Physiology: Evolved from octopus, the Merfolk have lost its two legs for stronger and larger body and greater brain. They still have a some sort of mantle, but only four of those legs are attatched to it. Two ""hands"" with tentacles divided to 3 ""fingers"" start from the upper body. They also have grown themselves some rudimentary skeleton and lungs for better support in out of water activities, although their limbs are still mostly boneless. And a skull to protect their genius minds Short Psychology: Inquisitive, curious, deadly sharp and fast learner, the Merefolk dwell in the costal regions of most oceans and some larger lakes with access to the sea. They build burrows and live in medium families, round 20-40 individuals, there are some dwellings on the shore also. Their society is matriarchal. They know how to use tools. Thanks to that, their smarts and their almost exclusively carnivorous diet, they have had quite a big impact on local fist stock and other wildlife in the waters. They are not completely emotionless, but for outsiders their thoughts, emotions and body language is alsomst impossible to understand. Merfolk Traits: ASI: +1 INT, +1WIS, +1DEX Age: They reach maturity around 5 years old, and live up to 50 years. Although the lifespan is conciderably longer if in deep waters with lower levels of oxigen. Alignment: Although they live in families, led by matriarch, they have not some specially high tendancy towards law, rather their curiosity leads them towards chaotic or neutral. Size: When stretched they can reach 12 feet in water, but usually on ground stay around 5-6 feet. Thanks to the lack of bones they weight bit less than average human, so around 130 pounds. Your size is medium. NB: your skull is the biggest unflexible thing in your body (use that wisely). Speed: Your base walking speed is 20 feet, and you have a swimming speed of 30 feet. Thanks to the suckers on your limbs, you also have climbing speed of 10 feet. (You are strong enough to swing yourself like a monkey from branch (or other object) to branch. This kind of movement adds 20 to your speed). (In addition I think I would like to add Athletics or something because it requires strong body to move without bones). Wierd Body: You are unable to wear heavy or medium armor. Light armor can be worn only if this is specially made to suit you (Made this specially because of the swimming speed and watery heritage, some leather or ""fishscale"" armor is OK enough to swim with). Firefear: You have vulnerability to fire damage, and hot and dry conditions are specially menacing for you. Seadweller: You have resistance to cold damage, and you ignore any drawbacks by deep, underwater environment. You also can breathe air and water. But when out of water you have to cover your body with atleast 1 gallon of water every day. Flesheater: You are (almost exclusively) carnivorous and thanks to that you have to eat ten times less often than other PC races (in sense that like snakes or other do. They eat, and then digest it for long time. Maybe remove that, because otherwise this PC just sleeps all the time with full belly). You also have advantage against Poisoned and Disease conditions. No Bone, No Sound: You are proficient in Dex (Stealth) skill and also roll this with advantage. (Although I should add some camo also maybe, dunno). Languages: You speak, read and write Common and Underdark. They have a lot of details, I would even like to add more, but at the moment, I think I'll let it be. Please ask, point and generally share your thoughts and ideas about this race. Should I make a subraces? If this gets feedback in decent amout, I'll make it lovely HB page (with pictures and stuff).

I though of it a bit, and made some changes myself. So here they come. Link to first one is here also: URL 1. Short Lore: There are many sentient species in the sea, but one of the most alien is tentacled Hexapod. No one knows if their emergence is natural or called forth by some forces unknown, but what is known is that their emergence has had already great impact on other species and the wildlife of the sea and coast. So few are captured and examined by scholars of known races. To that, most of the Hexapods don't look without rage. 2. Short Physiology: They have two upper tentacles with three fingerlike appendages and four lower tentacles on with they stand, somethimes spiraled together to mimic two legs. Although their brain and nervous system is still divided between the arms and body, their mouths and eyes, and overall facial features resemble humanoids. Though they have no outer ears and no noses, because they smell with their suckers. Their mouths are a serrated beak and they are almost entirely carnivorous. There have been even sightings of cannibalism and self mutialtion in cases of severe famine. When they get their strenght back and are enough fed, some of the lost limbs might start to grow back. Eyes are orbs of black with golden freckles, frontfacing and twice the size of other humanoids in comparison. They have a bony skull and beak, but cartilage support in torso and the upper parts of limbs, so still they can fit through most spaces where their head can fit through. And a stiff, rough skin which covers their extremely strong muscle mass. They come in rusty colors of red, brown and black, although some few albinoes have been sighted. They also can create light from their tentacles to lure prey and light dark corners of the vast ocean. Although it is mainly used for communication. They have an entire system in their ""light-language"". 3. Short Psychology: Usually living in the deep and dark regions of the oceans. But some also dwell in rivers, caverns, wetlands, but even costal areas and on the ground near water. Usually their houses and kingdoms, as is known from traders and interrogations, are caves deep beneath the waves or floating cities in the middle of the sea. Some captured ships banded together or entire swamps. The costal dwellings are usually trade villages and markets where they trade for other goods - weapons, meat, ships, information, tools, literature, maps etc -, not money, ocean ""products"" from fish and sunken treasures to saved sailors. They are matriarchal by their society and are divided into family groups of 30 to 50 heads strong. They are unusually peaceful towards other Hexapods and not a single war or larger conflict has happened ever. They are inquisitive, curious and deadly sharp and fast learners, although they value little of possessions not needed or useful. They seem emotionless and alien to other species and are feared for their close resemblance and possible connections to Illithid. 4. ASI: Wis +2, Dex +1 5. Age: Hexapods reach maturity around 5 years old, and live up to 50 years. Although the lifespan is conciderably longer if in deep waters with lower levels of oxigen. 6. Alignment: Although they live in families, led by matriarch, they don't have specially high tendancy towards law, rather their curiosity leads them towards chaotic or neutral. 7. Size: When stretched, they can reach 12 feet in water, but usually on ground stay around 5-6 feet. Thanks to the lack of bones they weight bit less than average human, so around 130 pounds. Your size is medium. 8. Speed: Your base walking speed is 20 feet, and you have a swimming speed of 30 feet. Thanks to the suckers on your limbs, you also have climbing speed of 20 feet. 9. Boneless Prowess: You are proficient in Athletics, Actobatics and Stealth skill. In addition, you make all Grapple checks and contests with advantage. 10. Pyrophobia: You have vulnerability to Fire and Radiant damage. In addition, hot and dry climates are extremely menacing for you. 11. Aquatic: You ignore any drawbacks by underwater environment and wetlands. You also can breathe air and water. But when out of water you have to cover your body with atleast 1 gallon of water every day. 12. Wierd Body: You have six limbs, 4 legs and 2 arms. Thanks to that and your alien physiology you are unable to wear heavy or medium armor. Light armor can be worn only if this is specially made to suit you. 13. Wierd Mind: You have advantage against being Charmed. And against Insight checks to read your emotions and body language. 14. Photophores: Your tentacles are covered in light-producing organs called photophores. You can activate them to shed dim light up to 10 feet from you. This light can be pulsating or constant. 15. Languages: You write, read and understand Common, Aquan and one of Deep Speech or Underdark. Your mouth can only crudely mimic the words of other languages, because between other Hexapods they communicate mostly via ""light-language""."

You have experienced loss throughout your life, and kept it pent up until it began to bubble over. Now it grants you the ability to cast spells. Surge of Pain: Starting at 1st level, you can turn the pain from combat into power. On your turn, when you cast a damaging spell, you add a number equal to the damage taken divided by 10 (rounded down) to the attack roll, or a number of d6 to the damage roll equal to the damage taken divided by 10 (rounded down). Pain Reflection: Starting at 6th level, you have learned to make others feel your pain. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to spend 2 sorcery points to cause the creature that damaged you to take the same amount of damage as psychic damage, ignoring immunity and resistance. Focused Pain: Starting at 14th level you gain better control over how you use your pain. When you use surge of pain the added number becomes damage taken divided by 5. When you use pain reflection the target gains vulnerability to the damage taken. Painful Aura: Starting at 18th level, you can spend 3 sorcery points to create an aura about you that absorbs damage. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), you gain resistance to all types of damage. Additionally any creature that would take damage within 15 feet of you instead takes none, and you take the damage. When the aura ends, even if due to you falling unconscious, you can chose one creature within range and deal 3 times the amount of damage you took as psychic damage, ignoring resistance and vulnerability.

You gain the following benefits: * Add your Wisdom modifier to your Strength (Athletics) checks. * You count as one size larger when determining creatures you can grapple or shove. You count as two sizes larger when moving a creature grappled by you. * When you use a bonus action to make an unarmed strike as a benefit from either the Martial Arts or Flurry of Blows features, you can replace the unarmed strike with a grapple or shove. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the bonus action, the grapple or shove replaces one of them. **Shelter of Oak** Your defense becomes as resilient as the bark of oak. Upon reaching 6th level, you can use your reaction to deflect melee attacks. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus + your monk level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can attempt a grapple or shove attack against the attacker if it's within the reach of your unarmed strike as part of the same reaction. **Verdant Nativity** By 11th level, your ki can be used to quickly grow sacred fig as a bonus action. Choose a space within 20 feet of you. A 40-foot tall fig rapidly grows in the chosen space. You can lead the direction of the fig's growth. For example, you can have the first 10 feet extend away from you before the remaining 20 feet bends upward. The fig has 13 AC, 7d12 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage. The fig also withers 1 minute after you are no longer within 20 feet of it. If a creature is in a space the fig extends to, the creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is carried away by the fig's branches. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it isn't carried by the fig. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you expend 6 ki points to immediately regain the use, or until you finish a long rest. **Thousandth Branch** When you reach 17th level, the multitude of strikes you can unleash emulates the vast canopy of sacred cedar. Double the number of unarmed strikes granted to you as a bonus action by the Martial Arts feature and Flurry of Blows."

Recently, a friend and I were chatting about a campaign setting, and the topic of the old 3.5e living spells came up. They're pretty neat monsters, all things considered, and I thought, hey, why not take a crack at porting them over to 5e? Here's what I've got so far: the chilling fog, the glitterfire, and the sickening sleep (all from the MM3). URL For the most part I think the template works out for intended challenge ratings, although I think it still highballs a bit, considering their relatively low AC and HD. I modeled Engulf off of the Water Elemental's Whelm ability, but pushed up the recharge since higher level spells do a whole lot more. I'm also of half a mind to swap them from oozes (their type in 3.5e) to elementals, mostly so some of the lesser ones could be used with conjure elemental. Any feedback is more than welcome and appreciated, as this is my first real foray into monster conversion/design. EDIT: I pushed through the changes for **Vulnerability to Dispelling**. As of right now, it stuns for 1 round and deals 3d6 force damage, scaling upwards as you cast it at a higher level. For the moment, I'm having it automatically succeed on spells *dispel magic* would normally be able to work on, as a reward for casting at the proper level and figuring out what is the make up of each living spell."

Because a siege can consist of hundreds of thousands of creatures, you should keep track of how many creatures of one type are remaining. A group of 20 will take initiative per type of creature. When it is the groups turn they make an attack roll, a d20 + attack modifier for whatever attack they are using. If the attack modifier is higher than the target group's AC, the attacking group kills 1d10 + their weapon damage and modifier creatures. If the attack is lower than the victim group, the amount of victim creatures fallen is halved rounded down. When the victim creatures looses creatures, they keep the same initiave and still have 20, but the total amount of creatures seiging is reduced. Example there are 300 skeletons, the group of 20 takes 18 damage. There are now 282 skeletons left and the same group of 20. If the victim creatures have regeneration or such traits, the amount of creatures that fall is halved. If the victim creatures have a vulnerability to the attack, the amount of fallen creatures is doubled. And finally if the attacking creatures have multi attack, the amount of creatures fallen is multiplied by the amount of attacks they can make. Edit: If there are less than 20 creatures available to make a group, the damage roll to determine how many victim creatures fall is reduced by the amount of missing attacking creatures.

145,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Bard College of the Spellshaper,11,5lajne,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/5lajne/bard_college_of_the_spellshaper/,2017-01-01 04:06:59,"I'd love some feedback on this- a bardic college focused on twisting and shaping spells. **College of Spellshapers** A student of the College of Spellshapers learns to use her intuitive insight into magic to twist and alter spells in ways others can't. Similar to yet distinct from sorcerous metamagic, a spellshaper's abilities let her affect spells cast both by herself and by others. **BASIC SPELLSHAPING** Starting when you join this college at 3rd level, when you or a creature you can see within 60' casts a spell that deals damage, you can use your reaction to spend one bardic inspiration die to either increase or decrease the damage the spell deals to one creature that it affects. The increase or decrease is equal to the result of your inspiration die roll and applies after any saving throw, but before any damage resistance, vulnerability, or immunity is applied. You can only increase the damage to a creature that actually takes damage from the spell, and additional damage is the same type(s) dealt by the spell. You can reduce the damage a creature takes to no less than 0 points. Alternatively, when you or a creature you can see within 60' casts a spell with a range measured in feet, you can use your reaction to spend one bardic inspiration die to increase the spell's range. The range increases by 5' x the result of the inspiration die. **ADVANCED SPELLSHAPING** Beginning at 6th level, you learn advanced spellshaping techniques that allow you to modify spells in more profound ways. When you or a creature you can see within 60' casts a spell that deals damage, you can use your reaction to spend one bardic inspiration die to change the type of damage dealt by the spell to acid, cold, fire, lightning, psychic, or thunder. The spell is otherwise unchanged. Alternatively, when a creature you can see within 60' casts a spell that has a range measured in feet, you can use your reaction to spend one bardic inspiration die to reduce that spell's range by 5' x the result of the inspiration die. If this makes the spell's range shorter than the distance at which the caster intends for it to take effect, the spell takes effect at the maximum range of the spell. **MASTER SPELLSHAPING** At 14th level, your spellshaping abilities improve and expand. When you spend a bardic inspiration die to modify the damage of a spell, you may now choose whether to apply its affects to each creature damaged by the spell. In addition, when you or a creature you can see within 60' casts a spell that requires concentration, you can use your reaction to spend one bardic inspiration die. If you do so, any time the caster of that spell must make a saving throw to maintain concentration on it, that creature may roll a bardic inspiration die and add it to the result. Alternatively, when you or a creature you can see within 60' casts a spell that targets one or more specific creatures, you can use your reaction to spend a bardid inspiratin die to cause the spell to target more creatures than normal. Roll your inspiration die; if you roll a 1 through 4, the spell affects one additional target. If you roll a 5 through 8, the spell affects two additional targets. If you roll a 9 or higher, the spell affects three additional targets. "
146,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Rakshasa Race (Counterpart to the Deva),13,5nvmzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/5nvmzw/rakshasa_race_counterpart_to_the_deva/,2017-01-14 15:40:11,"I'm currently DMing a campaign, and one of my players played an evil aligned [deva](URL using my homebrewed race. A dragon encounter went wrong, and he died. According to my own homebrew, he would resurrect as a rakshasa, which I undertook the process of homebrewing, simply because I have a soft spot for the immense amount of work he put into the character. In the case of Devaic rakshasa, they are weaker than true rakshasa, while possessing the strength to remember a moral existence, offering the rare chance (for devils), to be good-aligned. This race (at least in my campaign), is only intended to be an option for an evil-aligned deva to return, as says in the lore. However, I only allow rakshasa characters to be seeking to redeem themselves. Without further adieu, the rakshasa: Rakshasa (Deva Origin) Ability Score Increase: Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. Fiendish Immortality: You do not age, although most rakshasa rarely live for more than 500 years before being reincarnated. However, as a former deva, you are usually no more than 100 years old at the start of your adventuring career. Alignment: Rakshasa are almost universally lawful evil, although those of a divine origin may seek to redeem themselves to re-enter Mount Celestia. However, even those virtuous rakshasa struggle with the dark tendencies of your fiendish nature. Size: Rakshasa stand slightly taller than humans, and weigh 200 pounds or less. Your size is Medium. Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Fiendish Nature: Your type is fiend. You are subject to any effects that would affect fiendish creatures. You have vulnerability to piercing damage taken from weapons wielded by good creatures. Additionally, if you take damage from a magic weapon, you take an extra 1 point of damage. Darkvision. Your fiendish nature allows you to see what others cannot. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of grey. Lesser Spell Immunity: You have advantage on Constitution, Intelligence, and Charisma saving throws against spells of 6th level or lower. Fiendish Manipulator: You know the minor illusion cantrip, and may cast it at will. Additionally, you may cast the disguise self spell with this trait. At 5th level, you may cast major image as a 3rd level spell with this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Once you have cast one of these spells, you must finish a long rest before you may do so again. Claws. You are proficient with your claws, which are unarmed strikes that deal 1d4 damage on a hit. When you hit a creature with a claw attack, you may choose to curse it. If you do so, they must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier), and on a failed saving throw, you fill the creature's head with horrible visions and nightmares, and it cannot benefit from a short or long rest. A remove curse or similar spell ends this affect, and you may only have one creature cursed at a time. The curse ceases to have affect on a creature after 24 hours. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest. Nightmarish Reincarnation: Like their counterparts, the deva, rakshasa do not truly die upon being killed. If you die, you return to the Nine Hells for a number of days equal to 2d10 x your character level. If your character level is 4th or lower, you instead resurrect after a week, retaining your class levels and experience. Otherwise, you do not retain any equipment or class levels you had before you died. A rakshasa of good alignment instead resurrects as a deva. Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal. Concerns: Obviously Fiendish Manipulator and Lesser Spell Immunity. Before anyone asks, the Nightmarish Reincarnation feature mimics AL faction resurrections, which functions almost exactly the same. All critique is welcome."

I've drawn inspiration from other [Winter](URL themed ideas I came across on this sub and I've tried my best to make it my own work. I appreciate any and all feedback! [Tundra Domain](URL **My Specific Thoughts/Worries** * Being able to potentially restrain up to 4 creatures at level 2 with Channel Divinity seems very strong, but restraining only 1 seems underwhelming and like it won't scale well. Perhaps something similar to Sleep that scales with Cleric level? * Packing 2 advantages into the 8th level ability seems stronger than what other domains get, but I feel like Cold resistance feels fluffily close to the subclasses identity, and I didn't want to wait until 17th level to include it. * The 17th level capstone comes across as more of a Paladin aura than a Cleric ability, but I didn't want to include basically a free AOE storm spell. I feel like the damage is low for a capstone, but that it is balanced out by the Cold vulnerability and the ranged disadvantage. This is my first homebrew, so if I've gone overboard balance-wise, please tell me! Cheers!"

That's obviously intentional for balance, but I still want to make something usable at low levels. The idea for this spell is that while you take control of an undead you lose control of your own body. The vulnerability makes it warrant a lower level and makes it more suited to clever uses in specific situations rather than just summoning minions. I also think it could use a cooler name if anyone's got some ideas. **Undead Possession** Available to Clerics, Wizards 1st level Spell Casting Time: 1 Action Components: V, S Duration: Up to one hour Range: 60 feet Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creatures game statistics). You take control of this undead and your body becomes unconscious for the duration. While you control the undead you cannot speak or cast spells. Once the undead hits 0 hp, you return to your original body. You may also take a bonus action to end the spell return to your original body. Once the spell ends, the remains are no longer able to be reanimated or revived. "

This first one, the Path of the Taken, utilizes a central idea of allowing an entity to possess the barbarian; this entity serving as the font of the rage and battle lust. I think I had watched a few episodes of Outcast when inspiration struck I would appreciate some feedback as almost all my work so far has been conceptual (little to no in-game testing). Some of the paths (this one being a prime example) modify the base barbarian rage mechanic and its always difficult to tell how great the impact will be on the class overall. Its always risky tweaking core mechanics. To give a little more information, I actually heavily modified the base barbarian class (rebranding it as the berserker as I wanted to convey that rage, hate, and love of battle are not just uncivilized traits) so had to re-convert my rage paths back to vanilla 5E for forum evaluation. Thank you in advance for any input! **PATH OF THE TAKEN** *Some barbarians do not have a personal source of rage but are the vessel for a spirit or entity that brings hate and anger into the world. * *Those following the Path of the Taken Mind are possessed, serving as a vessel for a being intent on inflicting pain and suffering on those dwelling in the realms of the living.* **SUPERNATURAL RAGE** Beginning at 3rd level, you give yourself over to an otherworldly power of hate and rage, your body contorting and rising into the air, eyes showing only the sclera. This force may be a possessing demon, a vengeful spirit, or even an avenging angel. Your rage is modified as follows: + You have advantage on Charisma checks and Charisma saving throws. This replaces the standard advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. + You are unable to make melee or ranged attacks with physical weapons, instead using the entity possessing you to strike at your foes with invisible lashes and unseen strikes. While raging, your entity attacks have a reach of 30 feet and a successful attack does 1d6 damage plus your rage bonus. The base damage for this attack increases to 1d8 at 10th level and 1d12 at 17th level. Before entering your rage, you must choose the type of damage your supernatural rage inflicts, selecting from force, necrotic, psychic, or radiant. Once you have made this choice, the chosen damage type is in effect throughout the duration of your rage but can be changed again if you enter a new rage. This attack is considered a Strength-based melee weapon in regards to any abilities or class features that affect weapon attacks (e.g. reckless attack, extra attack). + You have resistance to psychic damage. This replaces the standard resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. + You are unable to move while raging, levitating to a height of 5 feet above the ground in the spot where you started your rage. For the duration of your rage, you are not affected by difficult terrain or any spells or effects that relate to standing on the ground. **INVISIBLE HAND** At 6th level, as a bonus action while raging, you may lift, move, or manipulate objects within your 30 foot reach that weigh less than 10 pounds. For example, you can open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You cannot use invisible hand to attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds. Alternately, you may attempt to violently push a small or medium creature. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be hurled up to 30 feet horizontally in a direction of your choice and land prone, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. **UNSPOKEN VOICE** Starting at 10th level, you can communicate telepathically with a range of 30 feet as long as you have a common language with the target. This ability does not give you the ability to read a targets thoughts or emotions and only works on targets with an Intelligence of 3 or greater. The target knows that you are the source of the unspoken voice. At 14th level, while using unspoken voice, you are able to understand and speak all known languages. At 18th level, the range of your unspoken voice is only limited by line of sight. Furthermore, targets no longer are automatically aware that you are the source. **PSYCHIC MAELSTROM** At 14th level, as a bonus action, you can call an aura of intense psychic energy to surround you. The aura is a 10 foot radius that lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. While the field is in effect, you gain a +2 bonus to your AC against ranged attacks, and all foes within the aura gain vulnerability to psychic, force, radiant, and necrotic damage. You may use psychic maelstrom once per rage and a maximum number of times per short rest equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). **EDIT**: Thank you MUCH for all the feedback. Ill be completely changing (buffing) supernatural rage, tweaking invisible hand, looking to retain the theme of unspoken voice but (slightly) increase the benefit, and work on the wording of psychic maelstrom. Once done, Ill post a v2."

The PCs have a lot of heavy-hitters in regards to melee(by the way, if Thalragnir means anything to you stop reading now), and I realized that I should throw something at them that can stand up to them in melee without getting slaughtered in a couple rounds. Since the party is a mix of veterans of the game and complete noobs, I decided that something homebrewed but not too far off from existing monsters would excite both groups. Just add my drinking problem and love of dark beers in and you get the stout jelly. A modified ochre jelly with slightly different damage immunities, a new vulnerability, and a new effect on its pseudopod attack. Hopefully a crowd-pleaser that presents a fresh take on oozes. I'm not too familiar with balancing monsters so the CR might be off, but I think it should be relatively close. [ Homebrewery Link](URL - Update: Upon some reflection I think it might make more sense to give the thing only resistance to poison rather than full immunity. More in line with the ochre jelly's pattern. And maybe take poison damage off the list of damage types that trigger a Split. - Update 2: Added changes mentioned above, and added a clause to the Pseudopod attack detailing the exhaustion effect more as reflected on in my comment responding to /u/CatsAndPlanets. - Update 3: [Saved as PDF and uploaded to Google Drive for convenience.](URL "

158,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Barbarian Primal Path: Doomslayer (New Primal Path Based on DOOM 2016),11,56vc0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/56vc0e/barbarian_primal_path_doomslayer_new_primal_path/,2016-10-11 11:20:53,"Hello subscribers of Unearthed Arcana. I'm bringing you my first homebrewed subclass for D&amp;D, the Doomslayer Primal Path. With this Primal Path, my goal was to emulate the mechanics and playstyle of DOOM 2016. I've never really tried anything like this before, so I figured I'd post it here to get some feedback. In addition to this subclass, I eventually plan to stat all of the ingame demons. **Path of the Doomslayer** *They are rage, brutal, without mercy. But you. You will be worse. Rip and tear, until it is done.* There are those Barbarian warriors who use the foul magic of the Abyss to enhance their abilities. Some of these Barbarians may turn their destructive wrath towards the fiends who inhabit the Dark Realm, using it to strike them down. In battle, the Doomslayer revels in fighting and absorbing the power of his foes, particularly demons. **Glory Kill** At 3rd level, you absorb and gather power from those you defeat. When you reduce an opponent to 0 HP in melee combat, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Con. modifier + your barbarian level (minimum of 2.) If the opponent you defeat is a fiend, the number of temporary hit points is Con modifier X2 + your barbarian level. **Hell Walker** At 6th level, the urge to kill allows you to move quickly around the battlefield. You can dash or disengage as a bonus action when raging. Additionally, difficult terrain doesnt hinder you while dashing when raging. **Abyssal Rune** At 10th level, you gain newfound powers from the foes you slay, manifesting itself as a branded mark that appears somewhere on your body. Select one of the following Abyssal Runes: *Savagery: Immediately after killing an opponent in melee combat, you can choose to make an extra attack against a creature within five feet of you. You may use this ability once per round. *Mobility: Immediately after killing an opponent in melee combat, you can choose to add an extra 10 feet to your movement speed. You may use this ability once per round. *Resilience: Immediately after killing an opponent in melee combat, you gain advantage on all Strength and Constitution saving throws for the rest of the round. You may use this ability once per round. **Demonic Berserker** At 14th level, you can tap into the deepest demonic energies to fuel your rage. When you first enter rage, you can select to fuel your rage as a Demonic Berserker. While in this Demonic Berserker mode:  All hostile creatures within 30 feet must make a wisdom saving throw or become frightened (DC= Barbarian Str. modifier + Proficiency). All frightened creatures may repeat this saving throw once every round until they make their saving throw. All creatures who make their saving throw are immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.  Your movement speed increases by 10 feet.  Your weapon damage ignores resistances and immunities.  You deal an extra 2d6 damage with every successful attack against Fiends. This effect lasts one minute, and can only be used once per long rest. EDIT: Changed up Glory Kill health bonus and Demonic Berserker fear effect and vulnerability. "

Below are several spells I've created from the custom spells and prestige class features in Ptolus which I would love your feedback on. Whether your confused on how something would work, see potential for breaking/exploitation/underwhelmingness, or just think I should change the level or class restrictions or such, I am curious. Thanks in advance for reading; I hope you find something of interest here. Aid from the Future  Level 3 Divination; Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard  1 Action; Instantaneous; Self; VS  You reach out to your future self for strength; regain 4d6 hit points and 1d4+1 levels of spell slots; after your next long rest, your HP maximum is reduced by the number of hit points you regained from this spell and you expend equivalent spell slots to those you gained  At Higher Levels: add 2d6 HP and 1d4+1 spell slots for every two levels above 3rd  If cast multiple times between long rest, the HP and spell slots accumulate; thus, you cannot restore more spell slots of a certain level than you could cast in a day; if the total HP restored is greater than your normal maximum HP, you fall to 0HP at the end of your next long rest and make a single death saving throw, stabilizing on a success (awaking 4d4 hours later with 1HP) or immediately dying on a failure; no spells or other aid can affect this saving throw and the target cannot be stabilized or healed by a medicine check, spare the dying, or any other spell City Transport  Level 6 Conjuration; Bard, Wizard  1 Action; Instantaneous; Touch; VS  You instantaneously transport one creature to another location in the same settlement (a town, city, or castle with a minimum 100 residents) that you can describe; an unwilling creature makes a Charisma saving throw against your spell DC; if you attempt to teleport into a space that is occupied or protected by magical abjuration (including Mordenkainens Private Sanctum, Guards and Wards, and Antimagic Field spells), the target fails to teleport and takes 4d6 force damage Commune with the City  Level 5 Divination (ritual); Bard, Wizard  1 minute; self; 1 minute; VSM (a map of the city)  You connect with the gestalt knowledge of the populace (a town, city, or castle with a minimum 100 residents), gaining valuable insight in one of two ways; you may ask up to three questions that can be answered with yes or no, receiving truthful answers if at least one inhabitant knows the answer (if none do, you receive a response of unknown and the question counts against your three; alternatively, you may have the location of a described/named building appear on the map along with the fastest route there from your current location (these markers fade from the map at the end of the spells duration) Imbue Vibration  Level 2 Transmutation; Bard  Bonus Action; self; concentration, up to 1 hour; VSM (a weapon you are proficient with)  Singing or whispering to your chosen weapon, you imbue it with a magical hum that provides benefits when you wield the weapon in combat; for the duration, the weapon is treated as magical for the purposes of resistance and gains additional benefits based on the spell slot used, gaining all benefits of the spell level and levels lower  2nd: attacks with the weapon cannot suffer DISadvantage  4th: the wielder gains +1 to AC  6th: the weapon can be used to make an unlimited number of opportunity attacks  8th: any hit with the weapon causes the target to be stunned for one round Lord of the City  Level 6 Divination; Bard, Wizard  1 hour; self; 10 minutes; VSM (an accurate map of the settlement carved in precious material or decorated in metallic filigree with a value of at least 500gp)  For the duration, you gain insight into the general mood of the populace and become aware of any events affecting 10% of the people or endangering 1%; you can learn the location of one individual (if they are within the settlement and you have touched them or hold a meaningful possession of theirs) and can send a single message to them (with response as per sending) Month of Vallis  Level 9 Transmutation; Bard, Warlock, Wizard  1 day; self; 30 days; VSM (a sealed chamber and 30 different gems worth 50 gp each)  This spell allows you  and only you  to access a magically hidden 13th month that falls between the last day of one year and the first day of the next; time passes normally during the month, but you cannot leave the chamber for any reason; you may undertake any activity possible within the space and with the supplies you have placed within it (including crafting, researching, and more); regular cycles of day and night pass outside as normal but looking out any windows reveals no other living creatures; you must eat, drink, and sleep as normal during the month; casting spells work as normal unless their effect extends beyond the chamber; when the month ends, you return to the normal time stream but are one month older than everyone else (who believe that no time has passed at all); if you do attempt to leave the chamber before the month is up, you are immediately transported to the normal time stream with everyone else but fall into a coma lasting 2d6 days, after which you spend 30 days with your max HP reduced 25% and -2 to Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma ability scores Necrosis  Level 2 Necromancy; Warlock, Wizard  1 Action; Concentration &lt;1 minute; 30 ft; 1 creature below max HP; VSM (a bit of string coated in animal fat)  You cause the wounds on a creature to expand, wracking it with pain; the target makes a Constitution save against you spell DC; on a fail, it takes 2d6 necrotic damage; if it fails by more than 10, the target is stunned for one round; on subsequent rounds, you can force the target to make the save again if it is within range, suffering the same effects on a failure; the spell ends on any successful save or if you end your turn more than 30 feet from the target; targets with less than half their maximum HP make the save with DISadvantage  At Higher Levels: add 1d6 damage for each level cast above 2nd Preparation  Level 2 Evocation; Wizard  10 Minutes; self; 1 hour; VS  You spend extra time preparing a single spell you expect to need soon; for the duration, you can cast the selected spell as if it were one level lower than normal (i.e. you could use preparation to make fireball a 2nd level spell, meaning a 3rd level slot would add 1d6 to the damage); both preparation and the selected spell must be on your list of prepared spells for the duration; you cannot select preparation as the focus of a preparation spell and you cannot have more than one spell under the effect of preparation at a time Second Chance  Level 4 Conjuration; Cleric, Wizard  1 action; touch; 1 hour; VSM (a two-headed coin)  You ward one creature you touch against ultimate death, imbuing them with a second chance at life; if the target is reduced to zero hit points during the duration, they immediately stabilize and return to life after 1d4 rounds with 10HP; this spell does not work if the target dies due to Instant Death (PHB 197) or the Power Word Kill spell  At Higher Levels: the target returns with an additional 5 HP per level above 4th but also remains dead for an additional one round per each level above 4th Shield of Light  Level 4 Abjuration; Cleric, Paladin  1 action; self; Concentration, up to 1 minute; VS  You create a shield of daylight that you wield as a normal shield, which grants you +2 bonus to your AC; the shield sheds bright light in a 15 foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet; this light dispels magical darkness of 3rd level or lower; the light from the shield is considered daylight for purposes of light sensitivity; all undead who enter or start their turn in the area of bright light must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell DC or be frightened of you until the spell ends (they cannot repeat this save until you recast the spell, and passing the save grants them immunity to the effect for 24 hours); regardless of the save result, all undead who can see the shield attack you with Disadvantage Throw Voice  Level 2 Illusion; Bard, Warlock, Sorcerer, Wizard  1 action; 30 feet; Instantaneous; SM (a mouth harp)  You magically make your voice come from any point within range, uttering up to 25 words; you may attempt to disguise your voice by making a Deception (Charisma) check subject to any listeners Insight (Wisdom)  At higher levels: add 10 feet to the range and 5 words to the message length for each level above 2nd Wellspring  Level 6 Conjuration; Cleric, Paladin  1 action; 60 feet; Concentration, up to 1 minute; VSM (a piece of cork)  You open a spring to the Astral Sea on a point you can see within range, spilling radiant spiritual water in a 20 foot radius; the area becomes difficult terrain and is treated as running water for any creature with such vulnerability; when entering or starting their turn in the area, all undead and evil creatures must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell DC, suffering 8d6 radiant damage on a fail or half as much on a success; on a failure, the creature is also grappled by the liquid, which it can escape by using its action on a Strength contest versus you Spellcasting ability; this spell can only be cast at ground level, though the astral liquid will pour onto lower surfaces out to the 20 foot radius  At higher levels: add 1d6 radiant damage for each level above 6th"

162,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,I made a magically powered suit of Power Armor as an item for my party to find. What are your thoughts on it balance wise?,4,4q0jby,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/4q0jby/i_made_a_magically_powered_suit_of_power_armor_as/,2016-06-27 10:18:21,"Here's the item: **Golem Plate** *Very Rare Plate Armor (Requires Attunement) (Requires Strength 15 to wear)* This magical suit of Plate Armor is an experimental exoskeleton made from the chassis of clockwork constructs is powered by magical infusion and weighs exactly 500 pounds. While attuned, you can take an action to expend a spell slot into the armor, powering it for 1 hour per spell slot level expended. Expending additional spell slots adds to this time. You may wear any light or medium armor at the same time as you wear this armor, however you gain no benefit from that armor, magical or otherwise. While powered, it takes 1 action to Doff or Don the Power Armor. While unpowered, it takes the standard Plate Donning or Doffing time. While not in use, energy drains as normal. While the suit is powered, you have Vulnerability to Lightning Damage. While Unpowered, your move speed is reduced by 10, you have disadvantage on dexterity ability checks and saving throws, and you require a DC 10 Athletics check to move. Once this check is made, you must repeat it every 60 seconds to keep moving. **Sound Dampeners.** As a Bonus Action, you may spend 30 minutes of energy to remove the disadvantage penalty to stealth checks for 10 minutes. **Kinetic Absorption.** As a Bonus Action, you may activate a forcefield around your armor. For 1 minute, you gain Resistance to nonmagical Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage made with weapons that are not Adamantine or by falling. Whenever you suffer this damage, your remaining energy is reduced by 1 minute for each damage resisted. You also become immune to Force damage while this is active. You may activate this feature once per Dawn. **Concussion Wave.** As an Action you may spend 1 hours worth of energy to create a concussive blast of force that knocks everything around you away. All creatures adjacent to you must make a DC 14 Strength Saving Throw On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 Force damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isnt pushed. In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you. **Blast Cannon.** As an action, you may expend 1 hours worth of energy to release a fiery projectile at an area within a range of 90 feet. Each creature in a 5 foot radius must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, all creatures in the area take 3d6 Fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. **Emergency Ejection.** As a reaction which is taken when the armor runs out of energy, or as an action, you may choose to activate the armors explosive failsafe mechanism, which violently and explosively blasts you out the back of the armor. You take 3d8 Fire damage, are knocked back 10 feet and you are forced prone. What are you thoughts on balance? Should I remove time as a mechanic and make it a charge based energy storage that drains over time?"

164,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,"[Spell] Blizzard, a 5th-level spell inspired by Overwatch",22,4ltysm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/4ltysm/spell_blizzard_a_5thlevel_spell_inspired_by/,2016-05-31 16:58:43,"Hey all, first post ever on reddit! I've been stalking this sub for a while, but I wanted to get some feedback on this spell I created based on Mei's ultimate ability from Overwatch. **Blizzard** *5th-level evocation* **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S, M (a leaf that has been frozen solid) **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute **Class:** Sorcerer, Wizard You create a swirling vortex of sheer cold and howling winds in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and swirling ice and snow lightly obscures the area. Each creature within the area when you create it, or that enters the area or starts its turn there, must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 cold damage, or half as much on a successful one. An additional effect is then applied based on how many consecutive times the creature has failed its saving throw against this spell's effects, which lasts for the spell's duration or until the creature succeeds on a saving throw against this spell. Each effect is removed one at a time, in descending order of when they were applied. When the spell ends, a creature still suffering from its effects continues to make saving throws, but takes no cold damage and suffers no additional effects on a failed save. The effects are described below: **Saving Throw  Effect**  1st  The creature's speed is reduced by 5 feet.  2nd  The creature's speed is reduced by an additional 10 feet, and it can't take reactions.  3rd  The creature's speed is reduced to 0, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.  4th  The creature can't take actions and gains vulnerability to cold damage.  5th  The creature freezes solid and is considered petrified until freed by the *greater restoration* spell or other such magic. This effect persists beyond the end of the spell. ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cold damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th. What do you think? Does it make sense? Is it too powerful, and if so, how can I change it so it's not? (Alternatively, is it not powerful enough?) Thanks!"
165,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Balancing some special magic artifacts [5e],3,4ohysv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/4ohysv/balancing_some_special_magic_artifacts_5e/,2016-06-17 16:34:13,"So for my current game I have been working on some artifacts that I expect to come into play late in the game. However, I want to make sure that they are balanced of equal power for all. If you are currently hunting Baron Firemont, don't read further. For each artifact I have been spit balling some idea's. Please let me know what you think and any suggestions. 1. Silence (Staff) Allows the wielder to prepare up to five spell levels from any spell list. Once a day, lets the wielder get +2 DC to a school of magic. 2. Charlie's Heavenly Apparatus of Rousing Music This is specifically for the bard in the group, it would let him use cutting word on the enemies save on spells he casts. Also I was thinking of allowing it to bestow a legendary save 1/day. 3. Larethian Circlet This is a skirmisher type item, in my mind. Allowing the wearer to cast misty step and gives the first attack per round advantage. 4. Breaker's cape My first idea was to combine the displacer cloak along with regaining HP when the wearer scores a critical hit. 5. Howling Saber (This one I have the hardest thinking of) First thoughts was a holy avenger that also gives flight. Making the bearer like a literal angle. 6. Clasp This armor would give vulnerability to the damage that the bearer uses. So like, if he hits with a bludgeoning attack, the enemy would give vulnerability to bludgeoning damage until the wearer hits with something else. I thought at first to limit it to the next hit of that type. Please let me know what you think and any suggestions would be SUPER GREAT."
166,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,[HOMEBREW] WARLOCK Otherworldly Patron - Fallen,9,4ooqdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/4ooqdc/homebrew_warlock_otherworldly_patron_fallen/,2016-06-19 00:34:18,"Hi all, This is just something I've been thinking about just recently and finally decided to write down. It's a homebrew patron for the Warlock class in 5e. Now as I will also mention in the slight preface, it is inspired quite heavily from Jim Buthcer's 'The Dresden Files' fiction book series, so there is some SPOILERS in there if you have not yet read and are planning to read it, ye be warned! But it is a great book series and I highly recommend it. Also this may have been done before or something similar but this has been just my own expression of the idea so far with input from my DM who has suggested I take to reddit for feedback and ideas. I will warn you now that it is a bit wordy for something as small as it is but the lore it is based from is quite rich, which is hard to convey in such a small section of the class. I welcome any constructive feedback and ideas, and of course as a homebrew I welcome anyone to use it and change it to suit their own campaign but please don't post it here or elsewhere are your own idea. Now this is by no means finished, nor has it been tested. I can't speak for the balance but I strived to keep it as balanced and interesting as I can. I also typed it out at about 2am so I apologies for any silly spelling/grammar mistakes and repetition. Anywho, enough rambling. Enjoy! And don't forget to leave me some feedback, it would be much appreciated. =) *APOLOGIES FOR THE WALL OF TEXT* I've made it a bit prettier and nicer to ready with the help of *thehomebrewery* Link: URL --------------------------------------------------------------------- **PREFACE** *So the inspiration for much of this patron homebrew comes from Jim Butchers novel series The Dresden Files, which I enjoyed thoroughly. This homebrew is targeted at something like what the interaction between Harry Dresden and Lasciel was but molded toward more of the character I had in mind. Please note that I have tried to keep this as balanced as I can while including as much borrowed lore for flavor. I know some others prefer a more 'impactful' or 'powerful' which is totally fine, but my idea for my character was not that of a heavy spell slinger or front-liner, but more toward a spellsword who is somewhat reluctant to rely on the magic from his patron for fear of corruption, but also will use what resources he has at hand if the need is great and he feels it's use is justified (Lawful Neutral Alignment). For those who are familiar with the series, yes I am very aware that there a significantly different expressions of the Fallen and the Knights of the Blackened Denarius but this is what I had in mind to use. Please feel free to use or modify this to your own designs but please dont forget to credit the talented Jim Butcher for his inspiring work. -Sled Dog* ____________________________________________ Version 1.01 **OTHERWORLDLY PATRON** **FALLEN / DENARIAN** Your patron is one of the fallen. Very little is known of the fallen, save for that a select few now reside in thirty ancient pieces of silver, coins from an ancient civilization. These thirty denarii each contain one of the fallen, with their own thoughts, knowledge, and power. This group of thirty fallen are referred to as the Order of the Blackened Denarius. Some of these beings have been known to offer power and knowledge to the Holders, corrupting them and eventually taking control of their Holder toward their own ends, dominating them completely. However others have worked toward an alliance between themselves and their Holders, in which the Fallen and the Holder work together toward a mutual benefit. One who holds a coin is known as a Knight of the Blackened Denarius, however many simple refer to them as a Holder. Some of the Knights, or rather the Fallen within them, will work with other fallen and their Knights, but these alliances are tenuous, where in other times they work against one another. Little else is known about the Denarians themselves, other than that they are a secretive group of individuals whose power and methods can differ greatly between each one of them. The Fallen seem to be more related to devils in the way they scheme and bargain, using subtlety and knowledge to entice mortals. It is said that once one of the thirty silver denarii has been touched willingly, the essence of the Fallen within the coin is imprinted within the mind of the one who touched it, and can then communicate directly with them. It is even said that once the coin has been touched and accepted, the Holder can summon the coin to them and absorb the coin into their body. While some of the Denarians work toward some form of an Armageddon, others simply work toward their own ends. This might be due to some Denarians being jealous of, or hateful toward humans. However others are intrigued of the mortal races and wish to enhance their own understanding of them, for purposes only they know. Additionally, those who hold a coin have implicit knowledge on the basic origins of the being that inhabits it. Therefore due to the nature of the fallen, only characters whose alignment is Neutral or Evil can take up a coin. Regardless of their goals, their presence in the coins can be exposed through magic detection spells, but only the type of entity they are is revealed. Their identity can only be discerned by seeing the coin, branding or symbol of the Fallen by those who have the religious knowledge of them, which are very few. **THE COINS** Each fallen contains most of their essence within their own coin, the silver denarius. Each of these coins has the unique symbol of the residing Fallen contained within it. This coin can be summoned to the Holder once a link has been formed, assuming the coin is not already contained within the body of the Holder. The coin can also be absorbed into the body of the Holder during a short rest, and can also be extracted from the Holder's body, also during a short rest. The point in which coin is absorbed leaves a branding of the coin and the symbol of the Fallen, which glows faintly when channeling any magic. **EXPANDED SPELL LIST** The Fallen lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you. **FALLEN EXPANDED SPELLS** Spell Level Spells 1st *shield of faith, searing smite* 2nd *blur, continual flame* 3rd *fireball, haste* 4th *fire shield, compulsion* 5th *flamestrike, contagion* **ANGELIC ORIGIN** While the Fallen wield Hellfire and Lord over many of the denizens of Hell, they began as something else. The pact boons of the Fallen can vary from terrifying tokens of Hell to majestic and graceful tokens from heaven, corrupted but still elegant in form. A familiar might be a graceful animal, majestic and proud but also corrupted. The Fallen are also very familiar with magic, including that of the faiths. While it might seem strange that a fiend might provide the means to use magic that most might consider reserved only for clerics or paladins, the Fallen were once of the heavens, and even now still possess the knowledge and magic they once had, however it might not work or appear quite the same as it once did. Holy or radiant magic wielded by you now takes the form and function of fire damage in its place which, like all of your magic enhanced by hellfire, shows slight but distinct signs of hellfire. As a gift from the presence of the Fallen in your mind, you can now read, speak and understand infernal through your bond. This isn't so much knowledge learned but youre patron interpreting it for your mind and translating it through your brain as you hear, speak and read it. **AGES OF LEARNING** The Fallen have knowledge and skills learned from many different hosts throughout the centuries, not including their own vast intellect. As an Eldritch Invocation, you can choose to learn on skill or proficiency from your patron. This could be learning how to use thieves tools, alchemy supplies, a martial weapon, armor tier, history, stealth, etc. **FLEXIBLE FOCUS** Starting at 1st level, you don't require a separate focus to cast your spells if you currently hold: the coin of your patron, your Book of Shadows, or Pact Weapon, as it now functions as your spellcasting focus. As the coin of your patron can be 'absorbed' into your body, the coin must still be contained within your hand, usually impregnated in the palm of the hand visible beneath the surface of the skin. Due to the nature of the Fallen and their coins, once a Holder has absorbed the coin into their body they gain resistance to mind control, fear and charm effects. **HELLFIRE ENHANCEMENT** Starting at 6th level, you patron has granted you access to Hellfire. This can enhance your spells and weapon attacks with increased damage, or change the element of certain spells to fire when applicable. Hellfire enhances damaging spells and weapon strikes you make, showing a minor fire effect, which is accompanied by the telltale black smoke and slight odor of brimstone characterized hellfire. Once per turn, you gain additional damage on spell hit or weapon strike (made with your pact weapon) equal to half your character level, rounded up (minimum of 1). This effect may only occur once per round, so will only benefit an AoO if hellfire enhancement has not yet been used during the current round. **HELLFIRE POTENCY** Starting at 10th level, your mastery of fire and hellfire grows. You gain resistance to all fire damage. If you previously possessed resistance to fire you do not gain immunity from this feature. In addition to your resistance, the hellfire enhancement of you magic can overcome those who can usually resist the element of fire. All your fire damage ignores resistance to fire damage, and can now affect those thought immune to fire damage as though they have only resistance to it. **THE POWER WITHIN** Starting at 14th level, you can plead with your Fallen patron to assist you, granting them the ability to directly affect your actions and abilities, working in unison with you to assist in all aspects of combat. While possessed, you appear to slowly smolder, and the angelic symbol of your patron glows faintly on your forehead as do your eyes. This effect subsides when the possession is over. You can spend a bonus action to initiate the possession, which lasts for a maximum of three rounds. This ability can be dropped early at the cost of another bonus action; otherwise will expire automatically at the end of your third round of possession. During the possession, you gain increased abilities, reflexes and resistances from your patron's experience. You gain advantage on all ability checks and saving throws. Additionally, you may add your Charisma modifier to all spell attack and weapon attack rolls to hit and also to your spell save DC for the duration of the possession. Additionally, you also gain extra damage from the possession. You may also add your Charisma modifier bonus to your Hellfire Enhancement damage. You become immune to mind control effects when possessed and can use your reaction to attempt to reflect any charm, fear or mind control spell back on the caster (Spellcasting ability check [Charisma] vs. the spell's save DC) if it has been cast at you. Due to Fallen's presence within your form, you share their vulnerability to radiant damage for the duration of the possession and have become vulnerable to spells that would normally only affect fiends, within reason. Once this feature has been used, it cannot be used again until after a long rest. ** *Changelog:* ** ** *V1.01* ** *Added Ages of Leaning as an Eldritch Invocation option;* *Changed title from 14th level bonus to The Power Within*"
167,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Cleric Charm Domain,4,4je9mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/4je9mw/cleric_charm_domain/,2016-05-15 12:26:34,"**Charm Domain:** Clerics of this domain most often follow Sune, known also as, Lady Firehair, the Lady of Lone, the Princess of Passion. Sune Firehair is a deity of passion and the delights of the senses. Her Clerics foster the beauty of all things in the world, fine arts, the best foods, the tastiest drinks, the softest clothes; they seek out the pleasures of all things in life. Temples dedicated to Sune are common in human lands, and they frequently server as public baths, places of relaxation, and sometimes even brothels. When cities are not large enough for a temple, on a street corner there might consist of a small shrine, with a mirror, and a shelf lined with perfumes and various cosmetics, so those without the funds to purchase these items can still make themselves feel beautiful in their day to day life. *Charm Domain Spells:* 1st Charm Person, Command 3rd Enthrall, Suggestion 5th Tongues, Leomund's Tiny Hut 7th Complusion, Dominate Beast 9th Dominate Person, Modify Memory **Divine Grace:** At 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill and the Performance skill. Additionally, while you are wearing no armor, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier. You may use a shield and still gain this benefit. This AC does not stack with features named Unarmored Defense. **Glamour:** At 1st level, you learn the friends cantrip. If you cast this cantrip, the target does not realize you used magic to influence its behavior when the spell ends. This feature can be used a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and you regain all uses when you finish a long rest. After using this feature on a creature, it cannot be used on the same creature again for 24 hours. **Channel Divinity:** *Sirens Song:* As an action, you invoke the name of your deity and proceed to sing, creatures within 30 of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is charmed and incapacitated by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. Creatures that step into range of your Sirens Song must make a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the ability. On each of your turns up to 1 minute, you may continue the Sirens Song with a bonus action; this Sirens Song also requires your concentration to maintain, you main increase the duration of Siren's Song for an additional minute for each Channel Divinity expended to maintain the song **Channel Divinity:** *Divine Beauty* At 6nd level, When you cast a domain spell or an enchantment spell, you can spend a use of your Channel Divinity feature to impose a disadvantage on the first save creatures make against that spell. If the spell is a charm spell, the target or targets don't realize they were influenced by magic when the spell ends, instead they will try to rationalize and justify their own behavior as best they can, or make up excuses when they can't, and you gain advantage on saving throws to resist charm and dominate effects **Potent Spellcasting** Starting at 8th level, you add your wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip. **Charm Vulnerability:** At 17th level, creatures within 60 feet of you have disadvantage on saves against your charm spells. If a creature is resistant to the charming condition they now roll saves normally. Creatures who are immune to the charm condition act as normal. What do you guys think? Too weak? Too strong? Just right? Edit: I would like to change the 8th level ability to something else charm related, however I was just following the tradition that PHB and SCAG has laid out with either Potent Spellcasting or Divine Strike. **Change Log:** Added Flavor text to the domain, Sune is currently the best fit for the direction that I want this domain to go forward with. Adjusted Sirens Song that you can only maintain the Sirens Song for a maximum of 1 minute with your channel divinity, you may renew the duration of this song with another use of Channel Divinity. Adjusted Domain spells, removed Bestow Curse and replaced with Leomunds Tiny Hut, also replaced Geas with Dominate Person. ~~Adjusted Bonus Proficiency, players may now choose two from Persuasion, Performance and Deception.~~ Adjusted Divines Beauty Channel Divinity feature to state it takes your action to use. ~~Adjusted Casting Stat for this Cleric Domain, changed several instances in the domain from wisdom to charisma to fit the new casting stat.~~ Adjusted Sirens Song: Specified Duration, Specified it requires your concentration and bonus action to keep using turn to turn, added that you can extend your song for an additional minute for each use of Channel Divinity. Adjusted Divine Beauty, added that you now have advantage on saving throws to resist charm and persuasion attempts. ~~Adjusted: Charm Vulnerability: Added a clause at the end, creatures with charm immunity make saves with advantage.~~ Adjusted: Unarmored Defense / Bonus Proficiency to Divine Grace: You may benefit from a shield while unarmored, and you get the persuasion and performance skills, reworded with the aide of user /u/roan_knight Adjusted: Glamorous Treachery name to just Glamour, reworded with the aide of user /u/roan_knight Adjusted: Divine Beauty, reworded and reworked with the aide of user /u/roan_knight. Adjusted: Charm Vulnerability. Does not work against immune creatures, creatures who are resistant roll normally and those without resistance roll with disadvantage."
168,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Recreating Monster Musume species in D&amp;D 5e: The Lamia,10,4kvykr,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/4kvykr/recreating_monster_musume_species_in_dd_5e_the/,2016-05-25 06:45:18,"Hello everyone! &amp;nbsp; Ever since I saw the anime and manga of [Monster Musume](URL I've wondered to myself how the different species and subspecies could be represented in D&amp;D's fifth edition as playable races in a fantasy setting. To that effect, I've started to draft up how their traits and abilities might look. Any feedback you folks can provide in this regard would be most welcome! &amp;nbsp; So without further ado, here is the first monster race being submitted for your review and comments: **The Lamia!** &amp;nbsp; P.S. My interpretation of these monster species are intended to have both male and female genders, except for the ones which are specifically classed as mono-gendered. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; #Lamia [The Lamia](URL are a reptilian liminal race with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a snake. A mono-gendered (female) demi-human race, Lamias are predatory carnivores that form tribal villages on the outskirts of desert oasis. Fully grown, their serpentine tails are powerful enough to bend iron. &amp;nbsp; #Lamia Traits **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution increases by 2. **Age.** Lamia reach maturity at 15 and can live to be 800 or so. **Alignment.** Lamia lean more towards chaotic alignments. **Size.** Your size is medium. However, because Lamia have such long tails to balance themselves on, you take up an additional 5 feet of space directly behind you at all times, unless you take the time to curl yourself up, in which case you take up a medium-sized space as normal. **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. **Constrict.** A Lamia can constrict a medium or smaller creature with its powerful tail. This takes an action and works like a grapple (phb conditions) and does 1d6 bludgeoning damage at the end of each turn the creature is grappled. To break out of the constriction, the foe must oppose the Lamia in a strength roll. **Natural Climber.** You have the advantage on checks made to climb vertical surfaces. **Thick Scales.** A Lamian's scales are thick granting it an unarmored AC of 11 + dexterity modifier. **Forked Tongue.** A Lamia can taste things even when they cannot see them. A Lamia gains advantage on passive Perception checks to identify unseen attackers, and creatures sneaking within 15ft of the Lamia have disadvantage on sneak rolls. The Lamians' sense of smell is very strong, rivaled to that of a Canine. **Cold-Blooded.** You have vulnerability to cold damage. **Languages.** Common **Subspecies.** You belong to one of the four subspecies listed below, of which you must choose one. &amp;nbsp; #Subspecies #Humanbred Humanbred are among the most common breeds of lamia in the world today. Their upper torsos are the most human out of all the other subspecies, aside from their snakelike eyes and slightly-elflike ears, and tend towards more human sensibilities. This subspecies represents the ideal balance between monster and human. **Ability Score Adjustment.** Your Dexterity increases by 1. **Human Empathy.** You have proficiency in the Persuasion skill. **Human Training.** You are proficient with one additional weapon type of your choice. &amp;nbsp; #Echidna Echidnas are a subspecies of Lamia. Because more of their bodies are covered by scales compared to lamias, echidnas are more closely related to Lizardfolk. Their name means ""viper women"", and true to their name, they possess poisonous fangs inside their mouths. Their venom is a type of hemorrhagin (meaning that it breaks down blood vessels) and must be treated with caution. Their snake-like lower bodies are covered in a unique pattern reminiscent of vipers. **Ability Score Adjustment.** Your Strength increases by 1. **Venomous Bite.** You can use your action to make the following attack: **Venomous Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: Your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1d4 + your Dexterity modifier piercing damage and the target must make a Constitution save. The DC for this save is equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. The target takes an extra 1d6 poison damage on a failed save, and half as much on a successful save. This poison damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, and increases again to 3d6 at 11th level. After you use your venomous bite, you can't use it again until you complete a long or short rest. **Echidna Claws.** Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 slashing damage. &amp;nbsp; #Medusa Medusas are a subspecies of Lamia with snakes for hair. Also known as gorgons, in mythology, their gaze are said to turn creatures into stone, but in reality they possess no such ability. However, their gaze does seem to be very keen, and their glare makes living creatures unable to move, as though they indeed have been turned to stone. This is due to the fact that they have poor eyesight. They only appear to be glaring as they are only trying to see more clearly. Because their hair is made of snakes they are tragically troubled by the fact that they can't change their hairstyle. **Ability Score Adjustment.** Your Charisma increases by 1. **Paralyzing Gaze.** You may spend an action to channel your gaze against any creature within 30 feet of you that can see your eyes, forcing it to make a Constitution saving throw. The DC for this save is equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. The target becomes paralyzed on a failed save. At the start of the target's next turn, it regains mobility, but only moves at half speed. The target regains full mobility on the turn after that. After you use your paralyzing gaze, you can't use it again until you complete a long or short rest. Your paralyzing gaze has no effect on huge or larger creatures. **Monstrous Appearance.** You are proficient with the intimidation skill. &amp;nbsp; #Melusine Melusines are a lamia subspecies with dragon wings on their backs. In contrast to other lamia subspecies, they are more similar to sea snakes than terrestrial snakes and prefer to live by the shore. Sadly, their wings aren't strong enough to lift their long lower bodies, making said wings being more vestigial in nature. **Ability Score Adjustment.** Your Intelligence increases by 1. **Sea Creature (replaces Cold-Blooded).** You have a swim speed of 50 feet, and you are no longer vulnerable to cold damage. **Bracing Wings.** The support from your vestigial wings give you the advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock you prone."

Also, how is the archtype power overall? Too much? (Sorry about the formatting!) ________________________________________ **OATH OF THE OVATE** Druids and bards of old, rangers, clerics of the Nature domain, even paladins who take the Oath of the Ancients are sometimes not enough. When the elements requires a champion, they looks to the paladins that have taken the Oath of the Ovate. **TENETS OF THE OVATES** [TBD] **OATH SPELLS** You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed. OATH OF THE OVATE SPELLS **Paladin Level - Spells** 3rd - *ensnaring strike, hunters mark* 5th - *hold person, magic weapon* 9th - *elemental weapon, haste* 13th - *conjure minor elementals, ice storm* 17th - *conjure elemental, hold monster* **CHANNEL DIVINITY** When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. ***Absorb Elements.*** As a reaction, which you take when you take acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your Channel Divinity to capture some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on you and storing it to empower your weapon for your next strike. You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with elemental energy. Until the end of your next turn or until you successfully hit with that weapon (whichever occurs first), you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The first time you hit with that weapon before the end of your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type. You then lose the Charisma modifier bonus to attack rolls granted by this effect. The extra damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 6th level (2d6), 9th level (3d6), 13th level (4d6), and 17th level (5d6). ***Study Your Enemy.*** As an action, you can study a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious, or until you use Study Your Enemy again. You also choose one damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. The DM tells you if the creature is immune, resistant, or vulnerable (if any) to that damage type. You may only have one studied creature at a time. If you use Study Your Enemy on a second creature, you no longer gain the effects against the first one. **AURA OF FURY** Starting at 7th level, the paladin, as well as any nonhostile fey and elementals within 10 feet of the paladin, gains a bonus to melee weapon damage rolls equal to the paladins Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). A creature can benefit from this feature from only one paladin at a time. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. **MASTER YOUR ENEMY** Starting at 15th level, the zeal with which you Study Your Enemy gives you greater anticipation over your foes actions. When a creature under the effect of your Study Your Enemy makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a weapon attack against that creature if it is within range. **ELEMENTAL CHAMPION** At 20th level, you can...

During this round you cannot move, and cannot take any actions, bonus actions or reactions. You also cannot concentrate on any other effects (as if you were casting a concentration spell). If you are grappled, shoved or take damage, you must make a concentration saving throw to continue to study your enemy. At the beginning of your next turn you then learn your enemys resiliencies and weaknesses to the elements and to your attacks.~~ ~~The DM tells you if the creature has vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to each of acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage.

It was inspired by some of the ones listed in the [Deck of Decks](URL but I have tried to make them unique: There are five decks of mythic cards on the material plane. These decks, numbering 22 cards each, are the stuff of legend. They are said to be both helpful and harmful, having both elevated ruffians to rulers and reduced heroes to ruin. The most famous of these is the ***Deck of Many Things***. The others are the ***Deck of Unfortunate Things***, the ***Deck of Chaotic Things***, the ***Deck of Material Things*** and the final, and most rare, deck before you: ***The Deck of Many Decks*** It comes with a four sided die and operates under slightly different rules than the other decks: 1. Each player can draw up to 10 times. 1. Every time you pull from the deck, you also must roll the die. 1. Each deck has a number and the die determines which of the other deck's will be pulled from. 1. Cards are returned to the deck and it is shuffled after every pull. 1.

171,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Ulfsark Primal Path V2,6,4a36d0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/4a36d0/ulfsark_primal_path_v2/,2016-03-12 19:51:19,"Author's Note: I decided to hew a little bit closer to The Middle Finger of Vecna's Dreadnaught archetype in some ways with this draft--including the rounds based rage and the 10th level ability. I also decided to make the shapeshifting the archetype's capstone and tried to make sure it's a suitably impressive ability. Lastly, I gave the archetype half of the Great Weapon Master feat in compensation for the silver vulnerability. This replaced the improved unarmed strikes and bonus action attack the archetype enjoyed previously. So, how is this archetype thematically? Balance wise? It originally started as a way to convert The Middle Finger of Vecna's Dreadnaught archetype to a traditional fantasy setting from a magitek one. **Path of the Ulfsark** &gt;Those barbarians who walk the path of the Ulfsark dont merely fight like wild men. They possess the minds and souls of wolvesthe blessings of the gods of the hunt. They are set apart from their fellow mortals by black pinned gold eyes and long fangs. This bestial nature grants them unnatural vitality, and much like the wild animals whose souls are bound to theirs, they are always ready to hunt their prey. **Wolf Kin** &gt;When you select this path at 3rd level, your beast blood awakens and grants you a new form of rage. When you rage, it is with the cold fury and sudden violence of a stalking wolf. Instead of raging normally, you may rage for a number of rounds equal to three times your constitution bonus. These rounds need not be consecutive. You can begin and end your rage as a bonus action. Your rage only ends early if you fall unconscious or choose to end it. After raging for this number of rounds, you must complete a short or long rest before raging again. Additionally, you lose your damage resistance against silvered weapons, but the focused nature of your fury allows you to channel your strength into sudden explosions of raw power. You may take a -5 penalty to your attack roll to add +10 to your damage roll on any attack. **Heightened Senses** &gt;Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you begin to adopt the improved abilities of a natural predator. You gain advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) check involving hearing or smell. **Beast Mind** &gt;At 6th level, you are immune to being charmed or frightened. **Wolf's Pounce** &gt;Beginning at 10th level, when you use your action to Dash, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or to shove a creature. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before taking this bonus action, you have advantage on this attack roll. **Lord of the Wild Hunt** &gt;At 14th level, you can shapeshift into a hybrid form for one minute once per long rest. In this hybrid form, you gain all the benefits of rage, and your unarmed strikes do 1d10 points of slashing damage and count as magical. In addition, you may make an additional attack as a bonus action when you attack with your unarmed strike. Finally, you may add half your proficiency to your damage on each unarmed strike. "

While I love the simplicity of 5e, I desired a little more choice and crunch to the default weapon stats. Here's my attempt at giving the weapons a little more identity (and in certain cases, balance). I've added a few keywords and clarified others. I also did my best to avoid static multipliers (the 3.5 approach) and keep things to common mechanics. This list might be most useful to those who want to use resistance and vulnerability more liberally than the RAW Monstrous Manual- I find combats much more interesting when damage type matters. Let me know what you think! *One addition I'll also be using in the next version- The ""Two-handed"" property will also get the following description ""You may also choose to halfsword/strike with the haft of this weapon for 1d4 bludgeoning damage"". This is mostly for flavor but occasionally be useful."

My friend suggested a homebrew race of tree/plant-like humanoid race. Their general feel is more of a human-treant rather than a fey creature like dryad. He added some racial abilities but they were very vague, OP or didn't fit in the 5e mechanics very well (like scaling AC with proficiency bonus or a bonus depending on level). One of the interesting racials would be ability he called Blossom which was in fact a once-per-long-rest rapid regeneration. I tried redesigning it into something like this: **Spread roots.** As an action you grow roots from your feet into the ground and drain nutrients from the nature around you, rapidly restoring your health. For 1 minute your speed becomes 0 and you automaticaly fail Dexterity saving throws. Your AC also doesn't get the Dex bonus. Every round you restore 1d4 health, you can end this early as a bonus action. Any suggestions on how I can change this? Or does it seem balanced? Maybe I should add concentration? Thanks for any suggestion in advance! Here's what I have so far: ***Briari*** **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2. **Damage Vulnerability.** You have Vulnerability to fire damage. **Living Armor.** When you are not wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. During a short rest, you can bond a suit of armor you are wearing to your body. When you finish that short rest, the armor you are wearing is bonded to you, and it cannot subsequently be removed from your body until you finish another short rest during which time you remove the bonded armor. **One with nature.** When you are resting in forests, swamps or other places near earth and plants you need only 4 hours of sleep, otherwise you need 8. **Natural Light.** You can produce natural light from glowing points on your body as an action. This creates bright light in a 20 foot radius around you, and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The color of the light is determined by your subrace. You can stop producing the light as an action. *Subraces* &gt;Duran (red\orange) * **Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 1. * **Toughness.** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level. &gt;Vinethar (dark-blue, blue-green) * **Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 1. * **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 35 feet * **Mask of the wild.** You can attempt to hide even when you are lightly obscured in foliage, mist, heavy rain and other natural phenomenon. &gt;Brightli (liliac) * **Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom or Charisma score increases by 1. * **Innate Magic.** You know the *Druifcraft* cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the *Entangle* spell once per day. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the *Spike Growth* spell once per day. Wisdom or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. The fire vulnerability is still up in the air for me, as it is the worst vulnerability you can have. But removing it would make this race a bit more powerful comparing to default races. "

175,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Lycanthrope prestige class- looking for suggestions/very rough draft,6,4042wu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/4042wu/lycanthrope_prestige_class_looking_for/,2016-01-09 12:00:13,"Hello! I am currently working on a lycanthrope prestige class. This subbreddit loved the_singular_anyone's vampire prestige class, and since I am DMing a Innistrad-based campaign, I was thinking about a similar (mechanically speaking) prestige class. *I am thinking about a five-level prestige class*. Why a prestige class? While playing a vampire is pretty broken (my opinion) lycantrophe curse is way too simple and grants the player few benefits. Let's start! **Prerequisites:** - must be of a living race - 5th level at least - constitution 14(?) - wisdom (14? charisma here too, for a required strong sense of self?) - have been bitten by a werewolf, a blood ritual, a specific heritage. Something at DM discretion **Hit points:** - 1d10 per level (or 6) for werewolves, weretigers, werehyenas and wererats - 1d12 per level (or 7) for werebears and wereboars **Proficencies** - Perception checks that relies on smell and/or sight (depending on the lycanthrope subrace). You could also know if there is any were-creature like you nearby, thanks to succesful (DC 10) perception check. - Animal handling checks on kindred animals - I guess no saving throw bonuses seems fair, right now at least. **Benefits** - resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non magical weapons that aren't silvered (while morphed) - proficency with unarmed strikes (claws, tooths, nail, whatever WHILE MORPHED). It is progressive, and based on streght for any subrace except for wererats. the idea right now is: cumulative (total) player level|damage and bonus :---|---: 5|d6+1 7|d8+1 11|d10+1, gain one more extra attack 14|d12+1 18|d12+1, gain one more extra attack - disease immunity - superior darkvision (36m) **Flaws** - silver weapon vulnerability - holy simbol vulnerability (at DM's discretion) - lack of self-control, especially until the 3rd level. At DM's discretion, strong rage, hate, or any feeling that perhaps recalls something which is very important for the charater *may* cause a transformation. - wolfsbane aroma (werewolf specific, I know. However, if you're a werewolf you can't stand its smell and ingest anything containing it may cause death. I have to find something like that for every other were-creature, I guess.) - Once per month, on full moon rise night, you have to answer your pack call, if you have any. Anyway, you feel the urge to hunt. At midnight you will morph and stay morphed for the rest of the night, killing and devouring the nearest living creature to you. Once you do so, you are free to wander as you like. You won't remember everything you did while morphed: this happens every time you morph. *EDIT:* ##level 1## At level 1, you gain the following: 1 morph/day, which last as shown in the tabel below. level|transformations per day|duration :---|:--:|---: 1|1|10min 2|1|30min 3|2|1h each 4|2|1h each 5|3|1h each *you can't revert in your human/elf/dwarf etc. form spontaneously* While morphed, you mantain all your traits, but you almost lose all control on yourself. You can't cast spells neither mantain concentration While morphed, you can act as normal, although you feel the urge to answer any ostile presence.You have to attack the closer enemy to you, determined among hostile creatures randomly each turn. If in melee with people you know, and you don't want to harm them, there is a 20% probability that you wont attack and flee, avoiding to hurt someone who maybe is dear to you. For any level in this prestige class, it will increase by another 20% (so, by level 5, you gain full control of yourself) While morphed, you gain the following temporary stat buffs depending on what you just become. were-creature|strenght|dexterity|CA :---|:--:|:--:|---: wolf|+3|+2|+2 bear|+3|+1|+3 rat|+1|+4|+1 hyena|+2|+2|+1 boar|+2|+1|+2 tiger|+2|+3|+2 Your natural armor while morphed is 8+cos+dex+your temporary CA buff. That 8 will maybe rise on higher total levels. If you were wearing any armor at the moment you morph, you stop wearing it- it count as an instant doff. Armors may be ripped apart and be damaged/inusable, at DM discreption. ##level 2 (and following)## I have to rearrange those ability, which the player can pick alternatively in groups of 3, or more, and divide them into active and passive abilities. Active abilities are the ones working while morphed; passive include the hybrid (yeah, that's coming along) or human form. However I am thinking about: - *blood frenzy*: (passive) each time you hit an ostile creature, you gain advantage on the next attack roll - *frightful presence*: (active) as the one in the MM, properly tweaked - *keen nose*: (passive) you gain proficiency in investigation or survival. If already proficient, you may add your proficiency twice - *primal awareness*: (active) blindsight - *restless hunter*: (passive) you gain advantage on survival and investigation checks, +45 ft movement improvement. - *silent step*: (passive) you have advantage on stealth checks while in natural areas, such as forests or caverns, or uncrowded areas, such villages at night. - *lone beast tactics*: (passive) you gain +2 bonus to melee attack rolls when you have no allies within 5 feet of you. - *pack mentality*: (passive) you gain +2 bonus to melee attack rolls when you have at least one ally within 5 feet of you. ok, more to come. Now this is still unfinished but waaay better! Let me know what you think "

Let me know your thoughts! **Playable Race - Eliksni** The Eliksni, or Fallen as the common people know them by, are a nearly extinct. They are a magical race that worship great machines and the ethereal that powers them. During the Whirlwind, their great machines were destroyed and their life-giving ether was all but lost. Now they wander the lands, siphoning the ether out of magical items to survive. **Fierce and Fanatical** The Eliksni are a nomadic race of four-armed, bipedal humanoids. They organize themselves into Houses led by the ruthless Kells. House unity is fickle as the Eliksni will only follow power. If a Kell exhibits weakness, their followers will abandon them. As fickle as house unity is, house alliances are more so. To the Eliksni, an alliance is a unity of two houses and two Kells cannot rule together. **A Broken People** The Eliksni were not always brutal. Their homeland was destroyed in what they call the Whirlwind. What was once a prosperous society fell into disarray. Houses were exterminated, Kells fell in combat, and the houses that did escape were reduced to scavenging to stay alive. Since the genocide committed on their people they rarely ever trust people outside of their house. They are met with hostility wherever they go due to the stigmatism surrounding their race. **Wanderers** Eliksni are at home wherever there is shelter. They are experts at navigating wastelands and ruins. They find themselves most at home in structures long abandoned by ancient civilizations. The empty halls are a friendly reminder of what they once had and they feed off what little magic the halls have left. **Four Armed** *flavor box* The second set of Eliksni arms are located directly below the primary arms and significantly smaller in size. They cannot be used to dual wield two-handed weapons. Treat them as a size smaller than the primary arms when using weapons and performing checks. **Eliksni Traits** Ability Score Increase: Your Dexterity score increases by 2. *Age*: Reach adulthood at roughly 20 years. They live as long as they receive ether to live. *Alignment*: Order above all else. They tend toward Lawful alignments. *Size*: Size varies during an Eliksni life. See below chart for details. *Progression* * Vandal: 4 arms, medium size * Captain: 9th level, 4 arms, medium size, proficient in medium armor. * Kell: 18th level, 4 arms, large size, Thunderwave spell. *Speed*: Base move speed is 30 *Climb Speed*: Vertical surfaces are not difficult for Eliksni. They can scale walls using their full movement. *Darkvision*: Accustomed to dark ruins and skulking in caves, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cant discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. *Volatile Ether*: Vulnerability to lightning damage. *Languages*: They can speak Eliksni and common Subrace: Chose a subrace. *Eliksni Magic* When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Shield spell once per day. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the Invisibility spell once per day. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. *Subrace*: **House Devils** - The Devils cling to the promise of another rise of Eliksni civilization. They know that it will take a great power to unite the Houses again. The Devils wage war and search for items of great power in hopes of creating their next civilization. * Charisma +1 * Toughness - Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level. **House of Winter** - House Winter is dedicated to learning. They bury themselves deep in ancient structures to study glyphs and manuscripts. House Winter is less nomadic, preferring to stay in one place and learn about it until they are forced out. * Intelligence + 1 * Skilled in perception and arcana checks. **The Silent Fang** - Silent assassins, they operate outside of any house. They are hired blades for any that will pay the price. A Fang will never abandon a mark until the job is complete. * Con +1 * Savage Attacks - When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapons damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit. * Skilled in stealth.

I have a rough first draf for a prestige class idea. AN exorcist specializes in dealing with spirits, ghost, and such, an can bind and use them in its battles against the fiends. Before I bother making this look good, id like to get some feedback. -Prerequisites In order to advance as an exorcist, you must meet the following prerequisites (in addition to the multiclassing prerequisites for your existing class):  Wisdom 13.  Constitution 13.  Complete a special task. You must be exposed to an evil spirit -Class Features Hit Dice: 1d8 per exorcist level Hit Points per Level: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per exorcist level Proficiencies: investigation Tools: None Saving Throws: none Skills: None -Spellcasting Your exorcist level is your spellcasting ability for the purposes of spells and abilities you use from your exorcist training that require a saving throw or spell attack. Your spell attack and spell save DC are listed below. Spell save DC = 8 + proficiency + Exorcist level Spell attack modifier = proficiency bonus + exorcist level Dead Eye  At 1st level you can see into the ethereal plane up to 60 feet. You can see ghosts and spirits if they are invisible. If someone is possessed within 60 feet of you, you can see the spirit inside them -Bind Poltergeist: At 1st level you can bind poltergeist to your service through a ritual that takes one hour.You may also only ever have one spirit of each type bound at the same time. A bond requires a spell slot to be filled for as long as the spirit is bound. A spell slot filled in this way is not recovered after a long rest, and you may only restore the spell slot used to bind a spirit after a long rest once the spirit has been released. Depending on the type of spirit bound, you gain certain benefits while the spirit is in your power and when you release the spirit, as detailed at the end of the class description. Releasing a spirit is a bonus action, although some spirits allow release as a reaction. -Life Ward: At 2nd level, you gain the ability to perform a rite of warding as an action. The ward has a radius of 30 feet, centered on you, and is stationary for its duration. While inside the ward, friendly creatures cannot be charmed, frightened, or possessed by spirits and have resistance to all damage from spiritual sources. You can use an action to release a bound poltergiest an heal all friendly allies in the life ward a number of hitpoints equal to 10x the spell slot level. Additionally, if a friendly creature would be reduced to 0 hit points inside the ward but not killed outright, the creature becomes stable. The ward lasts 10 minutes per level, or until you perform another rite of warding. Once you use this feature you must finish a short rest before you can use it again. -Exorcism: At 3rd level, you gain the ability to perform an exorcism. This ability functions as the banishment spell against spirits and incorporeal creatures. Unlike the banishment spell, the exorcism does not require concentration after casting, and the target does not return by default. Alternatively, you can attempt to exorcise a living targets own soul. The target makes save and on a failed save, the target is dealt 6d8 necrotic damage and is stunned for one turn. On a successful save, the target only takes half damage and is . You may use this feature twice, after which you must take a long rest before you can use it again. -Channel Spirit 4th level: Spirits are a part of the living world, and your have learned to channel their power to augment your own. At the end of a long rest, you can choose to increase one ability score of your choice by 2 or increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. At the end of each subsequent long rest, you can alter this choice, reducing the scores you previously increased and improving different scores. (If you chose to increase two abilities, you can opt to alter only one of those choices.) -Possession You have learned to use the greatest strength of your enemy as a weapon. You can project your spirit from your body up to 1 mile. While your spirit is projected the material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesnt need food or air and doesnt age. Your spirit form is ghostly and ethereal, allowing you to pass through solid objects and creatures. While in this form you cannot physically interact with the material world, and it cannot physically interact with you. You can try to posses another creatures body. You must end your turn in the creatures square. At the beginning of the creatures turn they must make a wisdom save, on a failed save you posses the creatures body. While a creature Is possesd in this manner it acts on your turn and you have access to all abilities the creature has. Should the creature be slain while you are in possession of it you are expelled from its body in an adjacent square. The creature may continue to make saving throws on its turn. If it succeeds you are expelled from it into an adjacent square. You may return to your body as a bonus action. After using this power you must complete a long rest before you can use it again. Poltergeists Poltergeist of Agony:In the presence of a spirit of agony, foes wounds continue to bleed, and fires continue to burn. While a spirit of agony is bound, any creature you damage within 30 feet continues to take damage for 3 turns. Damage dealt this way is equal to twice the level of the spell slot used to bind the spirit per turn and is of the same type as the original source. This damage is dealt at the beginning of your turn. Binding this spirit requires a spell slot 1st level or higher to be filled. Release: Bonus Action to release. When you release agony from your power, all creatures within 30 feet who have taken damage in the last round are dealt necrotic damage equal to 4 times the level of the spell slot used to bind the spirit. -Poltergeist of Empathy: Spirits of empathy force your enemies to share your pain. For as long as a spirit of empathy is bound to you, whenever you are dealt damage from a living or undead source, that source takes damage equal to twice the level of the spell slot used to bind this spirit. Binding this spirit requires a spell slot of 2 nd level or higher to be filled. -Release: When you release empathy from your power, a single target within 30 feet takes damage equal to all damage you sustained in the previous round. -Poltergeist of Fear: While you have a spirit of fear bound, creatures who fail a saving throw against one of your spells is frightened if you choose.

So after thinking on it for a bit I decided to begin building a Fetchling race for 5e use. But before I go all out on all the lore and theme of the Fetchlings I wanted to make the base stats good and balanced. Please leave some feedback or thoughts, lore thoughts also welcome. --- **Fetchling** Warped humans from the Shadow Plane. * *Ability Score Increase*: Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 1. * *Age*: Have similar lifespans to humans, however few live to the ends of their lifespan. * *Languages*: You can speak, read, and write Common and Undercommon. * *Size*: Fetchling vary in size, similar to humans, however they are on average slightly shorter than humans; around 4 and a half to 5 and a half feet in height. Regardless, you are classified as a Medium size. * *Speed*: Your base movement speed is 30 feet. * *Skills*: The Shadow Plane is a desolate, dangerous place with everyone doing anything to survive. You gain Proficiency in the Survival Skill. * *Darkvision*: Accustomed to the perpetual night of the Shadow Plane, your eyes have gained a natural attunement to the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. * *Shadow Plane Resident*: The cold bleakness of the Shadow Plane makes you hearty yet you lack tolerance to the one thing the Plane doesnt contain; radiance. You gain Resistance to Cold damage and Vulnerability to Radiant damage. * *Similar Energies (Necromancy)*: As an inhabitant of the Negative hemisphere of the Planes your energy is akin to the energy that powers necromantic spells. You have advantage versus all Necromancy spell saving throws."
180,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,A Homebrewed Saiyan Race,2,3tpgzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/3tpgzt/a_homebrewed_saiyan_race/,2015-11-22 03:39:41,"I have been working on this race for a short while now, as I am a big fan of Dragon Ball Z, and I wished to bring some of the aspects of the show to D&amp;D (D&amp;DBZ?) I am well aware that this race is powerful, and that is somewhat intentional. I think the Saiyan race should be naturally more capable than a mere Earthling, but if anything is well out of balance please let me know, any and all feedback is welcome. **Saiyan Race** *""What's the matter? Not winning as easily as you thought? Heh, you won't be winning at all. What, clown, are you feeling angry? Humiliated? Is that it? Fool! You don't know what humiliation is! Don't worry, I will teach you its bitter taste just as you taught me. Me, a warrior elite. At my finger tips I hold the power to destroy entire worlds. I am a Saiyan of royal blood, I am the last of my kind, and on my shoulders rests the glory of an extinct warrior race. Whole civilisations once trembled at the sound of my name, but you didn't, did you Kakarot? And at your hands, your common hands, my honour and my pride - the foundations on which I have always stood - begin to crumble at my feet. It was at your hands I suffered my first great humiliation, toppled by a piece of low level trash. It is time to take back what is mine - I will not live my life as your second - that time is over. Every breath you take is an assault to my honour, but no more Kakarot. By my hands you will Be cut down inch by inch, the way you have cut down my pride!"" -Vegeta, Prince of All Saiyans* **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2, your Dexterity and Strength scores both increase by 1 **Age.** Saiyan's mature in their mid-teens and typically live just over a century. They don't suffer old age as much as Humans, and remain in their prime well into what Humans would consider old age. **Alignment.** Saiyan's alignment is largely based on their past experiences, although Saiyans living in large communities tend towards Chaotic and Evil as their feral blood causes them to act like a pack of animals. **Size.** A Saiyan's height is about the same as a Human, and can vary just as much, although they are almost without exception muscular. Your size is medium. **Hot-Blooded.** You have resistance to cold damage. **Natural Athleticism.** You gain proficiency in the Athletics skill. **Zenkai.** When you return to positive hit points after dropping to zero hit points you gain a temporary power boost. For the next 10 minutes, your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution all increase by 2, and you gain temporary hit points equal to twice your level. **Tail.** You have a prehensile tail, just long enough to wrap around your waist. It is roughly as strong as an arm, but struggles to make dexterous movements. You can make unarmed strikes with your tail, but not weapon attacks. It can push or drag a weight in pounds equal to 10 times your Strength score, and can lift a weight in pounds equal to 5 times your Strength score. However, your tail is also a weak point. An enemy can make an attack specifically targeting your tail, with disadvantage. Any attacks against your tail deal an additional damage die, and your tail has vulnerability to slashing damage. If it takes damage equal to 1/4 of your hit points, your tail is detached, and you lose any effects regarding it, and your next saving throw, attack roll, or ability check. If an enemy attempts to grapple your tail (with disadvantage) and succeeds, you are considered incapacitated and have disadvantage on all saving throws, attack rolls, or ability checks. While your tail is grappled, you or the grappling creature can make a Strength ability check to detach the tail, with a DC equal to your Constitution score. You have advantage on such a roll. When a tail is severed, it can be regrown by pressing on the small of a Saiyan's back. A Saiyan attempting to do this to themself must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity roll. When you lose your tail, your Strength score decreases by 2 until your next long rest. **Great Ape.** When you are exposed to a full moon, you go through a significant transformation. Your size triples in all dimensions, and your weight is multiplied by 27. Your size increases to Huge, destroying/scattering any worn equipment. In this from, your Strength and Constitution increase by 4, and you also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d10 damage in this from, and you gain the Siege Monster trait (as in the Earth Elemental monster). You also gain temporary Hit points equal to twice your level. While in this transformation, your Intelligence decreases by 4, and you cannot distinguish between allies and enemies, generally attacking all that you can see. While in this transformation you retain all tail weaknesses. This transformation ends if you lose access to the full moon, or if your tail is severed. You cannot transform into a great ape if you don't currently have a tail. **Languages.** You can speak, read and write Common. Random Height and Weight Race/Base Height/Height Modifier/Base Weight/Weight Modifier Saiyan/4'6""/+3d8/130 lb./ (2d4) lb **Potential Addition** **Insatiable Hunger.** You require twice the food intake of a Human. If anyone could point me towards a resource I could use make this into a more official looking PDF that would be appreciated. EDIT: Some spelling and formatting errors fixed."
181,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,[5E] Class: Explorer (Indiana Jones!),16,3ng92a,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/3ng92a/5e_class_explorer_indiana_jones/,2015-10-05 00:42:59,"Rough sketch of a class that's built around dungeoneering and relies on ""Artifacts"" that imbue them with special powers. Also, you know, inspired by Indiana Jones. So two main things to work on: 1. Is there even a *hint* of proper balance? How do we test that? 2. More cool artifact options. #**EXPLORER** #Hit Points **Hit Dice**. 1d8 per explorer level **Hit Points at 1st Level**. 8+ your Constitution modifier **Hit Points at Higher Levels.** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per explorer level after 1st. #Proficiencies **Armor**. Light Armor **Weapons.** Simple weapons, hand crossbows, whips, rapiers, shortswords **Tools.** Climber's Kit **Saving Throws.** Dexterity, Intelligence **Skills.** Choose any three from Acrobatics, Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Perception, Religion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth. #Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: - (a) a rapier, (b) a shortsword, or (c) a quarterstaff - (a) an explorer's pack, or (b) a dungeoneer's pack - A whip, a hand crossbow, and 20 bolts - Leather armour and a component pouch #Class Progression - Level 1: Expertise, Imbalancing Strike, Dungeon Delver - Level 2: Trap Sense, Spellcasting - Level 3: Artifact - Level 4: Ability Score Improvement - Level 5: Shutdown - Level 6: Imbalancing Strike Improvement, Trap Sense Improvement - Level 7: Artifact Feature - Level 8: Ability Score Improvement, Lightning Speed Research - Level 9: -- - Level 10: Dungeon Delver Improvement, Improvised Escape - Level 11: Artifact Feature - Level 12: Ability Score Improvement - Level 13: -- - Level 14: Shutdown Improvement, Ancient Acclimation - Level 15: Artifact Feature - Level 16: Ability Score Improvement - Level 17: -- - Level 18: Impossible Knowledge - Level 19: Ability Score Improvement - Level 20: Lifelong Learning #Class Features **Expertise.** At level 1, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. **Imbalancing Strike.** At level 1, you can knock down foes much larger than you. Subtract 5 from an attack roll with a reach weapon. On a hit, deal normal damage, and if your target is a creature of no more than one size larger than you, it is knocked prone and you deal an extra 1d6 bludgeoning damage. At level 6, you can knock prone a creature that is two sizes larger than you and you deal an extra 2d6 bludgeoning damage instead. **Dungeon Delver.** At level 1, you have already spent hundreds of hours exploring dungeons of all kinds. While in a dungeon, you always know the location of the entrance or exit to that dungeon as long as you have passed through that entrance or exit at least once. You also have advantage on perception and insight checks when searching for hidden rooms, passages, and mimics. At level 10, you know every entrance and exit to a dungeon (regardless of whether you've passed through it) as well as three types of enemies that are currently inside the dungeon at the DM's discretion. **Trap Sense.** At level 2, you have become attuned to the presence of traps. You can use this ability to sense how many traps are within 120 feet of your position. Once you have used this ability, you must complete a short or long rest to use it again. This ability can also be recharged when an ally triggers or disarms a hostile trap you were not aware of from your Trap Sense. At level 6, your range increases to 300 feet and you know the precise direction of any traps you detect with this ability. **Shutdown.** At level 5, your keen mind for practicality has lost all patience for showmanship. When an enemy takes any action that is not the Attack action, you may use your reaction to make a ranged attack on that enemy as long as you have a ranged weapon in your hand. At level 14, you may use this reaction even without having a ranged weapon in your hand: you sheath your current weapon, draw your ranged weapon, fire, and (optionally) draw your original weapon again. **Lightning Speed Research.** At level 8, you are reknowned for your ability to pick up new information and commit yourself to study. When you are in an unfamiliar region or city, you can spend 10 gp and 3 hours of studying to grant yourself advantage on any Intelligence (history) checks about the region for one week. You also know every kind of creature native to the region and can innately sense when someone is lying about their respective knowledge (or simply doesn't know the answer). **Improvised Escape.** At level 10, you think fast on your feet and can make use of items and vehicles around you to facilitate an escape from tricky situations. You gain proficiency in improvised weapons and can safely operate any land vehicle, boat, or riding animal as long as you have a trusted ally riding with you on the same vehicle or creature. Additionally, you may move an extra 10 feet when you take the Dash action. **Ancient Acclimation.** At level 14, you have ingested so many foreign toxins from your various adventures that you have developed antibodies to deal with unwanted infections. You gain resistance to necrotic damage and can identify any poisonous substance you consume, as well as the steps necessary to cure yourself (or others), as long as this poison isn't magical in nature. **Impossible Knowledge.** At level 18, your head swims unbearably with hidden knowledge far beyond your years. You double your proficiency bonus when making an Arcana or History check. Additionally, if you do not know the spell Identify, you learn it immediately. You can cast, at-will, the spell Identify without expending a spell slot. **Lifelong Learning.** At level 20, you have come to a fundamental understanding of the nature of the world and have realized you do not have enough time to explore all that life offers ... not without intervention, at least. Your lifespan doubles. You gain all of the benefits of old age and none of the detriments, remaining fit, active, and healthy until your final days. You gain an additional 4 hit dice, you are immune to disease and necrotic damage, and you are resistant to poison damage. #Artifact Features At level 3, an otherwise mundane item you've acquired through your adventures is revealed to be a powerful Artifact of an ancient religion or civilization. Harnessing the true power of this artifact is crucial to your victory over foes, although the use of these powers often comes with a price. ##Divine Artifact **Blinding Rays of Providence.** At level 3, you are able to display a pale glimpse of your Artifact's true nature. You hold your Artifact high and avert your eyes. All creatures within 30 feet of you who can see your Artifact and have not also averted their eyes must make a Charisma save to meet your spell save DC or are blinded until the end of your next turn. This ability replenishes after completing a long rest or after proudly displaying your Artifact in direct sunlight for 2 hours uninterrupted. Using this ability more than twice in a single day leaves you terribly sunburned for 24 hours; you have vulnerability to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage if you are wearing light armor or no armor. **Shroud of the Martyr.** At level 7, your Artifact rumbles and smokes, empowering you with domination over your foes. Noxious fumes spill from your Artifact, spreading around corners and filling up the room in a 60 foot radius. The fog lasts for a number of turns equal to your Charisma modifier. Every creature in the fumes, aside from yourself, suffers disadvantage on attacks that rely on vision unless these attacks deal radiant damage. Once you have used this ability, you must complete a short rest before you can use it again. After the first use of this ability in a single day, each subsequent use affects you as well  you are no longer immune to the negative effects and you suffer the same as others suffer. You must complete a long rest in order to become immune to its effects again. **Unjust Death** At level 11, your Artifact has begun to directly intervene in your life; it decides whether you live or die, not you. When you drop to zero hit points and are not killed outright, you may add your Charisma modifier to your death saves. You also gain resistance to all damage until you are stabilised or conscious. Once you have used this ability, you must complete a short rest before you can use it again. However, if you attempt to use this ability when you have been knocked unconscious as a clear, direct result of a choice you have made that is unambiguously evil, you instantly die. **True Nature.** At level 15, a secret component of your Artifact is revealed to those who would contest the limits of your power. Ethereal spirits burst out and drain the life out of the dissenters. You may choose up to three creatures that you can see within 20 feet. The creatures you choose must make a Charisma check to meet your spell save DC, or else take 4d10 necrotic damage and 6d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half damage on a success. You must complete a long rest before you can use this feature again. Each time you use this feature, you must make a DC 10 Charisma save or your alignment shifts one space down towards Evil for one week (returning to your original alignment at the end of the week). If you attempt to use this ability when you have an Evil alignment, you must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or the ethereal spirits attack you instead: you take 4d10 necrotic damage and 6d6 radiant damage immediately. ##Eldritch Artifact **Untamed Forces.** At level 3, your Artifact seeps into your mind and fractures the divide between you and the ethereal plane. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, roll a d20. On a 1, roll a d100 on the Wild Magic table as a sorcerer would. Additionally, as a reaction, when an enemy or ally casts a spell of 1st-level or higher, you may roll a d100 on the Wild Magic table and choose whether or not to apply that effect to your target. Once you have used this reaction, you must complete a short rest before you can use it again. **Revelation.** At level 7, your artifact's influence permeates across the battlefield, and all you have to do is unlock its effects upon the minds of others to drive them insane. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see or hear within 60 feet. On a hit, they take 2d10 psychic damage and make three attacks against their closest enemy or ally, moving if necessary, and taking no action if they are unable to attack. You must complete a short rest before you can use this feature again. If you miss with the attack, all of its effects (except damage) immediately apply to you instead. **Fabric Crunch.** At level 11, your Artifact is beginning to rip through reality itself around you, making you nearly impossible to hit. Shimmering energy around your body increases your AC by 2. Additionally, as a reaction, when you are hit with a spell that targets only you, you may immediately force a creature within 60 feet that you can see to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or else suffer the effects of the same spell. Whenever you take this reaction, you gain disadvantage to Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom saving throws for 1 minute. **Glimpse Into Madness.** At level 15, an unspeakable creature on a forgotten plane uses your Artifact as a waypoint between its world and yours, and anyone who dares attack you may draw its curiosity. When you are hit with a melee or ranged attack, you may use your reaction to force your attacker to cast Contact Other Plane on themselves. Their intelligence saving throw is against your spell save DC, and they take an additional 4d10 psychic damage regardless of success or failure. If they are able to speak to the entity, they are incapacitated for 1 minute and are effectively senseless as they psychically converse. Each time you use this ability, you gain a point of exhaustion. #Spellcasting You gain the ability to cast spells at level 2 on account of your time spent exploring ancient dungeons and studying their secrets in solitude. **Spellcasting Ability.** Intelligence. Your spellcasting ability comes from study and contemplation. You memorise your spells and rely on a component pouch for the material components of your spells. **Spell Save DC.** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier **Spell Attack Modifier.** your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier **Ritual Caster.** You can cast any explorer spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. #Spells Known 1. 0 2. 2 3. 3 4. 3 5. 4 6. 4 7. 5 8. 5 9. 6 10. 6 11. 7 12. 7 13. 8 14. 8 15. 9 16. 9 17. 10 18. 10 19. 11 20. 11 #Spell Slots 1. -- 2. 1/2 3. 1/3 4. 1/3 5. 1/4 2/2 6. 1/4 2/2 7. 1/4 2/3 8. 1/4 2/3 9. 1/4 2/3 3/2 10. 1/4 2/3 3/2 11. 1/4 2/3 3/3 12. 1/4 2/3 3/3 13. 1/4 2/3 3/3 4/1 14. 1/4 2/3 3/3 4/1 15. 1/4 2/3 3/3 4/2 16. 1/4 2/3 3/3 4/2 17. 1/4 2/3 3/3 4/3 5/1 18. 1/4 2/3 3/3 4/3 5/1 19. 1/4 2/3 3/3 4/3 5/2 20. 1/4 2/3 3/3 4/3 5/2 #Spells ##1st level - Alarm - Catapult - Comprehend Languages - Detect Magic - Detect Poison and Disease - Disguise Self - Expeditious Retreat - Feather Fall - Hunter's Mark - Identify - Jump - Longstrider - Purify Food and Drink ##2nd level - Arcane Lock - Continual Flame - Cordon of Arrows - Darkvision - Enlarge/Reduce - Find Traps - Knock - Locate Object - Pass Without Trace - Protection From Poison - See Invisibility - Spider Climb ##3rd level - Counterspell - Daylight - Dispel Magic - Fly - Glyph of Warding - Nondetection - Protection From Energy - Remove Curse - Sending - Speak With Dead - Water Breathing - Water Walk ##4th level - Fabricate - Freedom of Movement - Grasping Vine - Locate Creature - Stoneskin ##5th level - Dispel Evil and Good - Hallow - Legend Lore - Telekinesis"
182,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Homebrewed Monster: Hypnotoad,7,3p72yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/3p72yi/homebrewed_monster_hypnotoad/,2015-10-18 16:03:39,"Context: I'm currently running a 5e game for a group of 6 8th-level PCs, who are incredibly genre-savvy when it comes to fighting. Since the monsters in the MM no longer pose a challenge to them, I have decided to homebrew every single encounter in the campaign. And since I have gotten so many ideas from Unearthed Arcana subreddit, figured I ought to start giving back. Here's a boss they faced yesterday, the Hypnotoad Large Monstrosity, Chaotic Neutral Hit Point: 250 Speed: 40 ft, swim 60 ft. AC: 16 (natural armor) Saving Throw: Int +5, Wis +4, Cha +6, Strength +9, Dex +3, Con +7 Skills: Perception +13 Damage Immunities: acid, poison ; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from non-magical weapons Damage Vulnerability: force. Condition Immunities: charmed, poisoned, exhaustion. Senses: Dark-vision 240 ft, Passive Perception 23 Languages: Can understand most languages but cannot communicate back Challenge Rating: I have no clue man. Maybe 12? **TRAITS** Leaper: The Hypnotoad doesn't take any Opportunity Attack as part of his movement. Legendary Resistance (3/Day) If Hypnotoad fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead. Slippery Mucus: When the Hypnotoad is bloodied, mucus starts to ooze out of its skin as a Reaction, forming a protective layer that nullifies all damage taken by him until the end of his next turn. Frightful Presence: Each creature of Hypnotoads choice that is within 60 feet of Hypnotoad and aware of him must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creatures saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Hypnotoad's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. **ACTIONS** Hypnotoad can use his frightful presence. He then makes two attacks with his tongue. *Tongue*: Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (4d12+10 ) bludgeoning damage. Any target taking more than 36 damage from the Toad in a single turn is swallowed. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained and it takes 6d10 acid damage at the start of its turn. If the Toad takes more than 40 damage in a single round from the creature(s) inside it, it will spit out the target. *Leap*: As part of his movement, the Hypnotoad jump 40 feet toward a 4x4 area, forcing all creatures within that zone to make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 ft backward, knocked prone and take 29 (6d6+8) damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't proned and is pushed 5 ft backward. This attack does not use up his action. **LEGENDARY ACTIONS** The Hypnotoad has 3 legendary actions, which he can take at the end of a creature's turn. These are refreshed at the start of the Hypnotoad's turn. *Body Slam*: The Hypnotoad makes a Leap attack. *Mindwipe*: The Hypnotoad targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the Hypnotoad until the Hypnotoad dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is under the Hypnotoad's control and can't take reactions, and the Hypnotoad and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance. Whenever the charmed target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw. OPTIONAL: The charmed creature takes 20 damage and the Toad is healed by 40 at the start of the creature's turn. This does not trigger a saving throw. So there we go, a boss meant for highly optimized groups of adventurers. For maximum effectiveness of this boss's chassis, I recommend a small lair or hideout where the party has no choice but to clump together at some point, maximizing the effectiveness of the Leap attack. Have fun, and tell me how your party fare against this guy :D Edit: Formatting"
183,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Shields Up! Borderlands Style Energy Shields!,9,3lgltt,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/3lgltt/shields_up_borderlands_style_energy_shields/,2015-09-19 04:05:28,"&gt;**Energy Shield** &gt;*Wondrous item, rarity varies* &gt;An energy shield projects an intangible, invisible field around the user. An energy shield typically comes with various other effects, from launching spikes at attackers, to absorbing projectiles. As an Action you can activate or deactivate this device. &gt;All energy shields protect the user with a pool of hit points separate from the users. These hit points have vulnerability to shock damage. (This works a bit like the Abjuration Wizards Arcane Ward more or less. Damage that drops the shield carries over the user) Brand of shield determines size of hit dice the shield has, while rarity determines how many it has. The maximum capacity for a shield is the average of the dice (So for a d10 shield, take 6 times the number of dice it has). A shield will recharge one HD per rarity per round after not taking damage for 3 rounds (A common shield recharges one HD, a rare recharges 3). &gt;Number of dice used per rarity: Common: 2; Uncommon: 4; Rare: 6; Very Rare: 8; Legendary: 10 &gt;* Adaptive Shield: This shield uses d8 dice. When you take elemental damage, this shield becomes resistant to that element until another elemental type of damage it taken, after which it switches to that elemental resistance. In the case of lightning damage, this shields resistance and vulnerability cancel out. Once the shields hit points have been depleted, it must fully recharge before this ability can activate again. &gt;* Roid Shield: This shield uses d12 dice. When this shields hit points are dropped to zero, the user is injected with adrenaline. For a number of rounds equal to the number determined by rarity, all melee attacks add the shields dice to the weapons damage. Once the shields hit points have been depleted, it must fully recharge before this ability can activate again. &gt;* Elemental Spike Shield: This shield uses d6 dice.

This item is essentially a poor mans Arcane Ward, or Arcane Ward made commercially available. How Arcane Ward would interact with this feature can be up to the DM using this item. Also, as is a Rare quality d12 shield will have 42 hit points, 3 less than the Arcane Ward. Yes, this item takes away from the niche of that class. As you might have guessed, I'm using Borderlands 2 style stuff here. I didn't want these shields to be granting AC because that isn't how they work in the game- they are meant to be an extra layer for if you *do* get hit. Enjoy. edit: errata: Essentially what I mean by ""how many dice it uses"" I mean for special effects and hit points. Take the Roid shield for example. A common roid shield will add 2d12 damage for 2 rounds once those 14 hit points are lost. edit II: forgot to mention how to activate the dang thing. Added it in, but basically an action to activate or deactivate. "

185,vulnerability,UnearthedArcana,Bloodborne - Ludwig's Holy Sword (5E),18,3apqbx,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/3apqbx/bloodborne_ludwigs_holy_sword_5e/,2015-06-23 00:34:37,"Looking for feedback here: **Ludwig's Holy Blade** - Weapon (Sword), Rare *This light blade is a common, mundane longsword, but comes with a matched sheathe made of blessed heavy metal, which is itself a blade. When the wielder uses a bonus action to sheathe the longsword and attach it to the blade, it is transformed into a 2d6, heavy, two-handed greatsword. The greatsword is blessed by the Healing Church to be baned against those suffering curses, such as lycanthropes; any target with the Shapechanger property has vulnerability to this weapon when it is in its greatsword form. This weapon is considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. It is a bonus action to unsheathe the sword and return it to its default form.* For those not familiar with the weapon from Bloodborne: URL Basically, Bloodborne features a weapon type called ""Trick Weapons"" which can change modes - some drain health to do more damage, some require two hands and hit slower, et cetera. Ludwig's Holy Blade is one such weapon, which can switch between a ""light"" one-handed sword and a heavy two-handed version."
