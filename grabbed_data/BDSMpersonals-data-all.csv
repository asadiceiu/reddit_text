Not much of a re-poster, but thought I'd give it another try. \*\*\*\*\* I think two partners reading to each other, on the couch, under a blanket, in the park, in bed, close to each other feeling the other one drift into sleep is one of the most intimate and erotic things between two people. I start with this image because I am convinced that a functioning bdsm relationship requires the same as any other relationship in which both partners desire closeness and intimacy: language, communication, listening, and entrusting yourself to the other. Kink lists do nothing for me. These days, I am not sure if it makes sense to ever hope for a genuine partnership again; but I do know I would want and need it to involve an emotional and intellectual connection. Of course, the physical too; but it's meaningless without said connection. And connections are not magically found; they are developed, and require patience, honesty, care, and the willingness to be vulnerable. Vulnerability requires taking a risk; if you might be willing to take one with me, please reach out. Me: tall wm, 6'4"", in writing/teaching, passionate about reading, literature, art, and film. Honest, nurturing and giving. Single father. Just to be upfront. You: over 30. Local, in the DMV area, possibly PA. I am sorry, but I can't do online only; looking for something IRL, in the long run."
1,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,27 [M4F] Looking for a truly submissive woman to become my secretary,1,i24p11,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/i24p11/27_m4f_looking_for_a_truly_submissive_woman_to/,2020-08-02 12:32:09,"Hopefully if you're reading this, you're already a fan of *Secretary* from 2002 with Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader. To be specific, this is how I prefer to characterize my dynamic between myself and a submissive partner - Employer/Boss and secretary who is owned by the one she works for. I also prefer to couch the terms of this dynamic within the context of Ownership &amp; Possession (O&amp;P), as I prefer them over *slavery* and *enslavement*, and I do not typically use the words ""submissive"" or ""Dominant"" as nouns as some choose to do. Here are some definitions of ownership and possession from the O&amp;P manifesto (which is no longer available online unfortunately); &gt;1. What is Possession? &gt;Central to O&amp;P is the concept of Possession: having control and use for one's own purposes of that which is possessed, involving some or all of the rights associated with property ownership. This is asymmetric and unequal in status. While the submissive is in the dominant's possession they are fundamentally there for the dominant, obeying the dominant, and subject to the dominant's decisions. The dominant is the submissive's superior, just as an employer is their servant's superior. The unambiguous, honest, and hierarchical nature of O&amp;P provides clarity about what is to be done, and who is to do it, without the manipulation and unstated quid pro quo of so many relationships. &gt;2. What is Ownership? &gt;Possession may be limited in time or scope, but Ownership is the enduring and veto-less form of possession, in which possession has been maintained long enough and deep enough that it has become ingrained, resulting in the enslavement of the submissive, as a slave. Since this is a gradual, overlapping process, it is usually easier to talk of Ownership &amp; Possession together as O&amp;P. So at first, I am seeking possession of a submissive woman in order to grow both a bond with her and to grow her inner obedient spirit along the way. Eventually, I seek the ownership of that woman. In addition to that, I also happen to desire a woman who subscribes to the [ethos of complete female submission.](URL The etymology of the word is an apt one for this dynamic I believe. It does not just mean a simple clerk or a notary, but more succinctly denotes a ""person entrusted with secrets"". A *confidant*. Hence *secret*ary. This has two meanings in the context of a relationship like this, at least to me, in that not only would this woman be entrusted with my secrets, but she would *be* my secret possession - her own nature and dignity as a submissive woman, her secrets and her well being kept hidden and safe by me. And in order to so, I would necessarily have to be entrusted with her, and everything she is as a woman. Thus the ownership aspect, and yet in my eyes it is *a truly mutual and reciprocal relationship like no other*. In addition to that, I feel it is the proper kind of relationship for a man and woman inducted into a total exchange of power between each other. The position calls for a well-behaved, respectful, obedient and diligent woman to fulfill certain secretarial duties and who both needs companionship and seeks to provide it. If you feel you are lacking in a few or all of these areas, do not be discouraged from applying. All lapses in judgement and inability to fulfill your secretarial duties will be met with the swift and firm application of the appropriate disciplinary procedures, typically involving the use of a hard wooden paddle and the inducing of tears. All punishments are intended to induce *transformational discipline*, that is, discipline intended to transform a lapsed ill-behaved secretary into an elegant secretary cleansed of her transgressions. Desired attributes of a prospective secretarial candidate: * Intellectual/sapiosexual * Warm, elegant personality (for charming acquaintances and associates and representing Us in the best possible light) * Dresses femininely (pencil skirts, short dresses, heels, hosiery, the works, etc. - these can be provided as necessary) * In need of companionship and a deep connection with someone who is her Owner * In need of a more blissful domestic life filled with sensuality, passion, grace, elegance, caring and all the finer things in life for a smart, well-bred woman - all reinforced with a structured amount of discipline and punishment of course * Desires self-improvement and mutual understanding with someone she earnestly respects * Hungers for a lifestyle out of the norm from contemporary society, and arguably more enriching and fulfilling than others * Enjoys and celebrates the symbiosis between Male Authority and feminine deference * Enjoys the feeling of restraints binding her wrists, delightful warmth and exquisite pain being applied to her bare bottom, her orgasms denied (or forced again and again alternatively), and a Man's lips wrapped around hers * Becomes wet from uttering the word ""Sir"" * Heart melts when uttering the word ""Sir"" (alternatively) If this sounds like you, do not hesitate to apply. Let's schedule two separate interviews if that is indeed the case, shall we? One between you and I over dinner, and another between your bare bottom and my paddle over my desk... Now that we have the formalities out of the way, let me introduce who I am more thoroughly. I am someone who has long possessed a different kind of taste in the type of women I like to sink my teeth into. I've been in the military since I left home, pursuing higher education and training for a particular career at the moment, and in need of a submissive woman who I can bring along for the amazing future I have mapped out ahead for me and for the world. To put it more roughly and less precise than that long ad you just read, I am in need of a 1950/1960s-style TPE relationship. I want to exude masculinity and fiery romantic dominance with you, and I want you to exude femininity and beautifully sweet deference/acquiescence in kind. I want to mend you if you're hurt, mold you like clay into the kind of woman you've always longed to be (if needed), and improve my own life by sharing it with another soul (and protecting it in times of vulnerability). I am 5""11, average build, black hair, dark eyes, white, and I am told I have an equally soothing and yet enrapturing voice capable of activating a woman's most erogenous zone. In addition to that my hands and the fingers upon them are quite dexterous and skilled in a number of hobbies. I am seeking a LDR at first and commitment/living together under one roof eventually if we're certain about the path we want to take. I look forward to conversing with you. Your photo gets mine. Stay safe during this crisis. -Nite"

Then you slap your chest until it's red and hope you've punished yourself enough to satisfy me. You go back to sleep anxious. The next day, you have to go to work. You don't wear panties, since you were told not to. You get a message during your shift and have to go to the bathroom to play with yourself. You're little more than a toy to be played with. You're often on the verge of tears, and this day is just too much. You sob and scream internally. The next message tells you to lick the toilet bowl. You protest, hoping to have mercy, but instead you're told not to be a boring, prudish cunt and to do as you're told or go back to your boring, meaningless life. You realize that your feelings don't matter to anyone. They haven't mattered in a long time. You still hope that your mind will be enough to win someone over. You constantly wonder if all the questions you're being asked about your personal life are an effort to collect more blackmail, a cruel joke, or genuine interest.

That kind of gratification and control and vulnerability that can only be shared by the kinky among us. I'm based near London, in Kent. I drive. I am a business owner. I'm a firm but fair Master with a lot of experience under my belt. I love to make things. I love to better myself and my property too. Trainer. Sadist. Cuddler. Owner. I don't have a type, but I dislike too much bratting, I prefer a good girl. Kinks are many and varied, limits few. I yearn for the other half of my dynamic, and I hope to meet someone for a lasting relationship. I love to teach, experience not necessary. I love eagerness to please.

Searching for an ethical non-monogamous, feminist , sex positive, gross, masochistic pain slut, who has a twisted mind on par with mine. The deeper,the darker your fantasies, the more I want to meet you. Brat at me and I'll brat right back. It's a battle of resolve and I love to win. About me: 35[M4F]6'3""(Cis gendered, Het) Top/Daddy/Sadistic geek who works in the trucking industry. Im a bear of a man and some say i look a little like Post Malone without the face Tattoos. Friends call me Weezer, lovers say I'm a teddy bear with sharp teeth &amp; scary paws. I can show you I'm tall, dark, and handsome, but interesting? I have to leave some mystery. That's the fun part about meeting new humans. Generally I'm sweet, patient, loving, kind, goofy, silly, empathic, emotionally intelligent and I will love on you in public but I'll want to put my cigarette out on your arm and have you thank me for it. Vulnerability, emotional intelligence, trust, and safety are very important to me. I'm not looking for a quick scene on a friday night or to jump into a relationship head first. Lets see how deep the well is before we jump in or we'll both just end up splitting our heads open. Let's chat and get to know each other so I can pour myself into you and drink you up from within. I require Negotiations and demand aftercare if we do end up playing. I have my shit together in my non- monogamy [egalitarian non-hierarchical polyamory] and kink life [Risk aware consensual kink], [not interested in TPE, M/s] , [D/s is okay but im not too serious], [Ageplay is where I flourish most]. We all have our baggage and I will not unpack it for you, but that doesn't mean I won't help. I won't leave you dangling on the wash line like grandma's wet panties if times get rough. But I need to know if you can see how the panties got up there, and how to get them down before the wind blows them away. Kinks: (likes) ADBL DD/lg (messy babies go to the front of the line!) Diaperd girls Scat/messing (eaters) inexperienced and very interested in playing with one Watersports and wetting BDSM (rough body play) (edge play) CNC (intoxication fetish)(black mail) Humiliation (body and intelligence shaming; even if it isn't true I'll make it feel like it is) Degradation (face spitting) (boot worship)(cock worship) Pretty much anything taboo. Kink: (dislikes) Rope Bottoming M/s TPE Rope Petplay Rope(I'm uneducated swine with no time for pretty knots) Ultimately this is mutually beneficial exploration and experience. I'm not into taking what isn't freely given. Let me tear you down so we can build each other up. I try live by example and I take responsibility and accountability for my actions. I am human, certainly not perfect. I try to be the person I would want to meet at kink events. A fun night would probably involve plastic sheeting, I'll let your imagination run with that. Don't worry I'm not an ax murderer, but I can play one in the bedroom. My sense of humor comes out in person better than written. Have you ever stayed awake at night thinking about the futility of life and how little and meaningless our existence is in the grand scheme of things? Hahahaha me either....... Do you need to be put in your place? Fortune favors the bold, and a purpose is just a message away. TLDR: If you're scared of a wall of text in a personal ad, you're not the right person. Let's text on a messaging app of your choice and I'll provide a horribly lit bathroom selfie from 5 years ago."

6,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"28[M4F] The most meaningful part of being a Dominant is using the power she gives you to lift her up. I'm looking to create a 24/7 dynamic focused on mentorship and self-improvement. I'm going to guide and push you toward your best, in both service and life. (open to long distance in US and Canada)",1,i5o68b,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/i5o68b/28m4f_the_most_meaningful_part_of_being_a/,2020-08-08 09:02:32,"**Introduction** I am an experienced Dominant and a passionate kinkster, and I firmly believe that this lifestyle is more than just something that takes place when the lights are turned off, but an enormously positive and beneficial lifestyle centered around self-improvement, connection and service. I strongly believe that the highest function of D/s is as a tool to build someone up. To give them the support, companionship, motivation, structure and accountability necessary to manifest positive change in their life. There is great meaning and joy in introducing someone new to this lifestyle. In showing that it is right to give yourself and that within that surrender, you have worth beyond measure. **What brings me here:** I'm a 28 year old professional blessed with a stable but modest income earned by doing meaningful work that makes a difference in my community. I have been further blessed in the creation of healthy relationships with friends and family, and a steady motivation to further improve myself and work on new goals. I've found a place of peace and contentment that I want to share with someone who needs it. Those who have been under me describe me as a caretaker, some have even asked if I'm a therapist (I'm not). My role could also be compared to a life coach. But, I'm not here because I'm better than you or more accomplished than you or even have this life better figured out. I'm here because I've failed, because I've taken hard falls and have made many wrong turns. In the most perilous moments, with the help from others, I've discovered tools within myself that have led to real change. The most important of which is an acceptance of myself and a belief in my strength and capability to overcome any obstacle and grow from my failures. **This is the truth that will lie at the core of our dynamic:** You are intelligent. You are creative. You are capable. You are strong. You have the power to create what you want in life. You are of great worth and you deserve meaning and happiness. I don't need you to feel those things right now - a large part of your training will be about accepting those truths and introducing them to your life - but I need you to be open to them. This dynamic is about taking action in your life that serves you. To re-orient your life where the decisions you make allow you to feel healthier, to have well-being, to grow, improve and accomplish your goals. **What we will create:** * Well work on changing your thoughts, the stories you tell yourself, the narratives that are keeping you trapped. * Well identify your goals, short-term and long-term, identify what is important to you, and develop a plan to get you there. * Well change your routine. Create a disciplined regimented environment for you to thrive in.Well transform your lifestyle to one that is healthy, a nutritious diet, and regular exercise schedule, daily meditations. * In all of this, you will find that you are no longer alone. Youll have an owner. An owner to make proud. An owner to represent. An owner who will encourage you and always push you forward. An owner who will hold you accountable with whatever severity is necessary. * Most importantly, above anything else, you are going to feel pride within yourself. **What you will invest:** This is not free. You will pay me daily with your body, your mind and your service. With your obedience and your submission. You will be entirely stripped and exposed, physically and mentally, and within that environment of true vulnerability and commitment, we will create the catalyst you need to start creating the life that you deserve. **A final word** Let me take this moment to stress that the most important element in this is not me, it is you. This depends on the kind of commitment, energy and openness you create in yourself. If you come to me out of simple curiosity or because this sounds interesting and it'll help pass the days, you're probably not going to get a lot out of this. But if you come to me with a determination and a fire - no matter how small - that you are ready to build a new life for yourself, a new way of being - then the day you message me will be the beginning of a journey we will eventually look back on with gratitude. I'm here at the start, waiting for you to join me."

All punishments are intended to induce *transformational discipline*, that is, discipline intended to transform a lapsed ill-behaved secretary into an elegant secretary cleansed of her transgressions. Desired attributes of a prospective secretarial candidate: * Intellectual/sapiosexual * Warm, elegant personality (for charming acquaintances and associates and representing Us in the best possible light) * Dresses femininely (pencil skirts, short dresses, heels, hosiery, the works, etc. - these can be provided as necessary) * In need of companionship and a deep connection with someone who is her Owner * In need of a more blissful domestic life filled with sensuality, passion, grace, elegance, caring and all the finer things in life for a smart, well-bred woman - all reinforced with a structured amount of discipline and punishment of course * Desires self-improvement and mutual understanding with someone she earnestly respects * Hungers for a lifestyle out of the norm from contemporary society, and arguably more enriching and fulfilling than others * Enjoys and celebrates the symbiosis between Male Authority and feminine deference * Enjoys the feeling of restraints binding her wrists, delightful warmth and exquisite pain being applied to her bare bottom, her orgasms denied (or forced again and again alternatively), and a Man's lips wrapped around hers * Becomes wet from uttering the word ""Sir"" * Heart melts when uttering the word ""Sir"" (alternatively) If this sounds like you, do not hesitate to apply. Let's schedule two separate interviews if that is indeed the case, shall we? One between you and I over dinner, and another between your bare bottom and my paddle over my desk... Now that we have the formalities out of the way, let me introduce who I am more thoroughly. I am someone who has long possessed a different kind of taste in the type of women I like to sink my teeth into. I've been in the military since I left home, pursuing higher education and training for a particular career at the moment, and in need of a submissive woman who I can bring along for the amazing future I have mapped out ahead for me and for the world. To put it more roughly and less precise than that long ad you just read, I am in need of a 1950/1960s-style TPE relationship. I want to exude masculinity and fiery romantic dominance with you, and I want you to exude femininity and beautifully sweet deference/acquiescence in kind. I want to mend you if you're hurt, mold you like clay into the kind of woman you've always longed to be (if needed), and improve my own life by sharing it with another soul (and protecting it in times of vulnerability). I am 5""11, average build, black hair, dark eyes, white, and I am told I have an equally soothing and yet enrapturing voice capable of activating a woman's most erogenous zone. In addition to that my hands and the fingers upon them are quite dexterous and skilled in a number of hobbies. I am seeking a LDR at first and commitment/living together under one roof eventually if we're certain about the path we want to take. I look forward to conversing with you. Your photo gets mine. Stay safe during this crisis. -Nite"

Arent you in for a treat;),1,iasy0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/iasy0m/f4m_29_ky_sub_for_dom_onlineirl_potential_arent/,2020-08-17 00:09:48,"Online or IRL Hi there! I hope this post finds you well! A little bit about me: I am 29 years old, educated, good job, wonderful friends/family. Most people would say that Im bubbly, always laughing and down to earth. Ive had a lot of people say Im really attractive, but I dont know it. Which I feel like is a good thing. Physically I am 57, long blonde hair, green eyes and average/little extra..Id be happy to send pics upon request. What Im looking for: First off I think that initial attraction is important. However, its not everything. A lot of my attraction to someone comes from their personality. Humor is a big thing for me, bc I love laughing. Also, life is too short to be serious all the time.  As far as why I am here...I find myself searching for something more than what a vanilla relationship can offer. Ive been involved in D/s for about 3.5 years and recently took some time off from it (we can talk about why, if youre curious). This lifestyle is always something I crave and come back to. I have my own opinion about what a D/s dynamic should be, as we all do. So if its not what youre looking for or if you dont agree thats okay...we all have different views on how this should play out. I believe that kink and D/s are different. A lot of people post about wanting the kink part, right off the bat (to each their own). Dont get me wrong, the kink part is awesome....when you trust and have an emotional connection with that individual. I have no desire to play with a complete stranger. I dont want to see your dick before knowing your mind. After all, knowing your mind will help me in the dick area. Haha ;P Seriously though, I crave someone that knows me, better than I know myself. Someone who searches the deepest parts of me that no one else has every came close to. Someone who knows my needs, wants, desires, ambitions, fears, etc. and uses all of those to better own me. Possess me. And I will do the same in return. Bc a Dom and his submissive should know each other best. To truly submit to someone is a different level of vulnerability. Which Im sure is the same for a Dom, in other ways. I will happily kneel to someone, once I feel they are worthy and I can trust them. Power exchange at its best  I also think that learning about someone first and getting to know them as a person...letting everything develop organically creates the best sort of attraction and in turn, helps develop the best kink aspects of the dynamic. My kinks: Micromanagement, breath play, impact play, sensory deprivation, communication (yes, thats right...its hard to find these days), primal, light pain, orgasm control/denial. Honestly my kinks depend a lot on my partner...I am definitely a pleaser. And what makes my partner happy, makes me happy. Limits: Blood, scat, piss, permanent markings, age play. I hope this at least sparked an interest for you to want to know more. If not! Happy searching!! :)"

Hi there! Im seeking a female sub/baby girl for an IRL relationship. I've been in the lifestyle for over 15 years now and I've been on both sides of the leash so-to-speak. Having been a submissive myself, I completely understand, value, respect and appreciate the role of a submissive and what a submissive does for the person they are serving. Its a vulnerable position and it should never be abused by anyone. I've seen the good and the bad that comes with the lifestyle and I would NEVER ask anyone to do something that I wasn't comfortable with. If you seek guidance, structure, release, etc I can certainly provide that. I can be firm, demanding, tough, strict and unwavering. However, I can also be a best friend, sweet, kind, loving, compassionate and your biggest cheerleader as well. At my core, I adore Women like crazy. I will always fight for Womens rights and equality for Women. I do believe in girl power. Ive never been of the impression that if a Woman is a sub she is weak..in fact its quite the opposite. Shes usually an alpha in her every day life. I love and respect this. The most important things for me are respect, consent, and the safety of my submissive. I absolutely want the person I am with to feel valued and loved in every way and know that at the end of the day they are my number one priority always. I find tremendous joy in helping someone grow into and feel comfortable in their role as a submissive. I love being that safe place for them to let it out while never feeling judged, ashamed, criticized or bashful for embracing what they love. It's a journey for both people and that's all part of the fun and enjoyment. Im not here to tear someone down or apart, Im here to build them up, empower them, give them what they need, take them to sub space and offer love, affection, support and validation after. I want someone to know how extremely important they are to me and that I would NEVER take advantage of their vulnerability. Im a natural nurturer. Respect for my partner is paramount and all boundaries and limits are adhered too, ALWAYS. There is ZERO excuse for abuse in this lifestyle, ZERO. I'm super friendly and outgoing and most of all, approachable. I'm not some asshat that expects you to call them ""Sir"" after one message..let's be real. Chemistry is the key to all of this and if you can't talk openly and freely, you'll never learn about one another. I want someone that can open up to me, go for walks, go shopping, get a pizza, make dinner together and talk like normal people. Thats the fun of all this...we both have a fun kinky side we love to embrace. I welcome subs, slaves, brats, littles and everyone in between. Experience levels arent important, passion is what counts. Im not a sugar daddy and Im not interested in buying your content I seek genuine connections. In my vanilla life I am successful, cultured, educated, and enjoy a multitude of interests. Everything from cooking to the arts appeals to me. I'm also slightly addicted to coffee so I'm always down for a coffee date. Thanks for reading. I look forward to hearing from you! Feel free to DM."
17,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"28[M4F] The most meaningful part of being a Dominant is using the power she gives you to lift her up. I'm looking to create a 24/7 dynamic focused on mentorship and self-improvement. I'm going to guide and push you toward your best, in both service and life. (open to long distance in US and Canada)",1,ib1yhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/ib1yhf/28m4f_the_most_meaningful_part_of_being_a/,2020-08-17 08:32:10,"**Introduction** I am an experienced Dominant and a passionate kinkster, and I firmly believe that this lifestyle is more than just something that takes place when the lights are turned off, but an enormously positive and beneficial lifestyle centered around self-improvement, connection and service. I strongly believe that the highest function of D/s is as a tool to build someone up. To give them the support, companionship, motivation, structure and accountability necessary to manifest positive change in their life. There is great meaning and joy in introducing someone new to this lifestyle. In showing that it is right to give yourself and that within that surrender, you have worth beyond measure. **What brings me here:** I'm a 28 year old professional blessed with a stable but modest income earned by doing meaningful work that makes a difference in my community. I have been further blessed in the creation of healthy relationships with friends and family, and a steady motivation to further improve myself and work on new goals. I've found a place of peace and contentment that I want to share with someone who needs it. Those who have been under me describe me as a caretaker, some have even asked if I'm a therapist (I'm not). My role could also be compared to a life coach. But, I'm not here because I'm better than you or more accomplished than you or even have this life better figured out. I'm here because I've failed, because I've taken hard falls and have made many wrong turns. In the most perilous moments, with the help from others, I've discovered tools within myself that have led to real change. The most important of which is an acceptance of myself and a belief in my strength and capability to overcome any obstacle and grow from my failures. **This is the truth that will lie at the core of our dynamic:** You are intelligent. You are creative. You are capable. You are strong. You have the power to create what you want in life. You are of great worth and you deserve meaning and happiness. I don't need you to feel those things right now - a large part of your training will be about accepting those truths and introducing them to your life - but I need you to be open to them. This dynamic is about taking action in your life that serves you. To re-orient your life where the decisions you make allow you to feel healthier, to have well-being, to grow, improve and accomplish your goals. **What we will create:** * Well work on changing your thoughts, the stories you tell yourself, the narratives that are keeping you trapped. * Well identify your goals, short-term and long-term, identify what is important to you, and develop a plan to get you there. * Well change your routine. Create a disciplined regimented environment for you to thrive in.Well transform your lifestyle to one that is healthy, a nutritious diet, and regular exercise schedule, daily meditations. * In all of this, you will find that you are no longer alone. Youll have an owner. An owner to make proud. An owner to represent. An owner who will encourage you and always push you forward. An owner who will hold you accountable with whatever severity is necessary. * Most importantly, above anything else, you are going to feel pride within yourself. **What you will invest:** This is not free. You will pay me daily with your body, your mind and your service. With your obedience and your submission. You will be entirely stripped and exposed, physically and mentally, and within that environment of true vulnerability and commitment, we will create the catalyst you need to start creating the life that you deserve. **A final word** Let me take this moment to stress that the most important element in this is not me, it is you. This depends on the kind of commitment, energy and openness you create in yourself. If you come to me out of simple curiosity or because this sounds interesting and it'll help pass the days, you're probably not going to get a lot out of this. But if you come to me with a determination and a fire - no matter how small - that you are ready to build a new life for yourself, a new way of being - then the day you message me will be the beginning of a journey we will eventually look back on with gratitude. I'm here at the start, waiting for you to join me."

It's a big ask, but all I can promise is that no one will care for you or be there for you more, day after day after day. (Online at the start works entirely fine for me.)",1,ie5uvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/ie5uvm/27m4f_i_have_a_funny_need_that_someone_gives/,2020-08-22 07:35:13,"I am seeking a young lady to have as my own, to guide, train, care for and enjoy. So I imagine your first question would be ""who the hell is this guy?"" An excellent question. I have been in the scene for almost five years now and have learned a great deal in that time. I must admit I am quite the nerd when it comes to BDSM, I love to learn about new kinks, new fetishes and how people tick so I hoover up as much information as I can and love to do so. This does mean I am prone to long rants about random subjects as well, because I'm a nerd in a lot of other things too, so fair warning and good luck. If you don't give your full attention, I'll probably slap you - or leave an angry emoji on your screen - basically the same thing - so you all have that as a disadvantage. As a Dominant I primarily derive my pleasure from pure control and the effect it has upon those under me. **Let me start with why you're going to be so important to me** Submission should be a place of pride. Submission is vulnerability, and as anyone who knows anything about life will tell you, vulnerability takes a great deal of strength. Submission is an expression of that strength. It's a strength I myself don't have much of, but I need someone else to have it in my life, and as a Dominant, I am tasked with honoring the strength you show by placing yourself at my feet. And why do you show that strength? So that you may serve. So that you may express your care and affection and goodwill toward someone else. So that you may make his day a little easier, a little more enjoyable. So that you can find joy in being selfless. There's truly not a more compassionate, generous or loving thing that you can do for someone else. And what I find in the best submissives is that this generosity of heart doesn't stop at just their Dominant. They extend that respect and goodwill and that joy of service, in small ways, to every one in their life. It's an example I hold close to me because it pushes me to be a better man. **What you can expect from me:** **Honesty:** Just like I expect it from you , you can expect it from me, I will be honest and open with you about my thoughts and feelings so you can trust that I will not hold back from you. **Care for your well-being:** Part of my outlook is an emphasis upon the symbiosis of dynamics. It's not simply a one way street where you do everything I want and get nothing back , by accepting your gift of submission I also accept the responsibility that comes with it. Your well-being both physically and mentally will become my charge and I will ensure to the best of my abilities that you not only have that support but feel it too. To have a Master is to have a mentor. I will leave you a better, happier person. That is a promise. **A weird, mostly likable, eccentric person:** Sure I love the rituals and structure and the beauty of creating a dynamic but I'm not always some dusty aloof Dom. Sometimes I'm a young and hip aloof Dom. I enjoy fun and breasts, I will want to chat to you as a friend, with the understanding of your position thrown in, so I will create an environment where you can talk to me openly and safely while feeling submissive and owned the whole time, and you can rest assured that we're going to have some fun. **What will your expectations be?** **Honesty:** Honesty is crucial with me. If I cannot trust that you will be open with me about how you feel or about aspects of your life then I cannot trust you to be safe with any tasks or play we might do, so it is the most important thing you can do for me to live up to this expectation fully. **Enthusiasm:** Sounds silly, I know, but from experience I have found this surprisingly lacking in a lot of folks. Just because you are mine does not mean you can just kick back and only do exactly as instructed. If I wanted a robot I'd attach Alexa to a Furbie (Already a thing in Japan?) I want you to truly want to learn, to please, to expand your knowledge and skills and to have the same passion for kink as I do. **Intelligence:** Im not expecting you to be the second coming of Einstein or for you to develop cold fusion while suspended upside down with nipple clamps on but I do want you to think about how you perform tasks and rituals. Im only human (mostly) and so I will make mistakes , instead of following blindly I want to know you will adjust as needed or tell me to hold up. That is a great comfort to me. **An understanding of place:** A hard one to quantify. I strongly believe in the symbiosis of the M/s and D/s dynamics and my duties in relation to that. I will be a mentor and a friend, but I am not here to just be a service top. I won't bend to random moods or whims and again while I am very understanding when it comes to feelings, mental illness and life getting in the way, there should always be the understanding that you are mine not the other way around and so I always want to see a true effort every day to put me first. **Reasonable contact and expectations of contact:** We all have normal lives to live sadly, and as such we can't be sat around all day enjoying our debauchery (Damn you, employees of Kink.com). I fully accept that communication will not be a perfectly clockwork affair but I do expect to hear from you throughout every day when you are able, likewise you can expect the same from myself. There is no such thing here as chatting too much and we should demand presence from one another. A distant relationship is not worth having. **For you to be submissive:** I may be going over covered ground here but to be absolutely clear, a submissive submits, in this case you will submit to me. This doesnt mean manipulation, obfuscation, omission or outright defiance. I'm not saying there will be no banter, in fact I quite enjoy it every now and then, a big yes for banter, but at the end of the day your signing up to be controlled by me so if you intend on trying to manipulate me in any fashion to get what you want then you're not for me. **A small clarification:** I find it a popular penchant to infer that as a Dominant I seek to make you entirely dependent on me. That's not what a loving partner would do, and I'm aiming to be one of those. I want to be clear that my goal is not to make you dependent but to use your submission to me as a way to empower you and make you more capable. You will be at my feet and your power will be mine when serving me, but outside of that, I am here to make you more independent and more confident. **Here is a very brief list of some of my likes:** *Orgasm control* - Training to hold off orgasm or to cum on command. I feel this is pretty popular. I'm going to hear you moan a lot. *Predicament/Desperation play* - You know that game where someone has to read a chapter of a book while being edged over and over again? Yeah, I wouldn't do that. *Pain/Pleasure* - While I wouldn't refer to myself as a pure sadist, I do enjoy pain when it invokes pleasure or teaches a lesson. Okay, I do enjoy pain just for pain as well. But, I'm only like a 75 percent sadist - at most. It isn't all I do. I'm only cruel like 10 percent of the time - at most! What's the definition of pure sadist again? *Rituals/life control* - A big part of being mine will be conforming to a structure I lay down. This will involve rituals (not a cloaked blood sacrifice) and certain subtle life changes that will give you a consistent feeling of being under control. **Hard limits** So, yes I know my likes are very vague but at least this part is certain: Permanent Damage, social suicide, scat, blood play, public. The rule of thumb is I follow both S.S.C and R.A.C.K, I want this to be enjoyable and not damage either of us. **FAQ:** *I have a limit of pictures/videos is that ok?* While I fully respect, understand and support not wanting to go gynecological in the first 5 minutes, full surrender means full surrender, and I will take nothing else than your entire physical and mental self. This means that photos and videos will be expected upon your submission. This does not mean we're going to re-enact a strip search after an hour of talking. *""Do you accept male subs?""* I am afraid not. Good luck to you. Keep up the good fight. *Do you accept larger girls?* Attitude is the most sexy thing you can possibly have, so if you have that, quit worrying and message me. If we're not physically compatible, I will be upfront and respectful within that conversation, but that is a silly reason to skip out on this if it appeals to you. You deserve to give yourself a chance and I want to give one to you. *I have a busy work/life schedule is that ok?* Like I've said we all have lives. I will work with you to uphold and maintain your highest priorities.

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

I've found a place of peace and contentment that I want to share with someone who needs it. Those who have been under me describe me as a caretaker, some have even asked if I'm a therapist (I'm not). My role could also be compared to a life coach. But, I'm not here because I'm better than you or more accomplished than you or even have this life better figured out. I'm here because I've failed, because I've taken hard falls and have made many wrong turns.

Create a disciplined regimented environment for you to thrive in.Well transform your lifestyle to one that is healthy, a nutritious diet, and regular exercise schedule, daily meditations. * In all of this, you will find that you are no longer alone.

This depends on the kind of commitment, energy and openness you create in yourself. If you come to me out of simple curiosity or because this sounds interesting and it'll help pass the days, you're probably not going to get a lot out of this.

23,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,27 [M4F] ISO 1950s/60s style boss-secretary relationship,1,ig13c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/ig13c3/27_m4f_iso_1950s60s_style_bosssecretary/,2020-08-25 10:01:50,"Hopefully if you're reading this, you're already a fan of *Secretary* from 2002 with Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader. To be specific, this is how I prefer to characterize my dynamic between myself and a submissive partner - Employer/Boss and secretary who is owned by the one she works for. I also prefer to couch the terms of this dynamic within the context of Ownership &amp; Possession (O&amp;P), as I prefer them over *slavery* and *enslavement*, and I do not typically use the words ""submissive"" or ""Dominant"" as nouns as some choose to do. Here are some definitions of ownership and possession from the O&amp;P manifesto (which is no longer available online unfortunately); &gt;1. What is Possession? &gt;Central to O&amp;P is the concept of Possession: having control and use for one's own purposes of that which is possessed, involving some or all of the rights associated with property ownership. This is asymmetric and unequal in status. While the submissive is in the dominant's possession they are fundamentally there for the dominant, obeying the dominant, and subject to the dominant's decisions. The dominant is the submissive's superior, just as an employer is their servant's superior. The unambiguous, honest, and hierarchical nature of O&amp;P provides clarity about what is to be done, and who is to do it, without the manipulation and unstated quid pro quo of so many relationships. &gt;2. What is Ownership? &gt;Possession may be limited in time or scope, but Ownership is the enduring and veto-less form of possession, in which possession has been maintained long enough and deep enough that it has become ingrained, resulting in the enslavement of the submissive, as a slave. Since this is a gradual, overlapping process, it is usually easier to talk of Ownership &amp; Possession together as O&amp;P. So at first, I am seeking possession of a submissive woman in order to grow both a bond with her and to grow her inner obedient spirit along the way. Eventually, I seek the ownership of that woman. In addition to that, I also happen to desire a woman who subscribes to the [ethos of complete female submission.](URL The etymology of the word is an apt one for this dynamic I believe. It does not just mean a simple clerk or a notary, but more succinctly denotes a ""person entrusted with secrets"". A *confidant*. Hence *secret*ary. This has two meanings in the context of a relationship like this, at least to me, in that not only would this woman be entrusted with my secrets, but she would *be* my secret possession - her own nature and dignity as a submissive woman, her secrets and her well being kept hidden and safe by me. And in order to so, I would necessarily have to be entrusted with her, and everything she is as a woman. Thus the ownership aspect, and yet in my eyes it is *a truly mutual and reciprocal relationship like no other*. In addition to that, I feel it is the proper kind of relationship for a man and woman inducted into a total exchange of power between each other. The position calls for a well-behaved, respectful, obedient and diligent woman to fulfill certain secretarial duties and who both needs companionship and seeks to provide it. If you feel you are lacking in a few or all of these areas, do not be discouraged from applying. All lapses in judgement and inability to fulfill your secretarial duties will be met with the swift and firm application of the appropriate disciplinary procedures, typically involving the use of a hard wooden paddle and the inducing of tears. All punishments are intended to induce *transformational discipline*, that is, discipline intended to transform a lapsed ill-behaved secretary into an elegant secretary cleansed of her transgressions. Desired attributes of a prospective secretarial candidate: * Intellectual/sapiosexual * Warm, elegant personality (for charming acquaintances and associates and representing Us in the best possible light) * Dresses femininely (pencil skirts, short dresses, heels, hosiery, the works, etc. - these can be provided as necessary) * In need of companionship and a deep connection with someone who is her Owner * In need of a more blissful domestic life filled with sensuality, passion, grace, elegance, caring and all the finer things in life for a smart, well-bred woman - all reinforced with a structured amount of discipline and punishment of course * Desires self-improvement and mutual understanding with someone she earnestly respects * Hungers for a lifestyle out of the norm from contemporary society, and arguably more enriching and fulfilling than others * Enjoys and celebrates the symbiosis between Male Authority and feminine deference * Enjoys the feeling of restraints binding her wrists, delightful warmth and exquisite pain being applied to her bare bottom, her orgasms denied (or forced again and again alternatively), and a Man's lips wrapped around hers * Becomes wet from uttering the word ""Sir"" * Heart melts when uttering the word ""Sir"" (alternatively) If this sounds like you, do not hesitate to apply. Let's schedule two separate interviews if that is indeed the case, shall we? One between you and I over dinner, and another between your bare bottom and my paddle over my desk... Now that we have the formalities out of the way, let me introduce who I am more thoroughly. I am someone who has long possessed a different kind of taste in the type of women I like to sink my teeth into. I've been in the military since I left home, pursuing higher education and training for a particular career at the moment, and in need of a submissive woman who I can bring along for the amazing future I have mapped out ahead for me and for the world. To put it more roughly and less precise than that long ad you just read, I am in need of a 1950/1960s-style TPE relationship. I want to exude masculinity and fiery romantic dominance with you, and I want you to exude femininity and beautifully sweet deference/acquiescence in kind. I want to mend you if you're hurt, mold you like clay into the kind of woman you've always longed to be (if needed), and improve my own life by sharing it with another soul (and protecting it in times of vulnerability). I am 5""11, average build, black hair, dark eyes, white, and I am told I have an equally soothing and yet enrapturing voice capable of activating a woman's most erogenous zone. In addition to that my hands and the fingers upon them are quite dexterous and skilled in a number of hobbies. I am seeking a LDR at first and commitment/living together under one roof eventually if we're certain about the path we want to take. I look forward to conversing with you. Your photo gets mine. Stay safe during this crisis. -Nite"

I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, but if not, just search for ""hand dominance"" on PornHub or any other adult streaming site. It's the total vulnerability, I suppose, and loss of control. That, combined with the exposure and exhibitionism -- man's genitalia on display while his mistress slinks and skulks in her lingerie or latex bodysuit. She teases him, taunts him, tortures him. His orgasm and pleasure are hers. His *desire* for *her* is his weakness, and she exploits it to the hilt. She edges him. She denies him. She verbally humiliates him. She dictates the terms of his release (and relief). In some scenarios, he arouses himself under her direction: stroke, don't stroke; faster, slower; stop, start. And throughout it all, he is not allowed to come until she give her loving (or demeaning or humiliating) permission. In other cases, she takes control -- his hands are bound, leaving her to milk him. To force him to climax or to entirely deny it. To ruin his orgasms by allowing what might have been a spouting masterpiece devolve into a dribbling mess. To mercilessly jack him in post-orgasm torture. She laughs; she doesn't care. It is her delight to see his much-anticipated gratification reduced to a defeated, drained, and empty sex organ between his legs, wrinkled and flaccid. But is this real? Are there women into this as much as I am? I will gladly reciprocate if that is desired or expected -- just let me know how I might be of service . . ."

So I imagine your first question would be ""who the hell is this guy?"" An excellent question. I have been in the scene for almost five years now and have learned a great deal in that time. I must admit I am quite the nerd when it comes to BDSM, I love to learn about new kinks, new fetishes and how people tick so I hoover up as much information as I can and love to do so. This does mean I am prone to long rants about random subjects as well, because I'm a nerd in a lot of other things too, so fair warning and good luck. If you don't give your full attention, I'll probably slap you - or leave an angry emoji on your screen - basically the same thing - so you all have that as a disadvantage. As a Dominant I primarily derive my pleasure from pure control and the effect it has upon those under me. **Let me start with why you're going to be so important to me** Submission should be a place of pride. Submission is vulnerability, and as anyone who knows anything about life will tell you, vulnerability takes a great deal of strength. Submission is an expression of that strength. It's a strength I myself don't have much of, but I need someone else to have it in my life, and as a Dominant, I am tasked with honoring the strength you show by placing yourself at my feet. And why do you show that strength? So that you may serve. So that you may express your care and affection and goodwill toward someone else. So that you may make his day a little easier, a little more enjoyable. So that you can find joy in being selfless. There's truly not a more compassionate, generous or loving thing that you can do for someone else. And what I find in the best submissives is that this generosity of heart doesn't stop at just their Dominant. They extend that respect and goodwill and that joy of service, in small ways, to every one in their life. It's an example I hold close to me because it pushes me to be a better man. **What will your expectations be?** **Honesty:** Honesty is crucial with me. If I cannot trust that you will be open with me about how you feel or about aspects of your life then I cannot trust you to be safe with any tasks or play we might do, so it is the most important thing you can do for me to live up to this expectation fully. **Enthusiasm:** Sounds silly, I know, but from experience I have found this surprisingly lacking in a lot of folks. Just because you are mine does not mean you can just kick back and only do exactly as instructed. If I wanted a robot I'd attach Alexa to a Furbie (Already a thing in Japan?) I want you to truly want to learn, to please, to expand your knowledge and skills and to have the same passion for kink as I do. **Intelligence:** Im not expecting you to be the second coming of Einstein or for you to develop cold fusion while suspended upside down with nipple clamps on but I do want you to think about how you perform tasks and rituals. Im only human (mostly) and so I will make mistakes , instead of following blindly I want to know you will adjust as needed or tell me to hold up. That is a great comfort to me. **An understanding of place:** A hard one to quantify. I strongly believe in the symbiosis of the M/s and D/s dynamics and my duties in relation to that. I will be a mentor and a friend, but I am not here to just be a service top. I won't bend to random moods or whims and again while I am very understanding when it comes to feelings, mental illness and life getting in the way, there should always be the understanding that you are mine not the other way around and so I always want to see a true effort every day to put me first. **Reasonable contact and expectations of contact:** We all have normal lives to live sadly, and as such we can't be sat around all day enjoying our debauchery (Damn you, employees of Kink.com). I fully accept that communication will not be a perfectly clockwork affair but I do expect to hear from you throughout every day when you are able, likewise you can expect the same from myself. There is no such thing here as chatting too much and we should demand presence from one another. A distant relationship is not worth having. **For you to be submissive:** I may be going over covered ground here but to be absolutely clear, a submissive submits, in this case you will submit to me. This doesnt mean manipulation, obfuscation, omission or outright defiance. I'm not saying there will be no banter, in fact I quite enjoy it every now and then, a big yes for banter, but at the end of the day your signing up to be controlled by me so if you intend on trying to manipulate me in any fashion to get what you want then you're not for me. **A small clarification:** I find it a popular penchant to infer that as a Dominant I seek to make you entirely dependent on me. That's not what a loving partner would do, and I'm aiming to be one of those. I want to be clear that my goal is not to make you dependent but to use your submission to me as a way to empower you and make you more capable. You will be at my feet and your power will be mine when serving me, but outside of that, I am here to make you more independent and more confident. **What you can expect from me:** **Honesty:** Just like I expect it from you , you can expect it from me, I will be honest and open with you about my thoughts and feelings so you can trust that I will not hold back from you. **Care for your well-being:** Part of my outlook is an emphasis upon the symbiosis of dynamics. It's not simply a one way street where you do everything I want and get nothing back , by accepting your gift of submission I also accept the responsibility that comes with it. Your well-being both physically and mentally will become my charge and I will ensure to the best of my abilities that you not only have that support but feel it too. To have a Master is to have a mentor. I will leave you a better, happier person. That is a promise. **A weird, mostly likable, eccentric person:** Sure I love the rituals and structure and the beauty of creating a dynamic but I'm not always some dusty aloof Dom. Sometimes I'm a young and hip aloof Dom. I enjoy fun and breasts, I will want to chat to you as a friend, with the understanding of your position thrown in, so I will create an environment where you can talk to me openly and safely while feeling submissive and owned the whole time, and you can rest assured that we're going to have some fun. **Here is a very brief list of some of my likes:** *Orgasm control* - Training to hold off orgasm or to cum on command. I feel this is pretty popular. I'm going to hear you moan a lot. *Predicament/Desperation play* - You know that game where someone has to read a chapter of a book while being edged over and over again? Yeah, I wouldn't do that. *Pain/Pleasure* - While I wouldn't refer to myself as a pure sadist, I do enjoy pain when it invokes pleasure or teaches a lesson. Okay, I do enjoy pain just for pain as well. But, I'm only like a 75 percent sadist - at most. It isn't all I do. I'm only cruel like 10 percent of the time - at most! What's the definition of a pure sadist again? *Rituals/life control* - A big part of being mine will be conforming to a structure I lay down. This will involve rituals (not a cloaked blood sacrifice) and certain subtle life changes that will give you a consistent feeling of being under control. **Hard limits** So, yes I know my likes are very vague but at least this part is certain: Permanent Damage, social suicide, scat, blood play, public. The rule of thumb is I follow both S.S.C and R.A.C.K, I want this to be enjoyable and not damage either of us. **FAQ:** *I have a limit of pictures/videos is that ok?* While I fully respect, understand and support not wanting to go gynecological in the first 5 minutes, full surrender means full surrender, and I will take nothing else than your entire physical and mental self. This means that photos and videos will be expected upon your submission. This does not mean we're going to re-enact a strip search after an hour of talking. *""Do you accept male subs?""* I am afraid not. Good luck to you. Keep up the good fight. *Do you accept larger girls?* Attitude is the most sexy thing you can possibly have, so if you have that, quit worrying and message me. If we're not physically compatible, I will be upfront and respectful within that conversation, but that is a silly reason to skip out on this if it appeals to you. You deserve to give yourself a chance and I want to give one to you. *I have a busy work/life schedule is that ok?* Like I've said we all have lives. I will work with you to uphold and maintain your highest priorities. Especially the priorities that comes before kink. *""Where do you live by the way?""* Oh, this funny old state of Wyoming *Does anyone live in Wyoming?* # That is an offensive stereotype! There's Bob. He's an hour south by horseback in fair weather. Swell guy, that Bob. So I am almost certain I will have misspelled or grammatically bungled huge sections of this and forgotten probably some key bits of information leaving you all hopelessly confused and in a daze, but if you manage to regather yourself, I'd love a message. Just two quick rules. 1. I am intelligent person. You're probably smarter than I am. So, spell things fully and correctly. Give myself and yourself the respect we both deserve and conduct yourself with some dignity. 2. My name is not ""Sir"". If we're both fortunate, you'll be calling me Sir approximately 9,283 times a day soon. That's not...the very first time you message me. Once you get to know me a little, it's entirely up to you. But at the start, we are two wandering souls meeting each other in the chambers of Reddit. Let's treat each other as such."

Do you crave a state of constant panic, fear, and anxiety? If you fantasize about emotional, verbal and physical abuse, but are too flighty and afraid to really commit to it, then you just need to work up the courage to talk to me. Picture the following: You wake up at 2 AM. Your first thought is to check your phone. You read your latest instruction and force yourself out of bed, your heart beating fast, and apologize profusely for going to sleep without saying goodnight. Then you slap your chest until it's red and hope you've punished yourself enough to satisfy me. You go back to sleep anxious. The next day, you have to go to work. You don't wear panties, since you were told not to. You get a message during your shift and have to go to the bathroom to play with yourself. You're little more than a toy to be played with. You're often on the verge of tears, and this day is just too much. You sob and scream internally. The next message tells you to lick the toilet bowl. You protest, hoping to have mercy, but instead you're told not to be a boring, prudish cunt and to do as you're told or go back to your boring, meaningless life. You realize that your feelings don't matter to anyone. They haven't mattered in a long time. You still hope that your mind will be enough to win someone over. You constantly wonder if all the questions you're being asked about your personal life are an effort to collect more blackmail, a cruel joke, or genuine interest. If you want your life to have this chapter, I'm right here and hungry for someone to mark. I'm interested in psychological manipulation, coercion, dubcon, emotional and physical abuse, existential dread. If we talk it's for a long-term exploration of these themes. I'm not looking for roleplay and I prefer a quick-fire interrogation style chat to slow and long-winded responses. Look at my profile and you might find other prompts. I reward curiosity, intelligence, emotional depth, vulnerability and people who know how to grab my attention. Send me a PM with the following information: Name Age Location Something I shouldn't know about you How long you've fantasized about being blackmailed Why you're throwing your life and autonomy away Say that you understand this is a life-changing decision."

The kind of dynamic I fantasize about is a nurturing and gentle one. I'd like my little to be sweet, loving, and playful. I'm all of those things myself and I usually find myself naturally filling the role of a reliable and caring figure without even thinking about it. I'm really kinky too and completely open minded, so I'd love to hear about what you like even if it's not one of my kinks already! I also like when littles act a bit bratty or spoiled, I think it can be really cute and I'm also not afraid to get serious when the moment calls for it. The sort of little I like would be one who is around my age or below(18-24), really cutesy, childish, sensitive, and innocent, but also with a kinky/naughty side in private. I find traits such as shyness, inexperience, clinginess, and needyness really cute. I find any body type that isn't overweight appealing, with a preference towards petite/small littles. Race is not a factor at all for me so don't worry about it, I would however love to learn about your background since I really appreciate and like to learn about other's heritage and culture! I'm 5'9"", lean slim build, light olive skin tone, short/medium length straight black hair, and dark brown eyes. As a daddy I'm someone who is very dominant and likes taking charge of things and making decisions. I like to make sure my little is happy and comfortable every step of the way and always ask for feedback such as ""How are you feeling princess?"", ""Does that sound okay to you baby girl?"", ""Do you like this, cutie?"", and so on. It is important to me for a little to feel safe and be able to show vulnerability around me and I will make it a point to create an environment that suits that. While I am very gentle and affectionate I can also be very intense and have quite a voracious sex drive. That's why it is very important that I mention the need for my little to be sexual and that she have a sex drive that can keep up with mine. Intimacy is very important for me and is a big part of compatibility. For me sex is one of the most intense displays of love and affection and something that I can't get enough of with the right one. Some of my interests/hobbies: Music, art, psychology, science/tech, guitar, weightlifting, anime, travel, cooking, video games, computers, psychedelics. Some of my kinks: DDlg, ageplay, breeding, oral, rope/restraint play, edging, teasing, and lastly, any of yours!(I really am very open minded and love trying new things! I'll be more than happy to try something you're into that I may not know of!) Limits: Scat, blood/gore, vomit, etc. I'm looking for something long term, I want to form something special, deep, and intense with someone. The closer you are the better, I post this with the intention of making this a real thing! I look forward to hearing from you and getting to know each other. If there's anything you'd like to know that I may not have mentioned please feel free to ask! I'm very open and will happily answer whatever questions you may have for me. You can reach out to me on here through DM or chat, I also have kik/snapchat/discord."

I've been every kind of Top you can think of, and I am quite flexible with what kind of sub is right for me. What I really need is that devotion that only comes from submission. That kind of gratification and control and vulnerability that can only be shared by the kinky among us. I'm based near London, on the border with Kent. I drive. I am a business owner. I'm a firm but fair Master with a lot of experience under my belt. I love to make things. I love to better myself and my property too. Trainer. Sadist. Cuddler. Owner. I don't have a type, but I dislike too much bratting, I prefer a good girl. Kinks are many and varied, limits few. I yearn for the other half of my dynamic, and I hope to meet someone for a lasting relationship. I love to teach, experience not necessary. I love eagerness to please. I dislike intolerance and closed-mindedness. As long as this post is up, please feel free to message me. I hope to hear from you!"
33,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"27[M4F] Seeking my cute obedient girl to love on. I need you. (online, in-person down the road if you're the one my life is building toward)",1,ijlcwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/ijlcwf/27m4f_seeking_my_cute_obedient_girl_to_love_on_i/,2020-08-31 07:50:00,"Everyone is screwed up, broken, clingy, and scared- Ann Lamont Saw that quote the other day, and I guess it seemed an appropriate way to begin this personal. And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time. Edit: There was concern in an earlier posting about my demanding emotional intimacy and how that might be unhealthy. I'm going to post an abridged version of my explanation here, but please refer to my posting last week to reference the entire conversation if you desire, and contact me or comment below if there are any concerns. The point is to create a truly safe place, where my submissive knows she is fully accepted, even her trauma and insecurities. That safe place comes from friendship and trust. I don't plan on interrogating my partner about her life as soon as she messages or even as soon as she submits. I don't plan on interrogating at all. It's something she will surrender freely and willingly in her own time, when she knows that she will be cared for and accepted, that she is valued and safe. Just because it is a part of that mental surrender doesn't mean I can't approach it with great compassion and empathy and patience. I think that's the most important thing I can give a submissive when it comes to these truly difficult things. But I also need her to know she has a partner in all of it, and that carrying these things is heavy and a part of D/s is having someone to share that weight with you. It's not about making her tell me anything. This is a lifestyle of consent, and the person this relationship is right for will consent to share these things with me when that trust and safety is there."

Not much of a re-poster, but thought I'd give it another try. Probably my last one. \*\*\*\*\* I think two partners reading to each other, on the couch, under a blanket, in the park, in bed, close to each other feeling the other one drift into sleep is one of the most intimate and erotic things between two people. I start with this image because I am convinced that a functioning bdsm relationship requires the same as any other relationship in which both partners desire closeness and intimacy: language, communication, listening, and entrusting yourself to the other. Kink lists do nothing for me. These days, I am not sure if it makes sense to ever hope for a genuine partnership again; but I do know I would want and need it to involve an emotional and intellectual connection. Of course, the physical too; but it's meaningless without said connection. And connections are not magically found; they are developed, and require patience, honesty, care, and the willingness to be vulnerable. Vulnerability requires taking a risk; if you might be willing to take one with me, please reach out. Me: tall wm, 6'4"", in writing/teaching, passionate about reading, literature, art, and film. Honest, nurturing, giving, open-minded. Single father. Just to be upfront. You: over 30. Local, in the DMV area, possibly PA, but best if in Northern MD.

The loneliness is sharp and palpable, but the hope that things will work out is waning with every day that passes. Searching for BDSM partners on Reddit is honestly one of the most painful things Ive been through in my adult life. I've been using reddit to engage in D/s dynamics for the past 11 months and it has left me feeling gutted and even more alone than before I started. I've been used, left, ghosted, rejected, and as a result, my self worth is shattered. I can't explain how many times I've said, ""Okay. I understand."" only to mean ""Okay, I understand that I'm not enough to make you stay. I understand that I'm not your priority and I never was."" How many ""Doms"" on here are actually just abusers? How many people promise that they're looking for connection, only to request explicit pictures and dole out tasks within 48 hours? They all want to possess me completely, to own every aspect of my mind, to exploit my vulnerability for their limited attention span, while giving nothing in return. And there's no pattern; it's been men, women, younger, older, nearby, and across the ocean. Someone told me once that this is just the game - that sifting through people on Reddit is common and most interactions are disappointments. But it's worse than that, I think. I wonder if weve created a space where anonymity serves to shield countless transgressions. I've known I was submissive since I was 15. I acknowledge and celebrate that part of myself, but I crave companionship. I crave a Dominant to guide my mind, command my body, cherish my heart, and treasure my submission. But I'm only interested in doing this safely and genuinely. I am constantly told that I'm ""not submissive"" when I stand up for safety, fairness, and honesty. To vouch for myself, to say ""no,"" is seen as disobedient. It hurts. I feel lost in this wide world and maintaining softness and sensitivity feels impossible.

This ad is long and specific, Im hoping it helps me find someone who is genuinely interested. **DISCLAIMERS** To start off, Im engaged. Mostly happily, Im also really done with seeing my fianc all-day everyday. Hes aware that Im looking to chat with others about kinky-sex stuff. Hes not aware of some of my kinks. He gets pretty uncomfortable with the idea that Im submissive. I spare him the details. Im also not exactly at my goal weight right now. I definitely experienced some COVID-related weight gain. Im working on it. Im normally fairly athletic. Im happy to share pictures, but may be a little shy about my body for a while. I just wanted to get that out of the way incase anything was a dealbreaker. **ABOUT ME** Im fairly successful. At least, by my standards. I love my job and am passionate about what I do. I will talk your ear off about it. Im a little bit of a workaholic, I have a lot of free time right now though. I feel like I did all the right things at all the right times. College, career, house, marriage. Basically, I fit all the suburban white girl stereotypes. My idea of a perfect date is also 100% sipping Starbucks and taking a long walk around Target. I have hobbies. I love trashy tv (watch The Bachelor with me?) I recently got really into gardening. Im currently obsessed with Animal Crossing. I like martial arts and kickboxing, my gyms are still closed though . Overall, Im happy. Im just a little sexually frustrated sometimes. **SEX STUFF** I am sexually submissive. I crave vulnerability and helplessness. I discovered this through porn; kink.com was always my go-to. I still have an embarrassing crush on James Deen (ugh, its confusing.) I dont orgasm, I just cant. Things feel good, then I just become overly sensitive though. The Goop episode definitely didnt help. Im into the idea of someone teaching me to orgasm (then subsequently owning my future orgasms.) But this becomes a delicate and frustrating subject. If youre going to try this, you really need to get to know me please. I adore pain. Im a huge masochist. I would love to kneel at someones feet to be flogged. I like humiliation, but Im picky. For example, I love name calling but only when it means something. If you start calling me a stupid slut out of the blue, it means nothing to me (actually, it probably gets a pretty serious eye roll.) I really like talking about fetishes and fantasies. **WAYS I WANT TO SUBMIT** First of all, I want this to happen gradually. Please dont just start ordering me around. I currently plan to keep this online, I really like the mental side of bdsm. I am potentially open to meeting someone in person (someday.) * Id love to find someone to send adorable daily morning selfies to. I want a relationship where we eventually say good morning and good night. * Id love to write short sexy stories with someone. Ill admit, Ive talked to several doms recently. One gave me prompts and we wrote some erotica together. It was exciting. * Id love to share all of the porn I view. I like the idea of having my porn habits monitored and analyzed. Honestly, I like the idea of having most of my habits monitored and analyzed. * Id love to play some games. Lets make a sexy bet. * Id definitely accept other creative assignments and tasks. I generally get bored of really repetitive stuff. I definitely want a dom with an imagination. **ABOUT YOU** There is nothing more sexy than a caring, educated, understanding, confident and sadistic man. Or woman, I would love to submit to a woman. Im looking for someone who has a soft side. Im not really into the word Daddy, but I want to find someone that cares about me. I need a dom that earns respect and takes his time. At the same time, I want to find someone that is sadistic. I want you to genuinely enjoy inflicting pain and humiliation. The following are pluses, not requirements. * Im really aroused by intelligence and experience. I dont want someone that tells me hes been a dom for 20 years . I want someone that acts like hes been a dom for 20 years. * Im so interested in talking to people with other D/s relationships. Totally not a requirement. But I like the idea of potentially playing with other submissive women. Or better - getting dominated by a couple . Also, since Im not looking for a romantic relationship, its sometimes nice to know youre talking to someone else. **CONTACTING ME** * Please send me a message (who even uses the chat feature?)"

However, when Im not studying, I can be found spending time with my closest friends, listening to music, watching football, or watching my favorite movies/tv shows on repeat. As for my kinky side: I would still consider myself inexperienced, however I am a submissive through and through. To be more specific: I consider myself a primal brat. I have little tendencies (dont we all need a little Little in our lives?) and would love to dabble in pet play. My kinks include: teasing, light bondage, rope, light degradation, discipline, humiliation, JOI, orgasm control/denial, exhibitionism, breeding, marking (scratching/biting), sensory deprivation, CNC (to a degree). I tend to have a very open mind and would love to explore more. My limits include: Scat/urine, blood play, bestiality, heavy pain/abuse. What am I looking for in my Dominant? Physically - a man or woman between 20 and 45. I am not incredibly picky about looks - I would just prefer someone generally in good shape and good health, as I am trying to keep healthy and active myself. I would prefer someone in the United States due to time zone differences; that being said, I will keep an open mind. I need a confident Dominant who is strict but caring. I thrive under structure and am most satisfied when I am pleasing a superior. However...I need someone headstrong who can easily put me in my place when Im feeling bratty. What am I looking for in our relationship? I want a connection. Someone who I can come to at the end of the day and open up to, who I can open myself up to and entrust with my vulnerability. I want a friend, a mentor, a lover - someone who knows me, gets me, sees me, and yet can put me back in my place at the snap of a finger; someone to make me feel small. s\\nxap **zoxostacy**"

As for my kinky side: I would still consider myself inexperienced, however I am a submissive through and through. To be more specific: I consider myself a primal brat. I have little tendencies (dont we all need a little Little in our lives?) and would love to dabble in pet play. My kinks include: teasing, light bondage, rope, light degradation, discipline, humiliation, JOI, orgasm control/denial, exhibitionism, breeding, marking (scratching/biting), sensory deprivation, CNC (to a degree). I tend to have a very open mind and would love to explore more. My limits include: Scat/urine, blood play, bestiality, heavy pain/abuse. What am I looking for in my Dominant? Physically - a man or woman between 20 and 45. I am not incredibly picky about looks - I would just prefer someone generally in good shape and good health, as I am trying to keep healthy and active myself. I would prefer someone in the United States due to time zone differences; that being said, I will keep an open mind. I need a confident Dominant who is strict but caring. I thrive under structure and am most satisfied when I am pleasing a superior. However...I need someone headstrong who can easily put me in my place when Im feeling bratty. What am I looking for in our relationship? I want a connection. Someone who I can come to at the end of the day and open up to, who I can open myself up to and entrust with my vulnerability. I want a friend, a mentor, a lover - someone who knows me, gets me, sees me, and yet can put me back in my place at the snap of a finger; someone to make me feel small. s\\nxap **zoxostacy**"

I strongly believe that the highest function of D/s is as a tool to build someone up. To give them the support, companionship, motivation, structure and accountability necessary to manifest positive change in their life. There is great meaning and joy in introducing someone new to this lifestyle. In showing that it is right to give yourself and that within that surrender, you have worth beyond measure. What brings me here: I'm a 28 year old professional blessed with a stable but modest income earned by doing meaningful work that makes a difference in my community. I have been further blessed in the creation of healthy relationships with friends and family, and a steady motivation to further improve myself and work on new goals. I've found a place of peace and contentment that I want to share with someone who needs it. Those who have been under me describe me as a caretaker, some have even asked if I'm a therapist (I'm not). My role could also be compared to a life coach. But, I'm not here because I'm better than you or more accomplished than you or even have this life better figured out. I'm here because I've failed, because I've taken hard falls and have made many wrong turns. In the most perilous moments, with the help from others, I've discovered tools within myself that have led to real change. The most important of which is an acceptance of myself and a belief in my strength and capability to overcome any obstacle and grow from my failures. This is the truth that will lie at the core of our dynamic: You are intelligent. You are creative. You are capable. You are strong. You have the power to create what you want in life. You are of great worth and you deserve meaning and happiness. I don't need you to feel those things right now - a large part of your training will be about accepting those truths and introducing them to your life - but I need you to be open to them. This dynamic is about taking action in your life that serves you. To re-orient your life where the decisions you make allow you to feel healthier, to have well-being, to grow, improve and accomplish your goals. What we will create: Well work on changing your thoughts, the stories you tell yourself, the narratives that are keeping you trapped. Well identify your goals, short-term and long-term, identify what is important to you, and develop a plan to get you there. Well change your routine. Create a disciplined regimented environment for you to thrive in.Well transform your lifestyle to one that is healthy, a nutritious diet, and regular exercise schedule, daily meditations. In all of this, you will find that you are no longer alone. Youll have an owner. An owner to make proud. An owner to represent. An owner who will encourage you and always push you forward. An owner who will hold you accountable with whatever severity is necessary. Most importantly, above anything else, you are going to feel pride within yourself. What you will invest: This is not free. You will pay me daily with your body, your mind and your service. With your obedience and your submission. You will be entirely stripped and exposed, physically and mentally, and within that environment of true vulnerability and commitment, we will create the catalyst you need to start creating the life that you deserve. A final word Let me take this moment to stress that the most important element in this is not me, it is you. This depends on the kind of commitment, energy and openness you create in yourself. If you come to me out of simple curiosity or because this sounds interesting and it'll help pass the days, you're probably not going to get a lot out of this.

This is honestly a bit tough for me to write because I'm a bit afraid of putting it out there. However, the desire for it is clearly overriding any sort of reservations I've been having. I'm a 25-year-old woman in search of her Mommy Domme, her lover, her partner in crime. I want a relationship: a regular lesbian, girl-on-girl relationship to the outside world and a kinky, well-thought-out 24/7 (ish), Md/lg relationship behind closed doors. Basically the whole package lol. I don't have a whole lot of experience: I have had one long term relationship like this before. It lasted on-and-off for about two years, and she was my first girlfriend, Mistress, and Mommy. And I miss it: I miss having someone to adore and having someone adore me back. I miss calling someone ""Mommy"" (yeah i know, it's weird for a lot of people...it's honestly a bit weird for me too but i'll get into that later) and I miss looking up into her eyes, knowing that she's there to love and protect me. BUT what I don't miss is how easy it can be to f\*ck it all up. The boundaries between kink and ""regular"" life can get pretty messy, so I'm looking for someone with strong communication skills and emotional intelligence. I'm looking for my own kind of ""unicorn"" (no, not a 3way). I'm looking for someone who ""vibes"" with me as a friend AND a lover AND a domme. I'm also UGH kinda picky, which doesn't help me at all, but I'm addicted to tall, pale, goth or alt girls. IDK Y, especially considering I'm nothing of the sort. But hey, the heart wants what it wants, right? A bit about me: * I'm 5' 4"" * Female * Asian * Proportional but a ""little bit extra,"" I guess some would say ""thicc"" * Kinks: any sort of spanking (otk, caning, whips, crops, whatever, bring it on lol), light humiliation, some role-playing (age regression stuff), choking, slapping, IDK what else. If it's one of the common kinks, I'd probably be ok with it, except for oral. I don't usually like things in my mouth so that might be a deal-breaker for a lot of people lol * Limits: basically anything ""extreme"", also only light anal play and no oral (gags are fine if they're not too big) * With regards to littlespace/mdlg things: I'm not sure if you can consider me a ""true little"". I don't really care for most activities, it's more about the sense of trust and vulnerability I would have for a Mommy Domme. To me, that level of intimacy just isn't the same with a ""regular"" domme i guess. * I'm clingy, like most littles, soooo.... please be into that or at least understanding of it * Monogamous * A brat more than anything else You should contact me if: * You are a monogamous woman (preferably a lesbian or a female-preferenced bi lady) who is emotionally available and intelligent and who possesses great communication/interpersonal skills * Are looking for a long-term relationship as well as a bdsm one (so not just for play/for fun) * Are dominant (not necessarily domineering, I actually prefer gentler dommes) * Are ok with md/lg stuff and know what that's all about * Are close to my age (25) and preferably a bit older * And IDK, i guess just contact me if what I wrote resonates with you. No you don't have to be a ""pale, thin, goth girl"" but please be a woman Thanks for reading! Thanks for your time! And I hope to hear from you soon, if you're out there."

I live with chronic nerve pain. I can mention it and I can manage it. Looking for emotional support as I ride the daily waves of pain. I worked so hard over the past 11 years to get where I am today. Some of my kinks revolve around my pain. Being massaged and nurtured - also, ""sharing"" my pain with people. I am poly with one submissive. I am pansexual. Hearts and parts. I love people. I have fantasies about men, women, trans, men who dress as women. So many options. I want to explore the rainbow. Challenge accepted! Open to all body types. The more I like you mentally - the more I will like you physically. Looking for someone to dress up and be cute and girly for me. I am looking for someone 18-40. Someone to chat with. Someone to care for, feminize, degrade, objectify, and use. A good friend and a great submissive sextoy. We can fantasize online until the pandemic is over and then see if we want to meet in person. We can encourage, support, and comfort each other. We do not have to line up on everything. I love discovering new things because I interacted with someone passionate about something. A willingness to explore, experiment, and try new things will go far with me. We are a great match - if you like to have in depth discussions. Let's go to there. Looking for someone to discuss all of our fantasies with. Someone to be sexually and emotionally vulnerable with. I like exploring as Daddy, Sadist, and Dom. I love the contrast between sweet and sadistic. I want you to dress in cute and frilly outfits for me. Shades of Halloween - Princess. Cheerleader. Schoolgirl. I want to make sure you look really nice when I degrade you and encourage you to take pictures for me. Over time I will turn you into Daddys little princess and Daddys little cumslave. I will teach you to cum for me, and help Daddy cum. All while you wear cute little rainbow stockings. I will enjoy teaching you how to please me. I will enjoy eventually taking ownership over your orgasm. If everything lines up. I will craft and mold you so you make my needs a priority. I will use you to satisfy myself. I will guide and nurture you as you serve me. Praise and affection. Degradation and humiliation. We will find that balance together. We can find your limits and keep them sacred or push them until we find new ones. We go at your pace. Top kinks - oral / deepthroat, orgasm control, freeuse, worship, mindfuck, sissy, CNC, and ageplay. Limits - scat, blood, weapons, needles, heavy impact play, breathplay and choking. If this sounds like heaven to you - it sounds like heaven to me. Who am I? - I try to make the world a better place. I know how hard life can be. No one has to go through life alone. I overcame many obstacles to become the person I am today. I have stories to share. Stories about my travels and the people I met. Stories about my favorite things. 6 foot. Big Handsome Man. Beard. Glasses. Charming. Contagious laughter. I am well educated, intelligent, and understanding. I am very good at breaking down complicated concepts and pulling out something simple and clear. I connect with people on a deep and emotional level. Weaving in and out of what we did and how we felt about it. I have a weakness for accents. My natural southern accent is one of my strengths. I love talking on the phone / through voice chat. My love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I have a darker sense of humor (think - Cards Against Humanity). I am incredibly optimistic. I accept things as they are - then find a path forward. I am kind. Compassionate. Empathetic. Emotionally intelligent. Nurturing. I like being the person that my friends can rely on. I love being taken care of and nurtured. I am incredibly affectionate - I like touching the people I care about to remind them I care. Lots of hugs. Bitmojis in this case. I love music. I have a thing for rap, rock, 80s pop hits (I CAN go for that), and music with really deep lyrics. I love how my feelings will magically line up with songs I am listening to. I will naturally reference songs during conversation. I love musicals like Hamilton (Wait for it!). I love falling into any storytelling experience. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I love playing video games - especially JRPGs/RPGs. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). I like documentaries. I love mythology. I love superhero, horror, crime, sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, suspense, action - movies and tv shows. I love magic and stand up comedy. I love when they defy expectations. Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. It keeps me laughing during good and bad times. I enjoy board games. Who are you? - Nurturing. Affectionate. Curious. Kind. You love to listen. You have a thirst for learning and understanding. You have an open mind. You love, respect, and treasure vulnerability. You understand yourself and what you want. You are enthusiastic about life and kink. You are patient and love explaining things in great detail. We will have many discussions about so many things! Let's build an open line of communication. Accept each other with curiosity and openness. We have a lot of exploring to do. Bring a map and a flashlight. If you are reading this - I am searching. Send me a PM - What did you connect with?

I want to build a connection with someone that doesn't expect nudes or sexual content right away. I want someone that understands that the wait is worth it once we have gotten to know each other more and have built up tension and anticipation that it will be so much more fulfilling. **About Me:** I'm short, bit chubby, great rack, hair color depends on the week, light green eyes with dark natural lashes, cute lil pouty mouth that says a lot of dirty things. I never open mouth smile but have lovely teeth, but a bit fangy. I don't tan on purpose or use any fake tanner so naturally kind of pale. I don't smoke and can't stand it. I drink socially but lately that amounts to not at all since haven't been able to be social. Truth be told, I'm kind of an introvert anyway so even when not faced with a global pandemic I usually only go out a couple of times a month. I own my home and have curated a lot of things to make living in it enjoyable so I don't feel the need to find much entertainment elsewhere. I'm also fond of cooking and baking, and kind of a food snob, so I don't go out to eat much either unless it's a social activity. **Things I find attractive:** * Dark hair * Big noses * Hipsters * Lumberjacks * Soft femme bois * Sass * Sense of humor (I know this is subjective but I want to know what gets your giggle motor runnin') * UK or NZ accents * Switchy with power * Goal oriented * Foodie * Animal lovers/compassion * Vulnerability * At least 25 years old **So why BDSM personals?** Once I get to know someone I blossom like a dirty little rose. I have experience as both a Domme and a sub. i have dabbled in DDLG and MDLB. I find myself to be nearly a perfect 50/50 switch, and hope to find someone similar. Some days I may want to call you Daddy and ask for cuddles, other days I may want to wrap my little hand around your throat and ask you who your Daddy is (spoiler, it's me.) I want us go discuss all our weird and fun fantasies and never judge one another and to have a foundation that strong needs time and trust. **Kinks:** * Bondage * Pegging/Anal * Cum play * Queening * Deep throating/messy * Spanking/paddling * Trying ALL the toys for both partners * Orgasm control/denial * Public play/teasing * Blood (this is usually the deal breaker for most so figured I may as well drop that bomb) **Limits:** * Anything too gross like scat or vomit * Nothing illegal (Public play might cross this border depending) * No permanent scaring * Age regression/diaper play Phew okay I think I covered most of the bases here. Location doesn't matter as this will be online at least for the foreseeable future. **Strongly prefer private messages and not chat requests.**"

It's hard to express just how much I miss it. I miss getting to experience aspects of her that others don't. I know it's not for everyone, but I miss being owned enough to know what my Mistress's toes taste like, what her body does when it's getting excited.There is a vulnerability in dominating, in expressing exactly what you want. The times make online more reasonable alternative. So those things may not be likely, but I can still learn what she enjoys, make her laugh, be there to try to help with bad days, beg for permission to orgasm."

I don't know you in anyway, but I assume you feel attraction based on their quantity and medium. Right? I'll elevate the game to another level - I'm talking dick snail mail, flower dicks, cake dicks, and hell, I'll even fax dicks. I just wanted to show you I can hopefully make you FEEL something. Either through laughter because you're awesome and got my joke. Or disappointment, because you actually have a fax and wanted some dick on that sexy 8x11. Friendship is the most important thing I offer to start. That's where everything begins... **Who I AM** I'm a single, no kids, emotionally available, well educated man with a mysterious skill set that keeps me gainfully employed.

Your commitment to setting goals and accomplishing them is something you work hard towards and are proud of. Single. No children. Seeking LTR. Can make time available. Able to travel occasionally. Can supply private jet. That said, there's a need deep within you to explore kink. You have a passion for it and want a Dom to explore it with. You crave someone to use those toys ON you instead of having to do it to yourself. Your smile lights up the sky when you receive his praise and there's nothing that makes you happier than when he's happy. You have enough experience in life and dating to realize the true beauty of a D/s relationship and the maturity to handle the intense connection that it creates. **My Dom Style** Safety. Trust. Privacy. Control. Respect. Leadership. Vulnerability (both ways). Support. Understanding. Exploration. I believe that a D/s relationship doesn't always mean the Dominant has all the answers. I believe both partners need to be open to growing as a team. It takes practice and open communication to create what I'm looking for. I'm ready to put in the hard work to make it happen. You are too! As you know that with the right man your team will be unstoppable. **And Then...** In your reply tell me about yourself, why my post connects with you, and, why you need this type of relationship. So, please, if what I wrote connects with you, take the time to send a message. Even if you have to create an account to do so.

Thats proven much harder to explain than it has ever seemed in my head. Suffice it to say, there is a great cavernous depth of beautiful filth to be explored when the right person comes along and hopefully brings a flashlight. The fun stuff can, and will, come later; Im far more interested in connecting on a normal human being level first. And as someone who just is dominant, I know that my complement just is submissive (and yes, Ive spent plenty of years questioning and challenging that with unsurprisingly little success and am not terribly interested in repeating those performances). Someone who simply breathes it, understands it so natively its sometimes hard to put into words, needs it so deeply she has likely gone without it for such a terribly long time just to be absolutely sure it will be right when she finds it. Someone who knows and needs the same terrifying depths of trust and vulnerability and love that I have always known Ive needed. Some of my kinks include bondage, spanking, ice/wax, deep throating, dp, anal, gags, pain, pussy torture/spanking, nipple play, orgasm control/denial/edging, humiliation, and hidden public.

Perhaps this isnt the place to post because Im looking into exploring this particular kink, rather than having experience. I have almost no experience (Ive tried sexually dominant roles, which Ive enjoyed). I wanted to see if anyone would be willing to show me ropes (although perhaps this is a strange request as Im supposed to take the more dominant role). Of course, I understand the basics and understand the underlying need for trust, vulnerability, and consent. In my sex life, I always want verbal consent. Why this appeals to me: I like taking care of someone deeply and I have dominant streak running through me. I enjoy taking on dominant roles sexually but I rarely have the chance as most men Ive encountered have been dominant or wanted to dominate me, which I sometimes dont mind but it does usually annoy me. I also like a softer side of the domination. Ive tried being dominant and using degradation and pain but I really hated it and felt terrible afterwards. I hate hurting people. But I enjoyed being dominant. Physically , Im generally a person who is very active. As of right now, Ive been stuck at home so Im not as active as before, but hopefully gyms open up again to be back on track. I am considered conventionally attractive (I dont have problems attracting male attention). I also look younger than my age, with most everyone thinking Im in my early 20s, so if a cutesy-looking woman dominating you is your kink, here I am lol Im generally attracted to average to fit body types but I generally care mostly about the face. If you have a nice face, I generally dont mind if youre out of shape (I know I am right now lol). And honestly if you have most beautiful body but Im not attracted to your face, well... I obviously have a wide ranging tastes in terms of looks, so dont worry too much about it if you message me. Obviously the most important part is your personality and intelligence. I would love to have an intelligent sub wherein I could take care of him and dominate him but also have discussion about the arts, politics, etc. And I tend to be more interested in someone who is positive and empathetic. Kindness is a huge turn on. I hope to find an ongoing thing, rather than a one time thing. Im not closed off to this being online only, nor am I opposed to this potentially becoming something serious and lifelong. I also am open to people abroad but keep in mind time differences. So if anything of this appeals to you, please message me. Im an eager learner and am very patient. I hope for thoughtful messages and will NOT reply to low-effort messages. Im also not looking for this to be purely sexual and hope to get to know the person who I am experiencing this with. Thank you for reading :) Edit: I should say Im looking for someone 24-32. I may go older but definitely not younger. Second edit: not into cucking or brattiness. I will not put up with a bratty man lol"

58,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"28[M4F] The most meaningful part of being a Dominant is using the power she gives you to lift her up. I'm looking to create a 24/7 dynamic focused on mentorship and self-improvement. I'm going to guide and push you toward your best, in both service and life. (open to long distance in US and Canada)",1,hyv0vk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/hyv0vk/28m4f_the_most_meaningful_part_of_being_a/,2020-07-28 02:02:37,"**Introduction** I am an experienced Dominant and a passionate kinkster, and I firmly believe that this lifestyle is more than just something that takes place when the lights are turned off, but an enormously positive and beneficial lifestyle centered around self-improvement, connection and service. I strongly believe that the highest function of D/s is as a tool to build someone up. To give them the support, companionship, motivation, structure and accountability necessary to manifest positive change in their life. There is great meaning and joy in introducing someone new to this lifestyle. In showing that it is right to give yourself and that within that surrender, you have worth beyond measure. **What brings me here:** I'm a 28 year old professional blessed with a stable but modest income earned by doing meaningful work that makes a difference in my community. I have been further blessed in the creation of healthy relationships with friends and family, and a steady motivation to further improve myself and work on new goals. I've found a place of peace and contentment that I want to share with someone who needs it. Those who have been under me describe me as a caretaker, some have even asked if I'm a therapist (I'm not). My role could also be compared to a life coach. But, I'm not here because I'm better than you or more accomplished than you or even have this life better figured out. I'm here because I've failed, because I've taken hard falls and have made many wrong turns. In the most perilous moments, with the help from others, I've discovered tools within myself that have led to real change. The most important of which is an acceptance of myself and a belief in my strength and capability to overcome any obstacle and grow from my failures. **This is the truth that will lie at the core of our dynamic:** You are intelligent. You are creative. You are capable. You are strong. You have the power to create what you want in life. You are of great worth and you deserve meaning and happiness. I don't need you to feel those things right now - a large part of your training will be about accepting those truths and introducing them to your life - but I need you to be open to them. This dynamic is about taking action in your life that serves you. To re-orient your life where the decisions you make allow you to feel healthier, to have well-being, to grow, improve and accomplish your goals. **What we will create:** * Well work on changing your thoughts, the stories you tell yourself, the narratives that are keeping you trapped. * Well identify your goals, short-term and long-term, identify what is important to you, and develop a plan to get you there. * Well change your routine. Create a disciplined regimented environment for you to thrive in.Well transform your lifestyle to one that is healthy, a nutritious diet, and regular exercise schedule, daily meditations. * In all of this, you will find that you are no longer alone. Youll have an owner. An owner to make proud. An owner to represent. An owner who will encourage you and always push you forward. An owner who will hold you accountable with whatever severity is necessary. * Most importantly, above anything else, you are going to feel pride within yourself. **What you will invest:** This is not free. You will pay me daily with your body, your mind and your service. With your obedience and your submission. You will be entirely stripped and exposed, physically and mentally, and within that environment of true vulnerability and commitment, we will create the catalyst you need to start creating the life that you deserve. **A final word** Let me take this moment to stress that the most important element in this is not me, it is you. This depends on the kind of commitment, energy and openness you create in yourself. If you come to me out of simple curiosity or because this sounds interesting and it'll help pass the days, you're probably not going to get a lot out of this. But if you come to me with a determination and a fire - no matter how small - that you are ready to build a new life for yourself, a new way of being - then the day you message me will be the beginning of a journey we will eventually look back on with gratitude. I'm here at the start, waiting for you to join me."

I hope your week is off to a great start. Mine sure is, and I'm feeling optimistic that the rest of the week will be just as good! I'm u/BayAreaLad and it is a pleasure to meet you :) BDSM is the coolest subset of sex. The intimacy, the vulnerability, communication, trust, the power or lack thereof. It is intoxicating! It's also really interesting to discuss the ethics behind it. There seems to be a place for anyone and everyone under the umbrella of BDSM. So cool! I've had some experience with it in IRL and online relationships. I also learned from reading, talking to folks, and more reading! Reading about kink has become a hobby at this point. I've only ever been the Dom/ top but I've some curiosity with being a Sub/ bottom. I'm the kind of person who will try anything twice. We have to collect data the right way, if the first time was a fluke! Things I'll never try include cuckold, pegging, illegal activities, anything to do with blood, and other non sexual bodily fluids. All the power to people who enjoy them but it's not for me. Anything else is fair game! I don't really know what I'm looking for but I'd like to make friends as a start. If there's chemistry, we can talk more about our needs, expectations and decide what to do from there. That being said, I'm here for lasting connections rather than instant gratification, short term gain. I want to learn more, experience new things, and grow my knowledge. If I could describe myself in one word, it would be 'curious'. I love to learn about things, activities, and people. I don't have any real expectations for partners. Being a woman is the only qualifier. I'm 25 years old, free from any diseases including covid 19. I'm no more crazy than what's socially acceptable. Well educated, well spoken and only slightly deviant. We will discuss more in private. Feel free to reach out to me as long as this post is up, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can."

For me submission is ultimately psychological, about being truly known, about being patent and open and vulnerable and about what then gets done with that vulnerability, much more than it is about specific acts. Im happy to share links to a Recon profile that goes into some more detail into my more in-person interests, and if you have a Tumblr account, Im happy to share the voluminous porn Ive written there, which provides, as much as anything can be said to, a detailed map of my libidinal psycheyou can also check out the DPP prompts on this account. And if Im not into something yet? Im really pretty easily manipulated; theres a good chance that, within some firm limits (blood, solo breathplay, shaving), you can probably convince me of its appeal. **You** In part because theres a lot that turns me on and that can turn me on, and because a lot of what turns me on is the individual particularity of a guy and what he enjoys, Im pretty open to what kind of dominant you want to be. Want to be mean, emotionally sadistic, and apathetic? Great! Want to be caring and build a connection based on trust and intimacy? Awesome! Want to be a mix of the twopatronizingly affectionate while ignoring my own wants/needs/desires in favor of your own, because ultimately you know best? Sounds fucking great. If there are specific kinks/dynamic/vibes youre into, please do let me know! I do, though, have two pretty firm criteria. The first is that youre verbal, articulate, literate, etc. I know, I know, thats a mildly insulting, even presumptuous thing to say, but even as words normally turn me on much more so than actions anyway, given that Im looking for a distance thing where your control will be mediated by your words rather than the firm pressure of your hand on the back of my head, they seem even more key. The other is that you recognize that even if we may both want you to eventually not treat me like one, I am a real person, with my own life (again however much we both want you to encroach on it); if youre the sort of person who thinks I should call you SIR automatically in the first message just because you exist, then were probably not a good match. (Although note that this does not mean that Im not open to the idea that youre inherently better than me and necessarily deserve deference; no doubt you are and do, but lets discover that together.) **Us** The pandemic has put a sharp stop to any kind of in-person kink play where I am, and so while normally Im in favor of actually meeting up, Im looking to explore serving and being used (and even just chat) at a distance. So much of my early sexuality was driven by encounters on chatrooms and old phonesex message boards, and it could be fun to explore that again. In terms of modality, reddit PMs, skype, texting, phone, or eventually video; in terms of things we could try: * Roleplay * Discipline (This ones more role, less play: in real life I struggle with self-control, procrastination, discipline, and all kinds of other behavioral issues; itd be awesome to find a life coach/mentor/paternal type figure to help me set the boundaries that Im unable to. Catharsis is good. Tears are good.) * Tasks/Ritual * Hypnosis (An incredibly longstanding fantasywho doesnt want to open up their subconscious and be remade, unawares?but something Ive never actually tried out) Thats just a random sample of things we (or more properly, you) could play with, though. If theres something else youre interested in, or if anything about this profile that speaks to you, please do be in touch!"

Yes, Im married. Yes, the husband knows. No, he will not be joining us. No, Im not leaving him as he is my primary partner. This is just for me as I Domme him at home but a girl needs a Dom/Master of her own to spank her, hold her down, and fuck her. I need a Dom/Master who will take the time to get to know me and build trust online before we meet in person. This is incredibly important to me. It helps lay the foundation for whats to come when we meet in person. Im talking a good 2-3 months before we meet. No, Im not trying to waste your time or mine but I dont want to just sub for anyone and I wouldnt expect you to Dom for just anyone. For me it has to be special because when its special I can fully surrender and submit for the long term. I want a man who knows what he wants and goes after it. Someone who will respect my intelligence then bend me over his knee. A man who understands Im stilly relatively new to being a sub so he will be patient with me training me with his experience. I crave attention and like to receive messages just because or with an order. I want you to make me cry in pain and pleasure then pull me beside you and hold me. I want you to hold my curvy hips as you take what is yours behind me. Im not a brat, I do love discipline and following rules without acting up first. Im not a side piece. I am more and you will be more to me as I value and respect the right Dom/Master for me. I crave vulnerability, surrender, and sensitivity. I want to be manhandled, grabbed, and told what to do. I enjoy orgasm control, anal, spanking, public sex, face fucking, breath play, restraints, pussy slapping, and have several things Id like to try that I havent gotten to yet. I am not interested in scat play, verbal humiliation or degradation to me or about my husband, stretching, or fisting. Those are hard limits. Outside my kinks Im a self confessed nerd who likes to lift weights too. I can code complex reports and then go play tabletop games with my friends and watch/read sci-fi. I love to read and books are incredibly important to me. I have ever changing bright not natural hair color, tattoos, and wear a vast array of black clothing. Im a spoiled princess whos husband takes very good care of her so Ive got the pretty dresses and accessories I crave. I like my men taller than 510 and adore the clean shaven or bearded look as long as you maintain your beard. I like men who communicate in full sentences, yes this had to be said, as the mental turn ons are just as important to me as the physical. I dont have preferences for body type as Ive found myself attracted to many a differently built man before but youll like big hips, thighs, and ass on your women with some belly because thats what I bring to the table. I would preferably be your only sub but this is not a deal breaker because Im married myself so I understand. I do like being the more significant sub if Im not the only one and in turn will service you well. I will be available on a regular basis to serve you for scenes once we have built up a naughty friendship online first. Because thats the thing, I want to be your friend just as much as Ill want to get on my knees and serve you. Lets see where this goes."

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.)Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

To give them the support, companionship, motivation, structure and accountability necessary to manifest positive change in their life. **What brings me here:** I'm a 28 year old professional blessed with a stable but modest income earned by doing meaningful work that makes a difference in my community. I have been further blessed in the creation of healthy relationships with friends and family, and a steady motivation to further improve myself and work on new goals. I've found a place of peace and contentment that I want to share with someone who needs it. Those who have been under me describe me as a caretaker, some have even asked if I'm a therapist (I'm not). My role could also be compared to a life coach. But, I'm not here because I'm better than you or more accomplished than you or even have this life better figured out. I'm here because I've failed, because I've taken hard falls and have made many wrong turns. In the most perilous moments, with the help from others, I've discovered tools within myself that have led to real change. The most important of which is an acceptance of myself and a belief in my strength and capability to overcome any obstacle and grow from my failures. **This is the truth that will lie at the core of our dynamic:** You are intelligent. You are creative. You are capable. You are strong. You have the power to create what you want in life. You are of great worth and you deserve meaning and happiness. I don't need you to feel those things right now - a large part of your training will be about accepting those truths and introducing them to your life - but I need you to be open to them. This dynamic is about taking action in your life that serves you. To re-orient your life where the decisions you make allow you to feel healthier, to have well-being, to grow, improve and accomplish your goals. **What we will create:** * Well work on changing your thoughts, the stories you tell yourself, the narratives that are keeping you trapped. * Well identify your goals, short-term and long-term, identify what is important to you, and develop a plan to get you there. * Well change your routine. Create a disciplined regimented environment for you to thrive in.Well transform your lifestyle to one that is healthy, a nutritious diet, and regular exercise schedule, daily meditations. * In all of this, you will find that you are no longer alone. Youll have an owner. An owner to make proud. An owner to represent. An owner who will encourage you and always push you forward. An owner who will hold you accountable with whatever severity is necessary. Most importantly, above anything else, you are going to feel pride within yourself. **What you will invest:** This is not free. You will pay me daily with your body, your mind and your service. With your obedience and your submission. You will be entirely stripped and exposed, physically and mentally, and within that environment of true vulnerability and commitment, we will create the catalyst you need to start creating the life that you deserve. **A final word** Let me take this moment to stress that the most important element in this is not me, it is you. This depends on the kind of commitment, energy and openness you create in yourself. If you come to me out of simple curiosity or because this sounds interesting and it'll help pass the days, you're probably not going to get a lot out of this. But if you come to me with a determination and a fire - no matter how small - that you are ready to build a new life for yourself, a new way of being - then the day you message me will be the beginning of a journey we will eventually look back on with gratitude. I'm here at the start, waiting for you to join me."

Without a condom I cum very quickly, and with a condom I either still cum within a few minutes or the lack of sensation softens my erection. Despite being extremely horny I often only get half hard, and it can take a lot of stimulation to get that far. I'm able to cum without being completely hard (and even when I'm nearly completely soft), which as you might imagine can be fairly humiliating. Maybe it's due to association or because of my experiences in the kink scene, but over time the humiliation aspects of all of this has turned into a fetish; SPH, being forced to orgasm while soft (e.g. with a hitachi), being ridiculed while attempting to have normal sex, etc, have all become major fantasies for me. &amp;#x200B; For much longer than I've had those kinks I've been involved in BDSM and kink, and I've had a lot of experience as a submissive both online and in real-life scenes. My kinks as a sub include light humiliation, pain play, impact play, chastity and orgasm control, ruined orgasms, cum eating, body worship, choking, mental play and mind fuckery, etc. I enjoy anal play and when it's done right it's incredibly pleasurable and will thoroughly melt my brain and make me useless for a few hours, though that's easy to do in general because it's very, very easy for me to hit sub-space. I suppose all this doesn't come as too much of a surprise. &amp;#x200B; My relationship with kink is complicated, and it's not something I just turn off my brain to do. Like I said I hit sub-space very, very easily, and when I do I go deep. The complicated side of that characteristic is that there's a significant loss of control that can happen with very little work, and needless to say there's a ton of vulnerability that goes along with that. A lot of this stuff is genuinely humiliating for me and there's plenty of different feelings wrapped up in them, so a casual and open friendship and a good amount of physical affection outside of the kinky stuff is absolutely required. &amp;#x200B; Here's a little bit more about myself outside of the kink related stuff (feel free to pm me for a photo): I'm white, 5'8"", big muscles from weight training but basically a dad-bod. I work in a STEM field and recently moved back to the central MA/Worcester area. I'm a softie in pretty much every meaning of the word. I'm very affectionate once things develop but I'm usually pretty shy when meeting new people, or at least when I'm meeting them due to a kink thing. I'm gender-affirming and open to talking to anyone with the strong exception of cis-men and people who identify as masculine; I'm cis and identify as straight. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for reading!

69,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,27 [M4F] In need of a truly submissive woman for personal secretary position,2,h8k636,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/h8k636/27_m4f_in_need_of_a_truly_submissive_woman_for/,2020-06-14 11:12:46,"Hopefully if you're reading this, you're already a fan of *Secretary* from 2002 with Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader. To be specific, this is how I prefer to characterize my dynamic between myself and a submissive partner - Employer/Boss and secretary who is owned by the one she works for. I also prefer to couch the terms of this dynamic within the context of Ownership &amp; Possession (O&amp;P), as I prefer them over *slavery* and *enslavement*, and I do not typically use the words ""submissive"" or ""Dominant"" as nouns as some choose to do. Here are some definitions of ownership and possession from the O&amp;P manifesto (which is no longer available online unfortunately); &gt;1. What is Possession? &gt;Central to O&amp;P is the concept of Possession: having control and use for one's own purposes of that which is possessed, involving some or all of the rights associated with property ownership. This is asymmetric and unequal in status. While the submissive is in the dominant's possession they are fundamentally there for the dominant, obeying the dominant, and subject to the dominant's decisions. The dominant is the submissive's superior, just as an employer is their servant's superior. The unambiguous, honest, and hierarchical nature of O&amp;P provides clarity about what is to be done, and who is to do it, without the manipulation and unstated quid pro quo of so many relationships. &gt;2. What is Ownership? &gt;Possession may be limited in time or scope, but Ownership is the enduring and veto-less form of possession, in which possession has been maintained long enough and deep enough that it has become ingrained, resulting in the enslavement of the submissive, as a slave. Since this is a gradual, overlapping process, it is usually easier to talk of Ownership &amp; Possession together as O&amp;P. So at first, I am seeking possession of a submissive woman in order to grow both a bond with her and to grow her inner obedient spirit along the way. Eventually, I seek the ownership of that woman. In addition to that, I also happen to desire a woman who subscribes to the [ethos of complete female submission.](URL The etymology of the word is an apt one for this dynamic I believe. It does not just mean a simple clerk or a notary, but more succinctly denotes a ""person entrusted with secrets"". A *confidant*. Hence *secret*ary. This has two meanings in the context of a relationship like this, at least to me, in that not only would this woman be entrusted with my secrets, but she would *be* my secret possession - her own nature and dignity as a submissive woman, her secrets and her well being kept hidden and safe by me. And in order to so, I would necessarily have to be entrusted with her, and everything she is as a woman. Thus the ownership aspect, and yet in my eyes it is *a truly mutual and reciprocal relationship like no other*. In addition to that, I feel it is the proper kind of relationship for a man and woman inducted into a total exchange of power between each other. The position calls for a well-behaved, respectful, obedient and diligent woman to fulfill certain secretarial duties and who both needs companionship and seeks to provide it. If you feel you are lacking in a few or all of these areas, do not be discouraged from applying. All lapses in judgement and inability to fulfill your secretarial duties will be met with the swift and firm application of the appropriate disciplinary procedures, typically involving the use of a hard wooden paddle and the inducing of tears. All punishments are intended to induce *transformational discipline*, that is, discipline intended to transform a lapsed ill-behaved secretary into an elegant secretary cleansed of her transgressions. Desired attributes of a prospective secretarial candidate: * Intellectual/sapiosexual * Warm, elegant personality (for charming acquaintances and associates and representing Us in the best possible light) * Dresses femininely (pencil skirts, short dresses, heels, hosiery, the works, etc. - these can be provided as necessary) * In need of companionship and a deep connection with someone who is her Owner * In need of a more blissful domestic life filled with sensuality, passion, grace, elegance, caring and all the finer things in life for a smart, well-bred woman - all reinforced with a structured amount of discipline and punishment of course * Desires self-improvement and mutual understanding with someone she earnestly respects * Hungers for a lifestyle out of the norm from contemporary society, and arguably more enriching and fulfilling than others * Enjoys and celebrates the symbiosis between Male Authority and feminine deference * Enjoys the feeling of restraints binding her wrists, delightful warmth and exquisite pain being applied to her bare bottom, her orgasms denied (or forced again and again alternatively), and a Man's lips wrapped around hers * Becomes wet from uttering the word ""Sir"" * Heart melts when uttering the word ""Sir"" (alternatively) If this sounds like you, do not hesitate to apply. Let's schedule two separate interviews if that is indeed the case, shall we? One between you and I over dinner, and another between your bare bottom and my paddle over my desk... Now that we have the formalities out of the way, let me introduce who I am more thoroughly. I am someone who has long possessed a different kind of taste in the type of women I like to sink my teeth into. I've been in the military since I left home, pursuing higher education and training for a particular career at the moment, and in need of a submissive woman who I can bring along for the amazing future I have mapped out ahead for me and for the world. To put it more roughly and less precise than that long ad you just read, I am in need of a 1950/1960s-style TPE relationship. I want to exude masculinity and fiery romantic dominance with you, and I want you to exude femininity and beautifully sweet deference/acquiescence in kind. I want to mend you if you're hurt, mold you like clay into the kind of woman you've always longed to be (if needed), and improve my own life by sharing it with another soul (and protecting it in times of vulnerability). I am 5""11, average build, black hair, dark eyes, white, and I am told I have an equally soothing and yet enrapturing voice capable of activating a woman's most erogenous zone. In addition to that my hands and the fingers upon them are quite dexterous and skilled in a number of hobbies. I am seeking a LDR at first and commitment/living together under one roof eventually if we're certain about the path we want to take. I look forward to conversing with you. Your photo gets mine. Stay safe during this crisis. -Nite"

72,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,48 [M4F] Looking for my Online Puddin,0,hbip9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/hbip9a/48_m4f_looking_for_my_online_puddin/,2020-06-19 03:07:35,"Hello there. I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games and painting 40k figures until all hours. (Way too much lately) - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. - Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. - Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. - Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting. - Obedience and compliance, as well as meticulous control and attention is what gets me going. - *Extras:* Slut shaming, behavior modification focused degradation/humiliation, body marking, ownership enforcement, etc. **In my perfect world, my submissive partner would be:** - Based here in the US, preferably in the east coast for timezone purposes. - Between 25-50 years old. - Available *sometime* within my available weekday hours (7a-7p EST) - Highly attentive and communicative. - Looking to live our long distance/separate lives together as much as we possibly can. Not confining ourselves to specific areas of sharing our lives together but opening up every facet of our lives to one another over time and trust. - Excited by the idea of mutual obsession, infatuation, and utter devotion. - Experienced OR actively learning and reading to gain more experience. - A strong speaker with high expectations for command of the English language . - Witty, dry sarcasm, dark humor are all a plus (please don't drown me in your lol's. I'll admit I am a sucker for a good placed GIF though). - Emotionally available. - Married or unmarried, tethered or untethered is irrelevant. Must be transparent with me and my expectation is some degree of monogamy even if you are in a LTR or married at some point. I'm not looking to be #3 in your rotation. To clarify further, in a long term concept with someone who is also married/in a LTR, I'm not looking for either of us to be in a relationship (physical or emotional) with anyone outside of each other and our respective partners. If you're poly, we're going to have to discuss this a large amount up front and get some clear communication on things. **Communication:** - Hangouts (text, voice/video calls), telegram (as a last resort really), emails, snail mail (PO box -- I'm not that insane), or in person. I've posted here before and met some amazing people, but ultimately long term wise, it hasn't lasted to what I've wanted. If you aren't interested in having deep conversations or in writing detailing responses, please don't bother to reach out to me. Include a name or alias that isn't your screen name, A/S/L, communication preferences, and precisely what in this post moved you to reach out. Also, please no reddit chat. Thank you."
73,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"28[M4F] The most meaningful part of being a Dominant is using the power she gives you to lift her up. I'm looking to create a 24/7 dynamic focused on mentorship and self-improvement. I'm going to guide and push you toward your best, in both service and life. (open to long distance in US and Canada)",1,hbp398,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/hbp398/28m4f_the_most_meaningful_part_of_being_a/,2020-06-19 09:04:13,"**Introduction** I strongly believe that the highest function of D/s is as a tool to build someone up. To give them the support, companionship, motivation, structure and accountability necessary to manifest positive change in their life. **What brings me here:** I'm a 28 year old professional blessed with a stable but modest income earned by doing meaningful work that makes a difference in my community. I have been further blessed in the creation of healthy relationships with friends and family, and a steady motivation to further improve myself and work on new goals. I've found a place of peace and contentment that I want to share with someone who needs it. Those who have been under me describe me as a caretaker, some have even asked if I'm a therapist (I'm not). My role could also be compared to a life coach. But, I'm not here because I'm better than you or more accomplished than you or even have this life better figured out. I'm here because I've failed, because I've taken hard falls and have made many wrong turns. In the most perilous moments, with the help from others, I've discovered tools within myself that have led to real change. The most important of which is an acceptance of myself and a belief in my strength and capability to overcome any obstacle and grow from my failures. **This is the truth that will lie at the core of our dynamic:** You are intelligent. You are creative. You are capable. You are strong. You have the power to create what you want in life. You are of great worth and you deserve meaning and happiness. I don't need you to feel those things right now - a large part of your training will be about accepting those truths and introducing them to your life - but I need you to be open to them. This dynamic is about taking action in your life that serves you. To re-orient your life where the decisions you make allow you to feel healthier, to have well-being, to grow, improve and accomplish your goals. **What we will create:** * Well work on changing your thoughts, the stories you tell yourself, the narratives that are keeping you trapped. * Well identify your goals, short-term and long-term, identify what is important to you, and develop a plan to get you there. * Well change your routine. Create a disciplined regimented environment for you to thrive in.Well transform your lifestyle to one that is healthy, a nutritious diet, and regular exercise schedule, daily meditations. * In all of this, you will find that you are no longer alone. Youll have an owner. An owner to make proud. An owner to represent. An owner who will encourage you and always push you forward. An owner who will hold you accountable with whatever severity is necessary. Most importantly, above anything else, you are going to feel pride within yourself. **What you will invest:** This is not free. You will pay me daily with your body, your mind and your service. With your obedience and your submission. You will be entirely stripped and exposed, physically and mentally, and within that environment of true vulnerability and commitment, we will create the catalyst you need to start creating the life that you deserve. **A final word** Let me take this moment to stress that the most important element in this is not me, it is you. This depends on the kind of commitment, energy and openness you create in yourself. If you come to me out of simple curiosity or because this sounds interesting and it'll help pass the days, you're probably not going to get a lot out of this. But if you come to me with a determination and a fire - no matter how small - that you are ready to build a new life for yourself, a new way of being - then the day you message me will be the beginning of a journey we will eventually look back on with gratitude. I'm here at the start, waiting for you to join me."

A 59, 180 pound, human man from Chicago. Im a bit of an over-communicator, if you couldnt already tell from the title, so I hope you enjoy what follows, or if you dont (or dont go farther than this) I wish you well all the same. So, like I was saying, John, handsome, Chicago, but allow myself... to further introduce... myself^further. I grew up in one of the northern suburbs of Chicago and spent a fair amount of time traveling the country as a teenager, and when I got older I upgraded to traveling the world. These days I (oddly) reside in River North of Chicago. I say oddly because I dont really fit in with the River North Becky and Chads, but I love the location and the building in which I live. I feel most alive delving into deep conversations, luxuriating in a lazy nap, excellent food, a great walk, laughing, and incredible sex. Lifes been devoid of incredible sex (despite being an excellent masturbator) for a little while now and thats how I find myself here. Ive actually been posting for quite some time, and this novella of a post is... a sort of new experiment Im trying in the hopes that it attracts the right people- or person. *Back to me though...* beyond enjoying all the fun stuff most human-not-vampire people like to enjoy, I also really value personal growth- facing ones self, taking responsibility for feelings, healing with love and self-acceptance. I want someone who is just as interested in personally growing as they are in getting sopping wet and hungry for dick. I pursue my self-growth through the study of spirituality, and/or the study of the self. This takes form in meditation, journaling, reflection, and discussion with teachers I have (as well as traveling to Europe to spend time with this teacher for a month or so). One of the... fruits of this study (if you want to call it that) is that Ive seemed to develop the ability to *see* someone; I either understand them or get a sense of them incredibly quickly and accurately (not everyone, and by no means am I a mind reader, its just something I hear a lot). Im not one for judgement, even if I disagree, nor am I one to put people down (despite my dirty talk tastes). Non-judgement, patience, acceptance and boundaries are all vital when it comes to great anything, in particular kinky sex. Sense of humor wise, I love absurdity, bad sexual innuendo, a bit of sarcasm, silly-ness, things that show comfort, confidence, acceptance and an ability to laugh at the world more than cry from, or fear it. I mention this because if we cant laugh... what are we doing? Hopefully youve already picked up on a couple of quotes and TV/film references. I keep referring to great sex which, lets be honest, is subjective. So, whats great sex mean to me? Ladies and gentleman of the jury, exhibit A: my kinks. I get off most on communication (verbal or non-verbal), and on a partner who is (relatively) equally as aggressive as myself. This is why I added the ish to the title. Eager obedience is certainly incredibly arousing, but the kind of girl who will tease and play, or outright just inhale my dick without warning or prompting is incredibly hot. Someone who is confident, enjoys being playful and organic as much as the protocol, minus the more extreme forms of power play (though I am guilty of enjoying some forms, such as title use, orgasm control, and edging) is important here. If you are the kind of person who has or would post to r/stupidslutsclub ... thats very much my bag. A specific list of my kinks... Extreme dirty talk Anal Fashion Play Public Oral Fixation (from my partner) Rough, Messy Oral Role Play Exhibitionism Voyuerism Toy Use Cum Play Orgasm Control Edging Teasing Free Use Tantra Swinging Group Play Sleep Play Attention Play Taking/Sharing photos and videos Id identify myself as a hedonist first and foremost (surprise surprise with a username like mine, right?), and a dominant second. Ive tried subbing once and it didnt take. Ironically, I defaulted to a sort of brat-like state (and I say ironically because Im not into brats). I do have some sub-ish fantasies, but theyre more me being used and objectified than actually submitting. Which is a great segue into a deeper idea of what subbing means to me. Whether Im right or wrong, my perspective on most of the submissive people Ive come across in ads on here or in real life is that they arent really looking for a submissive partnership, but rather dynamic where they simply receive (similar to the fantasies Ive described above). They dont submit in any sense beyond allowing their bodies to receive pleasure or stimuli by a Dominant person (which is cool if youre into that dynamic, whether it be giving or receiving (no judgement). I am looking for something more interactive, something with more give and take. Granted, I believe our perceptions are always changing at various speeds, I feel that if I had to define myself as a dominant, I would define it as a person who guides and gives stage for the sexuality of my submissive partner, while enjoying the attention and affection of that partner. I have a few kinks Id like to still get more into, most of which involve group play or swinging (Ive been to YCP a couple times and would *love* to find a consistent partner). Id just really love to find someone who is as much a (lovable) pervert as I am, and is generally interested in helping one another fulfill some fantasies. Hard limits for me, which are just as important as the things that turn us on, would be... Extreme violence/force Brats Resistance Needles &amp; Knives Blood, Scat, Urine DD/lg For me, choice is sexy. So anything that celebrates our choices is super arousing, thus things that sort of (either through theater or reality) conflict with the idea that were choosing to do what were doing are a turn off (with a couple of exceptions). Relationship wise, Ive been in quite a few short-term D/s relationships for exploration, and a couple of long term semi-kinky/vanilla relationships. I notice, sexually, that its a challenge for me to receive (trust issues), and that I consistently seem to be the one dictating the tone and pace (always initiating, the only one with fantasies or scenarios I want to do (or at least the only one sharing that I have fantasies) and its exhausting and disenfranchising. It takes vulnerability to open up and share any side of ones self, let alone something more intimate/private like your sexual one. To always initiate, to always go lets try this or that and be the only one doing it... even with partners who were up for it, I found there was a loneliness to that... So someone with their own fantasies and identity is huge to me. Still reading? Or even finding yourself really into all of this? Then let me wrap it all up with what Im hoping for/open to. Let me preface this with the disclaimer that I try not to have any expectations as I feel like those can be limiting for people and things, at the same time boundaries (like consent, and/or communication) are... expected (or more accurately put, required). Id love to find someone who wants to make sexual exploration, and exploration of our fantasies a main activity, on top of sharing meals, walks, time, conversation, and helping each other grow to become more of what we want (unconditionally loving, accepting, content people able to experience life without attachment or judgement (at least thats what Im going for). I live in River North (as previously mentioned) in Chicago and can host. I ask you just be of healthy mind and body, kind, passionate, loving, vulnerable and honest with yourself (so that you can also be those things with me). Should you arrive here with the desire to reach out... Im flattered. Id ask that you send me a message with more substance than a hi or hey. Tell me a bit about yourself, include some kind of photo, and **why you felt compelled to message me, what struck a chord most with you.** If it feels right well chat, if not Ill certainly let you know with a polite I dont think wed be a match. Should you creep my history and the dirty talk guide I wrote helps you (youre welcome! (ironically, I get more thank you notes for the guide than I do actual hi, Im interested messages). I am very much a heterosexual male and not interested in other males. I am open to other couples so long as theres honesty and openness (and its cool that I am hetero). Im not looking for online play so if you dont live in Chicago, or if you arent here *very* often... Well I think that about wraps it up. I hope you enjoyed and I wish you all the best in whatever youre doing, especially during this turbulent times."

Hello. Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I am a bisexual 25 year old female. I have been into D/S for as long as I can remember. There is no kink that will shock or surprise me. I am looking for submissives between the ages of 18-26. I absolutely love inexperienced and shy subs, they're adorable to me. I prefer my submissives to be younger than me, however I will consider older subs up to the age of 35 if they can prove they're worthy. I am looking for LONG TERM relationships, I have no interest in hook ups or one timers. I would describe myself as a sadist first, a dominant second. I enjoy teasing people, hurting them, fucking with their minds and playing with them like little toys. I enjoy inflicting pain, both physically and mentally. I am not a switch. I am very bossy and I enjoy being in charge at all times. I enjoy molding subs into my obedient little pets. I want my subs to be obsessed with me and need me. I want to be on their mind all the time. I love giving rules, and doling out discipline and punishments. While I love the sexual nature of it all, I also believe D/S extends far beyond sexuality. In fact I think some of the hottest D/S is non-sexual. I enjoy intense sadism, tears and bringing out vulnerability. I love turning submissives into a helpless little mess. That being said, I have a gentle side as well. I love affection, kisses, cuddles, making you feel safe and cared for. While I can be incredibly sadistic, I am also a very empathetic person. I like to help broken people. I like to show them it's ok to be themselves, and show them they can be accepted for who they are. I don't care how weird or fucked up you feel, Mistress will never judge you. I require my submissives to be respectful, obedient, and honest. Honesty is the most important requirement though, you will not lie or hide things from Mistress, ever. I don't care how embarrassing or difficult it is for you. Lying is one thing I will NOT tolerate. I prefer to be addressed by title at all times. My favorites are Mistress, Mommy, or Goddess. However I don't require this until we have something established. **I am married. My husband is also bisexual, and a dominant leaning switch. I strongly prefer bi-sexual submissives, as I enjoy involving my husband and I absolutely love when people submit to both of us.** At a bare minimum, you will be subservient to him and address him as Sir, so you must be ok with this type of dynamic. Want a response? The best way to do so would be to include a picture in your first message. Attraction is very important to me, and I have many types. Outside of kink, I enjoy fitness. I workout almost daily. Would love a sub I could workout with. I love hiking, camping, skiing, and cooking."

I start with this image because I am convinced that a functioning bdsm relationship requires the same as any other relationship in which both partners desire closeness and intimacy: language, communication, listening, and entrusting yourself to the other. Kink lists do nothing for me. These days, I am not sure if it makes sense to ever hope for a genuine partnership again; but I do know I would want and need it to involve an emotional and intellectual connection. Of course, the physical too; but it's meaningless without said connection.

The loneliness is sharp and palpable, but the hope that things will work out is waning with every day that passes. Searching for BDSM partners on Reddit is honestly one of the most painful things Ive been through in my adult life. I've been using bdsmpersonals to engage in D/s dynamics for the past 11 months and it has left me feeling gutted and even more alone than before I started. I've been used, left, ghosted, rejected, and as a result, my self worth is shattered. I can't explain how many times I've said, ""Okay. I understand."" only to mean ""Okay, I understand that I'm not enough to make you stay. I understand that I'm not your priority and I never was."" How many ""Doms"" on here are actually just abusers? How many people promise that they're looking for connection, only to request explicit pictures and dole out tasks within 48 hours? They all want to possess me completely, to own every aspect of my mind, to exploit my vulnerability for their limited attention span, while giving nothing in return. And there's no pattern; it's been men, women, younger, older, nearby, and across the ocean. Someone told me once that this is just the game - that sifting through people on Reddit is common and most interactions are disappointments. But it's worse than that, I think. I wonder if weve created a space where anonymity serves to shield countless transgressions. I've known I was submissive since I was 15. I acknowledge and celebrate that part of myself, but I crave companionship. I crave a Dominant to guide my mind, command my body, cherish my heart, and treasure my submission. But I'm only interested in doing this safely and genuinely. I am constantly told that I'm ""not submissive"" when I stand up for safety, fairness, and honesty. To vouch for myself, to say ""no,"" is seen as disobedient. It hurts. I feel lost in this wide world and maintaining softness and sensitivity feels impossible. If you have any energy to spare today, any comforting words, or anything you think could help, please reach out. TL;DR? Okay. I understand.

81,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,48 [M4F] Looking for my Online Puddin',1,hfvsrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/hfvsrm/48_m4f_looking_for_my_online_puddin/,2020-06-26 08:37:40,"Hello there. I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. Eventually I would like to move to an in person meetup and see where things go from there. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC games or paint 40k minis until all hours. - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that.

82,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"28[M4F] The most meaningful part of being a Dominant is using the power she gives you to lift her up. I'm looking to create a 24/7 dynamic focused on mentorship and self-improvement. I'm going to guide and push you toward your best, in both service and life. (open to long distance in US and Canada)",1,hfwvz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/hfwvz4/28m4f_the_most_meaningful_part_of_being_a/,2020-06-26 09:44:25,"**Introduction** I strongly believe that the highest function of D/s is as a tool to build someone up. To give them the support, companionship, motivation, structure and accountability necessary to manifest positive change in their life. **What brings me here:** I'm a 28 year old professional blessed with a stable but modest income earned by doing meaningful work that makes a difference in my community. I have been further blessed in the creation of healthy relationships with friends and family, and a steady motivation to further improve myself and work on new goals. I've found a place of peace and contentment that I want to share with someone who needs it. Those who have been under me describe me as a caretaker, some have even asked if I'm a therapist (I'm not). My role could also be compared to a life coach. But, I'm not here because I'm better than you or more accomplished than you or even have this life better figured out. I'm here because I've failed, because I've taken hard falls and have made many wrong turns. In the most perilous moments, with the help from others, I've discovered tools within myself that have led to real change. The most important of which is an acceptance of myself and a belief in my strength and capability to overcome any obstacle and grow from my failures. **This is the truth that will lie at the core of our dynamic:** You are intelligent. You are creative. You are capable. You are strong. You have the power to create what you want in life. You are of great worth and you deserve meaning and happiness. I don't need you to feel those things right now - a large part of your training will be about accepting those truths and introducing them to your life - but I need you to be open to them. This dynamic is about taking action in your life that serves you. To re-orient your life where the decisions you make allow you to feel healthier, to have well-being, to grow, improve and accomplish your goals. **What we will create:** * Well work on changing your thoughts, the stories you tell yourself, the narratives that are keeping you trapped. * Well identify your goals, short-term and long-term, identify what is important to you, and develop a plan to get you there. * Well change your routine. Create a disciplined regimented environment for you to thrive in.Well transform your lifestyle to one that is healthy, a nutritious diet, and regular exercise schedule, daily meditations. * In all of this, you will find that you are no longer alone. Youll have an owner. An owner to make proud. An owner to represent. An owner who will encourage you and always push you forward. An owner who will hold you accountable with whatever severity is necessary. Most importantly, above anything else, you are going to feel pride within yourself. **What you will invest:** This is not free. You will pay me daily with your body, your mind and your service. With your obedience and your submission. You will be entirely stripped and exposed, physically and mentally, and within that environment of true vulnerability and commitment, we will create the catalyst you need to start creating the life that you deserve. **A final word** Let me take this moment to stress that the most important element in this is not me, it is you. This depends on the kind of commitment, energy and openness you create in yourself. If you come to me out of simple curiosity or because this sounds interesting and it'll help pass the days, you're probably not going to get a lot out of this. But if you come to me with a determination and a fire - no matter how small - that you are ready to build a new life for yourself, a new way of being - then the day you message me will be the beginning of a journey we will eventually look back on with gratitude. I'm here at the start, waiting for you to join me."

Thats proven much harder to explain than it has ever seemed in my head. Suffice it to say, there is a great cavernous depth of beautiful filth to be explored when the right person comes along and hopefully brings a flashlight. The fun stuff can, and will, come later; Im far more interested in connecting on a normal human being level first. And as someone who just is dominant, I know that my complement just is submissive (and yes, Ive spent plenty of years questioning and challenging that with unsurprisingly little success and am not terribly interested in repeating those performances). Someone who simply breathes it, understands it so natively its sometimes hard to put into words, needs it so deeply she has likely gone without it for such a terribly long time just to be absolutely sure it will be right when she finds it. Someone who knows and needs the same terrifying depths of trust and vulnerability and love that I have always known Ive needed. Some of my kinks include bondage, spanking, ice/wax, deep throating, dp, anal, gags, pain, pussy torture/spanking, nipple play, orgasm control/denial/edging, humiliation, and hidden public. Do you think you fit the bill? I'd love to hear from you if so."

The loneliness is sharp and palpable, but the hope that things will work out is waning with every day that passes. Searching for BDSM partners on Reddit is honestly one of the most painful things Ive been through in my adult life. I've been using reddit to engage in D/s dynamics for the past 11 months and it has left me feeling gutted and even more alone than before I started. I've been used, left, ghosted, rejected, and as a result, my self worth is shattered. I can't explain how many times I've said, ""Okay. I understand."" only to mean ""Okay, I understand that I'm not enough to make you stay. I understand that I'm not your priority and I never was."" How many ""Doms"" on here are actually just abusers? How many people promise that they're looking for connection, only to request explicit pictures and dole out tasks within 48 hours? They all want to possess me completely, to own every aspect of my mind, to exploit my vulnerability for their limited attention span, while giving nothing in return. And there's no pattern; it's been men, women, younger, older, nearby, and across the ocean. Someone told me once that this is just the game - that sifting through people on Reddit is common and most interactions are disappointments. But it's worse than that, I think. I wonder if weve created a space where anonymity serves to shield countless transgressions. I've known I was submissive since I was 15. I acknowledge and celebrate that part of myself, but I crave companionship. I crave a Dominant to guide my mind, command my body, cherish my heart, and treasure my submission. But I'm only interested in doing this safely and genuinely. I am constantly told that I'm ""not submissive"" when I stand up for safety, fairness, and honesty. To vouch for myself, to say ""no,"" is seen as disobedient. It hurts. I feel lost in this wide world and maintaining softness and sensitivity feels impossible.

I have a pretty good job and spend a lot of my free time either exercising in some form, studying whatever catches my interest (typically psychology and philosophy-oriented), or working on a personal project.

To be specific, this is how I prefer to characterize my dynamic between myself and a submissive partner - Employer/Boss and secretary who is owned by the one she works for. [I also prefer to couch the terms of this dynamic within the context of Ownership &amp; Possession](URL (O&amp;P), as I prefer them over *slavery* and *enslavement*, and I do not typically use the words ""submissive"" or ""Dominant"" as nouns as some choose to do. In addition to that, I also happen to believe in the principles outlined in the linked page (if that wasn't already clear). The etymology of the word is an apt one for this dynamic I believe. It does not just mean a simple clerk or a notary, but more succinctly denotes a ""person entrusted with secrets"". A *confidant*. Hence *secret*ary. This has two meanings in the context of a relationship like this, at least to me, in that not only would this woman be entrusted with my secrets, but she would *be* my secret possession - her own nature and dignity as a submissive woman, her secrets and her well being kept hidden and safe by me. And in order to so, I would necessarily have to be entrusted with her, and everything she is as a woman. Thus the ownership aspect, and yet in my eyes it is *a truly mutual and reciprocal relationship like no other*. In addition to that, I feel it is the proper kind of relationship for a man and woman inducted into a total exchange of power between each other. The position calls for a well-behaved, respectful, obedient and diligent woman to fulfill certain secretarial duties and who both needs companionship and seeks to provide it. If you feel you are lacking in a few or all of these areas, do not be discouraged from applying. All lapses in judgement and inability to fulfill your secretarial duties will be met with the swift and firm application of the appropriate disciplinary procedures, typically involving the use of a hard wooden paddle and the inducing of tears. All punishments are intended to induce *transformational discipline*, that is, discipline intended to transform a lapsed secretary into a secretary cleansed of bad behavior. Desired attributes of a prospective secretarial candidate: * Intellectual/sapiosexual * Warm, elegant personality (for charming acquaintances and associates and representing Us in the best possible light) * Dresses femininely (pencil skirts, short dresses, heels, hosiery, the works, etc. - these can be provided as necessary) * In need of companionship and a deep connection with someone who is her Owner * In need of a more blissful domestic life filled with sensuality, passion, grace, elegance, caring and all the finer things in life for a smart, well-bred woman - all reinforced with a structured amount of discipline and punishment of course * Desires self-improvement and mutual understanding with someone she earnestly respects * Hungers for a lifestyle out of the norm from contemporary society, and arguably more enriching and fulfilling than others * Enjoys and celebrates the symbiosis between Male Authority and feminine deference * Enjoys the feeling of restraints binding her wrists, delightful warmth and exquisite pain being applied to her bare bottom, her orgasms denied (or forced again and again alternatively), and a Man's lips wrapped around hers * Becomes wet from uttering the word ""Sir"" * Heart melts when uttering the word ""Sir"" (alternatively) If this sounds like you, do not hesitate to apply. Let's schedule two separate interviews if that is indeed the case, shall we? One between you and I over dinner, and another between your bare bottom and my paddle over my desk... Now that we have the formalities out of the way, let me introduce who I am more thoroughly. I am someone who has long possessed a different kind of taste in the type of women I like to sink my teeth into. I've been in the military since I left home, pursuing higher education and training for a particular career at the moment, and in need of a submissive woman who I can bring along for the amazing future I have mapped out ahead for me and for the world. To put it more roughly and less precise than that long ad you just read, I am in need of a 1950/1960s-style TPE relationship. I want to exude masculinity and fiery romantic dominance with you, and I want you to exude femininity and beautifully sweet deference/acquiescence in kind. I want to mend you if you're hurt, mold you like clay into the kind of woman you've always longed to be (if needed), and improve my own life by sharing it with another soul (and protecting it in times of vulnerability). I am 5""11, average build, black hair, dark eyes, white, and I am told I have an equally soothing and yet enrapturing voice capable of activating a woman's most erogenous zone. In addition to that my hands and the fingers upon them are quite dexterous and skilled in a number of hobbies. I am seeking a LDR at first and commitment/living together under one roof eventually if we're certain about the path we want to take. I look forward to conversing with you. Your photo gets mine. Stay safe during this crisis. -Nite"

91,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"26 [M4F] A journey of a subs discovery [Melbourne, Australia] [Online]",1,gjct4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/gjct4t/26_m4f_a_journey_of_a_subs_discovery_melbourne/,2020-05-14 11:45:21,"Hi reddit! Preemptive apologies for the long post! This year I have really focused on figuring out what makes me who I am. It's been an incredible journey - one that has filled me with self confidence, while pushing me to become a far more open minded and less judgemental person. Being more self-assured has helped me embrace thoughts and feelings that I had previously thought ""no, that's wrong and society will judge me"" and instead treat them (and in turn myself) with kindness. One of those thoughts is about submissiveness. I am a rather tall, broad and athletic guy (6'1, 83kg, gym 4x a week pre covid). I come across as rather thuggish due to my figure and hair situation (trimmed beard, shaved head, kinda RBF), and historically I've been put in the position with previous partners where I (to quote) *have to be the dom.* That... never sat well. Despite my appearance and history, I have always felt like a teddy bear. In hindsight, I should've communicated these feelings but felt pressured into having to be the ""hard"" dom. Now I've realised what I truly desire. Who I am in all senses (emotionally, romantically, sexually). I just want kind, patient, caring, loving, affectionate, and the like, but from a submissive position. I am seeking that connection with someone that we can bond together and explore the wonderful world of dom/sub relations. Someone who can take the lead and that is deserving of being treated like a queen. Someone who doesn't treat dom/sub as a way to get power over another individual, but rather treats their opposite half as equal. To empower each other from different positions. To share the goings on in life with and be able to show emotional vulnerability. And so on. I dislike the idea of writing a ""personals resume"" so I'll keep the about me part short and sweet. I'm fairly self driven and motivated to be the best me possible. I love to please others around me, sometimes too much. I absolutely love goals and continually set better ones to grow, be that in my profession, hobbies, and any other aspect of my life. I am huge on coffee (classic Melbournian coffee snob), soccer, gym, board games, video games, d&amp;d, and much like everyone else lately, cooking and baking! I'm an open book / cards on the table kind of guy. I'll call a spade a spade, without trying to be an ass about it. As far as being a sub goes, I am into a *lot* of things. Face sitting, worship, pegging &amp; anal play, teasing &amp; edging, bondage &amp; restraints, exhibitionism, voyeurism, forced bi, wearing lingerie, honestly everything that's pretty much short of sounding and most fluid play I am into. I'll always be open to trying new experiences at least once! In an ideal world, we're relatively local, however I am open to giving things a go online provided we click! If you made it down here, I appreciate you giving this a read! If it's down your alley, flick me a message and lets get chatting! If not but you still want to talk to someone because lets face it, the pandemic has put a huge strain on us socially, shoot me a message anyway! :) tl;dr: open-minded masc guy just wants to be a teddy bear / wants to feel cute and affectionate / be emotionally vulnerable."

A little about me: A 27-year-old (***disabled medical marijuana patient***) working professional. (***I*** ***do have an irl partner, and yes he knows I'm here. If that's going to be any kind of issue, please don't bother messaging me.***) My hobbies include cooking, baking, reading, hiking, gardening, and biking. My favorite color is purple. I have an INFP (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Prospecting) personality. ***For me, emotional intimacy must occur before physical or sexual intimacy is possible.*** In little space, I feel about 6 years old. While in little space, I enjoy hot cocoa with marshmallows, coloring or painting, going for bike rides, baking, and watching Disney movies. I am looking for a 30+ year old ***English*** speaking Daddy ***in the US***, preferably on EST for an ***online only dynamic***. Someone curious and talkative and funny. I know online dynamics aren't many people's cup of tea, but I have found them rewarding in the past. I enjoy the opportunity for vulnerability that this type of dynamic allows when employing something like writing assignments or journaling. My ideal Daddy would be interested in helping me grow and blossom into my best (and submissive) self while allowing me the opportunity to serve him. We would be in daily communication (ideally over email, text, or snapchat). My kink interests broadly include behavior modification and accountability as well as obedience training. I am curious about bathroom use control, mental bondage, and verbal humiliation and degradation (to some extent). My ***hard limits*** include: blood, knife, or needle play, diapers, and watersports. Now, it is important to note that while I understand that a major part of the underlying foundation of BDSM is sex and sexuality that doesn't mean I want to discuss all those intimate details within our first three messages. ***Building a dynamic takes time.*** If you decide to message me, tell me something about yourself. Maybe something that you'd **not** normally tell when first meeting someone. (Please, not something creepy.)"

Meet Hank, Hector, and Harvey. Each element describes fairly distinctive part of my personality. *(Although I swear I dont have split personality disorder)* &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Meet Hank the** ***Teddy Bear.*** Youll know the type of men Im describing. Towering men of power, that look like they cant hurt a fly. Gentle, caring, quirky, and funny. (Thats right ladies, a fucking Oxford Comma!)  Hank will always know how youre doing, even before you tell him. Hell know when youve conquered your day at work, and hell know when youre upset. Hell worry about you until you let him cheer you up. Hank likes flirty conversations, being affectionate, and is a complete whore for cuddles. Laugh at Hanks jokes, its his big weakness. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Hector, the** ***Broken.*** Youll know the type of men Im describing. Men that are a little broken, a little beaten down. Men that usually hide this part of their personality (often, not as well as they think). Hector has good days and bad bays. On good days, Hector will go for long walks on the beach with you, watch sunsets, and paint your nails. On bad days, Hector just wants you to be patient with him. He doesnt want you to try and solve things (really, hes thought of everything), he just wants you around. He wants you to make conversation, and care just a little. Random-ass kisses help too. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Harvey, the** ***Kinky.*** Youll know the type of men Im describing. Men that pride themselves on being good at reading others, and situations. Men that are intelligent, measured, and dominant. Harvey will earn your trust, your vulnerability, and your submission. Hell be the happiest man in the world, when your toes are curled, and your fingers are grasping at the sheets in sweet agony. Tell Harvey about that kink you always wanted to explore, or that fantasy you cant seem to get out of your head. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; If youre still here, and theres a smile on your face you cant quite explain, please know that I am over the moon. I love making people smile and laugh. Also, if you are smiling at this (and arent screaming in horror?) maybe youre exactly what Im looking for. Maybe you have your self-ambivalence youd like to tell me about?  If you do decide to message me, I should be upfront about my love for voices and by extension, voice calls.

To give them the support, companionship, motivation, structure and accountability necessary to manifest positive change in their life. **What brings me here:** I'm a 28 year old professional blessed with a stable but modest income earned by doing meaningful work that makes a difference in my community. I have been further blessed in the creation of healthy relationships with friends and family, and a steady motivation to further improve myself and work on new goals. I've found a place of peace and contentment that I want to share with someone who needs it. Those who have been under me describe me as a caretaker, some have even asked if I'm a therapist (I'm not). My role could also be compared to a life coach. But, I'm not here because I'm better than you or more accomplished than you or even have this life better figured out. I'm here because I've failed, because I've taken hard falls and have made many wrong turns. In the most perilous moments, with the help from others, I've discovered tools within myself that have led to real change. The most important of which is an acceptance of myself and a belief in my strength and capability to overcome any obstacle and grow from my failures. **This is the truth that will lie at the core of our dynamic:** You are intelligent. You are creative. You are capable. You are strong. You have the power to create what you want in life. You are of great worth and you deserve meaning and happiness. I don't need you to feel those things right now - a large part of your training will be about accepting those truths and introducing them to your life - but I need you to be open to them. This dynamic is about taking action in your life that serves you. To re-orient your life where the decisions you make allow you to feel healthier, to have well-being, to grow, improve and accomplish your goals. **What we will create:** * Well work on changing your thoughts, the stories you tell yourself, the narratives that are keeping you trapped. * Well identify your goals, short-term and long-term, identify what is important to you, and develop a plan to get you there. * Well change your routine. Create a disciplined regimented environment for you to thrive in. * Well transform your lifestyle to one that is healthy, a nutritious diet, and regular exercise schedule, daily meditations. * In all of this, you will find that you are no longer alone. Youll have an owner. An owner to make proud. An owner to represent. An owner who will encourage you and always push you forward. An owner who will hold you accountable with whatever severity is necessary. * Most importantly, above anything else, you are going to feel pride within yourself. **What you will invest:** This is not free. You will pay me daily with your body, your mind and your service. With your obedience and your submission. You will be entirely stripped and exposed, physically and mentally, and within that environment of true vulnerability and commitment, we will create the catalyst you need to start creating the life that you deserve. **A final word** Let me take this moment to stress that the most important element in this is not me, it is you. This depends on the kind of commitment, energy and openness you create in yourself. If you come to me out of simple curiosity or because this sounds interesting and it'll help pass the days, you're probably not going to get a lot out of this. But if you come to me with a determination and a fire - no matter how small - that you are ready to build a new life for yourself, a new way of being - then the day you message me will be the beginning of a journey we will eventually look back on with gratitude. I'm here at the start, waiting for you to join me."

I start with this image because I am convinced that a functioning bdsm relationship requires the same as any other relationship in which both partners desire closeness and intimacy: language, communication, listening, and entrusting yourself to the other. Kink lists do nothing for me. These days, I am not sure if it makes sense to ever hope for a genuine partnership again; but I do know I would want and need it to involve an emotional and intellectual connection. Of course, the physical too; but it's meaningless without said connection. And connections are not magically found; they are developed, and require patience, honesty, care, and the willingness to be vulnerable. Vulnerability requires taking a risk; if you might be willing to take one with me, please reach out. Me: tall wm, 6'4"", in writing/teaching, passionate about reading, literature, art, and film. Honest, nurturing and giving. Single father. Just to be upfront. You: over 35. Local, in the DMV area, possibly PA.

I am Andrew and I'm an older Dom seeking a new online relationship. Newly returned to Reddit, following a break and then some frustrating experiences on Fetlife. Happy to make friends and chat to people, but what I crave above all is a connection with someone who has the same need to express this part of themselves in ways that are genuine, honest, but discrete and integrated into what is probably a busy and complex life. So you will probably be more mature, hence the 40+ suggestion in the title (happy to consider younger, but in my experience the age gap doesn't always contribute to mutual understanding). I am a sensual Dominant, given to forms of exploration that emphasise emotional and intellectual compatibility. This means that we would share not only the life we create online, but allow each other into the rest of life as comfort and discretion allow. I want and look to be a friend, as well as a Dominant. I have lots of experience, but prefer not to set out some kind of template as to what a dynamic must look like, or what i expect a submissive to live up to. That gets created out of the ebb and flow of our conversation. In more recent years I have found that where there is trust and mutual vulnerability it provides the foundation for exploration and play that explores some of the darker recesses of thought and desire. I want someone whose hand I can take, and lead, and guide. Control and the delicious nuances of power exchange make me feel more alive. You should want, perhaps need, the same, and feel that ache somewhere deep inside. Come and say hi, and let't chat. Location, looks, and other circumstances are all secondary."

I'm a 28-year-old girl who happens to be subby and looks like [this](URL (Asian, 5'3"", actually wears dresses more often than pants). While I'm naturally sexually submissive and would love to surrender myself to someone who is naturally sexually dominant, my feelings of sexual arousal are indelibly intertwined with romantic interest and will never be more important to me than finding a compatible person to laugh with and care about deeply. Hopefully he'll pass the [Traffic Test](URL and maybe also want to pull over and spank me for distracting him by saying suggestive things in my cutesy voice...buuut only if he also lets me be myself and make my own decisions. Not exactly easy to explain or find on ""normal"" dating sites! &amp;#x200B; Stuff that tends to matter: * I'm generally attracted to men closer to my age (27-38) who are health-conscious and non-smokers. (I don't like feeling way younger or less experienced than my partner in real life, and I'm not into micromanaging or one-sided shaping/molding. I'd much prefer to grow together.) * I'm happy to swap face photos and video chat if there's mutual interest! (Sorry, not into deliberate anonymous chatting. Even the most enticing written messages can be inaccurate indicators of overall chemistry.) * I'm romantically monogamous and find a relationship most compelling when it involves being deeply in love with one person. Consequently, I'm only interested in dating someone with a similar tendency to pair-bond without being overly dogmatic or jealous about it. * I want kids someday (not necessarily soon) and find it pretty sexy when my partner feels similarly. * I'm located in Northern California. Proximity makes things easier in the short-term (pandemic notwithstanding), but if nothing else in this post gives you pause, please don't let distance deter you from saying hi. (We're all stuck inside for a while anyway!) * My ideal partner is socially liberal and egalitarian, and values heeding scientific evidence. &amp;#x200B; Personality-wise, I'm pretty animated and naturally gravitate toward a calmer partner -- preferably one who would boop my lil button nose after I jumped into his lap! I'm especially attracted to affectionate men who are kind, open-minded, and intuitive, while also being rational and creative problem-solvers. I'm excited by a shared love of physical touch, being extremely silly together, and having enrapturing conversations that make hours pass by in the blink of an eye. Let's talk about everything in an endless web of ideas and topics that branch out from any given starting point, get existential, go on a scenic hike, try new things and visit new places, play board games, and aspire to make each other laugh so hard that we cry (like I did at [this gallery](URL I grew up with music (starting with violin at age 4) and would love an enthusiastic companion for events like symphonies, ballets, operas, musicals, and jazz performances. And if it's up your alley, I'd also love to sing and make music together! &amp;#x200B; Ideally, my partner *could* remind me that I ""belong"" to him with a single deliberate glance when the mood strikes, but everyday interaction and conversation would not be overly focused on contrived attempts to insert the dynamic, and my partner would like to communicate with me as an intellectual and decision-making equal. I love an abundance of texting, flirting, teasing, touching, and times that we melt into each other and feel the world fall away. But hopefully this would all be predicated on organically occurring feelings of vulnerability and trust, not play-acting. I love doing nice things for a partner, but that's driven by relatively normal/vanilla-romantic motivations, not a penchant for fetishized servitude. &amp;#x200B; The sexy stuff: I'm psychologically submissive, playfully cutesy/bratty (only lightly resistant), and into being lovingly teased (verbally and physically) and patronized. I don't want to be worthless; I want to be *yours* \-- your very good little girl. I find it deeply erotic to surrender myself to someone I love and trust, so completely that I would do anything for him, while knowing he would wield this power over me responsibly. It's not about individual physical kinks, though those can be great tools to reinforce the psychological dynamic. Yes: D/s, DD/lg (cutesiness and feigned innocence, not coloring books or pacifiers), disobedience and spankings, patronizing/demeaning questions and dirty talk, collars, cathartic tears, aftercare and cuddling, choking (blood choke), light bondage (don't need it if you're not into it, but also open to more if you are) No: M/s, TPE, 24/7, sadism/extreme pain (I'm not a masochist and this doesn't turn me on :( ), lasting physical damage (temporary marks like incidental bruises and redness are fine), puke, watersports, scat (or mouth-to-bottom contact), extreme butt stuff, adult baby activities (e.g. diapering) &amp;#x200B; Please PM (not IM) me if you think we might be compatible! Would be helpful to include age, location, a bit about both your vanilla and kinky sides, and photos if you're comfortable with that. Bonus points for a link to an OKCupid account (I'll reciprocate) or longform writing. &amp;#x200B; If this post is still up, I haven't found my forever person yet. Thank you for reading!"

Make no mistake though, I want (and need) to truly feel dominated. I need to be spanked, controlled, and put in my place. I need to be told no and what to do, but I also need to be praised and cared for generously. I need someone strong and strict but who also has a soft touch and is empathetic. I'm a sensitive type after all, even if I have a smart mouth at times ;) My kinks are varied, but I'm not into scat, extreme pain, face fucking or degradation. I'm preferably looking for someone older than me. Someone who wants to get to know me, who wants me to submit not just for the sake of it but because they want to enjoy a meaningful bond with me. In return I will do my absolute best to learn about you, what you want and need, what pleases you, what I can do for you to add joy and pleasure to your life. When I feel cared for I have an extremely strong desire to please and satisfy my Dom. If this speaks to you, send me a DM and let's chat :) I'd love to know more about you, your interests, what you're looking for in relationship and life, etc."
102,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"28[M4F] I'm a Dominant, disciplinarian, mentor and coach and I want to help you create the life that you deserve (long-distance)",1,gq1oa8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/gq1oa8/28m4f_im_a_dominant_disciplinarian_mentor_and/,2020-05-25 11:23:49,"**Introduction** I strongly believe that the highest function of D/s is as a tool to build someone up. To give them the support, companionship, motivation, structure and accountability necessary to manifest positive change in their life. **What brings me here:** I'm a 28 year old professional blessed with a stable but modest income earned by doing meaningful work that makes a difference in my community. I have been further blessed in the creation of healthy relationships with friends and family, and a steady motivation to further improve myself and work on new goals. I've found a place of peace and contentment that I want to share with someone who needs it. Those who have been under me describe me as a caretaker, some have even asked if I'm a therapist (I'm not). My role could also be compared to a life coach. But, I'm not here because I'm better than you or more accomplished than you or even have this life better figured out. I'm here because I've failed, because I've taken hard falls and have made many wrong turns. In the most perilous moments, with the help from others, I've discovered tools within myself that have led to real change. The most important of which is an acceptance of myself and a belief in my strength and capability to overcome any obstacle and grow from my failures. **This is the truth that will lie at the core of our dynamic:** You are intelligent. You are creative. You are capable. You are strong. You have the power to create what you want in life. You are of great worth and you deserve meaning and happiness. I don't need you to feel those things right now - a large part of your training will be about accepting those truths and introducing them to your life - but I need you to be open to them. This dynamic is about taking action in your life that serves you. To re-orient your life where the decisions you make allow you to feel healthier, to have well-being, to grow, improve and accomplish your goals. **What we will create:** * Well work on changing your thoughts, the stories you tell yourself, the narratives that are keeping you trapped. * Well identify your goals, short-term and long-term, identify what is important to you, and develop a plan to get you there. * Well change your routine. Create a disciplined regimented environment for you to thrive in. * Well transform your lifestyle to one that is healthy, a nutritious diet, and regular exercise schedule, daily meditations. * In all of this, you will find that you are no longer alone. Youll have an owner. An owner to make proud. An owner to represent. An owner who will encourage you and always push you forward. An owner who will hold you accountable with whatever severity is necessary. Most importantly, above anything else, you are going to feel pride within yourself. **What you will invest:** This is not free. You will pay me daily with your body, your mind and your service. With your obedience and your submission. You will be entirely stripped and exposed, physically and mentally, and within that environment of true vulnerability and commitment, we will create the catalyst you need to start creating the life that you deserve. **A final word** Let me take this moment to stress that the most important element in this is not me, it is you. This depends on the kind of commitment, energy and openness you create in yourself. If you come to me out of simple curiosity or because this sounds interesting and it'll help pass the days, you're probably not going to get a lot out of this. But if you come to me with a determination and a fire - no matter how small - that you are ready to build a new life for yourself, a new way of being - then the day you message me will be the beginning of a journey we will eventually look back on with gratitude. I'm here at the start, waiting for you to join me."

You leave me alone in your room to change into something more comfortable, and take a little too long. Your computer, phone, and all your passwords are carelessly left out. Some bad man could take advantage and thats exactly what Im going to do. Your sexting, your photos, your browser history, porn habits, the outtakes of your nudes you lie and say you don't have, access to profiles and correspondence on all the dating sites, emails, your drafts folder, Reddit throwaway accounts, just your entire fucking life on a platter to be used against you by a perv who knows exactly what you like and how you like it. Owned by someone who will know everything about you. Maybe it starts innocently enough like a lot of dates, with the added incentive of letting your guard down post-covid lockdown. You feel overly comfortable, things progress a little too quickly but you go with it and invite me for another drink at your place. Youre unsure if youre into me, and can't read me for shit, but since you figure youll never see me again, you confess that youre a little buzzed, and the conversation earlier got to you in a good way. Its on. You like what happens more than you expect because only a half hour before you were skeptical I was too sweet or too vanilla, but you sensed something darker and got really curious what it would be like. The heated kissing and hair pulling leads to ruined panties, but even if you engaged in a flirtatious conversation about how you would want this whole scene to go down, nothing prepares you for the turn things are about to take. Psychological control plus emotional masochism is a thing. A part of you enjoys being used and pleasuring people, and is very good at doing what youre told. Hearing that voice in your ear - soothing - threatening - coaxing you through the consent implied non-consent play that blurs and feels realish, until youre pathetically grateful for the attention captures you. Somewhere in between Stockholm Syndrom and a friendship with benefits, this freaks you out and makes you pulse at the same time. Desire to belong to someone and have an ongoing private connection you could never tell anyone about combined with mental subspace, not just the physical, makes up a delicious cocktail for you. A creative man who knows how to enjoy you right is often the missing element anyway. I would never boss you around without some intrinsic sexual pleasure attached, or the other kinky feels that are harder to define. Ive come to realize Im talented at affectionate cruelty, though it doesnt match how I see myself. Soft spot for inexperienced folks new to kink and looking for someone to showing them the ropes. Making this on-going adds an extra element. Will I be a consistently checking in on you frequently like the devil on your shoulder, paying you weekly visits to make you pay for the naughtiness I've observed and destroy your pussy? Maybe I'll become that that man with the masterful cock who makes you jump whenever he snaps his fingers? You'll forget if you want to or have to, or where the game begins and ends. I approach everything in life, including kink, with a subtle sense of humor and a deep-seated sense of empathy. It also goes without saying, that although youre in desperate need to release you non-vanilla proclivities, and Im all about making you do the stuff youve been telling those boys on the internet you want, treating you like a sex toy, this is still about a controlled on-going scene that only feels less so at times. The reality is just because you cum from fucked up thoughts doesnt mean you want to live all of it. The consent must always be present or it stops being roleplay. We can tailor this even as you sink deeper and deeper. Youll always have the ability to change your passwords back and regain your privacy at any point. I have the ability to get people to trust me, and Im not one to breach that trust. Knowing I could is hot enough. The goal here is to ruin you in other ways through intense fucking, and your forced compliant servitude with all the layers of fucked up'ness you can think of here."

Im zee (and a bunny and a unicorn and a princess and maybe more). I live in India and while I eventually want an IRL Daddy, thats gonna take a long time to happen in my city, and in the meanwhile, littlespace doesn't feel good without anyone to share it with, so I am looking for a short-to-long term, platonic-ish CG/Babysitter to talk to in littlespace. I am ethically non-monogamous but I want to build a strong, intimate connection. I am not looking for a full DDlg dynamic or daily rules. But if we connect really well, maybe we could explore that and other kinks. I am mostly a non-sexual little, but we can get to some sexual/age-play parts later too. Basically looking for somebody who might find gratification in making a little feel safe and in being adored (and teased) by them. I would love to get to know each others vanilla sides although I am looking for something primarily focused on our exploration of CGl and sharing all the love, affection, intimacy and vulnerability that can exist between a CG and a little. I would like to be able to text you with all my excited little ramblings, share all my made-up worlds and characters (do you know the difference between unicorn land and rainbow land?), tease and be teased back, be kept within lines when i brat, make you proud by being a good girl in vanilla life, watch cartoons with sometimes, and fall asleep with bedtime stories and stuffy cuddles. I am 5ft and smol and cute. Little me is around 3-5. I love cuddles, my stuffies (nelly belly is the softest, made of clouds!), cuddles, sucking my thumb, hot choco in my sippycup, putting stuff in my unicorn littlespace journal, cuddles, all things cute and pink, and cuddles! I can be a bit bratty. I show affection by teasing and I ask for affection by acting spoiled. But I dont brat in order to get punished. Timezone-wise, since I am in India, we would need to find some overlapping time between 8pm-1am and 9-11am IST. Both Europe and US might have this possibility. I would like to eventually move to voice and video calls. I prefer that you be older than me. And that you dont have any partners who would be in the dark about us. Okay now come say hi!

I just record thoughts as they come into my head. And this is how they go: [pardon the pic of me ](URL So Im relatively new to the kink scene. Ok, I am VERY new to the kink scene. I was raised in a religious household that helped demonize the bdsm side of me up until recently and all I gotta say is : i am really liking embracing this part of me :) (tl;dr for this section : Im fresh into the scene) One First thing Ill say is that I value communication above all else. Its rather difficult at times ( I get it I struggle with social anxiety) but I believe it makes things so much easier for both parties involved. I like the idea of the submissive being the one in control but also the dom. Both parties are part of this yin yang relationship to me when a good balanced D/S relationship is found (tl;dr for this section: I like the dynamics of D/S ) When it comes outside of bdsm I am passionate about drawing I am passionate about reading I am passionate about writing I am passionate about music (both making and listening to music ) I do smoke  I like art and anime I fucking love art Im patient with difficult stuff I Meditate (Tl;dr : I am just a passionate person even outside of bdsm ) I am interested in having a powerful life and have ambitions. Im down to help a partner ( whether its just for online fun - a romantic relationship) grow as a person with Me. (Tl;dr for this section : I like healthy relationships ) When it comes to the relationship aspect Well, as I mentioned earlier,I am new . But Im not letting that get in the way of me wanting to have a chill relationship with a sub that we can get to know each other better. Im open to a romantic relationship (tl;dr lets go ) I am open for an online relationship and see where it goes from there I enjoy being in a dominant role and am looking for a girl who finds comfort in being tied up; Or at the very least likes it a bit lol. While I am very into seeing submissives tied, my favorite part by far is the gag. I love the trust, vulnerability, intimacy, etc. this dynamic of having a sub bound and gagged is exhilarating (I hope I spelled that word right) I am still new to this scene so I cant really articulate what Im not into (buts far its : anal, furry, whipping But Im into : feet, choking, spanking, leather,collars, control/denial  If interested in starting something good, DM me.I Hope to start something chill and fun with a cool sub girl who also gets a kick out of being dominated in some way (ages 18 - 29 preferably)"

If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

So you clicked on my personal... yay! Im a 19 year old somewhat newbie seeking a dom in my area. Fetlife is kinda intimidating for me so I thought Id try here. I know quite a bit about BDSM but want more physical experiences. This doesnt always mean sex. I am drawn towards BDSM because of the connection and vulnerability people have and that is what Im looking to accomplish. Please dont dismiss me just because Im young, I really want to learn more explore my kinks with someone and are serious about BDSM. Id first want to establish a connection by talking with you and getting to know you. It would be online at first, since quarantine is in place, but it would eventually move to in person stuff. This would help establish trust before anything occurs. A little bit about me: Im 53 a bit chubby, and have tan skin with medium brown hair. Most people say I look Filipina or Hawaiian when they first see me. As far as kinks go, Id like to explore and expand what I already think I like. I am a sub, more focused on a pet, little, and brat. I also enjoy spanking, edging, and choking. I want to expand my kinks more and learn more, particularly, impact play, Shibari/ bondage, and orgasm control, and exhibitionism. I do have a bit of a cum fetish as well. My hard limits are CNC, electroplay, scat, and no blood. I also dont have a high pain tolerance. As I continue to explore my kinks this is subject to change. Aside from kink, I am very nerdy and shy. I love to play video games (particularly smash bros or Mario kart) and cosplay. I also love to cook and bake and Im a foodie. I also love to dance. Im very sassy and sarcastic as well and have a love for Pokmon. I would ideally like a dom with a lot of experience and not be more than 15 years older than me. As much as I would want a romantic relationship as well, Its okay if that doesnt happen. I look as BDSM more as an art than something sexual. Im looking for some to train and help guide me. A gentle but firm hand. So if you made it to the end then great! Please message me if interested. If you arent interested and are looking for friends, please message me as well. Im always looking for new friends in the BDSM community and maybe we can play switch games online lol."

If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"
112,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,34 [M4F] Mid-Atlantic US - Nothing like contemplating your own mortality to give you a swift kick in the rear and inspire you to start looking for your person again,13,g38gwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/g38gwj/34_m4f_midatlantic_us_nothing_like_contemplating/,2020-04-18 05:14:35,"My grandma called the other day, just to check in and spend a good ten minutes berating me for *still* being single. This is not atypical - she wants great-grandkids and probably secretly thinks Im gay as the last serious relationship shes known about was almost a decade ago - and usually revolves around the points of who gonna take care of you ifa you get sick?, eh, s no good to be alone everybody need a companion, and you getting old, /u/more_cookies, now you gonna have to find a girl who gotta kids and already been married. Please go back and read that in an adorable old Italian ladys accent for immersion. Shes doing well and is safe and healthy, if a bit bored, and I love her dearly. Thanks for asking. Now for the most part Ive simply learned to ignore it - its what grandmas *do*, and you have to understand Italian-American culture is highly critical and happy to point out all of your flaws to heighten insecurities and craft guilt trips around little things until you have complexes around them (great for mental health, I know) - and Im usually good at brushing it off with an I know, Im just busy with school/work/life or an Im just waiting for the right one to come along - both of which are technically true, and both of which are really excuses that Ive grown far too comfortable and tolerant of. I received two other phone calls that day (which is highly unusual, nobody calls me). One telling me that an old and dear family friend was on their death bed and likely not making it through the night, and one telling me that Ive been directly exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Now this is far from unusual in these times as numbers continue to climb towards peaks, and certainly the many millions of people in my old home of Manhattan are simply assuming the same to a far more concerning degree, but hearing the very cold legal-sounding information that I was to stay in strict self-quarantine and monitor myself for symptoms just *hit* me in a way that, perhaps, I needed to be hit. While Im still young and extremely healthy and doing all the right quarantine-y things and not legitimately worried I actually contracted anything - or that Id be in any kind of real danger even if I did - the past few days have served as an unwelcome - but necessary - wake-up call. Because, honestly, Ive been sleeping on the important things in life, stuck in a rut of focusing on my career and building a happy, stable, fulfilling life alone, and letting the insecurities and the what-ifs and the mental spirals of convincing myself I either dont *deserve* nice things or pointing out all the little things that might make me not worth seeking and having as a partner to numb what was once a deep, passionate yearning into a dull voice Ive been trained to push aside. Thanks, grandma. And so after a few days of deep, uncomfortable looks in the mirror, staring out the window into the distance, and mostly sleepless nights of ok, but like *if* Im dead in a few weeks, will I *really* be ok with the life I left? fun thoughts (isnt my anxiety-brain dramatic?), Im choosing to open the long-locked gates of my heart once again, and perhaps entertain some modicum of selfishness in admitting theres maybe more to this life than being safe and alone. Which apparently takes a global pandemic and a faint death threat. Not that I even know or remember how to do that. Its actually caused me to go back and read some [old](URL [posts](URL I wrote years ago - kind of in a letter-to-your-future-self sort of way - and *fuck* thats been a trip, like reading childhood journal entries that somehow only ring more true in the time since they were first composed (though, if youre the curious research-nerd type, Ive amassed some scraggly quarantine facial hair recently so not *all* of it remains relevant). Its all been a strange and sudden reminder of deep-seated truths and a revisiting of glowing embers that were once roaring flames. The danger, I suppose, with complacency is that theres no inherent *need* to escape. A comfortable prison, if you will, that may not offer the highs and lows of the outside world, but that *does* provide a stable safety net against risk and volatility. It would be much easier if the prison cell was dark, moldy, smelly, and horribly uncomfortable - when its roomy, cozy, and warm and your most prominent thought is yeah, I could live like this and be mostly happy you tend not to look for a way out. I have an *amazing* life that Ive worked my butt off to build and am incredibly lucky/fulfilled/satisfied in - dream career, healthy sense of community and value, still in the best shape of my life (minus some quarantine fluff), room to relax a bit and room to grow - a life which Ive crafted solo, and have settled in continuing to conceive of solo. The great comforts of stability, familiarity, and contentment have created an illusory world that inadvertently results in me spending it and leaving it safely and comfortably - and alone. And with recent events bringing that more to the light than ever before, somehow I know *that cant be it*, and somehow I know I need to leave the trappings of my comfy cell and brave the outside world with its harshness and its beauty and its pain and its joys once again. Perhaps this is the fire Ive needed to be lit under my ass for a while. Perhaps, this time, shell be out there. And ready. --- In my almost four cakedays here (do I get an old man trophy yet?) Ive seen *a lot*. Ive met some incredible, beautiful, wonderful, inspirational people (some of whom I still talk to and call friends to this day) - and have come across some ugly, angry, vindictive, misaligned misanthropes and sociopaths. Ive seen *more than* my share of hehe give me punishment ideas for my sub and so I just randomly met this supermodel who happens to be super kinky and wants me to be her dom what do I do posts, as well as deep and thought-provokingly human stories from all walks of life that find a home in the kink community. Ive taken years-long hiatuses and have a rather lengthy but boring history that precedes reddit, and I feel in as good a place as ever to *just be myself* and invite a whole nother human being into whatever this life is and has to offer. Ive made plenty of mistakes and likely hurt plenty of people along the way, but Im told vulnerability is strength and being open with imperfections is human, so Im doing my best to approach this with any armor laid down and any defenses disarmed. I suppose I should start with an outline of what Im talking about (as, clearly, I can *write* when the mood strikes) as its likely not your typical post/search/invitation: - Im looking for my person. My *one* person. My best friend, my complement, my reciprocal, my partner, my one and only lover. For life and for forever. To have, to hold, to open all cavernous depths to and invite in, to embrace terrifying vulnerability with in its many forms, to share countless cuddles, kisses, and orgasms with, to make all the waiting and the worrying and the wondering worthwhile. Someone who I look forward to growing old with, possibly raising a family with, and only falling deeper in love with as we do. - I mostly despise labels, niches, protocol, vocabulary, anything that feels the need to define or categorize or limit peoples freedom to just be themselves. That said, I identify as a d-type but dislike that being packaged with any expectations or connotations of what I must think/like/feel/want/do. Humans are far more complex than strictly defined roles, and I like to think we can be that first and have our proclivities second. I also have zero interest in any local kink community, will never go to a munch or public event, and am extremely private with this side of myself. - Similarly, Im really not interested in kinklists, bdsmtest results, or resumes of rope workshops and flogging classes attended. Humans are not a kink-activity-dispensaries, and I dont believe in relationships that are held together by a mutual-back-scratching balance of checking one anothers fetish boxes on a surface level. While I think the human mind is beautiful in its ability to take unconventional or otherwise bizarre things and find beauty or desire or arousal in them, Id like to think we can all exist as beings transcendent above our enjoyment of being spanked or tied up, and Id like to be approached and known as a whole person (and potentially *your* person) rather than a statistic or a weeding-out exercise. - As an empath and an INF-type, I feel things more than, I think, most people ever do and care deeply about people and their actions. I can be extremely sensitive (think more someone made a snide comment online and its really bothering me and less oh my goodness this random flower is *so beautiful* Im going to get on my knees and cry in the middle of this park) though often compensate for that by turning it off completely and going full stoic-mode (Id like not to do that - its one of many comforts of my current prison cell). I do my best to embrace this kind of vulnerability, and hope for a partner with whom to mutually encourage and celebrate it. - I am anything but whatever stock image of a dominant you may likely be projecting - and am quite happy with that. Im soft-spoken, (mostly) gentle, can be (sometimes slightly) anxious or insecure, try to be considerate and warm and giving to those around me, and have plenty of flaws, weaknesses, and imperfections to pass around. Im not going to bark vapid orders at you with some booming voice or threaten to carry you up the stairs over my shoulder if you misbehave - Id rather sit and talk through our feelings openly and discuss ways to grow closer together through expressive communication. I spent most of my 20s trying to fit the mold before discovering it is absolute horse shit and have no desire to be anyone but myself anymore - which I do my best to make an open book ready for perusing. Im never sure how to postmark the proposition to a potential partner of this proportion, but knowing myself and whats important to me, Id hope she is familiar with the following dichotomies: - Kind, wholesome, and compassionate to all around her - yet willing to shit-talk idiots with me behind their back - Giving, loving, and infinitely warm - yet fastidious and calculating with whom she shares herself - Emotionally, physically, intellectually, and spiritually healthy - yet not unfamiliar with the darker sides of happiness and willing to have a cookie now and again - Personable, presentable, and socially intelligent enough to know how to engage in conversation - yet an unabashed introvert homebody and huge nerd who is loving this quarantine thing and would make a worthy teammate (or opponent) in gaming sessions - Strong, independent, and stable - yet indelibly connected to a deep need to submit and belong to *her* person - Open minded, adventurous, creative, and sexually expressive - yet values purity, monogamy, intimacy, and discernment - An absolutely filthy mind - yet a (mostly) innocent demeanor - Basically, give me the unassuming girl-next-door science/math/book nerd who can cum like a fountain and make fun of dumb reddit posts while cuddling afterwards, and youll have a happy man. And since I do suppose it matters - mostly in the *I really dont want to waste anyones time so may as well get some big things that arent going to change out of the way now* sense, but entirely without judgement and with nothing but best wishes on everyones journeys - Im putting a non-negotiable hard no to: - Drugs of any kind, to any degree, at any time - Non-monogamist desires/tendencies/history, or any inclination towards public/sharing/open relationships - Anything even remotely suggestive of ddlg, little-space, or use of the term daddy - Refusing to talk to/date/be with someone based solely on political/religious affiliations - Anger, drama, poor communication skills, absence of direction/ambition/purpose in life - Being better than me at video games or having anything but highest compliments for my cooking and massages --- So, in the hopes that well all get out of this mess before too long, and taking advantage of the next few months of distance and time on our side - and, like, hoping Im not dead or something by the time wed get to meet - lets crack the old door open once again and accept the possibility of a life full of love and beauty before we kick the bucket - hopefully in many decades and of natural causes. Please note - while Im not at all new to any of this, I am likely fairly rusty and could use a good polish (mind out of the gutter) and some firm hand-holding (*mind* out of the *gutter*) and a warm, soft place to land (*mind*) while I reinvigorate my inner self (*out of*) and slip back into the world of normal, happy, kinky people (*the gutter*) Ill need us to take this nice and slow and stop to smell plenty of roses along the path, and hope I can rely on *you* for some strength, courage, and direction from time to time as well. I am anything but a typical d-type, and Im hoping my complimentarily atypical s-type is strong enough to lead every now and again, appreciates some good old-fashioned emotionally supportive pep talks, and is excited at the prospect of building something *together* rather than sitting back and letting the dom do all the work while she colors. Id like to close my thoughts with two things: First, as its far more statistically likely we are *not* each others respective person, I wish everyone who is reading this (and even those who didnt make it this far, like what, they have better things to do?) nothing but happiness and peace and love and all the good things even if we dont click for any number of a great many reasons. Never let anyone - even *yourself* - dissuade you on your journey, and please know that you are worthy of all the love in the world with *your* person and that I hope you find them when you are meant to. Finally, in case it needs to be said, I clearly love words and just pooped out over 2,500 of them in this post - Ill be forced to take your 6-word request to chat as an indicator of your projected reciprocity in a potential future relationship, and will likely not be terribly interested in conversing. Come on, none of us have anything better to do - and being good with words is probably the second quickest way to melt my heart. Though Id probably like to talk at some point because quality time is my love language and I hate texting and a nice voice is definitely the first quickest. [Here](URL mine - you know, for reciprocitys sake. **tl;dr:** D-type man seeks s-type woman for a lifetime of laughter and love and fucked up kinky shit to look forward to after this all blows over and we hopefully dont die in the next few weeks"

Lets make good use of the time and use it to build something great  Ive been around BDSM for a couple of years now; Im here for community and to search for a long-term partner. I: * Am a 30-year old male dominant, 61, with dark hair and eyes, white skin, and broad shoulders. * Have a professional degree and a career in a highly specialized, in-demand area of one of the learned professions. * Live along the Woodward Corridor in one of the northwestern suburbs of Detroit. * Am physically and mentally healthy, responsible, and drug/disease free. * Am single and monogamous, with an often-laidback personality. * Have a close relationship with my family and an active, diverse circle of friends. * Am a life-long learner who speaks three languages (learning a fourth) and loves to visit museums, hike, kayak, take scenic photographs, explore strange places, travel, drive, and generally enjoy life. Im also a nerd who likes to play video games and discuss philosophy, religion, history, and current events. * Have never met a dog I didnt like. * Am looking to build a life-long relationship that will eventually include marriage and building a family. * Prefer a large power exchange (24/7 TPE or very close) and more traditional gender roles, both to be realized gradually[\[NS1\]](URL ; as well as a lot of affection, intimacy, and mutual support. My ideal dynamic is always there but isnt always overt/explicit, with a lot of room for more-vanilla relationship moments, especially in the long-term. * Practice PRICK  Personally Responsible, Informed, Consensual Kink. Negotiation and consent are very important, especially before building a long-term dynamic. * Want to take responsibility for you, lead you, guide you, develop you into the submissive of your and my dreams, and take care of you. I love this feeling more than anything else. Its the main reason Im into this. * Am not a sadist; Im more into B&amp;D and D/s than S&amp;M. That said, I am willing to try just about anything once if it is important to the right partner. My hard limits are: the standard safety ones (death/permanent injury/minors/drugs/etc.), electric play, anything that draws blood, age play, and scat. * Work A LOT and often into the evening. If I take longer to respond, especially during the week, Im probably working late and will get back to you as soon as I can. Im interested in you if you: * Are a female submissive in her twenties, of any race, background, education level, or body type; as long as theres mutual attraction. * Live in Michigan or are willing to relocate here from elsewhere in the US or Canada when the time is right (I can help with that). I am not looking for a purely online relationship. * Do not currently have children but want to have them in the long-term, way down the road. * Are single and looking for a monogamous relationship with a wide range of D/s practices including rules, protocol, (monogamous) free use, and domestic service. If youre ideal relationship is a bit more traditional in the long-term, I really want to talk to you. * Are looking to grow into an open-ended, long-term dynamic with a formal commitment and collaring when we are ready. * Share at least a few of my interests and most of the beliefs below. Some major beliefs that inform my approach to D/s are: * D/s is a partnership that nourishes both of us. We are equal in worth and dignity and only unequal in authority. Were both adults whove simply decided to occupy different positions in our relationship. Both of us deserve respect, support, affirmation, and love. * Communication is key to success in anything, especially D/s. As with everything else in life, if we cant talk about it, we shouldnt be doing it. Listening is as important in a dom as it is in a sub. * All healthy relationships require consistent investment, conscious commitment, hard work, and a lot of sacrifice by both parties. This is no different. Regular maintenance required. No free rides! * Chosen and willing submission is a beautiful lifestyle, forced submission is a horrible crime. I have no tolerance for illegal coercion/trafficking and report it if I encounter it. You should too. * D/s is about building a profound, intimate bond between two people unlike any other; kink, protocol, training, sessions, and discipline are all just means for achieving that goal. At the end of the day, its all about you and me, not what we do to get there. * Intimacy requires vulnerability. Both of us should be comfortable being vulnerable with each other. Part of my role as a dom is cultivating a space where you feel safe enough to be vulnerable with me. Part of your role as a sub is accepting my vulnerability in return. * We each serve each other in our own way; this complementarity makes D/s work. We each give and take different things. The two of us working as a team is far better than either of us could be on our own. * Responsibility cannot be divorced from authority. It is my role to make your life simple and straightforward, provide for your needs, protect you with everything I have, and take care of you however I can. The best doms are servant-leaders and I want to give myself to you as much as I want to make you mine. If our power exchange is total, I am ultimately responsible for you and everything you do. * The core of submission is obedience. Being my sub means giving me your uncertainties, dilemmas, and problems to resolve for you, and trusting me to look after your best interests. Serving and pleasing me are great ways to give back for that, and feel good too! * Healthy D/s requires a stable, reliable, and supportive environment; I want you to always feel safe with me and be confident about our relationship. I want you to entrust yourself to me because I take your fears and anxieties away. * If youre feeling at peace, empowered, and fulfilled in life; Im doing a great job. If you help me relax, brighten my spirits, and encourage me to reach for the stars; our dynamic will be a beautiful thing. * Discipline is an important part of any power exchange. In our practice of D/s, it will be conducted in a calm, sane, and thought-through way that judges your actions, never your person. The focus should be on what happened, why it was bad, and how to do better; never on your personal worth. Spanking is just one of many ways to discipline. * As my sub, I will train you to not just meet my preferences, but to become the best person you can be. As your dom, I have a responsibility to look for your best interests, paternalism is part of my job. * When it comes to structure and discipline, consistency is the name of the game. * D/s is not abuse. Abuse tears down while D/s builds both of us up and makes us better people. * If you want to tell me you read this whole ad, write My favorite part of D/s is in your subject or the top of your message, then finish the sentence. * Successful relationships are built on shared values. What is most important to you in your life? * An unexamined life isnt worth living, were each on our own personal pilgrimage of sorts. Let me help you in yours and youll inevitably help me in mine."

Sharing your urine with me, at my command, is one of the most intimate, submissive acts I can imagine. It is difficult to imagine a form of intimacy with greater vulnerability and humiliation. I will give you a rigorous set of rules and commands, and you will share your peeing with me in the ways I specify. I will require videos, but you need not include your face.

The girl who remains, always, at my feet and in my heart (24/7 TPE) (Within United States and Canada)",1,g8mst7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/g8mst7/28m4f_im_yearning_for_my_slave_the_girl_who/,2020-04-27 07:24:08,"Everyone is screwed up, broken, clingy, and scared- Ann Lamont Saw that quote the other day, and I guess it seemed an appropriate way to begin this personal. And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

While I met some wonderful people through posting it, and formed some strong friendships, it has been some time since I actually engaged in a D/s dynamic. In this current lockdown situation, I'm realising more and more how much I miss the fulfilling feeling of exploring somebody's submission.) *The writer in me feels like a parody of itself, providing a foreword for a personals listing, but let's just say I've never tried to put my dominant desires into words before, and am a little alarmed by how extensively I ended up doing so. Bless your heart if you read it all through (and forgive my use of the Second Person PoV if it becomes grating; I fear I come dangerously close to sounding like Uncle Sam by the end).* ____________________________ So, a little about me first. I'm white, stand a little over six feet tall, carry a head of long dark hair, and have a slender physique with a little muscle on top of it. I live by the sea in the UK. I'm a musician and producer, and very passionate about the things I make. Songwriting has been my default way of working through my thoughts and feelings for the past decade, and as a result my work is very personal, so I can't help but care strongly about getting every musical detail as perfect as I feel I'm able to. I am something of a perfectionist in general, though, not that it need necessarily extend to my expectations of my sub's behaviour (though it certainly can do; some people respond far more favourably to such pressure than others would). I have a fair amount of experience dominating both over distance and in person, though with few partners. I know many forms of D/s play are absolutely not to be approached lightly, and I wouldn't consider engaging in anything without first issuing safewords; establishing limits; and covering any personal preferences for the kind of aftercare I provide, for catching you if things get a bit unexpectedly intense. That can be anything, from sending you pictures of animals, to singing on the phone, to watching your favourite TV show with you in a video call. If there's one accusation I've consistently fielded in my dominant adventures, it is that I am a tease. I can't disagree... and it plays right into the voyeuristic streak that's easily tempted out of me with a little verbal worship or pleading. I find it irresistibly entertaining, driving somebody further and further past the point of desperation. I tend to land anywhere from sweet and playful to stubborn and strict, though whatever the dynamic, I delight in submerging myself in the performative side of it. Not in an overtly theatrical sense, but it is just a real pleasure to fully immerse myself in a moment with a sub. When domming in person, I tend to be strict, reserved, and a little distant. I fill the room with a loud silence that amplifies a sub's sense of exposure and vulnerability. Those experiences were with subs who specifically enjoyed such an environment, however, and don't necessarily reflect my default speed. Over the phone and in video calls, I lean more towards being a cocky show-off, and relentless tease. I also get a sinfully strong kick out of somebody willingly humiliating themselves for my entertainment, but of course, that needn't factor in to anything we might get up to. I'm currently single, having spent most of my adult life so far in a mostly monogamous relationship (which occasionally included some agreed-upon play with others). As such, I'm not specifically looking for a directly romantic love connection, though obviously the intimacy of a D/s dynamic is wonderfully romantic, in a broader sense of the word. I am, however, totally comfortable with whatever shape your love life is currently in, provided that our interactions are not unfaithfully hidden from any partners who might be hurt by it. I can respectfully sympathise with adultery fantasies, but fantasies they must remain. Beyond that, anything goes; if you're married, poly, regularly submissive to others, or whatever else, I'm more than happy being a small part of your grander experience. I'm actually strongly intrigued by the idea of dominating a woman who separately has a submissive of her own, though I'd make no attempt to impose upon any other relationship, or insert myself uninvited in any capacity. All these different power dynamics, though, are totally fascinating. They're defined by so many factors, at every level of interaction between two people. Age, of course, is probably the most immediately dominant characteristic in the initial formation of a power dynamic, and as such, I am also very enticed by the idea of perverting that norm, and dominating a woman who is older than I am. As with your love life, I'm similarly comfortable with whatever shape your body is currently in. Truthfully, I've always felt somewhat perplexed and alienated by the generally propagated standards of beauty in society, because even the purely physical side of my lust has always landed irrespective of them, both in and outside their lines. Regardless of anybody's personal preferences, a person's appearance is such a small part of what makes them who they are, and usually an even smaller part of the pleasure they have the capacity of achieving. I'd love you to be comfortable with your body, and if you aren't, I'd hope our interactions might help you build up some of that comfort and confidence. It is an absolute joy to help somebody feel sexy. I'd love to communicate the overwhelming effect your submission would have on me, whether or not it means telling you something you already know. If you're not ok being seen at all, I fully respect that, though I would still like to figure out a discrete way for us to verify ourselves to each other early on. There are many different forms our interactions can take. I'd ideally like you to maintain fairly frequent contact, which is to say, it would be nice to hear from you at least a few times a week. Life, of course, isn't always so generous with its free time, which I respect, but I would ask that any extended gaps in contact be mentioned ahead of time, mostly to avoid potential worrying about your well-being. Being in the UK, that puts me five hours ahead of the East Coast and eight hours ahead of the West Coast (99% of the time, at least. It's actually an hour less than that for the next week or two). I have extensive experience dealing with time zones, so can and will work around any difference, but if you've not had to consider them before, be aware that it might be a bit of a frustration for us to wrestle with sometimes. When it comes to playing, all things are negotiable for me, but left to my own devices, I would like to set tasks for you, with deadlines and punishments attached. Writing tasks, photo tasks, edging tasks... I'd like to instant message with you. If we find ourselves particularly comfortable, I'd like to get you on the phone from time to time, and maybe even look at sorting out video calls. Obviously, all of these things require different levels of trust, and I understand that some of them may be hard limits for you. That is fine, and while I can't promise I won't still daydream about instructing you to strip for me on webcam, I absolutely do promise that I won't ever try to change your mind or twist your arm about such things. Besides, the imposition of limitations is very often the birth of ingenuity, and I leisure in getting creative with perversion. There's absolutely something to be said for making somebody feel as though they're kneeling in front of you, by using nothing but the correct combination of words. I'm not looking for any specific type of sub here. I like to learn people from the inside out, and reactively shape my dominant style around their energy. If you're bratty and sassy, maybe a little playfully standoffish, I'll enjoy drawing up some fun boundaries for that, and catching you trying to push them. If you're shy and subservient, and perhaps even nervous, it would be wonderful to encourage you, and reward your obedience with a genuine sense of appreciation. I pay very close attention to my partners, and I do feel that whoever and however you may be, I could be pushing some of your buttons in no time, given a little open communication. On which note, I'd be very happy to be your friend beyond whatever we might end up exploring sexually. Obviously, for many people, there is a strong allure to the idea of submitting to a person whose only presence in their life is a sexual one, perhaps in order to preserve some special elusive sense of authenticity across all of their interactions, or maintain an air of mystery to fill with extra fantasy. That is something I completely understand, and I would be perfectly comfortable pursuing things in that manner. I'd also very happily have us get to know each other, though. As someone who's always writing and recording and drawing things, I get very into listening to people talk about their own creative work, but I'm equally excited to hear about all things beyond my own experience. I'm also always up for trying some kind of artistic collaboration. Having said all that, I'd just as happily have a dumb, relaxed, giggly time, watching some TV or playing a game or just pretty much talking nonsense with you. There are people in my life I get deep with, and people I just have fun with, and people with whom I do both, and I treasure time spent with any and all of them. My point being, I'm sure I'd love getting to know you if you want to be known. If you've read this far, thank you, and I hope that you've done so out of some curiosity about replying, because I'd very much enjoy hearing from you. I appreciate that Reddit PMs aren't the most elegant to try to navigate, so don't hesitate in asking to move things to a different platform if there's one you'd prefer."

You perhaps can surrender to some extent, but not *too* much. You need to retain *some* power and thus *some* responsibility. I have an open and creative personality. Much like a musician who desires to play a violin purely for the sake of creating music, I desire to enable my partner to completely surrender purely for the art of BDSM. For my partner to have no power, and thus, no responsibility. Where shell get what she *needs*, what she *must* have in order to be *able* to have an experience of helplessness that she desires, but where what she *wants* doesnt matter. I score in the 0th percentile in the personality trait of orderliness, the *intrinsic* desire for predictability, routine, and plans. Thus, I have no need, no desire for anyone to be my girlfriend, to be exclusive, to not have other relationships, to commit to something ongoing after doing something once. You can go skydiving, have a great time, and not need to go skydiving again. Unless you want to. And not everyone of course *likes* that I dont care. They want someone who *does* care, that cares if they havent heard from them in a while. Every personality trait has its advantages and disadvantages. There are *other* things that I care about. Im deeply committed to safety, honesty, consent, and reality. I have no need for equality, for reciprocity. As an example, suppose we get on a video call together. You share your video with me, because then youre more vulnerable. I can see your reactions, I can see what effect Im having on you, and I can adjust what Im doing to take you deeper into surrender. Do I share my video with you? No. Because this isnt about me. *You* dont need to be responsible for paying attention to *my* reactions. Im a maximizer, Im uninterested in the average, I desire to create excellence, the extraordinary. Within the boundaries of your requirements and limits, I will always seek to draw you towards deeper surrender. You can indulge in inequality. In helplessness. In vulnerability."

I'm bi-curious/queer-ish, so if you're trans or non-binary I dig you too :) What's in the box: * soft spoken, softer hair * gainfully employed at the internet, making ones and zeros do things they never thought they could do * affectionate, cute as all get-out * hobbyist musician * sense of humor is anywhere between dry, deadpan, absurd, and sassy * mega perv (you were gonna find that out anyhow) * pie enthusiast * awkward as hell but generally comfortable in my own skin * HWP, functional penis For the right person I am pliable and slutty and oh so obedient. I love being controlled and objectified. I want somebody who is excited to experience my vulnerability (and take advantage of it). Instead of specific kinks, let's talk tonality and spirit. I am into a domination style that is overall based on positive reinforcement. You can torture me, deny me, and make me do things I don't like doing, but I'm gonna need it to come from a place of ""you're my prized possession for me to shape, to test, and to enjoy,"" not ""you're a worthless, subhuman slave."" Within the bounds of that, I'm down to explore and get into all sorts of stuff with you! This is not gonna be exhaustive (how could it be?), but if the following items are must-haves for you, then we're not a good fit: * cuckold (been cheated on--feels bad, man) * anything illegal * anything involving anyone other than you and me (without prior discussion/consent between everyone) * scat, blood * CBT beyond anything very minor * lasting or permanent bodily marking/harm * chastity (technically this is a soft limit, but yeah, if it's a must-have let's not have it be a point of contention) * ""service"" submission (giving/receiving acts of service is more of a love language for me, not a kink) I have oodles of limits when it comes to levels of control, denial, pain, etc, sure, but those are case-by-case things that need to be negotiated and renegotiated as things progress. This shit takes time as trust and familiarity develops! I want to give you control, but I'm not giving you the same level of control over me on day 1 as I would on day 100, ya dig?

I consider myself nerdy, ranging from anime and gaming, all the way up to a good book and a solid discussion. I can be just as content going out for a date, as I am spending a day cuddling on the couch. Other than that curiosity is a big motivation in my life, I have a lot of interests and I like exploring those to their fullest extent. This has resulted in a very experimentalist mindset throughout my life. &amp;nbsp; The biggest pull in BDSM for me is the expectation, rather than the exception, of clear, thorough and honest communication. I consider these necessary fundamentals to any healthy bonding, but especially so for a relationship, not to mention one where kink plays an important role. &amp;nbsp; ##### What Im looking for in a partner A man that is both honest and dominant enough to allow himself to be emotionally vulnerable. Someone to cuddle with on the couch, together with a show and perhaps some rope. A Dom that is more on the sensitive and caring side, but also holds a slight sadistic edge with the ability to enjoy things like degradation and (f/p)unishment. Though not required, ideally someone with a love for rope, but at the very least a willingness to learn and explore (Still learning self-bondage myself). Someone that enjoys cuddling and preferably enjoys lifting people over their shoulder or playfully pinning them down to prevent them from getting up. Someone in the age group from 25 up to and including 29, open to a committed monogamous relationship. Some fluff is fine, but a reasonably healthy weight is a requirement if I am to find someone attractive. I wont deny that I also favour men that are around my height range or taller. &amp;nbsp; And above all, someone that values trust, communication and emotional vulnerability just as much as I do. In the case that this post piques your interest and you think we'd be a match, Id love hearing from you. &amp;nbsp; Id appreciate people communicating via PM instead of Reddit chat."

First, thanks for reading. Second, I want to be upfront that I am married and that my partner is not aware. If thats a problem, please move on and best of luck to you. Ive thought a lot about how to write this post. Im looking for something specific that I know is going to be hard to find. Ive had it in the past and. The sense of fulfillment, purpose, and pure contentment that I felt from it is unparalleled. I dont want to write paragraph after paragraph about me; this would end up being too long. But the best way I think to describe me is that Im thoughtful, experienced, honest, understanding, respectful, and definitely a sadist. I love to discuss what we both want out of a dynamic, I want us both to be equally fulfilled, and I want to enjoy your suffering and be immensely proud of you, to care for you, and cherish you. I believe in being a positive influence on a sub, not just sexually, but personally and professionally. Have a personal goal you want to achieve? Let me help. Have a professional goal you want to obtain? Let me be your guide. Itll bring me joy to teach and guide, its just who I am. I want a connection, more than just sex, talking about our days and interests. Now, what Im looking for is simple, but hard to find. Im looking to build to a 24/7 TPE type relationship. I say build specifically, it will take time and trust and connection. When I think back to the most satisfying relationships I had, they were 24/7 TPE. That depth of trust, honesty, intimacy, control, and vulnerability is wonderful and perfect. When I think of where I want us to get to, this is what I think about: You get home after a day of work, spending the day distracted with your mind on me and your submission to me; my ownership. After you close the door you quickly strip down and dress into whatever clothing, or none, that you were instructed to be wearing for the evening. After dressed you kneel perfectly as youve been taught and let me know youre there and waiting. You wait for my response to direct you to either continue with your pre-assigned tasks or to use you for my enjoyment and pleasure. Your entire day and week are under my control. You are excited to ask me permission to go out with your friends later this week and hope I allow you, hope youve been a good enough girl to earn it. I inspect the job you did with your chores, discuss potential punishment as needed for poor work. We talk about our days, you tell me about the girl at work who noticed your collar today and gave you a funny look and we laugh. We have some incredible play time that leaves you exhausted and content before its at your bed time and we say goodnight. A short list of some of my kinks include: * Spanking * Humiliation, verbal and physical * Bondage * Orgasm control * Tease and denial * Anal * Pain play * Many more If the above interests you, Id love to talk to you. Please send me a PM with a little bit about yourself and what resonated with you in this post. I hope to connect soon."

To be specific, this is how I prefer to characterize my dynamic between myself and a submissive partner - Employer/Boss and secretary who is owned by the one she works for. [I also prefer to couch the terms of this dynamic within the context of Ownership &amp; Possession](URL (O&amp;P), as I prefer them over *slavery* and *enslavement*, and I do not typically use the words ""submissive"" or ""Dominant"" as nouns as some choose to do. In addition to that, I also happen to believe in the principles outlined in the linked page (if that wasn't already clear). The etymology of the word is an apt one for this dynamic I believe. It does not just mean a simple clerk or a notary, but more succinctly denotes a ""person entrusted with secrets"". A *confidant*. Hence *secret*ary. This has two meanings in the context of a relationship like this, at least to me, in that not only would this woman be entrusted with my secrets, but she would *be* my secret possession - her own nature and dignity as a submissive woman, her secrets and her well being kept hidden and safe by me. And in order to so, I would necessarily have to be entrusted with her, and everything she is as a woman. Thus the ownership aspect, and yet in my eyes it is *a truly mutual and reciprocal relationship like no other*. In addition to that, I feel it is the proper kind of relationship for a man and woman inducted into a total exchange of power between each other. The position calls for a well-behaved, respectful, obedient and diligent woman to fulfill certain secretarial duties and who both needs companionship and seeks to provide it. If you feel you are lacking in a few or all of these areas, do not be discouraged from applying. All lapses in judgement and inability to fulfill your secretarial duties will be met with the swift and firm application of the appropriate disciplinary procedures, typically involving the use of a hard wooden paddle and the inducing of tears. All punishments are intended to induce *transformational discipline*, that is, discipline intended to transform a lapsed secretary into a secretary cleansed of bad behavior. Desired attributes of a prospective secretarial candidate: * Intellectual/sapiosexual * Warm, elegant personality (for charming acquaintances and associates and representing Us in the best possible light) * Dresses femininely (pencil skirts, short dresses, heels, hosiery, the works, etc. - these can be provided as necessary) * In need of companionship and a deep connection with someone who is her Owner * In need of a more blissful domestic life filled with sensuality, passion, grace, elegance, caring and all the finer things in life for a smart, well-bred woman - all reinforced with a structured amount of discipline and punishment of course * Desires self-improvement and mutual understanding with someone she earnestly respects * Hungers for a lifestyle out of the norm from contemporary society, and arguably more enriching and fulfilling than others * Enjoys and celebrates the symbiosis between Male Authority and feminine deference * Enjoys the feeling of restraints binding her wrists, delightful warmth and exquisite pain being applied to her bare bottom, her orgasms denied (or forced again and again alternatively), and a Man's lips wrapped around hers * Becomes wet from uttering the word ""Sir"" * Heart melts when uttering the word ""Sir"" (alternatively) If this sounds like you, do not hesitate to apply. Let's schedule two separate interviews if that is indeed the case, shall we? One between you and I over dinner, and another between your bare bottom and my paddle over my desk... Now that we have the formalities out of the way, let me introduce who I am more thoroughly. I am someone who has long possessed a different kind of taste in the type of women I like to sink my teeth into. I've been in the military since I left home, pursuing higher education and training for a particular career at the moment, and in need of a submissive woman who I can bring along for the amazing future I have mapped out ahead for me and for the world. To put it more roughly and less precise than that long ad you just read, I am in need of a 1950/1960s-style TPE relationship. I want to exude masculinity and fiery romantic dominance with you, and I want you to exude femininity and beautifully sweet deference/acquiescence in kind. I want to mend you if you're hurt, mold you like clay into the kind of woman you've always longed to be (if needed), and improve my own life by sharing it with another soul (and protecting it in times of vulnerability). I am 5""11, average build, black hair, dark eyes, white, and I am told I have an equally soothing and yet enrapturing voice capable of activating a woman's most erogenous zone. In addition to that my hands and the fingers upon them are quite dexterous and skilled in a number of hobbies. I am seeking a LDR at first and commitment/living together under one roof eventually if we're certain about the path we want to take. I look forward to conversing with you. Your photo gets mine.

All those steamy thoughts and your increasingly kinky tastes left to your own devices? You cant just keep masturbating like that you need a real man in your life, not just a voice in your ear but a presence in your bedroom, being tender and mean in that way that makes your whimper and explosively turned on. A man who you will entrust with your vulnerability and all the feels who will spank you until your ass glows, until your busy brain takes a time out from all this time off. Even when life is back to normal, you want a a very sexy, VERY wickedly and deviously clever kinky temporary boyfriend to tap into your submissive rough sex D/s fantasies who you find yourself falling into a rabbit hole over, because he makes you do things you need to experience. Whether you're inexperienced and looking for someone to train and guide you; bored and looking for something exciting with a man who knows how to fuck you to sleep; insatiably perverted and desperately wanting for a master to take ownership of you and give you commands; cock addicted and looking for someone at least half as fun as I am to feed you regularly, or you know your kinks well and just need a Top who shares them, we should talk and bond over deliciously devilish thoughts you rarely get to share. I can be subtle and mysterious, but I like a lady who throws all her cards, and panties, on a table for me.

Im not here merely for routine casual sex or mechanical encounters - I'm here for experiences so encompassing you exit your own body while feeling everything at once, or more likely, feel like a decadent fever dream, or at least a comfort food fix and maintenance sex to keep us sane.

In some scenarios, misandry was triggered and disillusionment with this lifestyle while in another scenario, I met someone who I loved and challenged me in a way Ive never been challenged before  that scenario in particular was significant and powerful enough for me to still want to give this community a genuine try. I know who I am, and I know what Im not. All the same, Im willing to learn and grow and in the coming months or years, grow and be taught by someone who adopts and lives in that role. I think as Ive matured and grown, Ive naturally become a little antagonistic about the titles this community gives: if you feel like a submissive woman, why do you need to say it and then be validated for it in title by an online community? If you feel like a dominant man, why do you need to call yourself that instead of... just being a dominant man? Oddly enough, as I go back and forth with that inner turmoil, I find that traditional gender roles arent being maintained in the real world, and whether that is a negative or a positive is up to any ones own discretion, but I know as a naturally submissive woman, its been difficult to place myself in a submissive role in modern dating. Not only do I not trust most men to make decisions for me, I dont trust them to make decisions for us just to be jovial yet realistic: if I dont trust you enough to make the decision about where were eating tonight (because its not like you listen to me anyway, and I dont think you have the foresight to check and see if that place is even open), then what would I look like letting you tie me to our bed and trust you finished all your badges in Eagle Scouts? Its all about trust. And vulnerability. And honesty. But mainly trust, if I dont trust you what do we have? If you dont care if I trust you, what do you give me as a sub? I hate that word, but it works here. As far as any of this goes, I can be as forthcoming as youd like, and Ill be as forthcoming as you are Ive definitely walked both sides of the line here and know how difficult brat taming is (especially when your wants and needs are mainly sexual over romantic)  its much easier to deal with someone who does what you want when you want and how you want, and if youre looking for someone or something easy: its probably not me (unless youre God tier and everything Ive ever wanted in a man). I can, fully, understand and respect the duality of sexuality and relationship in most of these relationships, and I would like to think, as long as Im satisfied, you will be as well. Or maybe the other way around? I dont know that this was an introduction, Id like to be more personal when we speak. I know these things are usually about completely dissecting my thoughts and making yourself as mystic as possible, but, Id love to know about you.

For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"
135,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"27 [M4F] Lucrative secretarial position still seeking applicants, free paddling included with every interview!",1,f0i8u0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/f0i8u0/27_m4f_lucrative_secretarial_position_still/,2020-02-08 09:37:52,"Hopefully if you're reading this, you're already a fan of *Secretary* from 2002 with Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader. To be specific, this is how I prefer to characterize my dynamic between myself and a submissive partner - Employer/Boss and secretary who is owned by the one she works for. [I also prefer to couch the terms of this dynamic within the context of Ownership &amp; Possession](URL (O&amp;P), as I prefer them over *slavery* and *enslavement*, and I do not typically use the words ""submissive"" or ""Dominant"" as nouns as some choose to do. In addition to that, I also happen to believe in the principles outlined in the linked page (if that wasn't already clear). The etymology of the word is an apt one for this dynamic I believe. It does not just mean a simple clerk or a notary, but more succinctly denotes a ""person entrusted with secrets"". A *confidant*. Hence *secret*ary. This has two meanings in the context of a relationship like this, at least to me, in that not only would this woman be entrusted with my secrets, but she would *be* my secret possession - her own nature and dignity as a submissive woman, her secrets and her well being kept hidden and safe by me. And in order to so, I would necessarily have to be entrusted with her, and everything she is as a woman. Thus the ownership aspect, and yet in my eyes it is *a truly mutual and reciprocal relationship like no other*. The position calls for a well-behaved, respectful, obedient and diligent woman to fulfill certain secretarial duties and who both needs companionship and seeks to provide it. If you feel you are lacking in a few or all of these areas, do not be discouraged from applying. All lapses in judgement and inability to fulfill your secretarial duties will be met with the swift and firm application of the appropriate disciplinary procedures. Desired attributes of a prospective secretarial candidate: * Intellectual/sapiosexual * Warm, elegant personality (for charming acquaintances and associates and representing Us in the best possible light) * Dresses femininely (pencil skirts, short dresses, heels, hosiery, the works, etc. - these can be provided as necessary) * In need of companionship and a deep connection with someone who is her Owner * In need of a more blissful domestic life filled with sensuality, passion, grace, elegance, caring and all the finer things in life for a smart, well-bred woman - all reinforced with a structured amount of discipline and punishment of course * Desires self-improvement and mutual understanding with someone she earnestly respects * Hungers for a lifestyle out of the norm from contemporary society, and arguably more enriching and fulfilling than others * Enjoys and celebrates the symbiosis between Male Authority and feminine deference * Enjoys the feeling of restraints binding her wrists, delightful warmth and exquisite pain being applied to her bare bottom, her orgasms denied (or forced again and again alternatively), and a Man's lips wrapped around hers * Becomes wet from uttering the word ""Sir"" * Heart melts when uttering the word ""Sir"" (alternatively) If this sounds like you, do not hesitate to apply. Let's schedule two separate interviews if that is indeed the case, shall we? One between you and I over dinner, and another between your bare bottom and my paddle over my desk... Now that we have the formalities out of the way, let me introduce who I am more thoroughly. I am someone who has long possessed a different kind of taste in the type of women I like to sink my teeth into. I've been in the military since I left home, pursuing higher education and training for a particular career at the moment, and in need of a submissive woman who I can bring along for the amazing future I have mapped out ahead for me and for the world. To put it more roughly and less precise than that long ad you just read, I am in need of a 1950/1960s-style TPE relationship. I want to exude masculinity and fiery romantic dominance with you, and I want you to exude femininity and beautifully sweet deference/acquiescence in kind. I want to mend you if you're hurt, mold you like clay into the kind of woman you've always longed to be (if needed), and improve my own life by sharing it with another soul (and protecting it in times of vulnerability). I am 5""11, average build, black hair, dark eyes, white, and I am told I have an equally soothing and yet enrapturing voice capable of activating a woman's most erogenous zone. In addition to that my hands and the fingers upon them are quite dexterous and skilled in a number of hobbies. I am seeking a LDR at first and commitment/living together under one roof eventually if we're certain about the path we want to take. I look forward to conversing with you. Your photo gets mine. -Nite"

That emptiness that you carry everywhere you go and in every thought you have? Yep I feel it. I miss intertwining friendship with the a dark cathartic side. For me it feels good to do bad things (with consent obviously). I get to indulge a very primal desire and seeing my partner so vulnerable and at my mercy is a huge rush. The noises they make, their facial expressions, the pleading, the physical response from their bodies are all extremely satisfying. There's also a vulnerability from my side too. I don't let a lot of people see this part of me as it takes a huge amount of trust in my partner to let the sadistic side free. But when I do, it is absolutely exhilarating. The trust they give me is amazing too is very satisfying. Humiliation in particular creates emotional discomfort which reinforces a power imbalance. It always comes down to control for me. I have the power to make someone feel good, embarrassed, small, helpless, excited, etc. All in all, Id like to build something intense and wonderful with someone I get along with, someone who can meet up regularly and someone can trust me to catch me. So if you seek a friendship intertwined with something dark, cathartic, then drop me a line."

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.)Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

[I also prefer to couch the terms of this dynamic within the context of Ownership &amp; Possession](URL (O&amp;P), as I prefer them over *slavery* and *enslavement*, and I do not typically use the words ""submissive"" or ""Dominant"" as nouns as some choose to do. In addition to that, I also happen to believe in the principles outlined in the linked page (if that wasn't already clear). The etymology of the word is an apt one for this dynamic I believe. It does not just mean a simple clerk or a notary, but more succinctly denotes a ""person entrusted with secrets"". A *confidant*. Hence *secret*ary. This has two meanings in the context of a relationship like this, at least to me, in that not only would this woman be entrusted with my secrets, but she would *be* my secret possession - her own nature and dignity as a submissive woman, her secrets and her well being kept hidden and safe by me. And in order to so, I would necessarily have to be entrusted with her, and everything she is as a woman. Thus the ownership aspect, and yet in my eyes it is *a truly mutual and reciprocal relationship like no other*. The position calls for a well-behaved, respectful, obedient and diligent woman to fulfill certain secretarial duties and who both needs companionship and seeks to provide it.

Let's schedule two separate interviews if that is indeed the case, shall we? One between you and I over dinner, and another between your bare bottom and my paddle over my desk...

I am someone who has long possessed a different kind of taste in the type of women I like to sink my teeth into. I've been in the military since I left home, pursuing higher education and training for a particular career at the moment, and in need of a submissive woman who I can bring along for the amazing future I have mapped out ahead for me and for the world. To put it more roughly and less precise than that long ad you just read, I am in need of a 1950/1960s-style TPE relationship.

I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters.

For me, this is less about domination and more about a gentle connection with sensitive souls who sort of need a push into certain things, who like to explore emotional vulnerability that they lack in their day to day lives. I'll let my profile speak for itselfit has photos available for your consumption; I'm looking for a male (white) at least 30 years of age, dad bods/bhm are pushed to the front of the line since I love a bigger man. Well spoken, intelligent, a lover of back of forth banter. Communicative definitely and able to articulate and be straightforward. Experience in gentle femdom as well. Someone that likes creating a visceral tie with their domme and requires an intellectual and emotional bond in addition to a sexual one. I am *not* looking for anyone that wants to be dominated hardcore, this is a very soft and delicate dominationagain, the focus is on connection rather than do as I say but it is presentthat I'd like to pursue. Tell me about yourself in a messageI like people who take the time to add significant depth and life to their messages. No dick pics or one liner/word messages.

She's just waiting to reply! ;),1,ekkx20,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/ekkx20/47m4f_i_found_the_perfect_sub_shes_just_waiting/,2020-01-06 10:25:50,"Hello there. I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games until all hours. (Way too much WoW lately) - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. - Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. - Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. - Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting. - Obedience and compliance, as well as meticulous control and attention is what gets me going. - *Extras:* Slut shaming, behavior modification focused degradation/humiliation, body marking, ownership enforcement, etc. **In my perfect world, my submissive partner would be:** - Based here in the US, preferably in the east coast for timezone purposes. - Between 25-50 years old. - Available *sometime* within my available weekday hours (7a-7p EST) - Highly attentive and communicative. - Looking to live our long distance/separate lives together as much as we possibly can. Not confining ourselves to specific areas of sharing our lives together but opening up every facet of our lives to one another over time and trust. - Excited by the idea of mutual obsession, infatuation, and utter devotion. - Experienced OR actively learning and reading to gain more experience. - A strong speaker with high expectations for command of the English language . - Witty, dry sarcasm, dark humor are all a plus (please don't drown me in your lol's. I'll admit I am a sucker for a good placed GIF though). - Emotionally available. - Married or unmarried, tethered or untethered is irrelevant. Must be transparent with me and my expectation is some degree of monogamy even if you are in a LTR or married at some point. I'm not looking to be #3 in your rotation. To clarify further, in a long term concept with someone who is also married/in a LTR, I'm not looking for either of us to be in a relationship (physical or emotional) with anyone outside of each other and our respective partners. **Communication:** - Hangouts (text, voice/video calls), telegram, emails, snail mail (PO box -- I'm not that insane), or in person. I've posted here before and met some amazing people, but ultimately long term wise, it hasn't lasted to what I've wanted. I'm not looking to dive into D/s things very quickly. I prefer to get to know my partner outside of a dynamic first and foremost. If you aren't interested in having deep conversations or in writing detailing responses, please don't bother to reach out to me. Include a name or alias that isn't your screen name, A/S/L, communication preferences, and precisely what in this post moved you to reach out. Thank you."

Maybe you feel like you were wired wrong, perhaps even broken. Out of place. Engineered to never find gratification you've been craving, but seemingly unable to savor. What you *do* know is that you need to be needed and in a way that is meaningful and genuine. Not this tangled dance of favors - trading domestic obligations, precious vitality, financial independence, or emotional support for some pittance of stability and partial comfort. You want to feel complete. Whole. Full of those flavors and their entirety. Where you can give everything because you *know* you have nothing to fear after weaving this safety net out of our lives and into yours. You risk much choosing a path where you allow yourself to come undone. There is no deep connection without that vulnerability - that risk that allows your heartstrings to be played like a marionette. When your devotion is all that's left. When your dedication becomes all that matters. Your insecurities and your reservations disappear behind the curtain of fear because you know that you are wanted beyond simple lust and convenience.

152,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] To share your weakness is to make yourself vulnerable. To make yourself vulnerable is to show your strength.,1,elzux8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/elzux8/30_m4f_to_share_your_weakness_is_to_make_yourself/,2020-01-09 09:12:42,"I admit, I think about that quote far too often. Nonetheless, vulnerability is at the center of what this dynamic should be. One cannot submit without first being vulnerable. To share your weaknesses, to share your dreams, goals, insecurities, fears, darkest thoughts with a partner, and know that he will be there no matter, not judging for anything that you have shared. Vulnerability is not easy. Nothing worth doing is easy. But it's crucial as a stepping stone to submission. The second half of the quote is just as important as the first half. When you show vulnerability, is not a weakness. You show strengths by being vulnerable, by submitting. I don't want a doormat, but I want someone who submits with her head held high. Submission is a gift that you do not give to just anyone. You have a hard time finding a Dom worth respecting, I suspect. Most Doms don't get the subtleties of control and dominance. They focus too much on dominating your mind and do not focus enough on your mind and emotions. I am a 30 year old man, living in the DC area, where I work in a government position (don't worry, not a Trump fan). I have been involved with D/s for near a decade now, with several long term relationships on and offline, with a wide variety of dynamics, from strict TPE to more paternal DD/lg, and everything in-between. I have an active social life, mostly spent with a great smaller group of friends. The rest of my free time is spent in nature or in front of a computer. I love to swim, love to hike and enjoy video games. I would love to find someone who shares more than just her kinky with me, who has similar interests and hobbies. Speaking of interests, I am interested in many topics, movies, books, TV, politics, psychology, philosophy and more. When it comes to D/s relationships, I am strict, firm, creative and open-minded. No kink you have will shock me and I will be eager to make your fantasies become a reality. I focus a lot on dominance outside the bedroom, enjoying control in every aspect of life, beyond just sexually. Personality-wise, I am organized, driven, focused and calm. I plan things to the smallest detail and you will often find me making lists to improve my efficiency. I have found that this side of me works especially well in D/s relationships as well, where I can help improve your life and productivity, motivating you to be better than you have been on your own. I am looking for someone to spend my day with, to talk to and get to know, to explore our minds together. Someone with a personality, who is able to hold a conversation, knows how to ask the right kinds of questions and who feels like something is missing in their lives. Maybe it is a sense of direction or maybe it is missing someone to whisper filthy things in your ear. I am open to both long distance and local. I enjoy taking my time and getting to know someone well. Will you allow yourself to be vulnerable? I am waiting."

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with?

You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.)Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a wordsmith, an occasional cunning linguist, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games until all hours. (Way too much WoW lately) - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. - Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. - Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. - Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting. - Obedience and compliance, as well as meticulous control and attention is what gets me going. - *Extras:* Slut shaming, behavior modification focused degradation/humiliation, body marking, ownership enforcement, etc. **In my perfect world, my submissive partner would be:** - Based here in the US, preferably in the east coast for timezone purposes. - Between 25-50 years old. - Available *sometime* within my available weekday hours (7a-7p EST) - Highly attentive and communicative. - Looking to live our long distance/separate lives together as much as we possibly can. Not confining ourselves to specific areas of sharing our lives together but opening up every facet of our lives to one another over time and trust. - Excited by the idea of mutual obsession, infatuation, and utter devotion. - Experienced OR actively learning and reading to gain more experience. - A strong speaker with high expectations for command of the English language . - Witty, dry sarcasm, dark humor are all a plus (please don't drown me in your lol's. I'll admit I am a sucker for a good placed GIF though). - Emotionally available. - Married or unmarried, tethered or untethered is irrelevant. Must be transparent with me; my expectation is some degree of monogamy even if you are in a LTR or married at some point. I cannot stress this enough, but I am not looking to be #3 in your rotation. To clarify further, in a long term concept with someone who is also married/in a LTR, I'm not looking for either of us to be in a relationship (physical or emotional) with anyone outside of each other and our respective partners. **Communication:** - Hangouts (text, voice/video calls), emails, snail mail (PO box -- I'm not that insane), or in person. I've posted here before and met some amazing people, but ultimately long term wise, it hasn't lasted to what I've wanted. I'm not looking to dive into D/s things very quickly. I prefer to get to know my partner outside of a dynamic first and foremost.

158,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"27M4F - Seeking a girl with a heart for service for a Master/slave dynamic built on care, intimacy and devotion. (Long distance to start with potential transition to in-person)",1,eoen60,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/eoen60/27m4f_seeking_a_girl_with_a_heart_for_service_for/,2020-01-14 13:19:00,"If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"
159,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,32 [F4M] BBW Domme looking for her sweet boy...,1,epme41,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/epme41/32_f4m_bbw_domme_looking_for_her_sweet_boy/,2020-01-17 04:23:02,"What follows is a practical post, but trust me, I have a lot of affection and attention to give a special boy. I just dont want to waste anyones time, energy, or emotion if there is an obvious incompatibility. First of all, I am fine with finding someone to play with online, but I would prefer them to be in the US or Canada for time and communication purposes. What I get off on most is control and vulnerability. My kinks tend to lean into whatever gets me those things. BDSM provides me a tool box to get what I want, so it is hard to say specifically what I would enjoy with a pet like you. I need to learn you first, so I know how to pull my puppets strings. I can say I do not enjoy extreme age play, pain, or anything permanent. Your safety and best interest is always a top priority for me and while innocence can be sexy, the level of regression back to childhood is not a turn on for me and D/s is a very sexual experience in my approach. I am not a Femdom, keep your cash, I want your soul. You must be willing to exchange pictures and videos eventually. I will reciprocate when a good boy has earned a reward, but you dont need to earn a verification photo, we can do that whenever it feels right. Things I like always (not needs necessarily): being worshipped and adored, acts of service, needy (but well adjusted overall) boys, premature ejaculation, tease and denial, orgasm control, chastity, light cuckolding, and prostate play. Honestly, I dont mind if youre married if you meet the following requirements: you dont love your spouse and you dont have sex regularly or you are in an open relationship and also dont have sex regularly. Single is preferred, because if youre not emotionally available... whats the point? I like tall boys 25-45. Tell me your age, location, and height in your first message."

Ive always resonated myself as a submissive and all my experience, focus, and attention in the BDSM lifestyle lies there. I have a husband who has also been my Dom for a long time. More and more lately though, Ive been having some Femdom fantasies. Weve talked about them, both agree its not fitting for our dynamic, and I have been given the okay to feel things out with someone online. Im just mainly looking for someone to maybe, get to know, eventually role-play with, video chat, whatever. Just kind of practice with, if thats a thing? Some of what (I think) my kinks are (because they are mostly just fantasies in my head at this point) with this are: teasing, orgasm control, general control, edging, forced orgasm, face sitting, cuckolding, humiliation, light impact play. Im 28, in shape, long dark hair, cute. If we hit it off after some normal conversation, I am willing to verify that I am, in fact, a woman and not a creep or bot or anything like that. Im not looking to jump into role playing right away. Lets get to know each other first. I love the idea of an otherwise dominate in normal life, athletic, manly man being under my control, but I do realize this is online, not gonna be picky here, I mostly dont give a shit what you look like, just that we get along. My only real requirement is that you be at least 25+ please. Disclaimer again being obviously that, Im totally out of my element here. This may very well turn out to be the absolute most awkward thing for us both, but theres also that chance that my years of playing submissive have equipped me with first hand knowledge of what *you* are seeking, what *you* want to feel as a submissive, and Im hoping I can supply that special feeling of vulnerability for someone out there. Take a chance with me?"

163,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,47(M4F) - Still looking for that perfect (for me) sub!,1,erkl6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/erkl6d/47m4f_still_looking_for_that_perfect_for_me_sub/,2020-01-21 09:08:25,"Hello there. I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a wordsmith, an occasional cunning linguist, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games until all hours. (Way too much WoW lately) - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. - Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. - Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. - Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting. - Obedience and compliance, as well as meticulous control and attention is what gets me going. - *Extras:* Slut shaming, behavior modification focused degradation/humiliation, body marking, ownership enforcement, etc. **In my perfect world, my submissive partner would be:** - Based here in the US, preferably in the east coast for timezone purposes. - Between 25-50 years old. - Available *sometime* within my available weekday hours (7a-7p EST) - Highly attentive and communicative. - Looking to live our long distance/separate lives together as much as we possibly can. Not confining ourselves to specific areas of sharing our lives together but opening up every facet of our lives to one another over time and trust. - Excited by the idea of mutual obsession, infatuation, and utter devotion. - Experienced OR actively learning and reading to gain more experience. - A strong speaker with high expectations for command of the English language . - Witty, dry sarcasm, dark humor are all a plus (please don't drown me in your lol's. I'll admit I am a sucker for a good placed GIF though). - Emotionally available. - Married or unmarried, tethered or untethered is irrelevant. Must be transparent with me; my expectation is some degree of monogamy even if you are in a LTR or married at some point. I cannot stress this enough, but I am not looking to be #3 in your rotation. To clarify further, in a long term concept with someone who is also married/in a LTR, I'm not looking for either of us to be in a relationship (physical or emotional) with anyone outside of each other and our respective partners. **Communication:** - Hangouts (text, voice/video calls), emails, snail mail (PO box -- I'm not that insane), or in person. I've posted here before and met some amazing people, but ultimately long term wise, it hasn't lasted to what I've wanted. I'm not looking to dive into D/s things very quickly. I prefer to get to know my partner outside of a dynamic first and foremost. **If you aren't interested in having deep conversations or in writing detailing responses, please don't bother to reach out to me. Also, don't send me a one-liner on Reddit chat, please. I need substance here.** Include a name or alias that isn't your screen name, A/S/L, communication preferences, and precisely what in this post moved you to reach out. Thank you."

172,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"27M4F - Seeking a girl with a heart for service for a Master/slave dynamic built on care, intimacy and devotion. (Long distance to start with potential transition to in-person)",1,evwrli,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/evwrli/27m4f_seeking_a_girl_with_a_heart_for_service_for/,2020-01-30 11:59:29,"If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"
173,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"27 [M4F] Lucrative secretarial position still seeking applicants, free paddling included with every interview!",1,ewey22,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/ewey22/27_m4f_lucrative_secretarial_position_still/,2020-01-31 10:51:43,"Hopefully if you're reading this, you're already a fan of *Secretary* from 2002 with Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader. To be specific, this is how I prefer to characterize my dynamic between myself and a submissive partner - Employer/Boss and secretary who is owned by the one she works for. [I also prefer to couch the terms of this dynamic within the context of Ownership &amp; Possession](URL (O&amp;P), as I prefer them over *slavery* and *enslavement*, and I do not typically use the words ""submissive"" or ""Dominant"" as nouns as some choose to do. In addition to that, I also happen to believe in the principles outlined in the linked page (if that wasn't already clear). The etymology of the word is an apt one for this dynamic I believe. It does not just mean a simple clerk or a notary, but more succinctly denotes a ""person entrusted with secrets"". A *confidant*. Hence *secret*ary. This has two meanings in the context of a relationship like this, at least to me, in that not only would this woman be entrusted with my secrets, but she would *be* my secret possession - her own nature and dignity as a submissive woman, her secrets and her well being kept hidden and safe by me. And in order to so, I would necessarily have to be entrusted with her, and everything she is as a woman. Thus the ownership aspect, and yet in my eyes it is *a truly mutual and reciprocal relationship like no other*. The position calls for a well-behaved, respectful, obedient and diligent woman to fulfill certain secretarial duties and who both needs companionship and seeks to provide it. If you feel you are lacking in a few or all of these areas, do not be discouraged from applying. All lapses in judgement and inability to fulfill your secretarial duties will be met with the swift and firm application of the appropriate disciplinary procedures. Desired attributes of a prospective secretarial candidate: * Intellectual/sapiosexual * Warm, elegant personality (for charming acquaintances and associates and representing Us in the best possible light) * Dresses femininely (pencil skirts, short dresses, heels, hosiery, the works, etc. - these can be provided as necessary) * In need of companionship and a deep connection with someone who is her Owner * In need of a more blissful domestic life filled with sensuality, passion, grace, elegance, caring and all the finer things in life for a smart, well-bred woman - all reinforced with a structured amount of discipline and punishment of course * Desires self-improvement and mutual understanding with someone she earnestly respects * Hungers for a lifestyle out of the norm from contemporary society, and arguably more enriching and fulfilling than others * Enjoys and celebrates the symbiosis between Male Authority and feminine deference * Enjoys the feeling of restraints binding her wrists, delightful warmth and exquisite pain being applied to her bare bottom, her orgasms denied (or forced again and again alternatively), and a Man's lips wrapped around hers * Becomes wet from uttering the word ""Sir"" * Heart melts when uttering the word ""Sir"" (alternatively) If this sounds like you, do not hesitate to apply. Let's schedule two separate interviews if that is indeed the case, shall we? One between you and I over dinner, and another between your bare bottom and my paddle over my desk... Now that we have the formalities out of the way, let me introduce who I am more thoroughly. I am someone who has long possessed a different kind of taste in the type of women I like to sink my teeth into. I've been in the military since I left home, pursuing higher education and training for a particular career at the moment, and in need of a submissive woman who I can bring along for the amazing future I have mapped out ahead for me and for the world. To put it more roughly and less precise than that long ad you just read, I am in need of a 1950/1960s-style TPE relationship. I want to exude masculinity and fiery romantic dominance with you, and I want you to exude femininity and beautifully sweet deference/acquiescence in kind. I want to mend you if you're hurt, mold you like clay into the kind of woman you've always longed to be (if needed), and improve my own life by sharing it with another soul (and protecting it in times of vulnerability). I am 5""11, average build, black hair, dark eyes, white, and I am told I have an equally soothing and yet enrapturing voice capable of activating a woman's most erogenous zone. In addition to that my hands and the fingers upon them are quite dexterous and skilled in a number of hobbies. I am seeking a LDR at first and commitment/living together under one roof eventually if we're certain about the path we want to take. I look forward to conversing with you. Your photo gets mine. -Nite"

What I have in mind is more on the teasing/playful side than the dark/extreme side. I enjoy eliciting feelings of vulnerability without being insulting, derogatory, or mean. I see a distinction between humiliation and degradation and I'd be happy to discuss that with you more if you'd like. Some of my other likes include orgasm control, light pain/discomfort, simple rules/restrictions, teasing and begging, silly/pointless ""because I said so"" tasks, to name a few. I think a lot of things can be humiliating in the right context. I'd like things to be more playful and creative than forced and cliche. Ideally, I'm looking for somebody open to audio or cam (either or both would be fine), but if you're shy and prefer to just chat for now, that works too. Since this is largely mental, even nudity/sexual is not absolutely required if that is a limit. I'm very open minded and willing to discuss details, so long as you're submissive and into the idea of humiliation. As for me, I'm 33m, HWP, short brown hair, brown eyes, stubble. I'm in the eastern timezone, and looking for online at the moment (never rule out the idea of IRL at some point if we really click, but also being realistic). Some interests include camping/hiking, gardening, music/concerts, programming/tinkering, cooking/eating, among other things. Hopefully we can get to know each other beyond just kink. I generally prefer to chat on kik, google, or skype, but open to other platforms. I'm open to all ages and body types, since finding somebody to whom this appeals is really the key here. Just be 18+. Anyway, send me a quick intro if this appeals to you, along with your preferred means of communication, and we can take it from there. I may not respond immediately but will read and respond to messages as long as this post is still up. Hope to hear from you!"

A Dominant, such as I, gives as well, and have a great responsibility not only to respect that gift, but also their own. Each is an often times better half of the other, and should be treated as such. Who really has the power in the D/s lifestyle? That is a tough one, tackled and owned by either side depending on who you ask, though it does raise more questions. Is one end of the paddle more important or valuable than the other? Does one side of the chain exist simply for the purpose of another? Somehow, I can't see it that way. Like any good relationship or partnership, it's a split between component parts, the sum total being greater than the single elements, though enriched by all. A dominant personality needs their match in a submissive one, and vice versa, to equate balance in a good relationship of whatever kind. Unless you enjoy constant head bashing. One without the other tends to be unfulfilled and unhappy. So where is the power? Simply enough, on either side, for the sole reason that each needs the other. Where there is need, there is a vulnerability to the thing needed. Some of us revel in this, and others have to take control of it. Need is still there, whether you are on the bottom, the top, or take turns playing either. We are all looking for something or someone to fill a need within us, and that is what bring me here today. Submission is a gift, a great and beautiful one, deserving of the best in return. You are not just a property or just the point of worship, you are a person, with needs and dreams of your own. You are a person who is giving me more than just time and effort, but your heart and soul. I fill your needs, together we make something mutually blissful, and I work to make you happy. We all have a hole to fill, figuratively or literally. If you are interested in presenting the gift of your submission to me, send me a message."

I take excellent care of myself, can talk your ear off about diet and fitness and will probably ask you to come to the gym with me at some point, and think I look ok in a suit as well as out of one. Im also a Dom , even though I dont like labels and am still not entirely sure what it means and have yet to explore much of what that even is as Ive been saving it for the right person who I have most likely yet to meet. I mention all of this because its important, much more important than a tedious list of kinks and limits, because Im a person with a life Im passionate about, complete with flaws and imperfections and surprises and depths you should want to learn and love before we discuss our favorite spanking implements (my hands). I never last long on the more blatantly BDSM related sites with their blatantly sexual agenda and blatantly displayed genitalia where people seem to gather to find casual play partners and hairy old dudes to tie them up and take compromising pictures and jump right into things that would take me a really long time to open up to. D/s is not just a sexual dynamic to me; the intense and awesome depth of sexuality it can offer is, instead, an expression and reflection of the intense and awesome vulnerability and love that exist between a master and his Slave. The possession, hunger, electricity, utter filth, blissful peace, and terrifying beauty inherent in an ideal dynamic stem from the mind and the heart, over time and trust, not from hormones in a moment of physical weakness. I need cuddles, patience, warmth, unconditional praise of my cooking, unabashed nerdiness, unwavering loyalty, unlimited kindness, and an embarrassing amount of kissing. But I also need to be able to stop you mid-sentence with a look, pull you to your knees by your hair, earn and exercise complete control over your orgasms, and call you a good girl knowing full well what that does to you. Im a dom, and Im looking for a Slave. Not a Slave, but rather my Slave. Like a one and only forever sort of deal that starts in friendship and blossoms into a love that would make the rest of the world jealous if they could ever understand. I want to date like normal people, only knowing that the endgame includes and involves much more than 5 minutes of missionary once a week. Im not looking for my equal; Im looking for my complement. We will likely be very different in many ways, and I hope we can both learn so much from each other as we build a loving relationship alongside a beautiful d/s dynamic. Maybe weve shared the same dream our whole lives and, in some sense, already know each other better than anyone else. I hope this was enough to ignite the spark we need to connect. we will never know if you dont reach out. Im not going anywhere, I wont bite (yet), and am clearly a fan of epically long letters, creativity, and originality. But, Just be you. Thats all I can ever ask of you, even without knowing you yet.

My ad is very long, so here is the gist of it: I'm an intellectually-disposed, service-oriented male submissive looking for a monogamous, lifestyle D/s relationship. But until I find that (which, given my high standards, will probably take a long time), I am open to having less committed D/s arrangements. Read on for a more in-depth treatment. Also, most of this is taken directly off of my FetLife profile, so if youd prefer, you can just read it there: [Mathochism](URL As a bonus, Ive even posted a few pictures of myself. **Vanilla me** Outside of kink, Im an undergraduate student studying physics &amp; mathematics. In addition to those, I love learning about music theory, philosophy, and ancient civilizations. I have an almost childlike fascination with the American frontier of the 19th century. After college, I hope to go to graduate school and get a Ph.D. in physics. What will I do with that Ph.D., you ask? I'm really not sure. Some of my other interests include: **video games** (I play on PC and Xbox, and I particularly love RPGs and strategy games - my favorites, respectively, have to be The Witcher 3 and Sid Meier's Civilization), **reading good books**, **board games** (I've been really wanting to get into D&amp;D but haven't had the opportunity), **intellectually stimulating conversation**, **acting**, and **outdoor activities** such as skydiving, mountain/rock climbing, hiking/camping, and extreme travel. I am an aficionado of Edwardian fashion, as you may be able to tell, and I frequently find myself yearning for the days when people wore formal hats. Interesting fact: I play the piano. My favorite music is classical, particularly that of the Romantic era, but I also love metal, rock, swing, and jazz. My five love languages, in order, are: * Quality time - 10 * Acts of service - 6 * Physical touch - 6 * Words of affirmation - 5 * Gift-giving - 3 I identify strongly with the [INTJ personality type](URL I can be shy and awkward at first, but once you get to know me I'm geeky, eccentric, and playful. Maybe bordering on the absent-minded and ""day-dreamy"". Occasionally I'm prone to spontaneity, and my sense of humor would best be described as dry/deadpan. I'm always looking to try new things and expand my interests. **Submissive me** In my personal life, I tend to be a fairly confident and self-assured person. I know what I want, and regardless of others' expectations, I go after it. I generate opportunities for myself, as I'm acutely aware that I'm the sole architect of my destiny. That's just how I am - independent almost to a fault. Yet I have a strong, inexplicable yearning to be in a situation where I relinquish that independence and give it to someone else whom I view as deserving of it. This is the appeal of power exchange to me: forming a deep connection with someone, and of my own volition, handing to them the reins of my autonomy. (More or less, anyway - as much as the situation permits.) And from that yearning arises a desire to serve and to please. I am deeply interested in the well-being of any whom I've given my submission. I'm an obsequious sort of submissive who is relentlessly obedient and is always looking out for his Dominant's best interest. It provides me with great pleasure to know that I have impacted her life in some meaningful way. That could mean preparing a bath for her after she gets home from a long day of work, cleaning the house so that she can spend time on more meaningful things, cooking her favorite meal, giving her a massage to help alleviate stress - anything that increases her ability to be happy and successful. All of these excite me to an unfathomable end. And, of course, I'm interested in all of the kinky stuff that goes with such a dynamic. But not *just* the kinky stuff; I want the opportunity to bend down and kiss my partner's feet sometimes, among (*many*) other things, true - but I also want to just generally devote myself to her satisfaction, even outside of the bedroom. In that sense, I think I'd be most suited to a 24/7 dynamic. According to [this article](URL I am most interested in ""level 3 FLR"". Or, more accurately, an intermediate between level 3 and level 4 - level 3.5, perhaps. I think all the M/s stuff is fun and necessary on occasion, but it would get exhausting after a while if we did it literally all the time. While we're not engaging in M/s play, I'd still be deferential and committed to my Domme's happiness. But, to emphasize, the M/s stuff would not be 24/7; I don't think that is sustainable in the long run. It's important to have some time to unwind, to behave as normal people do, without the pressures of protocol and punishments and whatnot. **What kind of partner am I looking for?** I feel a bit conflicted addressing this issue. What I'm actually looking for - in the most ideal scenario - is a profoundly deep connection with someone. Someone to have a *realistic* and *sustainable* female-led relationship with, of the kind described in the book [Uniquely Rika](URL by Ms. Rika. Ideally, we'd get into a relationship that lasts at least a few years, if not the rest of our lives. We'd be totally committed to each other. (And *only* each other - at my core, I'm very monogamous.) The relationship would involve all the usual vanilla stuff, like love, inside jokes, shared lives, etc., but with the added ingredients of kink and power exchange. Beneath the vanilla exterior - unbeknownst to others - I would belong to my partner, as an extension of herself. I'd be forever committed to her happiness &amp; satisfaction, and in return, she'd offer me structure, guidance, and support. I'm looking for someone with whom to be best friends, life partners, and Domme and sub, all at once. Owner and property. In essence, I'd like to find someone to love and serve unconditionally. This is problematic, though, because I have very high standards when it comes to selecting such a partner. The amount of people I'd consider suitable for this type of relationship at this stage of my life is vanishingly small. Specifically, for a potentially lifelong relationship, I am looking for a **dominant-leaning woman** around my age (say, no older than 25, which is certainly the most limiting factor) who is **intelligent** (+/- 1 standard deviation of me, which also eliminates most of the population), **ambitious** (by which I mean have your own goals and be working to achieve them - have a direction in life, both personally and professionally), **monogamous**, and who has similar interests/values/dispositions as me. The last one is obviously pretty flexible, but to some extent, you should be compatible with me personality-wise. And, of course, we should be compatible kink-wise as well. The intersection of all of these traits is, to say the least, invisible to me. For this person - if they do indeed exist - I will not limit myself by distance. I will be moving away from Houston after graduating college, and who knows where I'll find myself in the upcoming decade. If, upon reading this, I have struck some particular nerve in you, and you feel like I might be what you're looking for, then by all means, send me a message and strike up a conversation, and we can see where it goes. I don't bite. I'll leave that to you. ;-) I hope that I will eventually find this person, but I do not expect to do so within the foreseeable future. In the meantime, I think it's important to gain some more experience with kink/sex/relationships. I need to develop myself further in that realm. Thus, I'm also content with having shorter, more casual relationships with people. If we're not compatible in the manner I previously described, then at the very least I'm open to being play partners, or perhaps even more than that. I'm even open to serious D/s arrangements where I'm devoted to you and only you, so long as we both understand that it is not permanent. I'm also open to poly relationships, and indeed, I'm open to *most* kinds of D/s relationships wherein I have a submissive role. The only thing I wouldn't want in this more casual relationship is romance; if we're not mutually interested in a monogamous, potentially indefinite relationship, then I'd rather not involve romance at all. We can be friends, of course, and I'd even consider a platonic connection a necessity, but there should be no ""love"" involved. In accordance with that, if you think you might be interested in some kind of D/s arrangement with me, shoot me a message and let's discuss it further! So: simultaneously, Im looking for a serious monogamous partner and non-monogamous play partners. Most people will fall into the latter category, and that is what I am mainly focusing on right now. However, even if I get into a casual D/s relationship with someone, I will constantly remain vigilant in my search for a lifelong partner, because that is my ultimate aim. **As far as kinks go...** Some of my favorite types of play include: impact, bondage, pegging, strap-on play, CBT, cunnilingus, foot/body worship, fluid play, scent play, cross-dressing/""feminization"", chastity, orgasm control, humiliation, and degradation. This list will, of course, evolve with experience, but these are what I think I enjoy most right now. I'm very open-minded, especially when it comes to kink/sexuality, so if you'd like to try something else, I'm most likely willing (and curious) to oblige. Some things I will *not* do are: &amp;#x200B; * Cause or significantly risk causing permanent or severe damage to myself. Goes without saying, but I'll list it just in case I'd ever need to reference it. (Mom always said I'd be a good lawyer!) This can take many forms, and I will obviously be the judge of what constitutes a ""significant risk"". I tend to be a pretty risk-averse person. I take a cautionary approach to extreme sadism play. * Do anything in such a way that reveals or significantly risks revealing these, erm, ""unconventional"" interests of mine to friends/family/school/work. * Urethral sounding. That stuff terrifies me, almost as much as the idea of having kidney stones. * ABDL, MDLB, or Cg/L of any form; or, more generally, age play in which I assume the role of a young child. * Blood or edge play. (That list is exhaustive, by the way. If it's not on that list, I'm almost definitely willing to try it.) On the subject of kinks, I find that most people get aroused primarily through stimulation of the senses *sight* and *touch*. I share this proclivity, but I differ from the norm in that I get equally - if not more - aroused from the stimulation of *taste* and *smell*. There is hardly anything I find more sexually exciting than having my senses dominated completely by the essence of my partner; than for nothing to exist in my immediate world except for them, because their presence is so strong, so captivating, that nothing else *can* exist. I think taste and smell are easier than the other senses to overwhelm. My absolute favorite types of play are therefore those in which I can taste or smell my partner. Bodily fluids, such as saliva and urine, and bodily scents, such as sweat and B.O., are particularly erotic agents of taste and smell. My nose and mouth are my most erogenous zones. I am consequently always open to kinks that utilize them somehow. I am, as they say, a huge ""scent whore"". For a similar reason, I am extremely into being restrained. I *love* all forms of bondage, rope, shibari, and whatnot and so forth. Hardly anything turns me on more than being teased and tortured while unable to do anything at all about it. The appeal lies in the loss of control and the complete vulnerability: I want my immediate world and surroundings to be subject entirely to the will of my partner. I was handcuffed and blindfolded once before, and it was honestly one of the most sexually exciting moments I've experienced. **In conclusion** Im just a kinky neophyte looking to take advantage of his newfound sexual freedom. Im a quick learner and Im eager to start exploring. If any of this strikes your interest, dont hesitate to send me a message!"

I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, but if not, just search for ""hand dominance"" on PornHub or any other adult streaming site. It's the total vulnerability, I suppose, and loss of control. That, combined with the exposure and exhibitionism -- man's genitalia on display while his mistress slinks and skulks in her lingerie or latex bodysuit. She teases him, taunts him, tortures him. His orgasm and pleasure are hers. His *desire* for *her* is his weakness, and she exploits it to the hilt. She edges him. She denies him. She verbally humiliates him. She dictates the terms of his release (and relief). In some scenarios, he arouses himself under her direction: stroke, don't stroke; faster, slower; stop, start. And throughout it all, he is not allowed to come until she give her loving (or demeaning or humiliating) permission. In other cases, she takes control -- his hands are bound, leaving her to milk him. To force him to climax or to entirely deny it. To ruin his orgasms by allowing what might have been a spouting masterpiece devolve into a dribbling mess. To mercilessly jack him in post-orgasm torture. She laughs; she doesn't care. It is her delight to see his much-anticipated gratification reduced to a defeated, drained, and empty sex organ between his legs, wrinkled and flaccid. But is this real? Are there women into this as much as I am? And by that I mean women who don't expect or want to be paid or ""tributed"" for their effort? I kinda think not. And yet, hope springs eternal. And so I am creating this post and hoping some woman out there who would enjoy taking control of me and using me in this way. Is she out there?"

189,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] A symphony of submission - Dominant seeks tonic for perfect authentic cadence,1,ee5cc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/ee5cc7/30_m4f_a_symphony_of_submission_dominant_seeks/,2019-12-23 01:18:23,"I. **Prelude** -Sonata form- The introduction begins starkly, coldly, unassumedly - as if the melody, stated subtly in the strings, is unaware it is being performed. Ambiguous in its tonality, its structure, it wanders with equal parts mystery and invitation, slipping under the radar of the unattuned ear, only offering exactly enough allure to implore the most curious and imaginative to listen on. As a second line joins in imitation, we learn of our main subject. He is a compendium of counterpoint, a chorus of contradiction, a discord of dichotomy. Often cold, distant, reserved to the world - yet infinitely warm, giving, protective of those he holds dear. Polite and proper - yet delectably depraved. The harmony hovers between major and minor - the listener, already, is unsure what they are hearing, yet innately certain that they must follow it. The first theme states itself unexpectedly plainly for such an evocative overture. It is happy, thoughtful, creative, searching, active, quirky, sensitive, light. Rich in texture, warm in harmony, inventive in melody. It follows most of the traditional formulae for such a classical structure and meets the eye as entirely typical - the average listener would surely pass it by and toss the entire work into the overwhelming pile of pieces that had nothing of substance to share. The transition into the secondary material is where the movement truly shines. Suddenly, yet not unsettlingly, the inimitable darkness of the introduction resurfaces with astounding aptitude from the otherwise ordinary primary material. Were it not so masterfully crafted, the listener might think them entirely separate works from entirely different composers - however the maestro at work here seems a master of juxtaposition who has surely wrestled with such diametric deviations for decades. In the blink of an eye, with the very same elements which had only moments ago finished stating the opening material, a wave of tumultuous color washes over the orchestra, sweeping and swelling towards glorious climaxes that seem unearned given how quickly the music has come upon us, yet unquestionably warranted and appropriate - only to pull the sound back at the last turn of phrase, booming brass giving way to whispering woodwinds just when the ear expected an ardent arrival. The most impressive feature of the movement is the effortless ease with which the two exist together without contention or conflict. The music never truly reaches the dynamic heights to which it is clearly capable, yet remains surprisingly satisfying nonetheless. The listener is left moved, changed, shaken - yet in dire need of more. The movement closes in the same unassuming nature with which it began, and a short pause signifies the denouement. The musicians turn their pages silently, almost reverently, so as not to disturb the sacred hush that has enraptured the audience. II. **Mind** -Rondo- Left with craving curiosity from the first movement, the listener is pleasantly surprised to hear the second open with a light, quirky scherzo. Overflowing with capricious whim and inventiveness - yet retaining a perspective of depth and solemnity. Effervescent grace notes enhance the melodys already unique and fascinating shape, while frequent and unexpected dissonances, both in tone and timbre, keep the ear on its toes - it is clear the composer is telling us an elaborate and wonderful joke and, furthermore, delighting in the process. The movements inner sections depart briefly from the eccentricity of the main theme. Once effusive, vociferous, passionately lush; once introspective, intense, brilliantly introverted. Each note carries its meaning with purpose - whether a string of highly specific intervals or a vast landscape of less poignant cascades of color. Each return is more pleasing than the next, and the single movement seems an entire symphony of shades, from the esoteric and existential to the noetic and nerdy. The curiosity and creativity of the writing seem truly endless, and as the movement closes with a final suggestive quip, the listener wonders what other worlds the composer may have shown her, had he more time. III. **Heart** -Minuet and Trio- In striking contrast to the calculated nature of the second movement - with its almost unspoken expectation for subtle subterfuge and imminent innuendo - the third opens with a simple dance. Innocence and purity seem the left and right feet as the music holds its listener close - and holds little back. The gestures are intimate, integral, intoxicating, inviting, the harmonies sweet, sweeping, swelling, swaying. With no elaborate instrumentation or clever construction, the music itself is the theme. The musicians play with complete, terrifying sincerity - there is no virtuosity, no technical fireworks, no impressive invention, only raw, beautiful, imperfect humanity. The sacred solemnity of the minuet gives way to a trio nearly bursting with the purest of joys. Utter rapture overtakes the orchestra as almost nave celebrations of absolute ecstasy bounce boundlessly between the walls of the hall. The sheer, contagious splendor of immaculate happiness overcomes the listener to the point of simultaneous laughter and tears. The trio reaches a bubbling climax, and the music returns the listener to the minuet with a most infectious smile and sense of deep peace. A wave of immense, incredible warmth washes over the audience as the movement at last comes to rest. IV. **Body** -Theme and Variations- Only after the sincerity and emotional openness of the third movement can the fourth reveal itself, unlock itself, expose itself. While many other pieces would open with this movement, even with precious, pitiful little introduction, the composer here holds it in highest regard, and has made us earn the right to enjoy its many intricate pleasures and crashing climaxes - a right the listener should aim to take full advantage of as often as practically possible. The theme carries the emotional vulnerability and nakedness into the physical, tactile realm - remnants of the minuet remain ever present throughout. But where the previous music touched on the abstract, the ethereal, here we are grounded immediately in the earthy, the carnal, the visceral, the animal. Soft clarinets coaxing melodic curves give way to pounding percussion carelessly crashing mallet into head, setting every molecule of air in the hall on fire. The variations are a game of contrasts and creativity. All imaginable elements at the composers disposal are used to full effect - from the highest, shrill whimper of the piccolo to the most guttural, low bellow of the tuba - from the painstakingly slow, undulating rhythm with saintly patience to the reckless, ravenous, raucous runs with the abandon of a sinner - from the most gentle, calming caress to the most violent, severe strike - the only unifying feature of the movement seems to be unabashed, unapologetic hedonism in its most depraved, most disturbed state. Each return of the theme seems to suggest a satisfying supposition, but inescapably and inexorably invites the intended into increased improvisation. The movement collapses into a much needed - and well earned - rest, the exhaustion of the musicians exertion evident. Warm tingles begin to lift off the skin as the final sustained chords drift into nothingness. The energy of the music lingers long into the silence that follows. V. **Soul** -Fugue- Divine. Inexpressible. Profound. Perfect. The subject transcends the mortality of mere musicians playing notes on pages. It is almost still. Quiet. One step away from the flawless beauty of pure silence. Eyes close, so as to not mar the ears with unnecessary information or influence. The music simply *is*, and no amount of words can ever properly capture the holy harmony that holds the whole spirit helpless. As painfully beautiful as music, words, movement, art can be, *nothing* in this world can ever hope to hold a candle to the perfect beauty of two souls finding their missing halves and uniting into one. The fugue reaches a stretto where subject and episode converge, where yin meets its yang, where melodies once dissonant on their own unite to form perfect harmony, where long journeys full of struggle, pain, sorrow, doubt, imperfection are immediately made worth every step. The piece ends with the tonic, resonant and grounded in the bass, and the dominant lingering blissfully in the top voice. The open, major chord is repeated three times with baited breath between. The strings keep vibrating long after the bow has been lifted, the conductor holds his hands high, hesitating to herald the end of the experience, the audience barely breathes, unable to break the perfect moment they wish would last forever. After what seems an eternity, the conductor lowers his hands. The musicians sheathe their instruments and relax their postures. A timid applause starts from the balcony and spreads respectfully through the house, people make small talk through humble bows, uncomfortable with enduring such vulnerability much longer. Programs are folded into purses and a mass exodus soon leaves the once bustling concert hall empty. Except for *one*. Perhaps, this time, she will be brave enough to venture backstage and say hello. --- Long for my soul. Hunger for my body. Cherish my heart. Start with my mind."

To be specific, this is how I prefer to characterize my dynamic between myself and a submissive partner - Employer/Boss and secretary who is owned by the one she works for. The etymology of the word is an apt one for this dynamic I believe. It does not just mean a simple clerk or a notary, but more succinctly denotes a ""person entrusted with secrets"". A *confidant*. Hence *secret*ary. This has two meanings in the context of a relationship like this, at least to me, in that not only would this woman be entrusted with my secrets, but she would *be* my secret possession - her own nature and dignity as a submissive, her secrets and her well being kept hidden and safe by me. And in order to so, I would necessarily have to be entrusted with her, and everything she is as a woman. Thus the ownership aspect, and yet in my eyes it is *a truly mutual and reciprocal relationship like no other*. The position calls for a well-behaved, respectful, obedient and diligent woman to fulfill certain secretarial duties and who both needs companionship and seeks to provide it. If you feel you are lacking in a few or all of these areas, do not be discouraged from applying. All lapses in judgement and inability to fulfill your secretarial duties will be met with the swift and firm application of the appropriate disciplinary procedures.

Now that we have the formalities out of the way, let me introduce who I am more thoroughly. I am someone who has long possessed a different kind of taste in the type of women I like to sink my teeth into. I've been in the military since I left home, pursuing higher education and training for a particular career at the moment, and in need of a submissive woman who I can bring along for the amazing future I have mapped out ahead for me and for the world. To put it more roughly and less precise than that long ad you just read, I am in need of a 1950/1960s-style TPE relationship. I want to exude masculinity and fiery romantic dominance with you, and I want you to exude femininity and beautifully sweet deference/acquiescence in kind. I want to mend you if you're hurt, mold you like clay into the kind of woman you've always longed to be (if needed), and improve my own life by sharing it with another soul (and protecting it in times of vulnerability). I am 5""11, average build, black hair, dark eyes, white, and I am told I have an equally soothing and yet enrapturing voice capable of activating a woman's most erogenous zone.

Thats proven much harder to explain than it has ever seemed in my head. Suffice it to say, there is a great cavernous depth of beautiful filth to be explored when the right person comes along and hopefully brings a flashlight. The fun stuff can, and will, come later; Im far more interested in connecting on a normal human being level first. And as someone who just is dominant, I know that my complement just is submissive (and yes, Ive spent plenty of years questioning and challenging that with unsurprisingly little success and am not terribly interested in repeating those performances). Someone who simply breathes it, understands it so natively its sometimes hard to put into words, needs it so deeply she has likely gone without it for such a terribly long time just to be absolutely sure it will be right when she finds it. Someone who knows and needs the same terrifying depths of trust and vulnerability and love that I have always known Ive needed. Some of my kinks include bondage, spanking, ice/wax, deep throating, dp, anal, gags, pain, pussy torture/spanking, nipple play, orgasm control/denial/edging, humiliation, and hidden public.

Im also a nerd who loves to play video games and discuss philosophy, religion, history, and politics. * Have never met a dog I didnt like. * Am looking for a long-term relationship that could eventually lead to marriage and starting a family. * Prefer a large power exchange (24/7 TPE or very close) and more traditional gender roles, both to be realized gradually; as well as a lot of affection, intimacy, and mutual support. My ideal dynamic is always there but isnt always overt/explicit, with a lot of room for more-vanilla relationship moments, especially in the long-term. * Practice PRICK  Personally Responsible, Informed, Consensual Kink. Negotiation and consent are very important, especially before building a long-term dynamic. I prefer to do a period of vanilla dating to get to know a sub before starting with kink. * Love the feeling of taking responsibility for, leading, guiding, developing, and taking care of someone more than anything else.

Im interested in you if you: * Are a female submissive in her twenties, of any race, background, education level, or body type; as long as theres mutual attraction. * Live in Michigan or are willing to relocate there from elsewhere in the US or Canada when the time is right (I can help with that). I am not looking for a purely online relationship. * Do not currently have children but are open to having them in the long-term, way down the road. * Are single and looking for a monogamous relationship with a wide range of D/s practices including rules, protocol, free use, and domestic service. * Are looking to grow into an open-ended, long-term dynamic with collaring and formal commitment when we are ready. * Share at least a few of my interests and most of the values below. Some major beliefs that inform my approach to D/s are: Communication is key to success in anything, especially D/s. If you cant talk about it, you shouldnt be doing it. All healthy relationships require consistent investment, conscious commitment, hard work, and a lot of sacrifice by both parties. D/s is no different. Regular maintenance required. No free rides! Dominant and submissive are equal in worth and dignity and only unequal in authority. They are both adults who have simply decided to occupy different positions in their relationship. Both deserve respect, support, affirmation, and love. Willing submission is a beautiful lifestyle choice, forced submission is a horrible crime. I have no tolerance for illegal coercion/trafficking and report it when I encounter it. You should too. D/s is about building a profound, intimate bond between two people unlike any other; kink, protocol, training, sessions, and discipline are all just means for achieving that goal. At the end of the day, its all about the bond and the other person. Intimacy requires vulnerability. Both dominant and submissive should be comfortable being vulnerable with each other. Part of a dominants role is cultivating a space where the submissive feels safe enough to do so. Part of the submissives role is accepting her dominants vulnerability in that space. Dominant and submissive each serve their partner in their own way; this complementarity makes D/s work. Each gives and takes different things. Responsibility cannot be divorced from authority. It is a dominants role to make his submissives life simple and straightforward, provide for her needs, protect her with everything he has, and generally take care of her. He is a servant-leader and must give of himself readily. If their power exchange is total, he is ultimately responsible for her well-being and everything she does. The core of submission is obedience. Being a submissive means being freed of many common dilemmas and other uncertainties by virtue of a dominants oversight and the roadmap it provides. Performing service and pleasing her dominant are important to a submissives satisfaction and overall health. Its how she feels fulfilled and gives back for that freedom. The red pill/pick-up artistry's idea of ""dominance"" is a misguided set of actively harmful ideas, especially in a D/s context. Healthy D/s requires a stable and supportive environment, a submissive should always feel safe with her dominant and secure in their relationship. An untroubled, empowered, and satisfied submissive is the mark of a great dominant. A relaxed, successful, and cheerful dominant is the mark of a great submissive. Micromanagement is only appropriate as a training tool or as a temporary response to past failings in an area. It doesnt work well as the long-term, standard approach. Discipline is a necessary part of any power exchange and should only be conducted in a calm, sane, and thought-through way that judges the submissives actions, never her person. Spanking is just one of many ways to discipline. Consistency in discipline is important to the health and thriving of a submissive in a D/s relationship. D/s is not abuse. Abuse tears down while D/s builds both of us up and makes us better people. If you want to tell me you read this whole ad, write My favorite part of D/s is in your subject, then finish the sentence. Successful relationships are built on shared values. What is most important to you in your life? An unexamined life isnt worth living, were each on our own personal pilgrimage of sorts. Let me help you in yours and youll inevitably help me in mine."
199,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] To share your weakness is to make yourself vulnerable. To make yourself vulnerable is to show your strength.,1,ei33nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/ei33nx/30_m4f_to_share_your_weakness_is_to_make_yourself/,2020-01-01 00:51:53,"I admit, I think about that quote far too often. Nonetheless, vulnerability is at the center of what this dynamic should be. One cannot submit without first being vulnerable. To share your weaknesses, to share your dreams, goals, insecurities, fears, darkest thoughts with a partner, and know that he will be there no matter, not judging for anything that you have shared. Vulnerability is not easy. Nothing worth doing is easy. But it's crucial as a stepping stone to submission. The second half of the quote is just as important as the first half. When you show vulnerability, is not a weakness. You show strengths by being vulnerable, by submitting. I don't want a doormat, but I want someone who submits with her head held high. Submission is a gift that you do not give to just anyone. You have a hard time finding a Dom worth respecting, I suspect. Most Doms don't get the subtleties of control and dominance. They focus too much on dominating your mind and do not focus enough on your mind and emotions. I am a 30 year old man, living in the DC area, where I work in a government position (don't worry, not a Trump fan). I have been involved with D/s for near a decade now, with several long term relationships on and offline, with a wide variety of dynamics, from strict TPE to more paternal DD/lg, and everything in-between. I have an active social life, mostly spent with a great smaller group of friends. The rest of my free time is spent in nature or in front of a computer. I love to swim, love to hike and enjoy video games. I would love to find someone who shares more than just her kinky with me, who has similar interests and hobbies. Speaking of interests, I am interested in many topics, movies, books, TV, politics, psychology, philosophy and more. When it comes to D/s relationships, I am strict, firm, creative and open-minded. No kink you have will shock me and I will be eager to make your fantasies become a reality. I focus a lot on dominance outside the bedroom, enjoying control in every aspect of life, beyond just sexually. Personality-wise, I am organized, driven, focused and calm. I plan things to the smallest detail and you will often find me making lists to improve my efficiency. I have found that this side of me works especially well in D/s relationships as well, where I can help improve your life and productivity, motivating you to be better than you have been on your own. I am looking for someone to spend my day with, to talk to and get to know, to explore our minds together. Someone with a personality, who is able to hold a conversation, knows how to ask the right kinds of questions and who feels like something is missing in their lives. Maybe it is a sense of direction or maybe it is missing someone to whisper filthy things in your ear. I am open to both long distance and local. I enjoy taking my time and getting to know someone well. Will you allow yourself to be vulnerable? I am waiting."

For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, but if not, just search for ""hand dominance"" on PornHub or any other adult streaming site. It's the total vulnerability, I suppose, and loss of control. That, combined with the exposure and exhibitionism -- man's genitalia on display while his mistress slinks and skulks in her lingerie or latex bodysuit. She teases him, taunts him, tortures him. His orgasm and pleasure are hers. His *desire* for *her* is his weakness, and she exploits it to the hilt. She edges him. She denies him. She verbally humiliates him. She dictates the terms of his release (and relief). In some scenarios, he arouses himself under her direction: stroke, don't stroke; faster, slower; stop, start. And throughout it all, he is not allowed to come until she give her loving (or demeaning or humiliating) permission. In other cases, she takes control -- his hands are bound, leaving her to milk him. To force him to climax or to entirely deny it. To ruin his orgasms by allowing what might have been a spouting masterpiece devolve into a dribbling mess. To mercilessly jack him in post-orgasm torture. She laughs; she doesn't care. It is her delight to see his much-anticipated gratification reduced to a defeated, drained, and empty sex organ between his legs, wrinkled and flaccid. But is this real? Are there women into this as much as I am? And by that I mean women who don't expect or want to be paid or ""tributed"" for their effort? I kinda think not. It just seems that, despite the appearance of a reverse power play, it is the guy who gains the most from this. What, really, is in it for the woman, other than a chance to be sadistic and cruel?So, am I just left with an especially pathetic sex fantasy? Well, hope springs eternal. And so I am creating this post and hoping some woman out there who would enjoy taking control of me and using me in this way. Is she out there?"

Im a hopeless romantic, not even close to 7 foot tall but most likely taller than you so dont worry, otherwise pretty normal guy who cant believe hes 19 already and who rarely lets his facial hair go past a few days stubble. I like wandering through the park, befriending strangers dogs, I reply quickly and I will take a quiet night in vs. a loud night out any day of the week, I take excellent care of myself, can talk your ear off about diet and fitness and will probably ask you to come to the gym with me at some point, and think I look ok in a suit as well as out of one. Im also a dom, even though I dont like labels and am still not entirely sure what it means and have yet to explore much of what that even is as Ive been saving it for the right person who I have most likely yet to meet. I mention all of this because its important, much more important than a tedious list of kinks and limits, because Im a person with a life Im passionate about, complete with flaws and imperfections and surprises and depths you should want to learn and love before we discuss our favorite spanking implements (my hands). I never last long on the more blatantly BDSM related sites with their blatantly sexual agenda and blatantly displayed genitalia (SO many questions about that) where people seem to gather to find casual play partners and hairy old dudes to tie them up and take compromising pictures and jump right into things that would take me a really long time to open up to. D/s is not just a sexual dynamic to me; the intense and awesome depth of sexuality it can offer is, instead, an expression and reflection of the intense and awesome vulnerability and love that exist between a master and his Slave. The possession, hunger, electricity, utter filth, blissful peace, and terrifying beauty inherent in an ideal dynamic stem from the mind and the heart, over time and trust, not from hormones in a moment of physical weakness. I need cuddles, patience, warmth, unconditional praise of my cooking, unabashed nerdiness, unwavering loyalty, unlimited kindness, and an embarrassing amount of kissing. But I also need to be able to stop you mid-sentence with a look, pull you to your knees by your hair, earn and exercise complete control over your orgasms, and call you a good girl knowing full well what that does to you. Im a dom, and Im looking for a Slave. Not a Slave, but rather my Slave. Like a one and only forever sort of deal that starts in friendship and blossoms into a love that would make the rest of the world jealous if they could ever understand. I want to date like normal people, only knowing that the endgame includes and involves much more than 5 minutes of missionary once a week. Im not looking for my equal; Im looking for my complement. We will likely be very different in many ways, and I hope we can both learn so much from each other as we build a loving relationship alongside a beautiful d/s dynamic. Maybe weve shared the same dream our whole lives and, in some sense, already know each other better than anyone else. I hope this was enough to ignite the spark we need to connect. we will never know if you dont reach out. Im not going anywhere, I wont bite (yet), and am clearly a fan of epically long letters, creativity, and originality. But, Just be you. Thats all I can ever ask of you, even without knowing you yet.

(Online to start - in-person in time),1,dulbnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/dulbnd/27m4f_looking_to_create_a_life_of_service_and/,2019-11-11 12:58:10,"If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

I'd love to have folx who'd like to show me around and tell me about living here but I'm also happy to spend time in--I'm generally an indoor kid anyway. I am hoping to have a doggo soon though who I'd love to go exploring with. This could be anything from totally platonic to a relationship, although I don't think I'm gonna want anything too serious for a little bit (I'm getting over a couple different breakups). I'm also wanting to start pursuing solo polyamory, so if that's something you do as well I'd love to chat about what it's like for you. Vanilla-wise, I'm like a cross between Ben Wyatt and Ben Wyatt. I'm cis-ish but also feel a certain affinity with the term non-binary--but you're totally welcome to call me a man and I use he/his/him. I like dogs and music and musical dogs. I also like social justice, politics, podcasts and mental health. I've spent the past couple years working at a progressive nonprofit in DC, trying to weaken the corporate stranglehold suffocating every aspect of our society. But like, if you work at a corporation Im sure *youre* nice. In general I'm into anything pop culture, the McElroy Brothers, karaoke, trivia, tabletop and video games, happy hour, yoga, and I'm looking to get more active in terms of exercise and outdoorsy stuff. I'm goofy af, witty, and adorable. I strongly value empathy, radical honesty and vulnerability. I've been told I have a grounding presence and am a good listener, and people often find it easy to open up to me. With regard to play, I consider myself heteroflexible/questioning. I'm a switch though I have much more experience in a submissive role than a dominant one, but I am interested in exploring my dominant side so I'm looking for either one. I'm mostly but not exclusively interested in femme and androgynous people--my level of attraction to masc people is something I'm not sure of yet and definitely interested in exploring though. I'm interested in one-on-one or pretty much any permutation of group play. Physically, I'm often told that I'm handsome and well-dressed, and I'm 5'8"" with an average/slightly overweight HWP body type. I might be anywhere from clean-shaven to stubbly, but not really more than that. I have plenty of body hair but not, I think, a gross amount, and mostly just on my front. I'm DDF and get tested regularly (I'm also on PrEP). Some things I like include: Femdom (particularly gentle femdom, but anything that isn't too too heavy on degradation or service works), sensory deprivation, sensation play, bondage, impact play, (relatively light) scratching/choking/biting/hair pulling, ass play (giving or receiving), face sitting, and flogging. A few things I haven't tried that I'd like to include exhibitionism, wax play, and knife play. I'm still somewhat new to kink (about a year) so there are lots of things I haven't tried that I'd be willing to. Go ahead and send me a DM if any of the above sounds exciting! It'd be lovely to have some social connections for when I move :D Happy to share pics if we get to talking!"
209,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] To share your weakness is to make yourself vulnerable. To make yourself vulnerable is to show your strength.,1,dvhjec,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/dvhjec/30_m4f_to_share_your_weakness_is_to_make_yourself/,2019-11-13 09:19:13,"I admit, I think about that quote far too often. Nonetheless, vulnerability is at the center of what this dynamic should be. One cannot submit without first being vulnerable. To share your weaknesses, to share your dreams, goals, insecurities, fears, darkest thoughts with a partner, and know that he will be there no matter, not judging for anything that you have shared. Vulnerability is not easy. Nothing worth doing is easy. But it's crucial as a stepping stone to submission. The second half of the quote is just as important as the first half. When you show vulnerability, is not a weakness. You show strengths by being vulnerable, by submitting. I don't want a doormat, but I want someone who submits with her head held high. Submission is a gift that you do not give to just anyone. You have a hard time finding a Dom worth respecting, I suspect. Most Doms don't get the subtleties of control and dominance. They focus too much on dominating your mind and do not focus enough on your mind and emotions. I am a 30 year old man, living in the DC area, where I work in a government position (don't worry, not a Trump fan). I have been involved with D/s for near a decade now, with several long term relationships on and offline, with a wide variety of dynamics, from strict TPE to more paternal DD/lg, and everything in-between. I have an active social life, mostly spent with a great smaller group of friends. The rest of my free time is spent in nature or in front of a computer. I love to swim, love to hike and enjoy video games. I would love to find someone who shares more than just her kinky with me, who has similar interests and hobbies. Speaking of interests, I am interested in many topics, movies, books, TV, politics, psychology, philosophy and more. When it comes to D/s relationships, I am strict, firm, creative and open-minded. No kink you have will shock me and I will be eager to make your fantasies become a reality. I focus a lot on dominance outside the bedroom, enjoying control in every aspect of life, beyond just sexually. Personality-wise, I am organized, driven, focused and calm. I plan things to the smallest detail and you will often find me making lists to improve my efficiency. I have found that this side of me works especially well in D/s relationships as well, where I can help improve your life and productivity, motivating you to be better than you have been on your own. I am looking for someone to spend my day with, to talk to and get to know, to explore our minds together. Someone with a personality, who is able to hold a conversation, knows how to ask the right kinds of questions and who feels like something is missing in their lives. Maybe it is a sense of direction or maybe it is missing someone to whisper filthy things in your ear. I am open to both long distance and local. I enjoy taking my time and getting to know someone well. Will you allow yourself to be vulnerable? I am waiting."

First, thanks for reading. Second, I want to be upfront that I am married and that my partner is not aware. If thats a problem, please move on and best of luck to you. Ive thought a lot about how to write this post. Im looking for something specific that I know is going to be hard to find. Ive had it in the past and. The sense of fulfillment, purpose, and pure contentment that I felt from it is unparalleled. I dont want to write paragraph after paragraph about me; this would end up being too long. But the best way I think to describe me is that Im thoughtful, experienced, honest, understanding, respectful, and definitely a sadist. I love to discuss what we both want out of a dynamic, I want us both to be equally fulfilled, and I want to enjoy your suffering and be immensely proud of you, to care for you, and cherish you. I believe in being a positive influence on a sub, not just sexually, but personally and professionally. Have a personal goal you want to achieve? Let me help. Have a professional goal you want to obtain? Let me be your guide. Itll bring me joy to teach and guide, its just who I am. I want a connection, more than just sex, talking about our days and interests. Now, what Im looking for is simple, but hard to find. Im looking to build to a 24/7 TPE type relationship. I say build specifically, it will take time and trust and connection. When I think back to the most satisfying relationships I had, they were 24/7 TPE. That depth of trust, honesty, intimacy, control, and vulnerability is wonderful and perfect. When I think of where I want us to get to, this is what I think about: You get home after a day of work, spending the day distracted with your mind on me and your submission to me; my ownership. After you close the door you quickly strip down and dress into whatever clothing, or none, that you were instructed to be wearing for the evening. After dressed you kneel perfectly as youve been taught and let me know youre there and waiting. You wait for my response to direct you to either continue with your pre-assigned tasks or to use you for my enjoyment and pleasure. Your entire day and week are under my control. You are excited to ask me permission to go out with your friends later this week and hope I allow you, hope youve been a good enough girl to earn it. I inspect the job you did with your chores, discuss potential punishment as needed for poor work. We talk about our days, you tell me about the girl at work who noticed your collar today and gave you a funny look and we laugh. We have some incredible play time that leaves you exhausted and content before its at your bed time and we say goodnight. A short list of some of my kinks include: * Spanking * Humiliation, verbal and physical * Bondage * Orgasm control * Tease and denial * Anal * Pain play * Many more If the above interests you, Id love to talk to you. Please send me a PM with a little bit about yourself and what resonated with you in this post. I hope to connect soon."
211,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,26[M4F] Looking for a girl to place on her knees and in my heart (long-distance for now),1,dwigjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/dwigjs/26m4f_looking_for_a_girl_to_place_on_her_knees/,2019-11-15 11:12:44,"Everyone is screwed up, broken, clingy, and scared- Ann Lamont Saw that quote the other day, and I guess it seemed an appropriate way to begin this personal. And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian.You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will.I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, but if not, just search for ""hand dominance"" on PornHub or any other adult streaming site. It's the total vulnerability, I suppose, and loss of control. That, combined with the exposure and exhibitionism -- man's genitalia on display while his mistress slinks and skulks in her lingerie or latex bodysuit. She teases him, taunts him, tortures him. His orgasm and pleasure are hers. His *desire* for *her* is his weakness, and she exploits it to the hilt. She edges him. She denies him. She verbally humiliates him. She dictates the terms of his release (and relief). In some scenarios, he arouses himself under her direction: stroke, don't stroke; faster, slower; stop, start. And throughout it all, he is not allowed to come until she give her loving (or demeaning or humiliating) permission. In other cases, she takes control -- his hands are bound, leaving her to milk him. To force him to climax or to entirely deny it. To ruin his orgasms by allowing what might have been a spouting masterpiece devolve into a dribbling mess. To mercilessly jack him in post-orgasm torture. She laughs; she doesn't care. It is her delight to see his much-anticipated gratification reduced to a defeated, drained, and empty sex organ between his legs, wrinkled and flaccid. But is this real? Are there women into this as much as I am? And by that I mean women who don't expect or want to be paid or ""tributed"" for their effort? I kinda think not. It just seems that, despite the appearance of a reverse power play, it is the guy who gains the most from this. What, really, is in it for the woman, other than a chance to be sadistic and cruel?So, am I just left with an especially pathetic sex fantasy? Well, hope springs eternal. And so I am creating this post and hoping some woman out there who would enjoy taking control of me and using me in this way. Is she out there?"

Im an experienced Daddy Dom as well for good girls who show lots of affection and like to improve, please, and strive to be good and obedient . No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction, want an arrangement where we meet a few times a month, understand the focus is on exploring dominance/submission, and not be lost and excessively clingy. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on kik or texting on google voice on vanilla topics. Thank you"

I'm looking for somebody who likes me enough to use, abuse, control, violate, and objectify me :) I'm open to all sorts of connections, from the shortest of short term to the longest of long term (even relationship-y). As long as it's mutually fun and healthy, let's make it happen! Down to meet up if you're close by as well. Let's explore and break new ground be weird and figure out what pushes each other's buttons in the right way. My kinks fall mostly to the lighter side of BDSM (I want to be your favorite slut, not your worthless slave), but I definitely have some kinks that are heavier too. You can rough me up and spit in my mouth if the mood's right &lt;3 ### about me * cute as all get-out * typically masculine in appearance, _much_ less so on the inside * physically HWP and looking for the same ([here](URL is a NSFW picture) * works at the internet * into playing guitar/singing for fun * bi-curious * an introvert who happens to also be a humongous ball of sass * horny most of the time (you were gonna find that out anyways) * will want to go down on you again and again and again * like a good chunk of sub dudes, waaay into anal play/pegging ### what you can expect from me as a sub * Confidence and assertiveness. I am a sub but not a doormat, and I'm not so desperate that I'll submit to just anyone. * Vulnerability that increases with time and trust. * Effort! As a guy who's had plenty of hetero[normative] sex where the other party usually expects _me_ to take control, I know first-hand that topping/dominating is _work,_ both mentally and physically. So you can bet I'll be putting in lots of effort to match. * Obedience and flexibility. I'm both a pleaser and a kinkster, so obedience is intrinsically rewarding to me. Yeah of course I have my own laundry list of kinks I hope you'll indulge in for my own sake, but that does not negate the fact that I get off on the idea of you making me do things solely for _your_ pleasure. I don't expect to _like_ everything you want me to do (at least not at first), and I love the idea of impressing you with increasing levels of obedience. * Passion. If we hit it off, It'll be so easy for you to wrap me around your finger. I can be extremely submissive, eager, and slutty for the right person. ### what I expect from you * Personality. I'm looking for somebody that is playful, curious, and some degree of sadistic. * Drive. I like people who are passionate and always working to improve in some way. * Realistic desires of your own. You want me to beg you for XYZ? Awesome, that's fucking hot. However, I don't like faking emotions, so you're going to have to make me feel pretty powerless and desperate before I can get into that headspace, and that requires time and some built-up trust. I _don't_ expect you to always be ""on"", to make every decision, or to have the energy to lead the way every time. I mean, fuck, plenty of the time _I_ will wanna top _you_ (just not in a kinky way). ### mutual expectations * communication * self-awareness * respect * understanding that gender norms are dumb and restrictive. let's be our weird selves ### hard no's * chastity * cuckold (been cheated on--feels bad, man) * ageplay * petplay * service submission - giving and receiving acts of service is a huuuge love language of mine. If I'm gonna cook you dinner or give you a massage I want it to be a ""I like and appreciate you"" thing, not a kinky thing ### on the topic of humiliation/degradation I'm very _mildly and cautiously_ open to exploring in this direction. I'm uber sensitive and tender, so when you're mean to me, it really gets under my skin. That _can_ be a good thing as a device to get me into a submissive mood, but I have to trust you to be extremely careful. If you want to go in this direction, tread lightly and do so _only_ if you're willing to put in the work to bandage up the wounds during or immediately after a play session. --- Hope we can get to know each other as regular people as well as on a kinky level if the chemistry is right! Happy to exchange more pictures. Chat me up! :)"

I'm 5'11, 160, fairly good shape, single (divorced) great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy being a dominant. I can be an experienced Daddy Dom as well for good girls who show lots of affection and like to improve, please, and strive to be good and obedient . No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction, want an arrangement where we meet a few times a month, understand the focus is on exploring dominance/submission, and not be lost and excessively clingy. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on vanilla topics.

216,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"27[M4F] looking to create a life of service and devotion with my forever slave. (Online to start, in- person in time)",1,dzktmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/dzktmz/27m4f_looking_to_create_a_life_of_service_and/,2019-11-22 02:25:38,"If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"
217,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] To share your weakness is to make yourself vulnerable. To make yourself vulnerable is to show your strength.,1,dzo6ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/dzo6ax/30_m4f_to_share_your_weakness_is_to_make_yourself/,2019-11-22 06:10:28,"I admit, I think about that quote far too often. Nonetheless, vulnerability is at the center of what this dynamic should be. One cannot submit without first being vulnerable. To share your weaknesses, to share your dreams, goals, insecurities, fears, darkest thoughts with a partner, and know that he will be there no matter, not judging for anything that you have shared. Vulnerability is not easy. Nothing worth doing is easy. But it's crucial as a stepping stone to submission. The second half of the quote is just as important as the first half. When you show vulnerability, is not a weakness. You show strengths by being vulnerable, by submitting. I don't want a doormat, but I want someone who submits with her head held high. Submission is a gift that you do not give to just anyone. You have a hard time finding a Dom worth respecting, I suspect. Most Doms don't get the subtleties of control and dominance. They focus too much on dominating your mind and do not focus enough on your mind and emotions. I am a 30 year old man, living in the DC area, where I work in a government position (don't worry, not a Trump fan). I have been involved with D/s for near a decade now, with several long term relationships on and offline, with a wide variety of dynamics, from strict TPE to more paternal DD/lg, and everything in-between. I have an active social life, mostly spent with a great smaller group of friends. The rest of my free time is spent in nature or in front of a computer. I love to swim, love to hike and enjoy video games. I would love to find someone who shares more than just her kinky with me, who has similar interests and hobbies. Speaking of interests, I am interested in many topics, movies, books, TV, politics, psychology, philosophy and more. When it comes to D/s relationships, I am strict, firm, creative and open-minded. No kink you have will shock me and I will be eager to make your fantasies become a reality. I focus a lot on dominance outside the bedroom, enjoying control in every aspect of life, beyond just sexually. Personality-wise, I am organized, driven, focused and calm. I plan things to the smallest detail and you will often find me making lists to improve my efficiency. I have found that this side of me works especially well in D/s relationships as well, where I can help improve your life and productivity, motivating you to be better than you have been on your own. I am looking for someone to spend my day with, to talk to and get to know, to explore our minds together. Someone with a personality, who is able to hold a conversation, knows how to ask the right kinds of questions and who feels like something is missing in their lives. Maybe it is a sense of direction or maybe it is missing someone to whisper filthy things in your ear. I am open to both long distance and local. I enjoy taking my time and getting to know someone well. Will you allow yourself to be vulnerable? I am waiting."

I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, but if not, just search for ""hand dominance"" on PornHub or any other adult streaming site. It's the total vulnerability, I suppose, and loss of control. That, combined with the exposure and exhibitionism -- man's genitalia on display while his mistress slinks and skulks in her lingerie or latex bodysuit. She teases him, taunts him, tortures him. His orgasm and pleasure are hers. His *desire* for *her* is his weakness, and she exploits it to the hilt. She edges him. She denies him. She verbally humiliates him. She dictates the terms of his release (and relief). In some scenarios, he arouses himself under her direction: stroke, don't stroke; faster, slower; stop, start. And throughout it all, he is not allowed to come until she give her loving (or demeaning or humiliating) permission. In other cases, she takes control -- his hands are bound, leaving her to milk him. To force him to climax or to entirely deny it. To ruin his orgasms by allowing what might have been a spouting masterpiece devolve into a dribbling mess. To mercilessly jack him in post-orgasm torture. She laughs; she doesn't care. It is her delight to see his much-anticipated gratification reduced to a defeated, drained, and empty sex organ between his legs, wrinkled and flaccid. But is this real? Are there women into this as much as I am? And by that I mean women who don't expect or want to be paid or ""tributed"" for their effort? I kinda think not. It just seems that, despite the appearance of a reverse power play, it is the guy who gains the most from this. What, really, is in it for the woman, other than a chance to be sadistic and cruel?So, am I just left with an especially pathetic sex fantasy? Well, hope springs eternal. And so I am creating this post and hoping some woman out there who would enjoy taking control of me and using me in this way. Is she out there?"

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian.You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will.I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

First, thanks for reading. Second, I want to be upfront that I am married and that my partner is not aware. If thats a problem, please move on and best of luck to you. Ive thought a lot about how to write this post. Im looking for something specific that I know is going to be hard to find. Ive had it in the past and. The sense of fulfillment, purpose, and pure contentment that I felt from it is unparalleled. I dont want to write paragraph after paragraph about me; this would end up being too long. But the best way I think to describe me is that Im thoughtful, experienced, honest, understanding, respectful, and definitely a sadist. I love to discuss what we both want out of a dynamic, I want us both to be equally fulfilled, and I want to enjoy your suffering and be immensely proud of you, to care for you, and cherish you. I believe in being a positive influence on a sub, not just sexually, but personally and professionally. Have a personal goal you want to achieve? Let me help. Have a professional goal you want to obtain? Let me be your guide. Itll bring me joy to teach and guide, its just who I am. I want a connection, more than just sex, talking about our days and interests. Now, what Im looking for is simple, but hard to find. Im looking to build to a 24/7 TPE type relationship. I say build specifically, it will take time and trust and connection. When I think back to the most satisfying relationships I had, they were 24/7 TPE. That depth of trust, honesty, intimacy, control, and vulnerability is wonderful and perfect. When I think of where I want us to get to, this is what I think about: You get home after a day of work, spending the day distracted with your mind on me and your submission to me; my ownership. After you close the door you quickly strip down and dress into whatever clothing, or none, that you were instructed to be wearing for the evening. After dressed you kneel perfectly as youve been taught and let me know youre there and waiting. You wait for my response to direct you to either continue with your pre-assigned tasks or to use you for my enjoyment and pleasure. Your entire day and week are under my control. You are excited to ask me permission to go out with your friends later this week and hope I allow you, hope youve been a good enough girl to earn it. I inspect the job you did with your chores, discuss potential punishment as needed for poor work. We talk about our days, you tell me about the girl at work who noticed your collar today and gave you a funny look and we laugh. We have some incredible play time that leaves you exhausted and content before its at your bed time and we say goodnight. A short list of some of my kinks include: * Spanking * Humiliation, verbal and physical * Bondage * Orgasm control * Tease and denial * Anal * Pain play * Many more If the above interests you, Id love to talk to you.

If you are fairly close by - Then that will most practical! Say - if you live in Southern Sweden, Eastern Denmark or Northern Germany? If you live further away - either we can meet in Copenhagen or Berlin - and I'll show you a wonderful weekend! Guiding you around and making it a experience of a lifetime - a weekend to remember!! I'd love to come and visit you! BUT I have just recently been travelling quite a lot! Going to the UK, Germany and Southern France! And done a roadtrip in the US! New York, Chicago, Saint Louis, Dallas - so I probably won't be going for any longer journeys for the next year or two? Unless you manage to persuade me? Pegging? Hey girl! - You lovely lady! Are you dreaming of being in control - setting the pace, entering a masculine man? Setting the pace, controlling the stroke and deciding the depth of penetration? Well if you want? And we - ""Hit it off"" and have the right ""chemistry""! Then I would LOVE TO fulfill your dream - have YOU - fuck my ass! Don't worry about anything! Don't hesitate! I HAVE THE EXPERIENCE! I have done this before, BUT(T) - not in a long time! This is one of the most amazing Sexual Experiences I've ever had! I've had such mind blowing orgasms that at one time I thought I was going to black out! I'll show you what to do and how to do it! I'll teach you how to make it a amazing act, that is - Safe, Sane and Consensual! Together we will embark on a journey that will blow both of our minds! I'm a mainly dominant man, but if we have the right chemistry and we build up trust - then you are welcome to tie me up and control me! Despite usually being a DomDaddy! In this case - I will give you control! How will we know if we ""hit it off""? The magic is in the meeting! I strongly believe that in a meeting, even one of a nonsexual nature - you can usually sense the connection! But also by videochatting before a meeting! SO! Send me a message! Life is too short to have unfulfilled dreams and fantasies! Why set yourself up for regrets and remorse? When you can safely fulfill your dreams and fantasies and experience something completely different - and perhaps even ""grow as a person""? This first experience is so important that you will benefit from having it with someone experienced! But also someone who is yearning for this, missing it, longing for it and is therefore willing to ""go the extra mile"" - for a amazing shared and mutual experience! A experience of mutual extasy and boundary breaking, mind-opening, intimacy building exploration, a experience of trust and vulnerability! Having a man under you - receptive, vulnerable and a smiling, melted puddle of bliss - covered in his own cum - unless you want it! Pegging? Try it! You won't regret it and you will learn a lot from it - not least about your self! Get new frames of references and blow your comfort zone - wide open! Dare to take control! Dare to unlock your hidden potential and discover new sides of yourself! Send me a message - tell me where you're at! Where you would like to meet and we'll figure something out! Everything is possible! ""Impossible"" - just takes some more, planning, time and effort! Fulfill your desires, dreams and fantasies! No shame, no guilt - just mind blowing extasy and fulfillment! Just DO it! I'm looking forward to meeting you IRL! Love, hugs and kisses! Bob"

Seeking a similar local female for D/s explorations several times a month",1,e3g5dc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/e3g5dc/38m4f_nyc_or_bklyn_intelligent_fun_career/,2019-11-30 02:30:39," 38 male here in NYC. I'm 5'11, 160, fairly good shape, single (divorced) great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy being a dominant. I can be an experienced Daddy Dom as well for good girls who show lots of affection and like to improve, please, and strive to be good and obedient . No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction, want an arrangement where we meet a few times a month, understand the focus is on exploring dominance/submission, and not be lost and excessively clingy. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on vanilla topics. Please remember to add the 4 things I asked for in the first message Thank you"

For the girl who needs to belong, to be owned, to be loved. I want to show you what it is to truly live as a slave. (Online to start, in-person if right.)",1,e3lt3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/e3lt3j/27m4f_for_the_girl_with_the_big_heart_who_loves/,2019-11-30 09:05:39," If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, but if not, just search for ""hand dominance"" on PornHub or any other adult streaming site. It's the total vulnerability, I suppose, and loss of control. That, combined with the exposure and exhibitionism -- man's genitalia on display while his mistress slinks and skulks in her lingerie or latex bodysuit. She teases him, taunts him, tortures him. His orgasm and pleasure are hers. His *desire* for *her* is his weakness, and she exploits it to the hilt. She edges him. She denies him. She verbally humiliates him. She dictates the terms of his release (and relief). In some scenarios, he arouses himself under her direction: stroke, don't stroke; faster, slower; stop, start. And throughout it all, he is not allowed to come until she give her loving (or demeaning or humiliating) permission. In other cases, she takes control -- his hands are bound, leaving her to milk him. To force him to climax or to entirely deny it. To ruin his orgasms by allowing what might have been a spouting masterpiece devolve into a dribbling mess. To mercilessly jack him in post-orgasm torture. She laughs; she doesn't care. It is her delight to see his much-anticipated gratification reduced to a defeated, drained, and empty sex organ between his legs, wrinkled and flaccid. But is this real? Are there women into this as much as I am? And by that I mean women who don't expect or want to be paid or ""tributed"" for their effort? I kinda think not. It just seems that, despite the appearance of a reverse power play, it is the guy who gains the most from this. What, really, is in it for the woman, other than a chance to be sadistic and cruel?So, am I just left with an especially pathetic sex fantasy? Well, hope springs eternal. And so I am creating this post and hoping some woman out there who would enjoy taking control of me and using me in this way. Is she out there?"

First, thanks for reading. Second, I want to be upfront that I am married and that my partner is not aware. If thats a problem, please move on and best of luck to you. Ive thought a lot about how to write this post. Im looking for something specific that I know is going to be hard to find. Ive had it in the past and. The sense of fulfillment, purpose, and pure contentment that I felt from it is unparalleled. I dont want to write paragraph after paragraph about me; this would end up being too long. But the best way I think to describe me is that Im thoughtful, experienced, honest, understanding, respectful, and definitely a sadist. I love to discuss what we both want out of a dynamic, I want us both to be equally fulfilled, and I want to enjoy your suffering and be immensely proud of you, to care for you, and cherish you. I believe in being a positive influence on a sub, not just sexually, but personally and professionally. Have a personal goal you want to achieve? Let me help. Have a professional goal you want to obtain? Let me be your guide. Itll bring me joy to teach and guide, its just who I am. I want a connection, more than just sex, talking about our days and interests. Now, what Im looking for is simple, but hard to find. Im looking to build to a 24/7 TPE type relationship. I say build specifically, it will take time and trust and connection. When I think back to the most satisfying relationships I had, they were 24/7 TPE. That depth of trust, honesty, intimacy, control, and vulnerability is wonderful and perfect. When I think of where I want us to get to, this is what I think about: You get home after a day of work, spending the day distracted with your mind on me and your submission to me; my ownership. After you close the door you quickly strip down and dress into whatever clothing, or none, that you were instructed to be wearing for the evening. After dressed you kneel perfectly as youve been taught and let me know youre there and waiting. You wait for my response to direct you to either continue with your pre-assigned tasks or to use you for my enjoyment and pleasure. Your entire day and week are under my control. You are excited to ask me permission to go out with your friends later this week and hope I allow you, hope youve been a good enough girl to earn it. I inspect the job you did with your chores, discuss potential punishment as needed for poor work. We talk about our days, you tell me about the girl at work who noticed your collar today and gave you a funny look and we laugh. We have some incredible play time that leaves you exhausted and content before its at your bed time and we say goodnight. A short list of some of my kinks include: * Spanking * Humiliation, verbal and physical * Bondage * Orgasm control * Tease and denial * Anal * Pain play * Many more If the above interests you, Id love to talk to you. Please send me a PM with a little bit about yourself and what resonated with you in this post. I hope to connect soon."

I am mostly but not exclusively attracted to femme or androgynous folx, but I'm interested in exploring things more with masc partners. I'm polyam--looking to start taking more of a solo poly approach than before. I would love to find kinky friends and/or play partners from a variety of roles, but a Domme who is into GFD would be my ideal. I am a switch--most of my experience is in a sub role, but I'm interested in taking on either a sub or Dom. My age range for play or dating is about 23-40. I'm like a cross between Ben Wyatt and Ben Wyatt. I like dogs and music and musical dogs (planning to adopt shortly after I move). I also like social justice, progressive politics, podcasts and mental health. I'm a fiend for pop culture in general, and especially TV--hit me up, I've got recommendations for days. I've spent the past few years working in progressive political nonprofits. I'm also into the McElroy Brothers, karaoke, trivia, tabletop and video games, happy hour, yoga, and I'm looking to get more active in terms of exercise/outdoorsy stuff. I'm goofy af, witty, and adorable. I strongly value empathy, radical honesty and vulnerability. I've been told I have a grounding presence and am a good listener. People often find it easy to open up to me. Physically, I'm often told that I'm handsome and well-dressed, and I'm 5'8"" with an average/slightly overweight HWP body type. I might be anywhere from clean-shaven to stubbly, but not really more than that. I have plenty of body hair but not, I think, a gross amount, and mostly just on my front. I'm DDF and get tested regularly (I'm also on PrEP). One thing I can offer a Domme is lots of guidance toward cool pop culture stuff--recommendations for TV/music/movies, pointing you toward neat online writing about the same, compiling things for you--I love doing that stuff! Major kinks for me include gentle femdom, sensory deprivation, sensation play, cougar/cub dynamics, praise, role reversal, anal play, impact, and bondage including rope. I'm very curious about feminization, knife play, electricity and perhaps CNC (as a bottom, and would likely want to try this only as RP the first time). I also am into various forms of group play with pretty much any permutation of genders involved. Limits include scat, blood, vomit, breath play, sounding, and any permanent damage.

I'm 5'11, 160, fairly good shape, single (divorced) great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy being a dominant. Im an experienced Daddy Dom as well for good girls who show lots of affection and like to improve, please, and strive to be good and obedient . No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction, want an arrangement where we meet a few times a month, understand the focus is on exploring dominance/submission, and not be lost and excessively clingy. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on kik or texting on google voice on vanilla topics. Thank you"

To make yourself vulnerable is to show your strength.,1,de86ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/de86ld/30_m4f_to_share_your_weakness_is_to_make_yourself/,2019-10-07 06:39:18,"I admit, I think about that quote far too often. Nonetheless, vulnerability is at the center of what this dynamic should be. One cannot submit without first being vulnerable. To share your weaknesses, to share your dreams, goals, insecurities, fears, darkest thoughts with a partner, and know that he will be there no matter, not judging for anything that you have shared. Vulnerability is not easy. Nothing worth doing is easy. But it's crucial as a stepping stone to submission. The second half of the quote is just as important as the first half. When you show vulnerability, is not a weakness. You show strengths by being vulnerable, by submitting. I don't want a doormat, but I want someone who submits with her head held high. Submission is a gift that you do not give to just anyone. You have a hard time finding a Dom worth respecting, I suspect. Most Doms don't get the subtleties of control and dominance. They focus too much on dominating your mind and do not focus enough on your mind and emotions. I am a 30 year old man, living in the DC area, where I work in a government position (don't worry, not a Trump fan). I have been involved with D/s for near a decade now, with several long term relationships on and offline, with a wide variety of dynamics, from strict TPE to more paternal DD/lg, and everything in-between. I have an active social life, mostly spent with a great smaller group of friends. The rest of my free time is spent in nature or in front of a computer. I love to swim, love to hike and enjoy video games. I would love to find someone who shares more than just her kinky with me, who has similar interests and hobbies. Speaking of interests, I am interested in many topics, movies, books, TV, politics, psychology, philosophy and more. When it comes to D/s relationships, I am strict, firm, creative and open-minded. No kink you have will shock me and I will be eager to make your fantasies become a reality. I focus a lot on dominance outside the bedroom, enjoying control in every aspect of life, beyond just sexually. Personality-wise, I am organized, driven, focused and calm. I plan things to the smallest detail and you will often find me making lists to improve my efficiency. I have found that this side of me works especially well in D/s relationships as well, where I can help improve your life and productivity, motivating you to be better than you have been on your own. I am looking for someone to spend my day with, to talk to and get to know, to explore our minds together. Someone with a personality, who is able to hold a conversation, knows how to ask the right kinds of questions and who feels like something is missing in their lives. Maybe it is a sense of direction or maybe it is missing someone to whisper filthy things in your ear. I am open to both long distance and local. I enjoy taking my time and getting to know someone well. Will you allow yourself to be vulnerable? I am waiting."
233,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,47(M4F) - I found the perfect sub! She's just waiting to reply! ;),1,delgtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/delgtz/47m4f_i_found_the_perfect_sub_shes_just_waiting/,2019-10-08 03:02:44,"Hello there. I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games until all hours. (Way too much WoW lately) - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. - Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. - Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. - Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting. - Obedience and compliance, as well as meticulous control and attention is what gets me going. - *Extras:* Slut shaming, behavior modification focused degradation/humiliation, body marking, ownership enforcement, etc. **In my perfect world, my submissive partner would be:** - Based here in the US, preferably in the east coast for timezone purposes. - Between 25-50 years old. - Available *sometime* within my available weekday hours (7a-7p EST) - Highly attentive and communicative. - Looking to live our long distance/separate lives together as much as we possibly can. Not confining ourselves to specific areas of sharing our lives together but opening up every facet of our lives to one another over time and trust. - Excited by the idea of mutual obsession, infatuation, and utter devotion. - Experienced OR actively learning and reading to gain more experience. - A strong speaker with high expectations for command of the English language . - Witty, dry sarcasm, dark humor are all a plus (please don't drown me in your lol's. I'll admit I am a sucker for a good placed GIF though). - Emotionally available. - Married or unmarried, tethered or untethered is irrelevant. Must be transparent with me and my expectation is some degree of monogamy even if you are in a LTR or married at some point. I'm not looking to be #3 in your rotation. To clarify further, in a long term concept with someone who is also married/in a LTR, I'm not looking for either of us to be in a relationship (physical or emotional) with anyone outside of each other and our respective partners. **Communication:** - Hangouts (text, voice/video calls), telegram, emails, kik (as a last resort unfortunately, plus it's going away soon), snail mail (PO box -- I'm not that insane), or in person. I've posted here before and met some amazing people, but ultimately long term wise, it hasn't lasted to what I've wanted. If you aren't interested in having deep conversations or in writing detailing responses, please don't bother to reach out to me. Include a name or alias that isn't your screen name, A/S/L, communication preferences, and precisely what in this post moved you to reach out. Thank you."

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with?

You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest.

240,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,27 [M4F] Toronto / Montral / Online - Looking for one clingy and needy woman,0,dleazt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/dleazt/27_m4f_toronto_montréal_online_looking_for_one/,2019-10-22 18:13:02,"When directed toward me, there are behaviours that, no matter how blatantly transparent, manipulate me; they speak to something inside me, gratify me, and invoke a clarity of thought and aggressive focus nothing else does. The primary factor here is docility. What arouses me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem a little off-balance. I want her to be comfortable with other people but not necessarily herself. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show submission to me in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to help you carry something. Be a little shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. I demand blatant favouritism in how you treat me versus how you treat others. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval. If you've read this far, then you know you need this and you will reach out to open up to me. Install the Telegram messaging app on your phone and follow up with your username. Tell me about yourself in general."

I'm 5'11, 160, fairly good shape, single (divorced) great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy being a dominant. Im an experienced Daddy Dom as well for good girls who show lots of affection and like to improve, please, and strive to be good and obedient . No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction, want an arrangement where we meet a few times a month, understand the focus is on exploring dominance/submission, and not be lost and excessively clingy. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Im only interested in those that have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on vanilla topics. Thank you"
242,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] To share your weakness is to make yourself vulnerable. To make yourself vulnerable is to show your strength.,0,dnx8hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/dnx8hf/30_m4f_to_share_your_weakness_is_to_make_yourself/,2019-10-28 05:13:28,"I admit, I think about that quote far too often. Nonetheless, vulnerability is at the center of what this dynamic should be. One cannot submit without first being vulnerable. To share your weaknesses, to share your dreams, goals, insecurities, fears, darkest thoughts with a partner, and know that he will be there no matter, not judging for anything that you have shared. Vulnerability is not easy. Nothing worth doing is easy. But it's crucial as a stepping stone to submission. The second half of the quote is just as important as the first half. When you show vulnerability, is not a weakness. You show strengths by being vulnerable, by submitting. I don't want a doormat, but I want someone who submits with her head held high. Submission is a gift that you do not give to just anyone. You have a hard time finding a Dom worth respecting, I suspect. Most Doms don't get the subtleties of control and dominance. They focus too much on dominating your mind and do not focus enough on your mind and emotions. I am a 30 year old man, living in the DC area, where I work in a government position (don't worry, not a Trump fan). I have been involved with D/s for near a decade now, with several long term relationships on and offline, with a wide variety of dynamics, from strict TPE to more paternal DD/lg, and everything in-between. I have an active social life, mostly spent with a great smaller group of friends. The rest of my free time is spent in nature or in front of a computer. I love to swim, love to hike and enjoy video games. I would love to find someone who shares more than just her kinky with me, who has similar interests and hobbies. Speaking of interests, I am interested in many topics, movies, books, TV, politics, psychology, philosophy and more. When it comes to D/s relationships, I am strict, firm, creative and open-minded. No kink you have will shock me and I will be eager to make your fantasies become a reality. I focus a lot on dominance outside the bedroom, enjoying control in every aspect of life, beyond just sexually. Personality-wise, I am organized, driven, focused and calm. I plan things to the smallest detail and you will often find me making lists to improve my efficiency. I have found that this side of me works especially well in D/s relationships as well, where I can help improve your life and productivity, motivating you to be better than you have been on your own. I am looking for someone to spend my day with, to talk to and get to know, to explore our minds together. Someone with a personality, who is able to hold a conversation, knows how to ask the right kinds of questions and who feels like something is missing in their lives. Maybe it is a sense of direction or maybe it is missing someone to whisper filthy things in your ear. I am open to both long distance and local. I enjoy taking my time and getting to know someone well. Will you allow yourself to be vulnerable? I am waiting."

First, thanks for reading. Second, I want to be upfront that I am married and that my partner is not aware. If thats a problem, please move on and best of luck to you. Ive thought a lot about how to write this post. Im looking for something specific that I know is going to be hard to find. Ive had it in the past and. The sense of fulfillment, purpose, and pure contentment that I felt from it is unparalleled. I dont want to write paragraph after paragraph about me; this would end up being too long. But the best way I think to describe me is that Im thoughtful, experienced, honest, understanding, respectful, and definitely a sadist. I love to discuss what we both want out of a dynamic, I want us both to be equally fulfilled, and I want to enjoy your suffering and be immensely proud of you, to care for you, and cherish you. I believe in being a positive influence on a sub, not just sexually, but personally and professionally. Have a personal goal you want to achieve? Let me help. Have a professional goal you want to obtain? Let me be your guide. Itll bring me joy to teach and guide, its just who I am. I want a connection, more than just sex, talking about our days and interests. Now, what Im looking for is simple, but hard to find. Im looking to build to a 24/7 TPE type relationship. I say build specifically, it will take time and trust and connection. When I think back to the most satisfying relationships I had, they were 24/7 TPE. That depth of trust, honesty, intimacy, control, and vulnerability is wonderful and perfect. When I think of where I want us to get to, this is what I think about: You get home after a day of work, spending the day distracted with your mind on me and your submission to me; my ownership. After you close the door you quickly strip down and dress into whatever clothing, or none, that you were instructed to be wearing for the evening. After dressed you kneel perfectly as youve been taught and let me know youre there and waiting. You wait for my response to direct you to either continue with your pre-assigned tasks or to use you for my enjoyment and pleasure. Your entire day and week are under my control. You are excited to ask me permission to go out with your friends later this week and hope I allow you, hope youve been a good enough girl to earn it. I inspect the job you did with your chores, discuss potential punishment as needed for poor work. We talk about our days, you tell me about the girl at work who noticed your collar today and gave you a funny look and we laugh. We have some incredible play time that leaves you exhausted and content before its at your bed time and we say goodnight. A short list of some of my kinks include: * Spanking * Humiliation, verbal and physical * Bondage * Orgasm control * Tease and denial * Anal * Pain play * Many more If the above interests you, Id love to talk to you. Please send me a PM with a little bit about yourself and what resonated with you in this post. I hope to connect soon."

Nonetheless, vulnerability is at the center of what this dynamic should be. One cannot submit without first being vulnerable. To share your weaknesses, to share your dreams, goals, insecurities, fears, darkest thoughts with a partner, and know that he will be there no matter, not judging for anything that you have shared. Vulnerability is not easy. Nothing worth doing is easy. But it's crucial as a stepping stone to submission. The second half of the quote is just as important as the first half. When you show vulnerability, is not a weakness. You show strengths by being vulnerable, by submitting. I don't want a doormat, but I want someone who submits with her head held high. Submission is a gift that you do not give to just anyone. You have a hard time finding a Dom worth respecting, I suspect. Most Doms don't get the subtleties of control and dominance. They focus too much on dominating your mind and do not focus enough on your mind and emotions. I am a 30 year old man, living in the DC area, where I work in a government position (don't worry, not a Trump fan). I have been involved with D/s for near a decade now, with several long term relationships on and offline, with a wide variety of dynamics, from strict TPE to more paternal DD/lg, and everything in-between. I have an active social life, mostly spent with a great smaller group of friends. The rest of my free time is spent in nature or in front of a computer. I love to swim, love to hike and enjoy video games. I would love to find someone who shares more than just her kinky with me, who has similar interests and hobbies. Speaking of interests, I am interested in many topics, movies, books, TV, politics, psychology, philosophy and more. When it comes to D/s relationships, I am strict, firm, creative and open-minded. No kink you have will shock me and I will be eager to make your fantasies become a reality. I focus a lot on dominance outside the bedroom, enjoying control in every aspect of life, beyond just sexually. Personality-wise, I am organized, driven, focused and calm. I plan things to the smallest detail and you will often find me making lists to improve my efficiency. I have found that this side of me works especially well in D/s relationships as well, where I can help improve your life and productivity, motivating you to be better than you have been on your own. I am looking for someone to spend my day with, to talk to and get to know, to explore our minds together. Someone with a personality, who is able to hold a conversation, knows how to ask the right kinds of questions and who feels like something is missing in their lives. Maybe it is a sense of direction or maybe it is missing someone to whisper filthy things in your ear. I am open to both long distance and local. I enjoy taking my time and getting to know someone well. Will you allow yourself to be vulnerable? I am waiting."

For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with?

Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."
254,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] To share your weakness is to make yourself vulnerable. To make yourself vulnerable is to show your strength.,0,d2g7fj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/d2g7fj/30_m4f_to_share_your_weakness_is_to_make_yourself/,2019-09-11 08:57:32,"I admit, I think about that quote far too often. Nonetheless, vulnerability is at the center of what this dynamic should be. One cannot submit without first being vulnerable. To share your weaknesses, to share your dreams, goals, insecurities, fears, darkest thoughts with a partner, and know that he will be there no matter, not judging for anything that you have shared. Vulnerability is not easy. Nothing worth doing is easy. But it's crucial as a stepping stone to submission. The second half of the quote is just as important as the first half. When you show vulnerability, is not a weakness. You show strengths by being vulnerable, by submitting. I don't want a doormat, but I want someone who submits with her head held high. Submission is a gift that you do not give to just anyone. You have a hard time finding a Dom worth respecting, I suspect. Most Doms don't get the subtleties of control and dominance. They focus too much on dominating your mind and do not focus enough on your mind and emotions. I am a 30 year old man, living in the DC area, where I work in a government position (don't worry, not a Trump fan). I have been involved with D/s for near a decade now, with several long term relationships on and offline, with a wide variety of dynamics, from strict TPE to more paternal DD/lg, and everything in-between. I have an active social life, mostly spent with a great smaller group of friends. The rest of my free time is spent in nature or in front of a computer. I love to swim, love to hike and enjoy video games. I would love to find someone who shares more than just her kinky with me, who has similar interests and hobbies. Speaking of interests, I am interested in many topics, movies, books, TV, politics, psychology, philosophy and more. When it comes to D/s relationships, I am strict, firm, creative and open-minded. No kink you have will shock me and I will be eager to make your fantasies become a reality. I focus a lot on dominance outside the bedroom, enjoying control in every aspect of life, beyond just sexually. Personality-wise, I am organized, driven, focused and calm. I plan things to the smallest detail and you will often find me making lists to improve my efficiency. I have found that this side of me works especially well in D/s relationships as well, where I can help improve your life and productivity, motivating you to be better than you have been on your own. I am looking for someone to spend my day with, to talk to and get to know, to explore our minds together. Someone with a personality, who is able to hold a conversation, knows how to ask the right kinds of questions and who feels like something is missing in their lives. Maybe it is a sense of direction or maybe it is missing someone to whisper filthy things in your ear. I am open to both long distance and local. I enjoy taking my time and getting to know someone well. Will you allow yourself to be vulnerable? I am waiting."

My treasure, my loyal servant, my slave.",1,d2y6mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/d2y6mh/26_m4f_looking_for_the_most_important_person_in/,2019-09-12 08:27:06," If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

First, thanks for reading. Second, I want to be upfront that I am married and that my partner is not aware. If thats a problem, please move on and best of luck to you. Ive thought a lot about how to write this post. Im looking for something specific that I know is going to be hard to find. Ive had it in the past and. The sense of fulfillment, purpose, and pure contentment that I felt from it is unparalleled. I dont want to write paragraph after paragraph about me; this would end up being too long. But the best way I think to describe me is that Im thoughtful, experienced, honest, understanding, respectful, and definitely a sadist. I love to discuss what we both want out of a dynamic, I want us both to be equally fulfilled, and I want to enjoy your suffering and be immensely proud of you, to care for you, and cherish you. I believe in being a positive influence on a sub, not just sexually, but personally, professionally. Have a personal goal you want to achieve? Let me help. Have a professional goal you want to obtain? Let me be your guide. Itll bring me joy to teach and guide, its just who I am. I want a connection, more than just sex, talking about our days and interests. Now, what Im looking for is simple, but hard to find. Im looking to build to a 24/7 TPE type relationship. I say build specifically, it will take time and trust and connection. When I think back to the most satisfying relationships I had, they were 24/7 TPE. That depth of trust, honesty, intimacy, control, and vulnerability is wonderful and perfect. When I think of where I want us to get to, this is what I think about: You get home after a day of work, spending the day distracted with your mind on me and your submission to me; my ownership. After you close the door you quickly strip down and dress into whatever clothing, or none, that you were instructed to be wearing for the evening. After dressed you kneel perfectly as youve been taught and let me know youre there and waiting. You wait for my response to direct you to either continue with your pre-assigned tasks or to use you for my enjoyment and pleasure. Your entire day and week are under my control. You are excited to ask me permission to go out with your friends later this week and hope I allow you, hope youve been a good enough girl to earn it. I inspect the job you did with your chores, discuss potential punishment as needed for poor work. We talk about our days, you tell me about the girl at work who noticed your collar today and gave you a funny look and we laugh. We have some incredible play time that leaves you exhausted and content before its at your bed time and we say goodnight. A short list of some of my kinks include: * Spanking * Humiliation, verbal and physical * Bondage * Orgasm control * Tease and Denial * Anal * Pain play * Many more If the above interests you, Id love to talk to you. Please send me a PM with a little bit about yourself and what resonated with you in this post. I hope to connect soon."

No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction, want an arrangement where we meet a few times a month, understand the focus is on exploring dominance/submission, and not be lost and excessively clingy. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Im only interested in those that have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on kik or texting on google voice on vanilla topics. Thank you"

In a nutshell, I'm a pretty normal 26-year-old girl, just trying to live my best life and make better choices for myself as I figure out what the fuck this whole adulthood thing is about. (How did my fridge get covered in wedding invites? When did my high school friendships become a neverending purgatory of ""let's grab coffee""? What's the deal with fabric softener? etc.) I have a semi-established diet/gym routine that I've lost \~20lbs with, but I've hit a plateau this year and could use some help. I'm pretty kinky thrive on structure and direction, so I figure with the right person maybe I can kill two birds with one stone? I'm looking for the kind of person who enjoys being given access to very intimate details of a sub's life, and micromanaging parts of it with rules we create together. If sexually charged vulnerability and exploring the erotic little facets of control sends a shiver down your spine... we might be a good fit. **Me:** 5'6"", 185 lbs, cute face, mildly nerdy, submissive with a fun curvy body that I like showing off. I'm in the US, about to start a career that I'm super excited about and probably have too many hobbies for my own good (but I do in fact have communication and time management skills, so don't let that scare you.) I love meeting new people and get along with basically everyone. **You:** Kind(!) but firm, confident, reliable, and body-positive with an appreciation for chubby girls. If you're working on your own fitness goals this is even something we could do together. I'm into lots of different body types and I don't expect you to be some crazy fit nutrition guru or anything. I would prefer someone nonmonogamous whether or not you're in a relationship right now. **What I'm looking for/offering:** I have a few goals that include getting to a healthier weight by being more disciplined about diet and exercise. I've had some success with using D/s for mentorship/motivation in the past and I'd really like to explore the full potential of that. I'm looking for someone who would enjoy collaborating on rules and enforcing structure through regular monitoring + reasonable rewards/punishments with some kinky fun in between. The specifics of that are fully negotiable, but ultimately I do want this to be positive and constructive, absolutely not a fat humiliation thing or some effort to ""be hotter"" masquerading as concern for health. I know it's a lot to ask for, but in return I promise this will be fun! I'm a little insatiable and have lots of kinks. We almost definitely have a few in common. I absolutely love dirty talk and showing off while we get to know each other, if you're into that. I'm not particularly shy about what I want and like. I'm really into obedience and being a good girl, and even though it can be fun to playfully push your buttons, I'm not particularly bratty. If you're cool and we have chemistry then I'll really want to please you. Whew, thanks for reading my wall of text! I'm really focused on finding something longer-term with the right person, so if that kind of arrangement ticks some boxes for you, I'd love to chat and find out if we're a good fit."

These are the methods by which my partners turn me on most. The primary factor here is docility. What arouses me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem a little off-balance. I don't mind if she's gregarious or even aggressive. I want her to be comfortable with other people but not necessarily herself. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show submission to me in yours. You need to think of yourself not as a person, but a thing for me to own. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to help you carry something. You need me to walk you to your car. Be a little shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. I demand blatant favouritism in how you treat me versus how you treat others. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. If you want me to feel aggressive and dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval. If you've read this far, then you know you need this and you will reach out to open up to me. Install the Telegram messaging app on your phone and follow up with your username or phone number."

Im a hopeless romantic, not even close to 7 foot tall but most likely taller than you so dont worry, otherwise pretty normal guy who cant believe hes 19 already and who rarely lets his facial hair go past a few days stubble. I like wandering through the park, befriending strangers dogs, I reply quickly and I will take a quiet night in vs. a loud night out any day of the week, I take excellent care of myself, can talk your ear off about diet and fitness and will probably ask you to come to the gym with me at some point, and think I look ok in a suit as well as out of one. Im also a dom, even though I dont like labels and am still not entirely sure what it means and have yet to explore much of what that even is as Ive been saving it for the right person who I have most likely yet to meet. I mention all of this because its important, much more important than a tedious list of kinks and limits, because Im a person with a life Im passionate about, complete with flaws and imperfections and surprises and depths you should want to learn and love before we discuss our favorite spanking implements (my hands). D/s is not just a sexual dynamic to me; the intense and awesome depth of sexuality it can offer is, instead, an expression and reflection of the intense and awesome vulnerability and love that exist between a dom and his sub. The possession, hunger, electricity, utter filth, blissful peace, and terrifying beauty inherent in an ideal dynamic stem from the mind and the heart, over time and trust, not from hormones in a moment of physical weakness. I need cuddles, patience, warmth, unconditional praise of my cooking, unabashed nerdiness, unwavering loyalty, unlimited kindness, and an embarrassing amount of kissing. But I also need to be able to stop you mid-sentence with a look, pull you to your knees by your hair, earn and exercise complete control over your orgasms, and call you a good girl knowing full well what that does to you. Im a dom, and Im looking for a sub. Not a little/sub, but rather my little/sub. Like a one and only forever sort of deal that starts in friendship and blossoms into a love that would make the rest of the world jealous if they could ever understand. I want to date like normal people, only knowing that the endgame includes and involves much more than 5 minutes of missionary once a week. Im not looking for my equal; Im looking for my complement. We will likely be very different in many ways, and I hope we can both learn so much from each other as we build a loving relationship alongside a beautiful d/s dynamic. Maybe weve shared the same dream our whole lives and, in some sense, already know each other better than anyone else. I hope this was enough to ignite the spark we need to connect. we will never know if you dont reach out. Im not going anywhere, I wont bite (yet), and am clearly a fan of epically long letters, creativity, and originality. But, Just be you. Thats all I can ever ask of you, even without knowing you yet. Im ready. Are you?"

For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. Let's start with some definitions slave: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. Dominant: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. Master/slave relationship: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. What will this relationship consist of: Active submission: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. Daily controls: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. Daily tasks: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. Weekly sessions: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. Punishments: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. What will be expected of you: Commitment: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. Devotion: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. Communication: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. Trust: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. Emotional intimacy: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. Physical intimacy: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. What you can expect from me: A Strong Hand: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. A Warm Heart: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. If you're interested Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest.

263,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,47(M4F) - I found the perfect sub! She's just waiting to reply! ;),1,d7f1xf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/d7f1xf/47m4f_i_found_the_perfect_sub_shes_just_waiting/,2019-09-22 05:31:11,"Hello there. I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games until all hours. (Way too much WoW lately) - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. - Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. - Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. - Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting. - Obedience and compliance, as well as meticulous control and attention is what gets me going. - *Extras:* Slut shaming, behavior modification focused degradation/humiliation, body marking, ownership enforcement, etc. **In my perfect world, my submissive partner would be:** - Based here in the US, preferably in the east coast for timezone purposes. - Between 25-50 years old. - Available *sometime* within my available weekday hours (7a-7p EST) - Highly attentive and communicative. - Looking to live our long distance/separate lives together as much as we possibly can. Not confining ourselves to specific areas of sharing our lives together but opening up every facet of our lives to one another over time and trust. - Excited by the idea of mutual obsession, infatuation, and utter devotion. - Experienced OR actively learning and reading to gain more experience. - A strong speaker with high expectations for command of the English language . - Witty, dry sarcasm, dark humor are all a plus (please don't drown me in your lol's. I'll admit I am a sucker for a good placed GIF though). - Emotionally available. - Married or unmarried, tethered or untethered is irrelevant. Must be transparent with me and my expectation is some degree of monogamy even if you are in a LTR or married at some point. I'm not looking to be #3 in your rotation. To clarify further, in a long term concept with someone who is also married/in a LTR, I'm not looking for either of us to be in a relationship (physical or emotional) with anyone outside of each other and our respective partners. **Communication:** - Hangouts (text, voice/video calls), telegram, emails, kik (as a last resort unfortunately), snail mail (PO box -- I'm not that insane), or in person. I've posted here before and met some amazing people, but ultimately long term wise, it hasn't lasted to what I've wanted. If you aren't interested in having deep conversations or in writing detailing responses, please don't bother to reach out to me. Include a name or alias that isn't your screen name, A/S/L, communication preferences, and precisely what in this post moved you to reach out. Thank you."

I'm 5'11, 160, fairly good shape, single (divorced) great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy being a dominant. Im an experienced Daddy Dom as well for good girls who show lots of affection and like to improve, please, and strive to be good and obedient . No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction, want an arrangement where we meet a few times a month, understand the focus is on exploring dominance/submission, and not be lost and excessively clingy. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Im only interested in those that have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on kik or texting on google voice on vanilla topics. Thank you"

It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"
269,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] To share your weakness is to make yourself vulnerable. To make yourself vulnerable is to show your strength.,4,dab7a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/dab7a8/30_m4f_to_share_your_weakness_is_to_make_yourself/,2019-09-28 14:02:35,"I admit, I think about that quote far too often. Nonetheless, vulnerability is at the center of what this dynamic should be. One cannot submit without first being vulnerable. To share your weaknesses, to share your dreams, goals, insecurities, fears, darkest thoughts with a partner, and know that he will be there no matter, not judging for anything that you have shared. Vulnerability is not easy. Nothing worth doing is easy. But it's crucial as a stepping stone to submission. The second half of the quote is just as important as the first half. When you show vulnerability, is not a weakness. You show strengths by being vulnerable, by submitting. I don't want a doormat, but I want someone who submits with her head held high. Submission is a gift that you do not give to just anyone. You have a hard time finding a Dom worth respecting, I suspect. Most Doms don't get the subtleties of control and dominance. They focus too much on dominating your mind and do not focus enough on your mind and emotions. I am a 30 year old man, living in the DC area, where I work in a government position (don't worry, not a Trump fan). I have been involved with D/s for near a decade now, with several long term relationships on and offline, with a wide variety of dynamics, from strict TPE to more paternal DD/lg, and everything in-between. I have an active social life, mostly spent with a great smaller group of friends. The rest of my free time is spent in nature or in front of a computer. I love to swim, love to hike and enjoy video games. I would love to find someone who shares more than just her kinky with me, who has similar interests and hobbies. Speaking of interests, I am interested in many topics, movies, books, TV, politics, psychology, philosophy and more. When it comes to D/s relationships, I am strict, firm, creative and open-minded. No kink you have will shock me and I will be eager to make your fantasies become a reality. I focus a lot on dominance outside the bedroom, enjoying control in every aspect of life, beyond just sexually. Personality-wise, I am organized, driven, focused and calm. I plan things to the smallest detail and you will often find me making lists to improve my efficiency. I have found that this side of me works especially well in D/s relationships as well, where I can help improve your life and productivity, motivating you to be better than you have been on your own. I am looking for someone to spend my day with, to talk to and get to know, to explore our minds together. Someone with a personality, who is able to hold a conversation, knows how to ask the right kinds of questions and who feels like something is missing in their lives. Maybe it is a sense of direction or maybe it is missing someone to whisper filthy things in your ear. I am open to both long distance and local. I enjoy taking my time and getting to know someone well. Will you allow yourself to be vulnerable? I am waiting."

I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Im only interested in those that have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste.

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

First, thanks for reading. Second, I want to be upfront that I am married and that my partner is not aware. If thats a problem, please move on and best of luck to you. Ive thought a lot about how to write this post. Im looking for something specific that I know is going to be hard to find. Ive had it in the past and. The sense of fulfillment, purpose, and pure contentment that I felt from it is unparalleled. I dont want to write paragraph after paragraph about me; this would end up being too long. But the best way I think to describe me is that Im thoughtful, experienced, honest, understanding, respectful, and definitely a sadist. I love to discuss what we both want out of a dynamic, I want us both to be equally fulfilled, and I want to enjoy your suffering and be immensely proud of you, to care for you, and cherish you. I believe in being a positive influence on a sub, not just sexually, but personally and professionally. Have a personal goal you want to achieve? Let me help. Have a professional goal you want to obtain? Let me be your guide. Itll bring me joy to teach and guide, its just who I am. I want a connection, more than just sex, talking about our days and interests. Now, what Im looking for is simple, but hard to find. Im looking to build to a 24/7 TPE type relationship. I say build specifically, it will take time and trust and connection. When I think back to the most satisfying relationships I had, they were 24/7 TPE. That depth of trust, honesty, intimacy, control, and vulnerability is wonderful and perfect. When I think of where I want us to get to, this is what I think about: You get home after a day of work, spending the day distracted with your mind on me and your submission to me; my ownership. After you close the door you quickly strip down and dress into whatever clothing, or none, that you were instructed to be wearing for the evening. After dressed you kneel perfectly as youve been taught and let me know youre there and waiting. You wait for my response to direct you to either continue with your pre-assigned tasks or to use you for my enjoyment and pleasure. Your entire day and week are under my control. You are excited to ask me permission to go out with your friends later this week and hope I allow you, hope youve been a good enough girl to earn it. I inspect the job you did with your chores, discuss potential punishment as needed for poor work. We talk about our days, you tell me about the girl at work who noticed your collar today and gave you a funny look and we laugh. We have some incredible play time that leaves you exhausted and content before its at your bed time and we say goodnight. A short list of some of my kinks include: * Spanking * Humiliation, verbal and physical * Bondage * Orgasm control * Tease and denial * Anal * Pain play * Many more If the above interests you, Id love to talk to you. Please send me a PM with a little bit about yourself and what resonated with you in this post. I hope to connect soon."

Ive met loads of great people, but I think that the connection means such different things to people. Were coming from such different places in life, and needs vary so greatly between people. As I let go of the relationships that werent mine to keep, I hope that I have learned enough to be able to better articulate what Im looking for. About me: Im in my mid-40s and from the East coast US. Im married and have children. I am limited in my ability to do phone calls, videos, and pictures. Thats ok with me, because I love writing creatively. To me, so much of this is mental. That doesnt mean that Im not sexual, or that Im against pictures. It just means that Im limited. Physically I am petite, but curvy. I have Irish features, and am most frequently described as cute. I am devoted. Im needy in the sense that I will always crave my Dom, but I have no trouble with supporting him in work and life. That means expecting the need for space to meet needs in those areas too. I know that DD/lg means different things to people. I am not a little in the sense of stuffies and coloring. For me, its more about vulnerability. I do not want someone who is just a nurturing type, picking clothing and such. Thats not me. I need someone who is ok with being called Daddy. I need someone that I can trust completely who will challenge me. I need someone who is ok with navigating the unrealized damage of an emotionally abusive spouse. I enjoy the intimacy of water sports. I am extremely open, and need someone who is as well. About you: I am looking for someone who is similarly aged. You are also married and in a relationship that does not meet your needs. I believe that we need to be in similar life places. You are over feeling guilty, and need the to be one of the priorities in your life. You are comfortable with who you are and what you crave. You consider this real. You are not looking for role play. You are intelligent, and in a creative field of work. You are emotionally available for the right person. You are connection driven. You enjoy reading and writing, and you are politically liberal. Youre confident in yourself as a person and Dom. I appreciate that people are in different places in their journey, but I cant be with another person who is just beginning, and unsure of their path. Anyone who has had any success on this journey realizes that these relationships can be very intense and emotional. If that is not something you are ready for, please dont respond. If you are someone that deletes accounts regularly, and goes through bouts of being online, do not respond. I need someone who recognizes what they need and embraces it. I communicate via Hangouts only. No reddit change messages please. Please respond with your age and location, as well as some details about yourself and what you are hoping to find. Thank you."

For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest.

(Online to start.)",0,cpg23o,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/cpg23o/26m4f_master_seeks_his_true_slave_for_a/,2019-08-13 04:03:21,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me.

Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important.

Polyamorous and pansexual. **This is what I can offer to a potential Domme:** * I can offer admiration towards my dominant. * I can write journals that expose my thoughts to you as both an act of submission as a way for you to understand me, how we're doing without you having to directly respond to me about what I write. * I can offer... well lewds. I'm a big exhibitionist and for the right Dominant whom I trust. I'm willing to show myself off specifically to them. * I think I'm cute. At least people tell me so. And that's what I can offer. * I can offer direct communication. I can be pretty direct and no nonsense. I know what I like and dislike. and while I may feel nervous sharing some of my darker kinks, if I feel ready to tell you it and you're ready to hear it, I'll tell you. * I can do voice and I can moan for you. * I can offer myself as a person who knows about consent and wants to do that as well as she can. * I can be a gaming buddy (PC) and I can be a listening ear. * I can offer you my emotional vulnerability. * I can offer a cock that willingly likes to be in chastity. (though within reason) * As a person who likes protocol, I can offer verbal affirmation that you are my Domme through etiquette and respectful phrasing. *** If that sounds nice to you, let me know. even if we're not a good match, I'd love feedback. I'm a space geek who places games and loves watching Netflix. (oh i can watch Netflix with you while on Discord) I'm fond of sex positivity, queer advocacy and... makeup and fashion... dancing the night away on the rare ocassions I go out. :P If you want to know my kinks, feel free to ask. But generally it's D/S (I call it powerplay) My few requirements are that: * You don't ghost me because that stuff hurts. * perhaps not believe in astrology if that's not too much to ask. * You be willing to communicate too. without it, there's no hope of a relationship. *** ***Pride may be over but the struggle continues.***"

Nonetheless, vulnerability is at the center of what this dynamic should be. One cannot submit without first being vulnerable. To share your weaknesses, to share your dreams, goals, insecurities, fears, darkest thoughts with a partner, and know that he will be there no matter, not judging for anything that you have shared. Vulnerability is not easy. Nothing worth doing is easy. But it's crucial as a stepping stone to submission. The second half of the quote is just as important as the first half. When you show vulnerability, is not a weakness. You show strengths by being vulnerable, by submitting. I don't want a doormat, but I want someone who submits with her head held high. Submission is a gift that you do not give to just anyone. You have a hard time finding a Dom worth respecting, I suspect. Most Doms don't get the subtleties of control and dominance. They focus too much on dominating your mind and do not focus enough on your mind and emotions. I am a 30 year old man, living in the DC area, where I work in a government position (don't worry, not a Trump fan). I have been involved with D/s for near a decade now, with several long term relationships on and offline, with a wide variety of dynamics, from strict TPE to more paternal DD/lg, and everything in-between. I have an active social life, mostly spent with a great smaller group of friends. The rest of my free time is spent in nature or in front of a computer. I love to swim, love to hike and enjoy video games. I would love to find someone who shares more than just her kinky with me, who has similar interests and hobbies. Speaking of interests, I am interested in many topics, movies, books, TV, politics, psychology, philosophy and more. When it comes to D/s relationships, I am strict, firm, creative and open-minded. No kink you have will shock me and I will be eager to make your fantasies become a reality. I focus a lot on dominance outside the bedroom, enjoying control in every aspect of life, beyond just sexually. Personality-wise, I am organized, driven, focused and calm. I plan things to the smallest detail and you will often find me making lists to improve my efficiency. I have found that this side of me works especially well in D/s relationships as well, where I can help improve your life and productivity, motivating you to be better than you have been on your own. I am looking for someone to spend my day with, to talk to and get to know, to explore our minds together. Someone with a personality, who is able to hold a conversation, knows how to ask the right kinds of questions and who feels like something is missing in their lives. Maybe it is a sense of direction or maybe it is missing someone to whisper filthy things in your ear. I am open to both long distance and local. I enjoy taking my time and getting to know someone well. Will you allow yourself to be vulnerable? I am waiting."

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"
286,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,[M4F] Toronto / Montral / Online - Need me. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me.,1,cult0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/cult0b/m4f_toronto_montréal_online_need_me_be_sad_be/,2019-08-24 09:33:55,"When directed toward me, there are behaviours that, no matter how blatantly transparent, manipulate me; they speak to something inside me, gratify me, and invoke a clarity of thought and aggressive focus nothing else does. These are the methods by which my partners turn me on most. The primary factor here is docility. What arouses me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem a little off-balance. I don't mind if she's gregarious or even aggressive. I want her to be comfortable with other people but not necessarily herself. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show submission to me in yours. You need to think of yourself not as a person, but a thing for me to own. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to help you carry something. You need me to walk you to your car. Be a little shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. I demand blatant favouritism in how you treat me versus how you treat others. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. If you want me to feel aggressive and dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval. If you've read this far, then you know you need this and you will reach out to open up to me. Install the Telegram messaging app on your phone and follow up with your username or phone number."

(Online to start.)",1,cwkykr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/cwkykr/26m4f_master_seeks_his_true_slave_for_a/,2019-08-28 23:40:08,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

I am a 28 year old woman who thrives from a DD/lg relationship. I have a penchant for the mental and emotional side of the dynamic, both weighing in more heavily than the physical/sexual aspects for me. I'd rather put my kinks on display. I have many, they are not static, many are situational. I'm happy to discuss with the right person at the right time. I live in EST and believe that you being in a similar time zone would be beneficial to our relationship, this is negotiable. I am not single and not poly; I'll let you do the math. But for these reasons, our relationship will likely only ever be online. Notwithstanding that limitation, I am seeking something virtually boundless. I crave companionship, romance, control, vulnerability, nurture, and so much more. I am open to all ages and body types. I am a plus size woman myself. What I'm looking for is truly substantial, so please be mature and patient. If you are just looking for pictures or play, move along. I'm looking to build something beautiful long before it becomes filthy. If we sound like a fit, please don't hesitate to reach out."

Please read 38 male here in NYC. I'm 5'11, 160, fairly good shape, single (divorced) great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy being a Daddy Dom for good girls who show lots of affection and like to improve, please, and strive to be good and obedient . No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction and not be lost and excessively clingy. And Im also not into age regression. Seeking a little girl who is at least 21 years old and older is fine. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Im only interested in those that have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on kik or texting on google voice on vanilla topics. Thank you"

293,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,[M4F] Toronto / Montral / Online - Need me. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me.,0,cxqxl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/cxqxl1/m4f_toronto_montréal_online_need_me_be_sad_be/,2019-08-31 13:07:15,"When directed toward me, there are behaviours that, no matter how blatantly transparent, manipulate me; they speak to something inside me, gratify me, and invoke a clarity of thought and aggressive focus nothing else does. These are the methods by which my partners turn me on most. The primary factor here is docility. What arouses me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem a little off-balance. I don't mind if she's gregarious or even aggressive. I want her to be comfortable with other people but not necessarily herself. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show submission to me in yours. You need to think of yourself not as a person, but a thing for me to own. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to help you carry something. You need me to walk you to your car. Be a little shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. I demand blatant favouritism in how you treat me versus how you treat others. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. If you want me to feel aggressive and dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval. If you've read this far, then you know you need this and you will reach out to open up to me. Install the Telegram messaging app on your phone and follow up with your username or phone number. Tell me about yourself in general."

First, thanks for reading. Second, I want to be upfront that I am married and that my partner is not aware. If thats a problem, please move on and best of luck to you. Ive thought a lot about how to write this post. Im looking for something specific that I know is going to be hard to find. Ive had it in the past and, for lack of a better word, am desperate to get it back. The sense of fulfillment, purpose, and pure contentment that I felt from it is unparalleled. I dont want to write paragraph after paragraph about me; this would end up being too long. But the best way I think to describe me is that Im thoughtful, experienced, honest, understanding, respectful, and definitely a sadist. I love to discuss what we both want out of a dynamic, I want us both to be equally fulfilled, and I want to enjoy your suffering and be immensely proud of you, to care for you, and love you. I believe in being a positive influence on a sub, not just sexually, but personally, professionally. Have a personal goal you want to achieve, let me help. Have a professional goal you want to obtain, let me be your guide. Itll bring me joy to teach and guide, its just who I am. I want a connection, more than just sex, talking about our days and interests. Now, what Im looking for is simple, but hard to find. Im looking to build to a 24/7 TPE type relationship. I say build specifically, it will take time and trust and connection. When I think back to the most satisfying relationships I had, they were 24/7 TPE. That depth of trust, honesty, intimacy, control, and vulnerability is wonderful and perfect. Practically, it might be best that youre in the UK or the EU. Im Eastern US, but my hours that I can be available for more than just text chat are usually around 9 AM EST to 6 PM EST. By more, we would voice and video chat and enjoy each others company. A scenario of what I want is below: You get home after a day of work, spending the day distracted with your mind on me and your submission to me; my ownership. After you close the door you quickly strip down and dress into whatever clothing, or none, that you were instructed to be wearing for the evening. After dressed you kneel perfectly as youve been taught and let me know youre there and waiting. You wait for my response to direct you to either continue with your pre-assigned tasks or to use you for my enjoyment and pleasure. Your entire day and week are under my control. You are excited to ask me permission to go out with your friends later this week and hope I allow you, hope youve been a good enough girl to earn it. I inspect the job you did with your chores, discuss potential punishment as needed for poor work. We talk about our days, you tell me about the girl at work who noticed your collar today and gave you a funny look and we laugh. We have some incredible play time that leaves you exhausted and content before its at your bed time and we say goodnight. A short list of some of my kinks include: * Spanking * Humiliation, verbal and physical * Bondage * Orgasm control * Tease and Denial * Anal * Pain play * Many more If the above interests you, Id love to talk to you. Please send me a PM with a little bit about yourself and what resonated with you in this post. I hope to connect soon."

Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"
298,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,27 [M4F] Strict and Caring Master seeking a forever slave/pet. ,0,d06nyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/d06nyp/27_m4f_strict_and_caring_master_seeking_a_forever/,2019-09-06 06:53:28,"*TL;DR; at the bottom.* If you read to the end of this, it might be the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave/pet. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** **slave:** The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. **pet:** There are some similarities between slave and pet. The key differences I want to point out are Autonomy and Responsibility. As a pet I expect you to manage your own time while I'm occupied, and with this comes responsibility. We'll clarify this a little more later. **Dominant:** There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. **Master/(slave/pet) relationship:** So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/(slave/pet) relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave/pet, and that's why I am pursuing this. **What will this relationship consist of:** **Active submission:** What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. **Daily controls:** At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave/pet you can for me. These areas are not determined right now, rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave/pet. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. **Daily tasks:** Similar with controls, every day you may be give a task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave/pet. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. **Weekly sessions:** I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits.

I dominate you with yours. Your freedom of choice is giving to your Master."

Please read 38 male here in NYC. I'm 5'11, 160, fairly good shape, single (divorced) great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy being a dominant. Im an experienced Daddy Dom as well for good girls who show lots of affection and like to improve, please, and strive to be good and obedient . No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction, want an arrangement where we meet a few times a month, understand the focus is on exploring dominance/submission, and not be lost and excessively clingy. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Im only interested in those that have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on kik or texting on google voice on vanilla topics. Thank you"

Authenticity is the goal here. Big me: I live in the south and I'm a student as well (Working on my Masters). In my down time I enjoy reading and writing. I play piano and love to be by the water. Memes are my second language, so if you don't like them this may not work out lol. Little me: I don't really have an age I gravitate towards but my little space is spent cuddling my stuffs and coloring (trying to stay in the lines, bu always failing D: ) When I get angry or frustrated I scrunch up my face and when I'm sad or scared I retreat to hide. I can be a brat, but I will always strive to be called your good girl. I spend so much of m time being big me and having to ""adult"" that I want to just have moments where I don't have to do anything and just be little and carefree. What I want: I want to be your ""sweet baby angle"" lol your ""cute dumb baby faced girl"" I want to take this slow and REALLY get to know you. I want you to love my little space and crave for me to be in it more. I don't think I should be calling you Daddy after a week of talking and you shouldn't expect me to. ""Daddy"" means so much and I only want to bestow that on someone who deserves it and wants to be that for me. What you can expect from me: Loyalty, honesty, vulnerability, cuteness, brattiness. This is serious for me and I will pretty much do what it takes to find my Daddy and keep him in my life. I'm black, curvy, 5'4 I'm looking for long-term so if you want FwB or just someone to call you Daddy in bed, it's not me. Also please be older than me (Doesn't matter how much older) and in the United States. There is sooooo much more I could say (and I feel like I've said so much already), but I suppose I should keep the rest for PMs. So please, message me and let's see if perhaps you're my Daddy and I'm your little girl."

I get insecure sometimes - which is normal for the amount of pain I am in. The good thing about having intense pain, day after day - you really get in touch with what matters. It changes your life and your perspective. Your priorities. Life is hard. I work very hard to enjoy the life I have. Open to friends and people to grow with. In whatever form they take. Open to the possibilities that life brings me. Looking for the right connection that can build into a romantic partner. Someone to trust, rely on, and depend on. A best friend to share my life with. Someone to have sexy adventures with. Someone to feel safe with in every way. We can start online. If things go well we can meet in person. I want to live with a kinky partner.

A willingness to explore, experiment, and try new things will go far with me. We are a great match - if you like to have deep discussions - even about things that make us uncomfortable. Let's go to there. We are not a good match - if you want rules and tasks immediately. I am pansexual. Hearts not parts. I love people. I have fantasies about men, women, men who dress as women, trans. I am open to exploring the rainbow. Challenge accepted! Open to all body types. The more I like you mentally - the more I will like you physically. It is important to build a strong emotional and communication foundation. Before we get too deep in a dynamic. I am more familiar with my dominant sides than my submissive sides. I like exploring as Daddy, Sadist, and Dom. I would love to explore my little side one day. Top kinks - oral / deepthroat (if you can), freeuse, dirty talk, CNC, degradation, forced orgasms / denial / edging, mindfuck, and ageplay (sexual and non-sexual). Limits - scat, blood, weapons, needles, heavy impact play, breathplay and choking. There are no bad or wrong fantasies - lets have some fun. Seeking - Passionate. Caring. Understanding. Curious. Nurturing. Affectionate. You love to listen. You have an open mind. You love sharing your thoughts and feelings. You are comfortable with vulnerability. Who am I? - I try to make the world a better place. I know how hard life can be. No one has to go through life alone. I overcame many obstacles to become the person I am today. I have stories to share. Stories about my travels and the people I met. Stories about my favorite things. 6 foot. Big Handsome Man. Beard. Glasses. Charming. Contagious laughter. Financially secure. Multiple degrees. Homeowner. I tend to stay home - resting and conserving energy. I go out with friends every now and then. I am well educated, intelligent, and understanding. I am very good at breaking down complicated concepts and pulling out something simple and clear. I enjoy the search for answers to questions I never knew existed. I have been kinky by myself. I had difficulty finding people who understood. Until now. It is a wonderful feeling - being accepted and understood. Being seen. I connect with people on a deep and emotional level. Weaving in and out of what we did and how we felt about it. I am interested and curious - I want to know every story and really understand what made you who you are. I love getting to know people through long rambling conversations. I want to know what you think and I want you to know what I think. I love to think out loud. To wonder. Dream. Imagine. Huge Disney fan! I have a weakness for accents. My natural southern accent is one of my strengths. I love talking on the phone / through voice chat. I love getting excited and enthusiastic about things. My love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I have a darker sense of humor (think - Cards Against Humanity). I love awkward humor. Like this show that no one watches I found called - 4 guys embarrassing each other. No wait - thats what I just googled to find it - there we go - Impractical Jokers. Definitely laughed my head off. I am incredibly optimistic. I accept things as they are - then find a path forward. I am kind. Compassionate. Empathetic. Emotionally intelligent. Nurturing. I like being the person that my friends can rely on. I love being taken care of and nurtured. I am incredibly affectionate - I like touching the people I care about to remind them I care. Lots of hugs. I love music. I have a thing for rap, rock, 80s pop hits (I CAN go for that), and music with really deep lyrics. I love how my feelings will magically line up with songs I am listening to. I will naturally reference songs during conversation. I love musicals like Hamilton (Wait for it!). I love falling into any storytelling experience. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I love playing video games - especially JRPGs/RPGs. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). I like documentaries. I love mythology. I love superhero, horror, crime, sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, suspense, action - movies and tv shows. I love magic and stand up comedy. I love when they defy expectations. Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. It keeps me laughing during good and bad times. I occasionally host board game nights with my friends. I enjoy laughing too loud at the movies. And going to the occasional escape room. I love reading every label in museums. I want to get deep - sexually and emotionally. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. I want to make sure I give things a try once or twice - within my limits ;). We have a lot of exploring to do. Bring a map and a flashlight. If you are seeing this - I am searching. If you messaged me before - you can message me again. Tell me about yourself and your kinks. What are you looking for? Ask me anything. Good Luck everyone! Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day."
303,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,27 [M4F] Strict and Caring Master seeking a forever slave/pet. ,0,ce32r1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/ce32r1/27_m4f_strict_and_caring_master_seeking_a_forever/,2019-07-17 07:08:01,"*TL;DR; at the bottom.* If you read to the end of this, it might be the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave/pet. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** **slave**: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. **pet**: There are some similarities between slave and pet. The key differences I want to point out are Autonomy and Responsibility. As a pet I expect you to manage your own time while I'm occupied, and with this comes responsibility. We'll clarify this a little more later. **Dominant**: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. **Master/(slave/pet) relationship**: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/(slave/pet) relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave/pet, and that's why I am pursuing this. **What will this relationship consist of**: **Active submission**: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. **Daily controls**: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave/pet you can for me. These areas are not determined right now, rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave/pet. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. **Daily tasks**: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave/pet. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. **Weekly sessions**: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. **Punishments**: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave/pet, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: **Commitment**: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. **Devotion**: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. **Communication**: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. **Trust**: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. **Emotional intimacy**: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. **Physical intimacy**: Well, you are my slave/pet. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: **A Strong Hand**: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave/pet and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. **A Warm Heart**: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. You'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. If you're interested tell me a little bit about yourself, and what you're looking for. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon. **TL;DR;** * I'm looking for a long-term slave that seeks complete devotion to their master. * I don't expect submission from the get-go. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. Your freedom of choice is giving to your Master."

Thus my presence here. I'd love to find a Dominant woman who'd find pleasure in tasking me with playing, not because I would enjoy it, but because that kind of power and control fuels Her. I'd be willing to show Her my compliance over Skype if we've built up some trust as that would enhance the feeling of vulnerability for me. Now I do have limits...namely blood, scat, extreme pain (though honestly I don't know my limits), children, or anything that would get us in actual trouble. Beyond that I'm flexible. On the kink front, I find particular arousal in anal penetration, prostate play, mild cbt, edging, denial, ruined orgasms, that sort of thing. If this sounds like something that might appeal to you, then I look forward to hearing from you and chatting a bit more :)"

You've imagined being told what to wear, how to stand, being spanked and having your body used completely. Maybe a little hair pulling, being tied up while someone fingers you until you have cum multiple times. You want to feel that you no longer have control, and you will be exhilarated and feel almost trance like when we meet. I like the nervousness that comes from the first meeting. The stammering when you are given a direct order, the suprise you feel when you actually do as your told and how good it feels to follow direction. I love creating the feelings of vulnerability and trust when I am dressed and you are completely naked with your clothes confiscated. I love stripping and inspecting you for the first time, checking for wetness and finding your pussy dripping. We take it slow and easy. I am looking for someone to explore intense power exchange scenarios with. I am an experienced, over-educated, 40, fit bike rider, art lover, white, employed, successful confident guy."

Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship.

I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"
308,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,24 [M4F] Western NY -- Nurturing Dom looking for someone to grow with!,1,cezi5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/cezi5e/24_m4f_western_ny_nurturing_dom_looking_for/,2019-07-19 08:48:26,"Hi! :) Im a nurturing, goofball, Daddy-type Dom looking for someone who craves emotional openness and the rawness of vulnerability with a partner who will respect their needs, push them towards self-improvement, and be an overall pretty awesome friend. Im 24, male, white, 59, average weight, feminist, liberal, and work in environmental tech. I lean to the homebody side of the social spectrum and have lots of varied hobbies (video games, reading history and nonfiction, hiking/kayaking/adventuring, sports, foodie activities, podcasts, digital art etc). Im very driven and am always trying to learn something new! Ive tried to live my life so far open minded, focusing on personal happiness and self-improvement. Ive learned from my past partners and dynamics that I really need to get to know my partners and establish mutual trust to have any sort of kink-based dynamic. Im not one to send one-word texts, dick pics or passive-aggressive responses. I *am* one to need to restrain myself from sending a thousand questions to satiate my desire to learn about you and how to make you laugh.  Open communication is absolutely critical for my relationships- this means talking about desires, limits, interests, relationship boundaries, etc. Similarly, consent and respect are concepts I take very seriously in all facets of my life. From my experience this communication is particularly necessary to make relationships like this work, even if it means taking more time and moving slowly. I have experience with many different kinks and types of play, and love them all in their own ways. I love actively learning more about BDSM and sexuality, as well as talking about it. As previously mentioned, I am a nurturing, guiding Dom, but I have a sweet sadistic side, such as liking to overwhelm and overstimulate my sub with intense sensation. I really like rules and training, such as positions, verbal responses and protocol, etc. I prefer to reward and praise than punish, and similarly love to give and deny pleasure over using pain. However, there are definitely times and places for pain and punishment, and I don't shy away from them. I crave getting into a partners mind completely, learning every nook and cranny of their sexuality to use against them in the best way possible. I find it much more empowering to make someone want to submit to me, and prove it, than to take power from them. Orgasm control, sensation play, relentless teasing, dirty talk and humiliation are my top kinks, but Im very open minded and love helping partners explore their interests. I can give more details about my kinks, limits etc if we talk more! Im primarily looking for a female partner near Western NY who is open to non-monogamy (as I currently have a long-distance partner). Intelligence, drive and emotional maturity are extremely attractive to me. Im also potentially interested in talking with couples who are looking to share dominance or explore subbing for me together. If this sounds like anything youre interested in, let me know! If not and you read this far anyway, I wish you the best on your kinky journey and hope you find what youre looking for. :)"

If you feel you are lacking in a few or all of these areas, do not be discouraged from applying. All lapses in judgement and inability to fulfill your secretarial duties will be met with the swift and firm application of the appropriate disciplinary procedures. Desired attributes of a prospective secretarial candidate: * Intellectual/sapiosexual * Warm, elegant personality (for charming acquaintances and associates and representing Us in the best possible light) * Dresses femininely (pencil skirts, short dresses, heels, hosiery, the works, etc. - these can be provided as necessary) * In need of companionship and a deep connection with someone who is her Owner * In need of a more blissful domestic life filled with sensuality, passion, grace, elegance, caring and all the finer things in life for a smart, well-bred woman - all reinforced with a structured amount of discipline and punishment of course * Desires self-improvement and mutual understanding with someone she earnestly respects * Hungers for a lifestyle out of the norm from contemporary society, and arguably more enriching and fulfilling than others * Enjoys and celebrates the symbiosis between Male Dominance and female submission * Enjoys the feeling of a collar around her neck, restraints binding her wrists, delightful warmth and exquisite pain being applied to her bare bottom, her orgasms denied (or forced again and again alternatively), and a Man's lips wrapped around hers * Becomes wet from uttering the word ""Sir"" * Heart melts when uttering the word ""Sir"" (alternatively) If this sounds like you, do not hesitate to apply. Now that we have the formalities out of the way, let me introduce who I am more thoroughly. I am someone who has long possessed a different kind of taste in the type of women I like to sink my teeth into. I've been in the military since I left home, pursuing higher education and training for a particular career at the moment, and in need of a submissive woman who I can bring along for the amazing future I have mapped out ahead for me and for the world. To put it more roughly and less precise than that long ad you just read, I am in need of a 1950/1960s-style TPE relationship. I want to exude masculinity and fiery romantic dominance with you, and I want you to exude femininity and beautifully sweet deference/acquiescence in kind. I want to mend you if you're hurt, mold you like clay into the kind of woman you've always longed to be (if needed), and improve my own life by sharing it with another soul (and protecting it in times of vulnerability). I am 5""11, average build, black hair, dark eyes, white, and I am told I have an equally soothing and yet enrapturing voice capable of activating a woman's most erogenous zone. I am seeking a LDR at first and commitment/living together under one roof eventually if we're certain about the path we want to take. I look forward to conversing with you. Your photo gets mine. Oh, and if you're the one girl destined to be my treasured secretary, I love you. Have a nice day. -Nite"

Thats proven much harder to explain than it has ever seemed in my head. Suffice it to say, there is a great cavernous depth of beautiful filth to be explored when the right person comes along and hopefully brings a flashlight. The fun stuff can, and will, come later; Im far more interested in connecting on a normal human being level first. And as someone who just is dominant, I know that my complement just is submissive (and yes, Ive spent plenty of years questioning and challenging that with unsurprisingly little success and am not terribly interested in repeating those performances). Someone who simply breathes it, understands it so natively its sometimes hard to put into words, needs it so deeply she has likely gone without it for such a terribly long time just to be absolutely sure it will be right when she finds it. Someone who knows and needs the same terrifying depths of trust and vulnerability and love that I have always known Ive needed. Some of my kinks include bondage, spanking, ice/wax, deep throating, dp, anal, gags, pain, pussy torture/spanking, nipple play, orgasm control/denial/edging, humiliation, and hidden public. Do you think you fit the bill? I'd love to hear from you if so."

A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave/pet. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** **slave**: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. **pet**: There are some similarities between slave and pet. The key differences I want to point out are Autonomy and Responsibility. As a pet I expect you to manage your own time while I'm occupied, and with this comes responsibility. We'll clarify this a little more later. **Dominant**: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. **Master/(slave/pet) relationship**: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/(slave/pet) relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave/pet, and that's why I am pursuing this. **What will this relationship consist of**: **Active submission**: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine.

You will be my slave/pet and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. **A Warm Heart**: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. You'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. If you're interested tell me a little bit about yourself, and what you're looking for. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon. **TL;DR;** * I'm looking for a long-term slave that seeks complete devotion to their master. * I don't expect submission from the get-go. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. Your freedom of choice is giving to your Master."

So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

I'm 5'11, 160, fairly good shape, single (divorced) great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy being a Daddy Dom for good girls who show lots of affection and like to improve, please, and strive to be good and obedient . No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction and not be lost and excessively clingy. And Im also not into age regression. Seeking a little girl who is at least 20 years old and the older the better. Im a pretty busy guy with work so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see where things go. I prefer to start part time I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Im only interested in those that have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on kik or texting on google voice on vanilla topics."

318,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] To share your weakness is to make yourself vulnerable. To make yourself vulnerable is to show your strength.,1,cjtwoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/cjtwoq/30_m4f_to_share_your_weakness_is_to_make_yourself/,2019-07-31 02:08:31,"I admit, I think about that quote far too often. Nonetheless, vulnerability is at the center of what this dynamic should be. One cannot submit without first being vulnerable. To share your weaknesses, to share your dreams, goals, insecurities, fears, darkest thoughts with a partner, and know that he will be there no matter, not judging for anything that you have shared. Vulnerability is not easy. Nothing worth doing is easy. But it's crucial as a stepping stone to submission. The second half of the quote is just as important as the first half. When you show vulnerability, is not a weakness. You show strengths by being vulnerable, by submitting. I don't want a doormat, but I want someone who submits with her head held high. Submission is a gift that you do not give to just anyone. You have a hard time finding a Dom worth respecting, I suspect. Most Doms don't get the subtleties of control and dominance. They focus too much on dominating your mind and do not focus enough on your mind and emotions. I am a 30 year old man, living in the DC area, where I work in a government position (don't worry, not a Trump fan). I have been involved with D/s for near a decade now, with several long term relationships on and offline, with a wide variety of dynamics, from strict TPE to more paternal DD/lg, and everything in-between. I have an active social life, mostly spent with a great smaller group of friends. The rest of my free time is spent in nature or in front of a computer. I love to swim, love to hike and enjoy video games. I would love to find someone who shares more than just her kinky with me, who has similar interests and hobbies. Speaking of interests, I am interested in many topics, movies, books, TV, politics, psychology, philosophy and more. When it comes to D/s relationships, I am strict, firm, creative and open-minded. No kink you have will shock me and I will be eager to make your fantasies become a reality. I focus a lot on dominance outside the bedroom, enjoying control in every aspect of life, beyond just sexually. Personality-wise, I am organized, driven, focused and calm. I plan things to the smallest detail and you will often find me making lists to improve my efficiency. I have found that this side of me works especially well in D/s relationships as well, where I can help improve your life and productivity, motivating you to be better than you have been on your own. I am looking for someone to spend my day with, to talk to and get to know, to explore our minds together. Someone with a personality, who is able to hold a conversation, knows how to ask the right kinds of questions and who feels like something is missing in their lives. Maybe it is a sense of direction or maybe it is missing someone to whisper filthy things in your ear. I am open to both long distance and local. I enjoy taking my time and getting to know someone well. Will you allow yourself to be vulnerable? I am waiting."

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."
320,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"[M4F] Toronto, Online - Show weakness. Need me.

These are the methods by which my partners turn me on most. The primary factor here is docility. What arouses me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem a little off-balance. I don't mind if she's gregarious or even aggressive. I want her to be comfortable with other people but not necessarily herself. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show submission to me in yours. You need to think of yourself not as a person, but a thing for me to own. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to help you carry something. You need me to walk you to your car. Be a little shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. I demand blatant favouritism in how you treat me versus how you treat others. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. If you want me to feel aggressive and dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval. If you've read this far, then you know you need this and you will reach out to open up to me. Install the Telegram messaging app on your phone and follow up with your username or phone number."

I need to trust someone to feel that vulnerability to be myself so to speak. Ideally it would be an exclusive relationship but let's not get ahead of myself. Anyways. I'm only looking for one Domme at a time because I view submission as incredibly personal and intimate. So who am I? I'm British, 19 and male and like I swear to god half of any personal posters on reddit, a computing student. I'm 5ft 10 but your height doesn't matter. My shoulders are broad but I'm mostly thin. I don't drink, smoke or anything but I don't really care if others do. Pics will be given once we're aquatinted. I love to make people laugh and smile, so I tend to always be telling jokes. Sometimes dark, sometimes just bad puns. When is a door not a door? When it is AJAR and those types of things. I'm like many a nerd, into video games. I like strategy games but I'm really bad at anything in real time. I like RPGs too! However this isn't my only hobby. I like to read, write and enjoy walking. I've even dabbled with photography! I can talk about pretty much anything provided I have some background knowledge, but I love to learn too so please tell me about your interests. I'm a collector of Humble Bundle ebooks which I never read. I shouuuld probably actually get around to them but I find reading fiction way more interesting then all the educational books I buy. I'm scared of the Ocean and of Storms. I think I accidentally traumatized myself as a child with too many ocean based documentaries about Giant Squids and Jellyfish and stuff (especially jellyfish god damm do they terrify me) As for Thunder and Lighting? Bright flashes and loud noises are over whelming. I do get a bit tense during poor weather.. My ideal partner in this kinky endeavour would be able to reassure me during these times of weakness. I'm a sucker for cliche romantic gestures. It's just that I'd prefer to see the roles reversed! You know offer to walk me home, offer me a jacket if it's cold and let me steal your hoodies. I get easily flustered by compliments and on the rare occasions someone's flirted with me... been reduced to a stuttering blushing mess. I kind of want to have someone read me a bed time story too? I can find some voices very soothing. So why GFD? I think this is an important question to answer. I'm a switch but I love being dominated with a soft touch. I'm not great with raised voices or threats, but I love the idea of someone wrapping me around their finger and intentionally flustering me for their own amusement. I like the idea of having my hair played with as they tell me about their day, and of being called sappy stuff like Hun, Cutie, Gorgeous, Beautiful, Darling and other stuff you can think of. Not a fan of handsome and I'm not sure why. I just want to find someone who will maybe spoil me with the affection I crave in return for my obedience and attention. Kinks: I'm trying to be open minded on most things so provided they're not listed below on my ""Hard pass"" list I may consider them. Below are some I like. Is role reversal a kink? I don't think so, but the idea fascinates me so much. Who says all men gotta be this way and women another, ya know? I'm not sure what to call it... light degradation? The idea that I'm a ditzy airhead (I can be when flustered) who wants (needs?) someone to take care of him. Light Spanking. You know not going to lie I have no idea what I like about this but I do like it. Light bondage and choking. I think we all know about this. I will say that the idea of being bound and teased is an attractive daydream. I like the idea of being manhandled a little. you know, throw me onto the bed and order me about, or just pinning me against the wall for a quick peck on the cheek. Or positioning me with my back to the wall and an arm to my side as you call me adorable and watch me melt under your gaze. Things I'm 100% against, read LIMITS ""unusual"" body fluids. I find these things gross and would prefer to not talk about them. Thanks. Feet. I don't know, I sometimes get the feeling of *god I'd let her step on me* but it's less about the feet and more of the connoation of domination. I see people who have a sexual attraction to feet themselves and just don't get it. Pegging. I can see the attraction, I really can. I just opt to believe it's not for me. Sounding. **No.** and whilst not a kink! Polyamory.I can't imagine being in that type of situation. I'm hoping to find someone capable of letting me ramble *and listening to me* Yes I will ramble for a solid 10 minutes on why I love Clustertruck or Dishonored or my dog or whatever. I tend to ramble in general conversation the more flustered I feel before devolving into being a stuttering wreck who can't string a sentence together. looking for someone who is hopefully capable of holding a conversation. I think this post spells out that I sure as hell can talk, and I'll be putting the same amount of effort into replying to you as I am writing this. Your appearance don't matter too much to me.

The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable.

You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

You know everything I know about how to build a happy and productive life. You probably clicked on this personal because you feel trapped. Youre consumed by old habits and buried in all the false truths youve told yourself over the years. You may have come here hoping for an easy fix. Thats not what Im offering. Im offering something completely different. Im offering something better. More meaningful. More transformative. More profound. Im offering you something hard. What does it mean to give all of yourself to something? When is the last time youve done it. Do you remember the feeling afterwards. The exhaustion. The pride. The clarity. How long has it been? Why are you holding yourself back? That is what it takes to change your life. This is what it will take to give yourself to me. This is where we will start. You will give every fibre of your being to me, completely. Your body. Your mind. Complete obedience. Complete service. You will be stripped, in every possible way. You will give me your dignity. You will give me your modesty. Youe comfort. Your personhood. Show me that commitment. That surrender. That devotion, and I will use those tools to help you create the person you want to be. Well work on changing your thoughts, the stories you tell yourself, the narratives that are keeping you trapped. Well identify your goals, short-term and long-term, identify what is important to you, and develop a plan to get you there. Well change your routine. Create a disciplined regimented environment for you to thrive in. Well transform your lifestyle to one that is healthy, a nutritious diet, and regular exercise schedule, daily meditations. And most importantly, you will find that you are no longer alone. Youll have an owner. An owner to make proud. An owner to represent. An owner who will encourage you and always push you forward. An owner who will hold you accountable with whatever severity is necessary. Becoming the person you need to be is about investment. Can you make the investment of getting on your knees and giving your life over to more than just yourself? To a life of service and transformation. Stop being stagnant. Stop letting your current life define you. Become something more. Ill be waiting for you."

Hard limits are respected, soft ones are thoughtfully considered before pressing up against them. I believe that the best situations are ones where the interests/concerns/limits of both parties are creatively blended into a workable dynamic. My motto is to always leave people better than I've found them, even if this arena might not feel that way. **What I'm looking for:** I'm looking for a long term dynamic that unfolds over a period of time in a progressive manner surrounding something I have that you don't want getting out. The details and pathway would be discussed, but I'm fond of the idea of holding leverage/blackmail (real or imagined) over someone in a way that leaves a light to heavy tension in their life. Showing up from time to time, turning the proverbial screws on you in creative ways. I'm not looking for exclusivity, nor trying to monopolize a large swath of your time. I crave that nervous anxiety in your gut when a message from me shows up out of the blue. That no matter how many hours/days/weeks pass, you know at some point I'll likely reappear.

326,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"25 [M4F] Texas/Online - Has anyone else noticed the book/movie The Outsiders, and the song All Star deal with the same exact theme? (Oh ya, I'm subby by the way)",0,clmuf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/clmuf1/25_m4f_texasonline_has_anyone_else_noticed_the/,2019-08-04 05:37:51,"**Introduction** I'm going to go out on a limb and say I'm the only one to have made this preposterous connection. You should do some stretching, make sure you're nice and limber. We're about to preform Olympic level mental gymnastics to explain what the works of S.E. Hinton and Smash Mouth have in common. Since it's possible your only experience with *The Outsiders* was reading it back in middle school, I'll give you a quick and dirty, spoiler free refresher. Side note, Francis Ford Coppola directed the film, the same Francis Ford Coppola that directed *The Godfather*. Even sider note, young Rob Lowe is clearly the hottest person in that movie, come and fight me Swayze fans! I hope you're an opposite side over an adjacent one because I'm tangent prone. Yes, that's a trigonometry joke. I don't know whether to be impressed, or sigh at myself for the hoops I jumped through to make that work. How about both? &amp;nbsp; Where was I before? Oh ya, Ponyboy and Johnny are both high school students, and are both members of a gang called the greasers. At some point they read the Robert Frost poem *Nothing Gold Can Stay*, which basically says nothing beautiful can last forever. Some time later Johnny calls back to that moment and in an act of defiance says, ""Stay gold Ponyboy."" I don't know about you, but it's to this day one of my favorite quotes of all time. Sparse on details? You betcha, I'm taking this no spoiler business way too seriously. &amp;nbsp; Here's where the gymnastics begin in earnest. Similar to Frost, Shakespeare has his own quote about the precious metal of gold. In *The Merchant of Venice* there is the line, ""All that glitters is not gold."" I would give you more context, but I'm not a fan of Shakespeare, and I'm definitely not dedicated enough to this silly bit to stop and read the play. At this point I'm sure some of you have skipped ahead and put the pieces together already. In the chorus of *All Star* we have the lead singer shouting to the heavens that, ""All that glitters IS gold."" I know, I got goosebumps too. Definitely not twisting the meaning of anything, or cherry picking hyper specific lines for the sake of this dumb argument. &amp;nbsp; With all of the evidence on the table I say once again, *The Outsiders* and *All Star* are thematically speaking the exact same. They stand in rebellion to titans of literature, choosing to fight the status quo for the sake of a better tomorrow! Viva la revolucin! Whoa there, got a little carried away. More importantly, I wonder that the judges will give me since I didn't stick the landing. Hopefully I can still make it to nationals! Wait, I already said this was the Olympics though... The internal logic of this bit is quickly falling apart, let's abandon ship and finally get back on track. Like I was ever on track to begin with. This post is shaping up to be the perfect metaphor for my life, an absolute train wreck. &amp;nbsp; First and foremost, I would like to offer up my sincerest thanks to anyone who may be reading. Much like I am taking a leap of faith by putting myself out there, you've taken your own simply by clicking on this terribly titled post. Even if I fail to pique your interest after all is said and done, I still appreciate the time you've spent listening and hope you have a wonderful rest of your day. Most of all I wish you the best of luck finding whatever it is you are looking for in life, you deserve to be happy. That pursuit of happiness is why I am standing here steadfast! Metaphorically, I'm typing this while sitting on my bed. The honest truth is it's scary to put myself out there. Despite that, I can't keep letting my near infinite anxiety stop me from being happy. With that in mind, please have patience while I clumsily try to express myself in a coherent manner. &amp;nbsp; **About Me** Before going any further, I feel it's important to say a few (understatement of the century) words about myself. This is never gonna work unless we're acquainted so here's my one sided small talk! Creation is a running theme of a lot of my hobbies. Writing, painting, baking. There's a wonderful sense of satisfaction from creating something out of nothing, although cookies always taste just a little bit sweeter when someone else makes them. Speaking of which, I have a horrible sweet tooth. Be warned, I'm a bit of a rebel. Filling a cavity? That just means celebration brownies when feeling finally comes back to my mouth. It's a miracle I'm still a twig, thank you metabolism. I weep at the thought that one day you will leave me. Speaking of which, I cry all the time. Happy, sad, the most mundane things can lead to a river of tears. Circling back to my premature death by sweets, I know I should start working out. Get ahead of the problem before it actually happens, my body can't take cake for breakfast forever after all. At the same time, I'm lazy. All this paragraph did was highlight my questionable decision making, off to a great start! &amp;nbsp; Since I'm just gonna assume lurking will happen, there's some stuff I've written that you can feel free to read. They aren't indicative of my normal musings, usually I stick to haikus that are either complete nonsense or cripplingly sad. Out of all the artistic mediums I dabble in, words are definitely where I'm most comfortable. Don't practice painting enough to consider myself particularly talented, and when you get down to it baking is following simple directions. The barrier for entry is real low for the haiku, I know a lot of people can be intimidated with all the rules involved with poetry. Five syllables, seven syllables, five syllables. Nothing fancy like the ridged structure of sonnets, and even limericks. My secret is to just have fun with it, and let total stream of consciousness lead me to whatever nonsensical destination it may. In fact, let's bust one out now for a demonstration! &amp;nbsp; The pressure is on. Will I become a diamond? Or dirty old coal? &amp;nbsp; Look at that, not too shabby considering I had absolutely no expectations of myself. That's certainly helpful in all your endeavors, not being afraid to fail. I'd also say that poeming is a skill in it of itself. What I mean by that is you can get better, gain more confidence with your writing with a little bit of practice. No different than riding a bike, or playing the guitar. Have I spent enough time selling this? I'm going to move on to different hobbies before I bore anyone to death. With the power of typing this out nonlinearly, I can tell you I've written far too much already (and with the power of the future I can tell you the final word count is alarmingly over 4000 words). &amp;nbsp; Beyond those hobbies, I absolutely love playing video games. It's my oldest pastime by far, and I'll probably still be playing when I'm old and decrepit. As opposed to my current state of young and decrepit. Right now I've been catching up with all the new content that was added to *Monster Hunter World*, gotta be prepared to go into the new expansion that's coming up. A bunch of new subspecies were just announced, so many new pretty armors to play dress up with. The game I'm probably the most excited for is *Cyberpunk 2077*, although *Silksong* and the *Breath of the Wild* sequel are high up. I remember playing through *The Witcher 2* (made by the same people making *Cyberpunk*) in high school and being blown away, especially with how different it is depending on your choices. In many ways it reminded me of *Radiata Stories* if anyone else remembers that obscure classic that I've never heard anyone else ever mention. &amp;nbsp; Despite just naming a bunch of games with rpg elements, I'm pretty open to most genres. The same can be said of movies too, and the only genre I actively avoid is horror. My spook tolerance is nonexistent. Off the top of my head my, some of my favorite movies of the past couple of years have been: *Blade Runner 2049*, *Into the Spider-Verse*, *The Shape of Water*, *La La Land*, and *Baby Driver*. By no means is that comprehensive, let alone representative of a top 5 of any sort. I can spend all day naming movies I enjoy, but we need to move on at some point. The only analyzing I do is over analyzing, regardless of the media. I have a habit of going way too deep, and pouring way too much time learning all the lore and history of a world if it catches my interest. Even for certain songs I'll try and find the history of how and why it was written. &amp;nbsp; That same kinda crazy passion goes into learning in general, and I'm extremely curious by nature. If I have a question, I won't rest until I have answer. Recently I wanted to figure out what breed of dog was genetically closest to wolves, and finding a peer reviewed article on the subject took way too long to find. To make a long story short, through genome sequencing the study found that the humble Shiba Inu was closest. I can link you to the article if you actually are interested in the work. And if you are interested in genetics you might be yelling, ""What about the commonality in chromosome banding, or protein sequencing?!"" Good question, but that's far above my pay grade. My pool of knowledge is vast, and about ankle deep. &amp;nbsp; Similarly to learning, I like to argue. Not out of anger or annoyance, playing Devil's advocate is just fun. Gasp! Lefties are evil, the church was right! The fact I haven't made that joke in 25 years is shameful. In all seriousness, I think there's a lot you can gain discussing opposing views even when they're not your own. On the formal side of education I'm currently working towards a degree in psych, not that I have any idea what I'm going to do with it. As far as picking a deep end for the pool, keeping with the knowledge metaphor, my top two choices were psychology or philosophy. At least former has job potential, but philosophy papers are so much more fun to write. For the record, ethics and existential nightmares are my philosophical jam. If you think I'm rambling now, never get me started on those topics. &amp;nbsp; My idea of the perfect day is one where I never leave the house, and I do absolutely nothing. Even now my heart is aflutter with the thought of such a wondrous day. I'm as introverted as introverts come, let me live in the... radish-dark. Yep, radish-dark. That's the opposite of the limelight, go with it. To quote Bill Wurtz, ""The sun is a deadly laser."" I just remembered another useless fact! Did you know laser is an acronym for ""light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation?"" Remember that for the pop quiz at the end. All in all I live a very boring life, but I'm seldom bored if that contradiction makes any sense. Then again you can pretty much sum up my entire existence as being one big contradiction. &amp;nbsp; Who knew spouting information about myself would be the hardest part of this process? My spirit animal is an old man yelling at kids to get off his lawn, I will fight anyone who says Charmander isn't the best starter Pokemon, and my feet are always cold. Took me long enough to get to the really important information. At the end of the day it's a marathon, not a sprint. It takes time to truly get to know someone, and I look forward to truly getting to know you. Two sided small talk, what a novel concept! &amp;nbsp; **Interests** Time for the awkward naughty bits, I suppose I've stalled plenty. If you haven't already gathered, I don't have much in the way of experience in this realm. As such, it seems disingenuous to simply give you a list of kinks. After all, there's a fundamental difference between fantasy and reality. Definitely lean towards the gentle side, that much I can confidently say. I'm a delicate flower, both physically and emotionally. In lieu of a list I can offer an explanation as to why certain aspects of submission sound appealing. &amp;nbsp; As odd as this may sound, I want to start with this tightness I sometimes feel in my chest. That's the best way I've found to describe it, a physical tightness. If I focus on it I get overwhelmed with emotion, I struggle to breathe and my head gets all fuzzy. Almost like a panic attack without the anxiety. As dire as that description may sound, that's the best my wordsmithing can do to explain the feeling. I've been told by a few lovely people who know more about this stuff that it's probably me going into subspace. After looking at the Wikipedia glossary of BDSM terms (yes, that's a thing), I think they're probably right. When I feel that ""tightness,"" whatever it might actually be, I can't help but want to belong to someone. &amp;nbsp; That's a word I've definitely latched onto, belonging. Not in the sense of property, more like I'm right where I should be. Opening up completely, and only being met with love. That I've made the right choice in exposing myself, validating the bonds that have been built. A subtle undercurrent of possessiveness can't be denied, making sure I know that I'm yours and yours alone. Stuff like a collar-esque accessory, little marks, and (not mean) body writing have a certain allure. Some sort of physical reminder that I belong to another. What's most important to me in a reminder is privacy, not standing out in public. Ideally it would be something no one will really see, but that we'll know is there hidden from sight. I don't know, mostly just talking aloud. The only thing I've come up with for an accessory to wear that's totally hidden is something akin to a bridal garter, I'm open to any better suggestions. &amp;nbsp; Control plays another big aspect. There's this vague scene that plays in my head where I'm pinned against the wall, and thinking about being cornered makes me feel safe. In another there's a hand gently wrapped around my throat. I'm not scared or even excited, instead it's really comforting to be so vulnerable. It's difficult to properly put into words, but the feelings are always warm and happy. For that reasons, the fundamental idea behind bondage type stuff is intriguing. In a very literal sense you're giving up control. Probably a terrible comparison, but being wrapped up in a blanket burrito is always super comfy. Blindfolds seem like another good way of giving up control, not knowing what's going to happen next. In many ways uncertainty is a reoccurring aspect of these feelings. I think it would be fair to say that control and uncertainty are two sides of the same coin. To give up control is to embrace uncertainty. Look at that, learning new things about myself even while typing! &amp;nbsp; Again, I'd like to reiterate that the reasons behind my interests are the important part. The meaning and symbolism behind the actions, as opposed to the physical acts. The take away blurbs are vulnerability, belonging, control and uncertainty. Those words, at the very least, begin to scratch the surface of what submission means to me. A tiny scratch, but a scratch nonetheless. I hope that shed some light, even if some of the explanations lean into the abstract. Ultimately, learning is a process that takes time and energy. While it's quite the undertaking, I'm eager to explore and figure out my place in this new world. &amp;nbsp; Speaking of place, this next part is out of it. That's a strange way of wording ""out of place."" Moving on like that never happened, I couldn't really think of a natural way to talk about this above. I just wanted to make sure it was known that the cute stuff like cuddles and boops makes my heart melt. In fact, the cute stuff is positively essential. Both giving and receiving. That wasn't meant to be an innuendo, yet here we are. I hope your scalp is ready for the pain of trying and failing to learn how to braid hair! In all seriousness, I'm trying to make is that emotional needs are just as, if not more important than sexual ones. That's where my main focus lies. I understand there's a conceit being made with me posting to, and you searching through a femdom orientated forum. Which is fine, there's nothing inherently wrong with admitting that it's important. For a long time it was something I felt weirdly ashamed of for no real reason. That said, we're more than our roles. They don't define who we are as people, and it's a small part of a much greater whole. &amp;nbsp; Also not an interest, but a potentially important observation about myself. I easily get flustered, and I've noticed a tendency to act bratty as a defense mechanism. While I understand that word has certain connotations in this context, the only alternative I can think of right now is obstinate. Now isn't the time to pull out dictionaries! Just figured that's something you should know, especially since it could easily be misconstrued as a kink. Any ""bratty"" behavior is me being really shy, and not knowing what else to do. Although who knows, I might actually be bratty in the kink sense too. I have no idea! &amp;nbsp; In the same vein, you should know I'll never ever broach this sorta stuff during normal conversation. I've already self inflicted too many blushes typing this out. Between the crippling shyness and the crippling depression, I should change my name to Tiny Tim. He was crippled, right? Or was he just sickly... I need to rewatch *A Christmas Carol*. Nothing says the Christmas spirit like the skin melting heat of the Sun's most powerful summer lasering. Remember when this section was called interests? I'm gonna move on. &amp;nbsp; **Limits** Unlike my interests, I have a more concrete notion of my limits. Although I am willing to push myself, there are points which I do not feel comfortable. Please be respectful of this fact, and know I will do the same. I'm against anything non-consensual, open and honest communication is of the utmost importance. Seems obvious, but let's keep things legal. Mostly thinking about public stuff when I say that. The risk of indecent exposure aside, it's not like the people around you consented. In addition, I am against severe pain, humiliation, butt stuff, age play, and a catch all I'll label bodily fluids. That isn't to say this is a comprehensive list, like I said before I'm no expert. If at any point I'm ever uncomfortable I will make sure to let you know, you're not a mind reader after all. Unless you are a mind reader, which would be equally fascinating and terrifying. &amp;nbsp; **Trust** You may have picked up as a running theme by this point, trust is key. I'm not expecting, nor do I want to jump right into play. Heck, I could very well chicken out and decide I'm not actually ready (you can too, by the way). What I'm looking for is a friend. From that trust can naturally flourish. It's a process that takes time, and continues to take place as both parties grow. Slow and steady wins the race. As such I'm looking for something long term, sticking with each other through thick and thin. Where you can depend on me as much as I can depend you. Whether that happens online or in person, I'm content either way. With that in mind, let's talk and get to know one another. Maybe, just maybe, we'll be exactly what the other has been searching for. Or maybe, just maybe, I'm overly romanticizing the situation. As I've grown older the kissing parts of *The Princess Bride* have become my favorite, this really shouldn't come as a surprise to me. &amp;nbsp; Completely unrelated to trust, but that's my all time favorite movie and book. Also not related to trust, but you should buckle up for esoteric references that require multiple leaps in logic to make any sense. That and weird philosophical waxings that come out of nowhere. &amp;nbsp; **Closing Thoughts** How did you possibly make it to this point?! Consider my mind to be officially boggled. Speaking of mind boggling, I hope you were paying attention earlier... What does laser stand for?! I bet you thought I was kidding when I said I was going to give a pop quiz. At this point you probably read that 15 minutes ago. Everyone who studied, and got the question correct is a good noodle! You get a gold star next to your name and everything. Not even a complete paragraph later and I have unintentionally made an esoteric reference to Spongebob. Maybe you should be a mind reader since you're dealing with the world's lamest fortune teller. Watch and be amazed as I somehow predict my own future! Nothing fishy about that. &amp;nbsp; Thank you again for taking the time and energy to read through all of my chaotic thoughts on this subject. Apologies for not getting through that in a more concise manner. You have the patience of a saint, truly. I understand how daunting of a task it must seem to take on someone that has little history in this world. If by some miracle you are interested, I would absolutely adore hearing from you. Please feel free to ask any questions you may have, I will happily answer them to the best of my ability. Despite the essay this has become, I'm sure there is important information I left out. Don't feel compelled to respond to every little thing in this post though, I shudder at the thought of you having to reread everything to make sure you've touched on all the disparate topics discussed. &amp;nbsp; Since most conversations seem to end up there anyways, my Kik is the same a my username (Buttery_Croissant) if you'd like to talk through that instead. After doing this a couple of times I've noticed that pms aren't exactly conducive to a normal flowing conversation, you know? The ever growing walls of text can get unruly, especially when I'm involved. Give me a keyboard and time and you will rue the day, utter nonsense will rain down like a biblical plague! Whatever works best for you though, I'm not that picky. Unless we're talking about food, in which case I'm as picky as can be. Don't think I'm weird enough yet? Brace yourself for a bombshell. I don't like cheese. Not lactose intolerant, I just don't like the taste and texture. And with that, the only person who was interested has immediately closed their browser in disgust. &amp;nbsp; Final stretch, time to focus! After all is said and done what's most important is to not give up hope, even if I'm not what you're looking for in life. What I mean is the right person is out there for you somewhere, I promise. It's not about finding anyone, it's about finding *the* one. That's enough from me, I'll leave you with a poem I frequently think about as a palette cleanser from my nonsense. Pretty sure that's the wrong palette. Yep, quick search later and I now know it's palate. The mistake is staying, our flaws are what make us unique and beautiful. Kinda sorta brought it back to the poem's theme, nice save! &amp;nbsp; She had blue skin, and so did he. He kept it hid, and so did she. They searched for blue, their whole life through. Then passed right by, and never knew. -Shel Silverstein."

Thus my presence here. I'd love to find a Dominant woman who'd find pleasure in tasking me with playing, not because I would enjoy it, but because that kind of power and control fuels Her. I'd be willing to show Her my compliance over Skype if we've built up some trust as that would enhance the feeling of vulnerability for me. Now I do have limits...namely blood, scat, extreme pain (though honestly I don't know my limits), children, or anything that would get us in actual trouble. Beyond that I'm flexible. On the kink front, I find particular arousal in anal penetration, prostate play, mild cbt, edging, denial, ruined orgasms, that sort of thing.

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

Im 24, male, white, 59, average weight, feminist, and on a upwardly winding career path in environmental tech. I lean to the homebody side of the social spectrum and have lots of varied hobbies (video games, reading history and nonfiction, hiking/kayaking/adventuring, sports, foodie activities, podcasts, digital art etc). Im always trying to learn something new! Ive tried to live my life so far open minded, focusing on personal happiness and self-improvement. Ive learned from my past partners and dynamics that I really need to get to know my partners and establish mutual trust to have any sort of kink-based dynamic. Im not one to send one-word texts, dick pics or passive-aggressive responses. I am one to need to restrain myself from sending a thousand questions to satiate my desire to learn about you and how to make you laugh.  Open communication is absolutely critical for my relationships- this means talking about desires, limits, interests, relationship boundaries, etc. Similarly, consent and respect are concepts I take very seriously in all facets of my life. From my experience this communication is particularly necessary to make relationships like this work, even if it means taking more time and moving slowly. I have experience with many different kinks and types of play, and love them all in their own ways. I love actively learning more about BDSM and sexuality, as well as talking about it. As previously mentioned, I am a nurturing, guiding Dom, but I have a sweet sadistic side, such as liking to overwhelm and overstimulate my sub with intense sensation. I really like rules and training, such as positions, verbal responses and protocol, etc. I prefer to reward and praise than punish, and similarly love to give and deny pleasure over using pain. However, there are definitely times and places for pain and punishment, and I don't shy away from them. I crave getting into a partners mind completely, learning every nook and cranny of their sexuality to use against them in the best way possible. I find it much more empowering to make someone want to submit to me, and prove it, than to take power from them. Orgasm control, sensation play, relentless teasing, dirty talk and humiliation are my top kinks, but Im very open minded and love helping partners explore their interests. I can give more details about my kinks, limits etc if we talk more! Im primarily looking for online female partners for now with the potential to eventually meet in person. I'm in Western NY so someone in the NE US or great lakes region is preferred! Intelligence, drive and emotional maturity are extremely attractive to me. Im also potentially interested in talking with switch couples, looking to share dominance or explore subbing for me together. I am open to either polyamory or monogamy, and will fully respect the boundaries of any kind of relationship I am in. If this sounds like anything youre interested in, let me know! If not and you read this far anyway, I wish you the best on your kinky journey and hope you find what youre looking for. :) (A sampling of conversation topics to get me talking: What would your dream life look like? What do you fear? Do you like thunderstorms? What 3 things do you care about most? What food could you absolutely not give up? Justin, Travis or Griffin? What is your Myers Briggs personality type? Hot take: Are Myers Briggs personality types bullshit? Weirdest music you listen to? Do you like documentaries about cults and little lost corners of history? Know a DM I can play with and learn from? Did I mean that in a BDSM or DnD context? Want to start a back porch garden?)"

Open to people in the continental US - to make travel easier on both of us. I plan to live with a kinky partner. I have a house here and am likely to stay. Looking for a best friend to share my life with. Someone to have sexy adventures with. Someone to feel safe with in every way. I want to build a relationship. Intimacy, kink, companionship, and romance. With someone I can trust, rely on, and depend on. I want to make connections and water them. One connection will flourish and blossom more than any other. That person will walk into my life. Lets laugh, have long and deep conversations, and explore each other. Lets talk about our feelings. Explore the ups and downs of life. And kink. Encourage, support, and comfort each other. The deeper this goes the more open and vulnerable we can be with each other. My life took me to dark places. I walked through the fires. I was forged in them and came out stronger. Do you want to delve into the darkness with me? Who am I? - I try to make the world a better place. I know how hard life can be. No one has to go through life alone. I love sharing the lessons my life taught me. I can connect with most people pretty easily. I overcame many obstacles to become the person I am today. I have stories to share. Stories about my travels and the people I met. Stories about injuring myself the first night of a 2 week trans-atlantic cruise - really, not fair life. Stories about all my favorite songs. 6 foot. Big Handsome Man. Beard. Glasses. Charming. Contagious laughter. I do not smoke, drink, or do drugs. Financially secure. Multiple degrees. I am well educated, intelligent, and understanding. I am very good at making complicated things simple and easier to understand. I enjoy the search for answers to questions I never knew I had. I have been kinky by myself. I had difficulty finding people who understood. Until now. It is a wonderful feeling - being accepted and understood. Being seen. When I discovered bdsm - I found a place to belong. Where things make sense. I am pansexual. Hearts not parts. I am open to all body types. The more I like you mentally - the more I will like you physically. I tend to fall for people through nerdy conversations about passions. Lets get deep on something one of us cares about. We can learn from each other. I recently learned about the real pirates of the Caribbean - yo ho! Huge Disney fan! I enjoy spending time with friends. I travel about once a year - many of my travels these days are deep into the corners of the human mind. I have a weakness for accents. My natural southern accent is one of my strengths. I love talking on the phone / through voice chat. I love getting to know people through long rambling conversations. I love to dream and improvise. I am very silly. I love making people laugh. I have a darker sense of humor. I am pretty relaxed overall - but I love getting excited and enthusiastic about things. My love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I am incredibly optimistic. I accept things as they are - then find a path forward. I am kind and compassionate. I am empathetic and emotionally intelligent. I am nurturing. I like being the person that my friends can rely on. I love music. I have a thing for rap, rock, 80s pop hits (I CAN go for that), and music with really deep lyrics. I love how my feelings will magically line up with songs I am listening to. I love musicals like Hamilton (Wait for it!). I love falling into any storytelling experience. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I like watching Netflix. I love playing video games - especially JRPGs, puzzle games, platformers, shooters. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). I like documentaries. I love mythology. I love superhero, horror, crime, sci-fi, fantasy, action, comedy, thrillers. I love magic and stand up comedy. I love when they defy expectations. Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. It keeps me laughing during good and bad times. I occasionally host board game nights with my friends. I enjoy going to the movies and the occasional escape room. I love museums. Seeking - Looking for feminine energy - women, trans, sissy. I want to dress someone in cute outfits. And do un-cute things to them. Passionate. Caring. Understanding. Curious. Nurturing. Affectionate. You love to listen. You like to tease, laugh, and play. You have an open mind. You are comfortable with yourself and what you want. You are enthusiastic and willing to explore our kinks together. Inside BDSM - I like flipping between Daddy, Dom, and Sadist. I love the contrast between sweet and sadistic. I love showering my submissive with praise and affection. Degradation and humiliation. Holding them close and cuddling. Reading bedtime stories. Using them to satisfy myself. Training them to satisfy me. You will make my needs and getting me off - especially orally - a priority. Looking for someone who wants to meet my emotional and sexual needs. Not particularly interested in hyper micromanaging your life. I want to guide and nurture you as you serve me. We will find that balance together. I want to explore the light and the dark. I have some darker kinks that can be discussed later. Seeking someone with an equally dark mind. We can discuss this as we get comfortable with each other. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. We can find your limits and keep them sacred or push them until we find new ones. Limits are - scat, blood, weapons, needles, heavy impact play, dangerous breathplay. Let's build a safe place. A relationship with trust, respect, and vulnerability. Together. I can be your bright, shining light in the darkness. You can be mine. Send me a PM - What are you looking for? Why do you think we would be a good match? Ask me anything. Good Luck everyone!

(Online to start)",1,c1b4ml,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/c1b4ml/26m4f_seeking_my_true_slave_for_a_relationship/,2019-06-17 01:29:46,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon."

If things go well we can meet in person. I plan to live with a kinky partner. I have a house here and am likely to stay. Seeking someone 25-45. A submissive or switch. Someone to explore all of our kinks and fantasies with. And find new ones together. Someone who wants to understand and be understood. We can see and accept all of each other. Who am I? - I try to make the world a better place. I know how hard life can be. I overcame many obstacles to become the person I am today. I have stories and lessons to share. No one has to go through life alone. 6 foot. Big Handsome Man. Beard. Glasses. Charming. Contagious laughter. I do not smoke, drink, or do drugs. Financially secure. Multiple degrees. I am pansexual. Hearts not parts. I am open to all body types. Open to everyone. I am well educated, intelligent, and understanding. Homebody. I go out with friends every now and then. I love learning about different thought systems, pulling out nuggets of wisdom, and absorbing that into my own personal belief system. If it makes sense to you and you can support it - it is a validly held belief. I enjoy the search for answers to questions I never knew existed. I connect with people on a deep and emotional level. I am very introspective. I love breaking things down and really understanding them. Lets talk it out. I love sitting in, talking about, processing, and working to understand feelings. I am interested and curious - I want to know every story and really understand what made you who you are. I want to know what you think and I want you to know what I think. The deeper this goes - the more openly and transparently we can discuss our feelings, perspectives, thoughts, and emotions with each other. I love getting to know people through long rambling conversations. I love to think out loud. To wonder. Dream. Imagine. I tend to fall for people through nerdy conversations about passions. Lets get deep on something one of us cares about. We can learn from each other. I recently learned about the real pirates of the Caribbean - yo ho! Huge Disney fan! I have a weakness for accents. My natural southern accent is one of my strengths. I love talking on the phone / through voice chat. I am very silly. I love making people laugh. I have a darker sense of humor (think - Cards Against Humanity). I love awkward humor. I love getting excited and enthusiastic about things. My love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I am incredibly optimistic. I accept things as they are - then find a path forward. I am kind. Compassionate. Empathetic. Emotionally intelligent. Nurturing. I like being the person that my friends can rely on. I love being taken care of and nurtured. I am very affectionate - if I like you - you will know. I love music. I have a thing for rap, rock, 80s pop hits (I CAN go for that), and music with really deep lyrics. I love how my feelings will magically line up with songs I am listening to. I love musicals like Hamilton (Wait for it!). I love falling into any storytelling experience. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I love playing video games - especially JRPGs. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). I like documentaries. I love mythology. I love superhero, horror, crime, sci-fi, fantasy, action, comedy, thrillers. I love magic and stand up comedy. I love when they defy expectations. Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. It keeps me laughing during good and bad times. I occasionally host board game nights with my friends. I enjoy laughing too loud at the movies. And going to the occasional escape room. I love reading every label in museums. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. I want to make sure I give things a try once or twice - within my limits ;). Who are you? - Passionate. Caring. Nurturing. Affectionate. Understanding. Curious. You like to laugh and play. You have a thirst for learning. You love to listen and understand. You have an open mind. You love, respect, and treasure vulnerability. You are comfortable expressing yourself. You are enthusiastic and willing to explore our kinks together. What am I looking for in a relationship? - Companionship. Romance. Intimacy. Kink. Lets ride the ups and downs of life. And kink. We can lean on each other during hard times. Get deep - sexually and emotionally. We can tease each other with inside jokes and bad jokes. Laughing until we hurt and we have to stop to catch our breath. Encourage, support, and comfort each other - inside and outside of the bedroom. Explore emotional / sexual highs and lows together. Go to the edge as a team. Then come back to reality. Hand in hand. We can build a relationship with trust, respect, vulnerability, and honesty. Together. I can be your bright, shining light in the darkness. You can be mine. Send me a PM - If you want to get to know me. Tell me what resonated with you and tell me your favorite song(s). Good Luck everyone! Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day."

In a nutshell, I'm a pretty normal 26-year-old girl, just trying to live my best life and make better choices for myself as I figure out what the fuck this whole adulthood thing is about. (How did my fridge get covered in wedding invites? When did my high school friendships become a neverending purgatory of ""let's grab coffee""? What's the deal with fabric softener? etc.) I have a semi-established diet/gym routine that I've lost \~20lbs with, but I've hit a plateau this year and could use some help. I'm pretty kinky thrive on structure and direction, so I figure with the right person maybe I can kill two birds with one stone? I'm looking for the kind of person who enjoys being given access to very intimate details of a sub's life, and micromanaging parts of it with rules we create together. If sexually charged vulnerability and exploring the erotic little facets of control sends a shiver down your spine... we might be a good fit. **Me:** 5'6"", 185 lbs, cute face, mildly nerdy, submissive with a fun curvy body that I like showing off. I'm in the US, about to start a career that I'm super excited about and probably have too many hobbies for my own good (but I do in fact have communication and time management skills, so don't let that scare you.) I love meeting new people and get along with basically everyone. **You:** Kind(!) but firm, confident, reliable, and body-positive with an appreciation for chubby girls. If you're working on your own fitness goals this is even something we could do together. I'm into lots of different body types and I don't expect you to be some crazy fit nutrition guru or anything. I would prefer someone nonmonogamous whether or not you're in a relationship right now. **What I'm looking for/offering:** I have a few goals that include getting to a healthier weight by being more disciplined about diet and exercise. I've had some success with using D/s for mentorship/motivation in the past and I'd really like to explore the full potential of that. I'm looking for someone who would enjoy collaborating on rules and enforcing structure through regular monitoring + reasonable rewards/punishments with some kinky fun in between. The specifics of that are fully negotiable, but ultimately I do want this to be positive and constructive, absolutely not a fat humiliation thing or some effort to ""be hotter"" masquerading as concern for health. I know it's a lot to ask for, but in return I promise this will be fun! I'm a little insatiable and have lots of kinks. We almost definitely have a few in common. I absolutely love dirty talk and showing off while we get to know each other, if you're into that. I'm not particularly shy about what I want and like. I'm really into obedience and being a good girl, and even though it can be fun to playfully push your buttons, I'm not particularly bratty. If you're cool and we have chemistry then I'll really want to please you. Whew, thanks for reading my wall of text! I'm really focused on finding something longer-term with the right person, so if that kind of arrangement ticks some boxes for you, I'd love to chat and find out if we're a good fit."

(Online to start)",1,c50xct,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/c50xct/26m4f_seeking_my_true_slave_for_a_relationship/,2019-06-25 12:30:51,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon."

I'm 5'11, 160, fairly good shape, single (divorced) great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy being a Daddy Dom for good girls who show lots of affection and like to improve, please, and strive to be good and obedient . No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction and not be lost and excessively clingy. And Im also not into age regression. Seeking a little girl who is at least 20 years old and the older the better. Im a pretty busy guy with work so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see where things go. I prefer to start part time I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Im only interested in those that have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on kik or texting on google voice on vanilla topics."

I realize I'm posting on r/BDSMpersonals... I just thought someone exploring here might read this and *get* it... I've been ""kinky"" for about five or six years now. Despite my level best, I've never been able to find a super long term kink partner to share and learn in-depth with. That said, I've still done a lot of exploring with short term partners and my time at Chicago's clubs, and reddit of course. After a long period I've decided I want to let go of being a 'Dom' or being 'kinky.' Some of the things (like anal, role play, or free use) I don't think I'll let go of (so perhaps I'll always be kinky to somebody), but the rough sex, the power exchange... I've decided to move away from that. I don't really know what that will look like. You do something for so long it can be hard to learn new tricks (or simply unlearn old ones), but I'm hoping someone is interested or curious to try this with me. I picture something with lots of passion, desire, vulnerability, openness. All things I pictured in a D/s, kink relationship. Okay so that explains why I'm posting... now for a bit about me. I'm 31, from Chicago, though I've lived in a few places in the U.S. and a couple in the E.U. as well. I love food, love to cook. I'm a fan of philosophy, design, architecture, culture, sociology, sexuality... the list goes on. I've met quite a few people over reddit... I usually follow the protocol of: swap photos, chat over a messenger, have a voice chat, then meet (assuming all those go well). So drop me a line about why you felt compelled to message me, send a photo and I'll send one in return, and we'll see where this goes. Thanks for your time, all the best."

Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon."

Will you give me your obedience and devotion? Your mind, body, heart and soul?",0,c6u5js,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/c6u5js/27m4f_experienced_dominant_seeks_his/,2019-06-29 13:57:17,"Everyone is screwed up, broken, clingy, and scared- Ann Lamont Saw that quote the other day, and I guess it seemed an appropriate way to begin this personal. And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 21 to 26 (A little younger/older is fine). Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."
346,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,27 [M4F] Strict and Caring Master seeking a forever slave/pet.,0,c74c8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/c74c8r/27_m4f_strict_and_caring_master_seeking_a_forever/,2019-06-30 06:43:07,"If you read to the end of this, it might be the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave/pet. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** **slave**: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. **pet**: There are some similarities between slave and pet. The key differences I want to point out are Autonomy and Responsibility. As a pet I expect you to manage your own time while I'm occupied, and with this comes responsibility. We'll clarify this a little more later. **Dominant**: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. **Master/(slave/pet) relationship**: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/(slave/pet) relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave/pet, and that's why I am pursuing this. **What will this relationship consist of**: **Active submission**: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. **Daily controls**: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave/pet you can for me. These areas are not determined right now, rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave/pet. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. **Daily tasks**: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave/pet. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. **Weekly sessions**: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits.

I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave/pet, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either.

It really hurts and the feeling consumes you and focuses your mind. You suddenly feel helpless and weak, but glowing inside. Radiating with desire. I see both the fear and trust as your moistening eyes look at me. I hear a begging whimper. Your lip quivers. The next blow is harder, swifter. In exactly the same spot. You reflexively beg for mercyreally beg this time. Your breath deepens, more desperate. Your hips writhe and buck after you feel my bare palm strike your ass. I turn your head and force you to look at the marks on your body. Red and purple welts. The spots grow, become splotchy, uneven, with a dark red center that rises from your skin. I love those marks. They are my gifts for you and now you will wear them. You will bear them. You feel me throughout the day, the dull aches and the searing sting. You smile and wince and glow. You feel them whenever you want to be reminded that you are mine. You feel them every time you sit down or move a certain way. Finally, you gasp and moan and your pelvis squirms when I tell you to feel pleasure. My touch is different now. My fingers glide across your beckoning wetness and I whisper, ""You are such a good girl. Such a pretty, obedient girl. I am so happy you are mine. You are all I ever wanted."" I kiss the tear away from your warm cheek as my finger pushes you open. I love the taste of your tears. I love how you feel inside. I want you to be my online submissive. l want to take you to that emotional edge and linger there with you, holding you precariously over the abyss of fear and pain and buried memories. I want to feel the surge of power in my body that I will get from holding your vulnerability in my hands and deciding what to do with it.

What I love about BDSM is the honesty, raw emotion and power of it. The Dom leading, guiding and training; the submissive surrendering control of her body to the Dom. The excitement in those first minutes of vulnerability as the remaining veneer of the outside world is stripped away and forgotten, replaced with intimacy beyond description. Music and light set the mood. A firm but gentle touch that conveys trust and allows you to slip deeply into Our darkness. Kissing, deep and wet. Skin against skin as lingerie is removed. Your breath fast and heavy against my neck, responding to the deep whisper of my voice. The roughness of rope around your torso, your ankles...your wrists. Being positioned, manipulated...commanded. My darkest desires written on the sweet tapestry of your beautiful body. Though we may only have met a short time ago, somehow we become one. Propelled by an ancient, animalistic desire we race toward an ecstasy few experience. The strength of my presence nothing short of psychological captivation, seduction and sexual possession. The allure of your submission rich in femininity and borne on an inner strength from confidence and a knowledge of self. Let me know if this resonates with you.

In a nutshell, I'm a pretty normal 26-year-old girl, just trying to live my best life and make better choices for myself as I figure out what the fuck this whole adulthood thing is about. (How did my fridge get covered in wedding invites? When did my high school friendships become a neverending purgatory of ""let's grab coffee""? What's the deal with fabric softener? etc.) I have a semi-established diet/gym routine that I've lost \~20lbs with, but I've hit a plateau this year and could use some help. I'm pretty kinky thrive on structure and direction, so I figure with the right person maybe I can kill two birds with one stone? I'm looking for the kind of person who enjoys being given access to very intimate details of a sub's life, and micromanaging parts of it with rules we create together. If sexually charged vulnerability and exploring the erotic little facets of control sends a shiver down your spine... we might be a good fit. **Me:** 5'6"", 185 lbs, cute face, mildly nerdy, submissive with a fun curvy body that I like showing off. I'm in the US, about to start a career that I'm super excited about and probably have too many hobbies for my own good (but I do in fact have communication and time management skills, so don't let that scare you.) I love meeting new people and get along with basically everyone. **You:** Kind(!) but firm, confident, reliable, and body-positive with an appreciation for chubby girls. If you're working on your own fitness goals this is even something we could do together. I'm into lots of different body types and I don't expect you to be some crazy fit nutrition guru or anything. I would prefer someone nonmonogamous whether or not you're in a relationship right now. **What I'm looking for/offering:** I have a few goals that include getting to a healthier weight by being more disciplined about diet and exercise. I've had some success with using D/s for mentorship/motivation in the past and I'd really like to explore the full potential of that. I'm looking for someone who would enjoy collaborating on rules and enforcing structure through regular monitoring + reasonable rewards/punishments with some kinky fun in between. The specifics of that are fully negotiable, but ultimately I do want this to be positive and constructive, absolutely not a fat humiliation thing or some effort to ""be hotter"" masquerading as concern for health. I know it's a lot to ask for, but in return I promise this will be fun! I'm a little insatiable and have lots of kinks. We almost definitely have a few in common. I absolutely love dirty talk and showing off while we get to know each other, if you're into that. I'm not particularly shy about what I want and like. I'm really into obedience and being a good girl, and even though it can be fun to playfully push your buttons, I'm not particularly bratty. If you're cool and we have chemistry then I'll really want to please you. Whew, thanks for reading my wall of text! I'm really focused on finding something longer-term with the right person, so if that kind of arrangement ticks some boxes for you, I'd love to chat and find out if we're a good fit."

My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction and not be lost and excessively clingy. And Im also not into age regression. Seeking a little girl who is at least 20 years old and the older the better. Im a pretty busy guy with work so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see where things go. I prefer to start part time I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Im only interested in those that have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste.

It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

If you are reading this - I am searching. Communication is sexy. Understanding each other is sexy. Open to online and long distance relationships. Open to friends and people to connect with. Open to the possibilities that life brings me. Looking for the right connection that can build into a romantic relationship. A best friend to enjoy life with. Someone to have sexy adventures with. Someone to feel safe with in every way. Seeking someone 25-45. A submissive leaning switch. Someone willing to explore the kinks and fantasies we both have. And enjoy finding new ones together. 1. Looking to start as friends. 2. Looking to build a D/s relationship. Start in the bedroom. And grow from there. We will find a comfortable place together. 3. Looking for love and romance - with a side of handcuffs. We can discuss all of this at length as we get to know each other. My life took me to dark places. I walked through the fires. I was forged in them and came out stronger. Do you want to delve into the darkness with me? I have chronic pain. My pain wears me down so I surround myself with positive people. Looking for someone supportive and self aware. Lets get introspective. And give each other a space to be seen, heard, and understood. Lets laugh, cuddle, have long and deep - ahem - conversations, and explore each other. Lets hold hands, stare at the ceiling, and talk about our feelings. Build that open line of communication. Accept each other with curiosity and openness. Explore the ups and downs of life. And kink Encourage, support, and comfort each other. Explore emotional / sexual highs and lows together. Go to the edge as a team. Then come back to reality. Hand in hand. Who am I? - I try to make the world a better place. I know how hard life can be. I overcame many obstacles to become the person I am today. I have stories and lessons to share. 6 foot. Big Handsome Man. Beard. Glasses. Charming. Contagious laughter. Financially secure. Multiple degrees. Homeowner. Homebody. I go out with friends every now and then. I am pansexual. Hearts not parts. I love people. Open to everyone. I am open to all body types. I am well educated, intelligent, and understanding. I love learning about different thought systems, pulling out nuggets of wisdom, and absorbing that into my own personal belief system. If it makes sense to you and you can support it - it is a validly held belief. I enjoy the search for answers to questions I never knew existed. I connect with people on a deep and emotional level. Weaving in and out of what we did and how we felt about it. I am very introspective. I love breaking things down and really understanding them. Lets talk it out. I love sitting in, talking about, processing, and working to understand feelings. I am interested and curious - I want to know every story and really understand what made you who you are. I want to know what you think and I want you to know what I think. I love getting to know people through long rambling conversations. I love to think out loud. To wonder. Dream. Imagine. I tend to fall for people through nerdy conversations about passions. Lets get deep on something one of us cares about. We can learn from each other. I recently learned about the real pirates of the Caribbean - yo ho! Huge Disney fan! I have a weakness for accents. My natural southern accent is one of my strengths. I love talking on the phone / through voice chat. I am very silly. I love making people laugh. I have a darker sense of humor (think - Cards Against Humanity). I love awkward humor. I love getting excited and enthusiastic about things. My love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I am incredibly optimistic. I accept things as they are - then find a path forward. I am kind. Compassionate. Empathetic. Emotionally intelligent. Nurturing. I like being the person that my friends can rely on. I love being taken care of and nurtured. I am incredibly affectionate - I like touching the people I care about to remind them I care. Lots of hugs. I love music. I have a thing for rap, rock, 80s pop hits (I CAN go for that), and music with really deep lyrics. I love how my feelings will magically line up with songs I am listening to. I will naturally reference songs during conversation. I love musicals like Hamilton (Wait for it!). I love falling into any storytelling experience. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I love playing video games - especially JRPGs/RPGs. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). I like documentaries. I love mythology. I love superhero, horror, crime, sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, suspense, action - movies and tv shows. I love magic and stand up comedy. I love when they defy expectations. Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. It keeps me laughing during good and bad times. I occasionally host board game nights with my friends. I enjoy laughing too loud at the movies. And going to the occasional escape room. I love reading every label in museums. Who are you? - You are also one of the touchy-feely-emotional-sexual people. Financially stable. Nurturing. Affectionate. Curious. Kind. You love to listen. You have a thirst for learning and understanding. You have an open mind. You love, respect, and treasure vulnerability. You are emotionally and sexually intelligent. You are enthusiastic about life and kink. You are patient and love explaining things in great detail. I will ask questions! What am I looking for in a relationship? - Companionship. Romance. Intimacy. Kink. We can roleplay our deepest desires together and simply enjoy each others company. I want to get deep - sexually and emotionally. With someone I can trust, rely on, and depend on. Someone I can lean on. Someone to cum with and someone to talk to. During the good and bad times. We can make inside jokes and bad jokes. Laughing until we hurt and we have to stop to catch our breath. Inside BDSM - I embrace the principle of ""good, giving, game."" Willing to work with you to make sure we both get our needs met. Researching things together will be fun. I want to explore sex and kink with someone caring, patient, and supportive. We can help each other get what we want. Help bring our fantasies to life. See the joy in each other's faces. Inside and outside of kink. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. I want to make sure I give things a try once or twice - within my limits ;). I like exploring as Daddy, Sadist, and Dom. I love the contrast between sweet and sadistic. I want to dress you in cute outfits. Possibly for different tasks and during roleplay. I want to make sure you look nice while I do un-nice things with and to you. Praise and affection. Degradation and humiliation. Using you to satisfy myself. Especially orally. Crafting and molding you over time so you will make my needs a priority. I want to guide and nurture you as you serve me. We will find that balance together. I am more familiar with my dominant sides than my submissive sides. Definitely want to start with gentle domination. I love to be called a good boy. There are times I want to be cuddled, held, and spooned - really focused on in bed. Bring me your focused caregiving energy - I will bring you mine. We can find your limits and keep them sacred or push them until we find new ones. Top kinks - oral / deepthroat, orgasm control, freeuse, worship, mindfuck, sissy, CNC, and ageplay. Limits - scat, weapons, needles, blood I want to try different dynamics. So we can find something that works for us and also enjoy exploring the differences. There are no bad or wrong fantasies - lets have some fun. We can discuss this more at length. Many times. We can build a relationship with trust, respect, vulnerability, and honesty. Together. I can be your bright, shining light in the darkness. You can be mine. We have a lot of exploring to do. Bring a map and a flashlight. Lets get to know each other and see where it takes us. Send me a PM - Tell me what you are passionate about. Tell me why you think we are a good match. Good Luck everyone! Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day."

In all relationships, I'm devoted. Sharp as a whip. I'm curvy, petite in the chest and thick in the booty (where it counts, let's be real), short hair, tattooed, vaguely goth. Think Lena Dunham but 10x cuter and 1000x sweeter. In bed, I have heavily submissive leanings and would love to find a dude with dominant/Dom leanings. I love affectionate, firm, uplifting, consensual cruelty. **That said, curiosity and communication skills are all you need to pique my interest.** I will, of course, send you a photo straight away if I'm interested!

You're stable and feel confident you can provide stable, steady support and meet with regularity. **Please do not message me if you're solely looking for a NSA /FWB arrangement.** I'd love to know more about you. What makes *you* tick? What are you passionate about? What are your values? What makes you curious, in and out of the bedroom? \*\*\* IMPORTANT\*\*\* Please PM me if interested - and only PM. Also, photos in first message are ideal (but, you know, privacy - I get it!). Other things that will get you immediately and gleefully blocked:  You don't live in the Raleigh area (sorry!)

I dont punctuate my prose with smiley faces every other sentence. I dont say hehe or play coy. And I dont respond well to acquaintances telling me they know exactly how I tick or feel or want. I dont *like* pain, but in my experience I enjoy encounters that evoke pain, be it emotional or physical. I dont shy from the uncomfortable moments. I try to sit with them. I like to understand whats happening. When something scares me, I want to know everything there is to know about it. Knowledge breeds power, and thats exceptionally true between a dom and his sub. For me, an exchange of power cannot occur unless the submissive first has at least *some* power. To give someone power, you must also impart your respect. This is the most common mistake I see when talking with dominant men. I like connection, shared experience, and empathy. I like closeness. I like vulnerability accompanied by strength. I like words. I like talking. I like men who honor what I say, especially dominant ones. I also like the complete annihilation of my dignity, given I find the right person with whom to explore that. Im sure you will have read this and felt Ive said nothing in regards to what Im looking for. But thats intentional. Dont inundate me with a kink list, please."

Emotionally balanced and looking for a D/s relationship or a steady play partner. I am single and unattached (divorced). Im not lifestyle and I look clean cut and one would never guess. Seeking someone to share time with and get to know and have more deep exploration with each other over time. Being able to connect on a vanilla level is a must. Not a 24/7 thing, unless we want it to me. Daddy dom play is something Ive done before and can find enjoyable. Looking for something real, fun, and no drama. Im basically looking for someone experienced or inexperienced, get to know each other and feel comfortable, and explore things and go in and out of role. Duration of role can grow if we both want that. I have good experience as a Dom. I can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy control and teaching someone about the darker pleasures. Newbies are ok. I tilt a little more towards the BD than SM as I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. In particular Im skilled with rope play, and love bondage, exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I consider myself high EQ and I look academic, like a modern professor Ive been told. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, love to learn and happy and balanced by nature. I dont fit the mold of a Dom (aggressive, asshole, jerk etc) Hate to say this, but after posting a few times I need to be clear that I am seeking someone without serious mental health problems and who has never been in a psychiatric hospital before. We all find life stressful but my preference is to find someone who can handle explorations of trust and control in a fun way. I am also not into BBWs, sorry, just my personal preference. When replying please state age, general location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation. I prefer to move to kik or texting and starting on vanilla topics.

I see both the fear and trust as your moistening eyes look at me. I hear a begging whimper. Your lip quivers. A teardrop pools at the edge of your eyelid. The next blow is harder, swifter. In exactly the same spot. You scream. You reflexively beg for mercyreally beg this time. Your breath deepens, more desperate. Your hips writhe and buck after you feel my bare palm strike your ass. I turn your head and force you to look at the marks on your body. Red and purple welts. The spots grow, become splotchy, uneven, with a dark red center that rises from your skin. I love those marks. They are my gifts for you and now you will wear them. You will bear them. Finally, you gasp and moan and your pelvis squirms when I tell you to feel pleasure. My touch is different now. My fingers glide across your beckoning wetness and I whisper, ""You are such a good girl. Such a pretty, obedient girl. I am so happy you are mine. You are all I ever wanted.""

And Her fantasy was beautifully deviant. And she chose to express it with me. We had chatted a bit on this site. I had proposed an erotic dirty talk massage. I am good with my hands, have excellent diction, and am a total perv. In short, the perfect gentleman. It came as a beautiful surprise. A sudden email late Saturday afternoon. Are you free right now? I am. Are you into spanking? Yes, please. What about role play? Sure what do you have in mind? I need to punished. Then rewarded. Then be bad, then be good. To be forced to do things that I dont know I want yet. Sounds perfect. You wont murder me? Nah, Im too non-committal for that. Okay, cool. Good to know. We discussed limits, safe words, and other keys to feeling comfortable. Even better, we came up with a helluva idea for a role play. Shed be my little girl; I her father figure who caught her doing things that she shouldnt be doing yet. Before I knew it she was here at my apartment. I buzzed her in. My door opens. She glowed. I was surprised how so. Kind, vibrant, sexy. We had agreed that we wouldnt talk too much, but go straight to the idea. So we hugged, and I let her get ready. I was to catch her doing bad things. Smoking pot and masturbating. Things good girls dont donot without my permission at least. I went to my room and waited for her to get ready on my plush expansive sofa. I was wearing a bathrobe, and got hard as I imagined what she was doing out there. When I walked out, she was wearing tight rainbow colored stockings and a revealing silk top. She had a marijuana pipe in one hand and was rubbing her cunt through her panties with the other. Her legs spread wide open, i could see everything. Her fingers rubbing and going inside. She jumped and tried to hide the pipe. What do you think you are doing? She looked shocked, sad, repeantful. Nothing, I wasnt doing anything. Yes you were. Show me what you were doing. Dont lie to me. I pushed her thighs open and pulled her panties aside. Her beautiful pussy was swollen. I touched her. Lips so soft and wet. So pretty. So distracting to stay in character when I just wanted to look, touch, play, devour. You are wet. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? This is bad, you are not supposed to do these things. Im sorry Daddy, I didnt mean to. You know exactly what are doing. Look at you. I pulled her panties off the side again and squeezed her pussy. Show me what you did. Nothing Daddy. I Didnt do anything. Dont lie to me. I grabbed her jaw, tilting her face up it my and looked into her soft doe-like eyes, imploring forgiveness. Get up. Stand in front of me. Pull your panties down and show me. I grabbed her elbow and pulled her up before me. She stood quivering. Take those off. She stepped out of her panties and stood at attention. Take that fuckin top off too. I was so fuckin hard at this point that I stroked my cock in front of her, as my bathrobe fell open. Look what you are making me do. You are so bad. I quickly smacked her left breast. She yelped. Now touch your fuckin pussy, show me what you did. She rubbed her beautiful pussy while I sat on the sofa in front of her rubbing my cock. Her flawless olive skin glowed in the warm afternoon light that streamed through the curtains. Her pubic hair was lush and bountiful, soft like silk as i stroked by fingers through it, then clenched my fist, pulling the hairs tight. Look at you. All grown up. I slapped her rubbing fingers away from her wet cut. Spread your legs apart. I looked her in the yes. Now stand there. You are going to learn that this is wrong. With a quick smack I slapped her wet pussy, and she gasped, half doubling over. You are going to learn not to do this, baby. Put your fingers in your ass. Do you want to be a good girl for me? Yes daddy, I do. Her long wavy brown hair flowed across her soft cheek. I stroked her softness, big round brown eyes gazing up at me. Put your fingers in your ass baby. You have to learn. She did, and I played with her pussy and clit, exploring her. Learning every fold, and touching. Touches that would feel nice and touches that would just feel. I pulled her lips apart. I pulled them down, stretching until she gasped. Keep your fingers in your ass baby. I looked up at her perfect swollen breasts, round plush nipples, dark garnet circles that called lips. It is hard to stay in character when you are in awe. Beauty is awe-inspiring. And the way she looked in the soft warm light, flowing hair across her cheek, swollen delicious breasts, and black black, silky black public hair shaved below to reveal the lips. This is awe. To lose breath and want. Turn around and spread your ass for me. She bent over and spread. I softly stroked her anus, running circles, dipping my finger in her pussy and then sliding it into her ass. I stood up, and took her close to me. Hugging her. Put three fingers in your pussy and three in your ass. I held her close, pressing my cheek against hers. Kissing her softly. Stroking her long black and her big brown eyes sparkled with the hint of tears. Im sorry Daddy. I am so sorry, I didnt mean to. I know baby. But I still have to punish you. I am going to have to spank you. 10 times. 10 times on your breasts. 10 times on your pussy. 10 times on your spread ass. She did as told. With each smack, the pace varied. Sometimes soft when she thought they would be hard. But usually hard when she thought they would be soft. Water welled in her eyes, and with each hit she said that she wanted to be good. Daddy I just want to be good. Please make me a good little girl again Daddy. I made her stand for the last one, legs wide wide wide apart so it was hard to balance. Look me in the eye. This will be the hardest. Really hard. As hard as i can. I faked the hit. And she flinched. I smacked her check. Keep still. And kept faking until the flinching stopped. Then with all my force I slapped her cunt and she buckled to the floor. I held her. She melted into me and I stoked her hair, kissed her cheek and softly rubbed her wet anus. My baby. we cuddled. embraced, in this half squat on the floor until she came to. She took me in her mouth and sucked on my cock then balls while I held and stroked her. You are such a good girl. Now you get to enjoy a nice reward. I took her by the hand and led her to my room. Candles were lit and incense burning. Lie down baby. I rubbed her with oil and stroked softly. up and down, stroking her sumptuous curves, delicate inner things, wet pussy, and then her wet oily ass. I rubbed her anus and with my fingers then palm of her hand. Suck your thumb baby. Just suck and drift, while I stroked her soft hair with one hand and rubbed her ass with the other, palm on anus, fingers playing with lips. She drifted like this for a while. Then we started to chat. As real people not characters. The vibrance that she greeted me with was back. She glowed. Her way glowed. Mannerisms, tone of voice and words. I love that version of Ave Maria, she said about the music. We had similar tastes in the arts and cultural affinities. It felt so natural talking like this. Talking about life, likes, experiences. Pure and total honesty, comfort and kindness. She glowed. After I gave her a thorough deep tissue massage with some pervy touches. She turned and lay on her back. It must feel good to heal, she said. It does. But it feels better to touch you, and look at you. She held my balls in her hands while i stroked her from top to bottom. I placed one palm on her chest and the other on her pubis. Breath in and out. Long slow deep strokes. My fingers traced the breath, starting from her lips to her clit, up the belly, between the breasts, and up across the crest of her face until her third eye. Follow the breath up and down. She help my balls and cock the entire time as my hands and words guided her. Then she made me come. Squatting over me, stroking my cock and balls. her hands, her mouth, her lips, her ass, her breasts rubbing me over and under, up and down until I exploded. I swear my cum hit the ceiling. Stars in my eyes and hot wetness, her touch and scent, near and stroking. holding my balls and cock me as the desire ebbed and vulnerability set it. That was fucking amazing. She touched softly. So, I said, this may sound really weird, but would you want to go on a date with me sometime? She smiled and said, quizas, quizs, quizs"
362,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,27M4F - I've been dreaming about you for years. I'm seeking a girl with a true servants heart. I want to create a 24/7 dynamic based on an intimate relationship of service and devotion. I want to own the person my life has been leading up to. I'm seeking my forever slave (online at first),0,bsugel,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/bsugel/27m4f_ive_been_dreaming_about_you_for_years_im/,2019-05-25 23:23:53,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon."

This part of myself woke up two years ago - I am so glad it did. It is such a wonderful feeling - being accepted and understood. When I discovered bdsm - I knew I found a place where I belonged. Where things made sense. Domination makes sense to me on a visceral level. I am willing to make mistakes, learn from them, and grow. Because I do not have to hide the part of myself that wants to tie people down and have sex with them. I am pansexual. Hearts not parts. I am sapiosexual. I tend to fall for people who can stimulate me intellectually. We can learn from each other. I recently learned about the real pirates of the Caribbean - yo ho! I have a weakness for accents. I hope yall do too ;). I have many stories to share. I overcame many obstacles to become the person I am today. I am happy to share my life experience and knowledge. I love getting to know people through long rambling conversations. I love to dream and improvise. I like to flirt, tease, and joke about sexual things. I also want to know about your day. Politically I lean to the left. Allergic to smoking. Not a pet person - I associate collars, leashes, training, and conditioning with people. My love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I am a good match for those who are comfortable with communication. Communication is sexy. Understanding each other is sexy. I live with chronic pain. For 10 years, I rebuilt my life around my pain. I spent a long time focusing on surviving. I learned to ride the wave. Surviving is my job. I want to curl up with my partner after a hard day working. Now - I am putting more energy towards living and enjoying life. Pain makes my plans conditional - depending on my pain level and how much energy I have each day. Pain messes with my sleep schedule. I will not let my pain stop me. I can have the life I want. The dating window has opened. Dont let em hold you down, reach for the stars. - Notorious B.I.G. Knock me down, I get the fuck back up again. - Hamilton. I am incredibly optimistic. I accept things as they are - then find a path to travel. Always look on the bright side of life. I am a very positive person. Which has helped me find a path forward. I am good at reading people and helping them understand themselves. I am interested and curious - I want to know what made you who you are. I make the world a better place. By being kind and compassionate. By encouraging people. By listening and supporting. I am empathetic and emotionally intelligent. I am gentle, caring, and nurturing. I love being a safe place that my friends can rely on. I am well educated, intelligent, and understanding. I am very good at breaking down complicated concepts and pulling out something simple and clear. I enjoy the search for answers to questions I never knew I had. Huge Disney fan! I am a homebody. I enjoy spending time with friends. I have a darker sense of humor (think - Cards Against Humanity). I am enthusiastic. I want to do really fun things with someone and then talk about how much fun we had! Hold on to that feeling. I love music. I have a thing for rap, progressive metal, 80s pop hits (I CAN go for that), and music with really deep lyrics. I love how my feelings will magically line up with songs I am listening to. I love musicals like Hamilton (Wait for it!). I like watching Netflix. I love playing video games - especially JRPGs. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). I like documentaries. I love mythology. I love superhero movies and tv shows. My favorite tv show is The Wire. I enjoy horror movies. My favorite movies - Avatar and Singin in the Rain. I love falling into any storytelling experience. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I love magic and stand up comedy. I love when they defy expectations. They give me great ideas... Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. It keeps me laughing during good and bad times. I occasionally host board game nights with my friends. I enjoy going to the movies and the occasional escape room. What am I looking for in a relationship? - Companionship. Intimacy, sex, and kink with someone I can trust, rely on, and depend on. Someone I can lean on during hard times - sexually and emotionally. Someone to cum with and someone to talk to. Someone I can let go with - sexually and emotionally. High emotional / sexual intimacy. We can tease each other with inside jokes and bad jokes. Laughing until we hurt and we have to stop to catch our breath. We can sing along badly to songs as we listen to them. Just to make the other person laugh. We can stare deeply into each others eyes and tell each other how much we care. I am a romantic at heart. The destination is not quite as important as the journey. Dont stop believin I will vent my pain to an understanding partner. We can hold hands, stare at the ceiling, and talk about our feelings. Working hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill. I can share my pain with my partner through BDSM. Life can make me feel powerless. We can build a space for me to feel powerful and in control. My domination will probably be more mental than physical. I am into ageplay and dark ageplay. I have fantasies about CNC and freeuse. Curious about bondage and sensory deprivation. I am attracted to lips - because of my oral fixation. There are so many ways I want to explore and experiment - so we can find our favorite ways to make me cum. In your mouth and deep down your throat. I want to choke you - with my cock. Facefucking. Gagging. We can find the right rhythm over time so as you come up to breathe - I can safely pull you back in. As if you are saying no and I am saying yes. I will caress the sides of your face as the tears of joy fall down. As you look up at me. Knowing we both found someone who understands this part of us. I always wanted to know - can I get so many blowjobs that I do not want them anymore? Will I ever be satisfied? I know the right person for me can help me figure that out. I want to dress you in different outfits and roleplay different scenarios. Looking for someone who wants to serve domestically. And be used sexually. I want to crawl inside your mind. Learn as much as I can. Break you down and build you back up. Teaching and training you to meet my needs. Daddys little cumdumpster. Because you need it. Because I need it. Because we need it. Cook and clean for me. Or try to - I may sit you on my lap. Bounce you up and down. Hold you close and play your body like an instrument. And work myself into one of your holes. Or bend you over and fuck you while you try to do the laundry. I love teasing and giving pleasure. I want to make you hurt with pleasure. By giving too much or withholding. I love holding you close and having you shake in my arms. I can shower you with praise, affection, degradation, and dirty talk. I enjoy mixing everything together. You never know what is going to come out of my mouth. Or when I am going to cum into yours. I think of domination like making a watch - we set up a system and positively enforce everything - and over time - the system runs by itself. As we work on setting up background tasks - you can perform tasks as needed. Aftercare is important. I will need - cuddling and comfort. Reassurance. I would like to explore and build our own dynamic - I am curious about petplay, Cg/l, master / slave. And so much more. We can find things that we like doing and hold on to them. Then continue exploring other dynamics. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. I have some dark, taboo, and fun fantasies that I want to explore. I hope you do too. We can be a safe place for each other. We can discuss our fantasies. Then, work together to bring them to life. Inside and outside of kink. Limits are - scat, blood, weapons, needles, heavy impact play, heavy breathplay and heavy choking. The movie never ends - it goes on, and on, and on, and on Get outta my sweet dreams. Get into my fast car. Hold my hand. Lets laugh, fuck, talk about our feelings, and have a great time. Let's build a safe place together. We can build a relationship with trust, respect, vulnerability, and honesty. Together. I can be your bright, shining light in the darkness. You can be mine. Send me a PM - What resonated with you? What are you looking for? Tell me about yourself. Good Luck everyone! Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day. Dont stop!"

This is long. Eventually, I want to live with a kinky partner. We can be there for each other and satisfy those urges when they arise. We can cuddle, snuggle, and spoon. Finding this will take time. In the present - I am looking for kinky friends. For that genuine human connection. Friends before lovers. Which brings us to this ad - where I talk about who I am. What I am looking for. Both inside and outside of kink. Open, clear, emotional, honest, deep, vulnerable - this ad shows you what you get with me. I want to put it all out there - to help the right people find me. I know myself well. I can tell you what I want. What I really, really want. And I hope you can do the same. We can encourage and help each other get what we want. We do not have to line up on everything - just enough to want to explore each other. Explore, discover, and grow. Inside of kink - it may be intense and demanding at times. Taking. Using. Degrading. Owning. Outside of kink - Slow and easy. Relaxing and patient. Holding. Asking. Respecting. Nurturing. Caring. If we are close - we can get together frequently. If there is a lot of distance between us - less frequently. I am open to starting things long distance or online. As long as we want to meet eventually. I have some online experience. Have been researching for 2 years. This will go slowly. We will learn new things - together. Lets explore and research as a team. I am growing and changing. I want to do it with someone. That IS what she said. Who am I? - I think about making the world a better place. I know how hard life can be. No one has to go through life alone. I think about crafting someone to my will. Physically / emotionally manipulating someone into a toy for my pleasure. My life has had so many ups and downs. I had many adventures. And now I want to have a different type of adventure. 6 foot.

I will treat you like a person before I treat you like a sex object. I have been kinky for a very long time - but had difficulty finding the words. Difficulty finding context. Difficulty finding people who understood Until now. This part of myself woke up two years ago - I am so glad it did. It is such a wonderful feeling - being accepted and understood. When I discovered bdsm - I knew I found a place where I belonged. Where things made sense. Domination makes sense to me on a visceral level. I am willing to make mistakes, learn from them, and grow. Because I do not have to hide the part of myself that wants to tie people down and have sex with them. I am pansexual. Hearts not parts. I am sapiosexual. I tend to fall for people who can stimulate me intellectually. We can learn from each other. I recently learned about the real pirates of the Caribbean - yo ho! I have a weakness for accents. I hope yall do too ;). I have many stories to share. I overcame many obstacles to become the person I am today. I am happy to share my life experience and knowledge. I love getting to know people through long rambling conversations. I love to dream and improvise. I like to flirt, tease, and joke about sexual things. I also want to know about your day. Politically I lean to the left. Allergic to smoking. Not a pet person - I associate collars, leashes, training, and conditioning with people. My love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I am a good match for those who are comfortable with communication. I live with chronic pain. For 10 years, I rebuilt my life around my pain. I spent a long time focusing on surviving. I learned to ride the wave. Surviving is my job. I want to curl up with my partner after a hard day working. Life can be difficult. Something as small as holding my hand can make a huge impact. Now - I am putting more energy towards living and enjoying life. I will not let my pain stop me. I can have the life I want. The dating window has opened. Dont let em hold you down, reach for the stars. - Notorious B.I.G. Knock me down, I get the fuck back up again. - Hamilton. I am incredibly optimistic. I accept things as they are - then find a path to travel. Always look on the bright side of life. I am a very positive person. Which has helped me find a path forward. I am good at reading people and helping them understand themselves. I am interested and curious - I want to know what made you who you are. I make the world a better place.

Emotionally balanced and looking for a D/s relationship or a steady play partner. I am single and unattached (divorced). Im not lifestyle and I look clean cut and one would never guess. Seeking someone to share time with and get to know and have more deep exploration with each other over time. Being able to connect on a vanilla level is a must. Not a 24/7 thing, unless we want it to me. Daddy dom play is something Ive done before and can find enjoyable. Looking for something real, fun, and no drama. Im basically looking for someone experienced or inexperienced, get to know each other and feel comfortable, and explore things and go in and out of role. Intensity of role can grow if we both want that. Im open to meeting weekly or more or less at first, depending on how things go I have good experience as a Dom. I can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy control and teaching someone about the darker pleasures. Newbies are ok. I tilt a little more towards the BD than SM as I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. In particular Im skilled with rope play, and love bondage, exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I consider myself high EQ and I look academic, like a modern professor Ive been told. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, love to learn and happy and balanced by nature. I dont fit the mold of a Dom (aggressive, asshole, jerk etc) Hate to say this, but after posting a few times I need to be clear that I am seeking someone without serious mental health problems and who has never been in a psychiatric hospital before. We all find life stressful but my preference is to find someone who can handle explorations of trust and control in a fun way. I am also not into BBWs, sorry, just my personal preference. When replying please state age, general location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation. I prefer to move to kik or texting on google voice and starting on vanilla topics. Please tell me two vanilla things about you and lets see if we would fit each other"
366,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,47(M4F) - I found the perfect sub! She's just waiting to reply! ;),3,bva7fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/bva7fo/47m4f_i_found_the_perfect_sub_shes_just_waiting/,2019-06-01 03:11:20,"Hello there. I've posted this on an old account previously, so if you've seen this before that's why. I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games until all hours. (Way too much WoW lately) - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. - Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. - Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. - Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting. - Obedience and compliance, as well as meticulous control and attention is what gets me going. - *Extras:* Slut shaming, behavior modification focused degradation/humiliation, body marking, ownership enforcement, etc. **In my perfect world, my submissive partner would be:** - Based here in the US, preferably in the east coast for timezone purposes. - Between 25-50 years old. - Available *sometime* within my available weekday hours (7a-7p EST) - Highly attentive and communicative. - Looking to live our long distance/separate lives together as much as we possibly can. Not confining ourselves to specific areas of sharing our lives together but opening up every facet of our lives to one another over time and trust. - Excited by the idea of mutual obsession, infatuation, and utter devotion. - Experienced OR actively learning and reading to gain more experience. - A strong speaker with high expectations for command of the English language . - Witty, dry sarcasm, dark humor are all a plus (please don't drown me in your lol's. I'll admit I am a sucker for a good placed GIF though). - Emotionally available. - Married or unmarried, tethered or untethered is irrelevant. Must be transparent with me and my expectation is some degree of monogamy even if you are in a LTR or married at some point. I'm not looking to be #3 in your rotation. To clarify further, in a long term concept with someone who is also married/in a LTR, I'm not looking for either of us to be in a relationship (physical or emotional) with anyone outside of each other and our respective partners. **Communication:** - Hangouts (text, voice/video calls) is my preference, telegram, emails, kik (as an absolute last resort unfortunately), or snail mail/PO box -- I'm not that insane --, or in person. I've posted here before and met some amazing people, but ultimately long term wise, it hasn't lasted to what I've wanted. If you aren't interested in having deep conversations or in writing detailing responses, please don't bother to reach out to me. Include a name or alias that isn't your screen name, A/S/L, communication preferences, and precisely what in this post moved you to reach out. Thank you."
367,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,27M4F - I've been dreaming about you for years. I'm seeking a girl with a true servants heart. I want to own the person my life has been leading up to. I'm seeking my forever slave (online at first),2,bvqknh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/bvqknh/27m4f_ive_been_dreaming_about_you_for_years_im/,2019-06-02 08:40:29,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon."
368,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"What I bring to the table (F4M, San Francisco Bay Area)",4,bvscil,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/bvscil/what_i_bring_to_the_table_f4m_san_francisco_bay/,2019-06-02 11:46:14," First, some details. I am 58, I live in the Bay Area, and I am seeking an accomplished  and local  Dom, reasonably close to my own age. I will share my FL profile when we establish a connection. And this Reddit account is obviously not my main one. Now, about me. What I bring to the table, as a friend, a lover, and a submissive. I was considering writing this in the Zagat style. ""High expectations are met"" by this ""elegant and poised woman"", with her ""razor-sharp wit"" and her ""insatiable passion that can be sensed from miles away"", while her ""powerful intellect"" will ""engage and challenge"" you, and her ""nuanced artistic vision"" will certainly make you want to stand by her side at many a ""stunning sunsets"". She is an ""exceptionally responsive bottom"", an ""enthusiastic anal player"", her oral skills are rated ""12 out of 10"", and she presents a ""rare combination of intellect and sexuality"". But, maybe not quite Zagat. Some people tell me that I am a ""complete package"". I am not sure what that means. Lunchables is a complete package, and yet utterly unappealing.... So here are some of the words that describe me. Authenticity, loyalty, honesty. I am open and transparent, I am always true to my core nature, and I am not afraid to look deep into myself and see myself for who I am: an intellectual sensualist, a wanton insatiable hedonist, an elegant slut. Ready to explore and push my boundaries. Confidence. I know who I am, what I stand for. I am as unapologetic of my intellect as I am of my sexuality. II am independent, self-sufficient, and comfortable moving in the world on my own. I am also strong enough to acknowledge that I seek connection and companionship, a hand to hold on to when navigating rough terrain. I am open with my emotions, trusting, and embrace my vulnerability. I have depth. My head, heart, and soul are in balance. Accomplishments. I am at a pinnacle of my career, I am recognized and lauded as a thought leader in my industry, I am worldly, sophisticated, poised, and elegant, and you will feel proud of the envious glances of others as we enter a room, me on your arm, turning heads as we walk by. I am a successful executive-level professional at work that, when with my lover, delight at pleasuring my man and being ravished by him. Passion. I give myself completely, with full abandon, nothing held back. I surrender to my desire, and it feeds off his desire. My pleasure multiplied by his pleasure in having full control of my pleasure. The ultimate power trip for that sapio Dom I am seeking. My body is akin to a finely tuned piano, and in the expert hands, there is an infinite variety of scherzos, minuets, andante con brio that can be performed. And finally, surrender. I have never experienced it, completely, and I crave it. Glimpses of promise every now and then, but I have never met a man that would take me, powerfully, effortlessly, completely. I will surprise, delight a man, a mensh, when he unwraps me and finds what's inside. When you captivate me, I will be beholden to you. I will commit to you, even though we may be ethically non-monogamous. But you will hold my heart, you will be the most important man in my life, you will be the one I think about when I wake up, and you will be my last thought before I fall asleep. I will feel compelled to talk about you to all my friends, and even casual work connections. You will matter to me. You will be the center of my universe, and it is a very vast universe. Because I want to please you, out of my free will, that has been surrendered to you. That is important. I always will have agency, and my submission is so much more precious because I don't have to. I have a full, interesting, rich life outside of you, and yet I choose to kneel by your feet and await your instruction. Be yours, in service. That's what I bring to the table. The menu is in your hands. You order."

Sometimes we have to step into the shadows and embrace our inner darkness to realize the desire and passion held within. Do you possess the courage to stop dreaming and truly embrace sensuality and passion? I'm a Caucasian man, 57 years old, with 20 years in the Lifestyle. What I love about BDSM is the honesty, raw emotion and power of it. The Dom leading, guiding and training; the submissive surrendering control of her body to the Dom. The excitement in those first minutes of vulnerability as the remaining veneer of the outside world is stripped away and forgotten, replaced with intimacy beyond description. Music and light set the mood. A firm but gentle touch that conveys trust and allows you to slip deeply into Our darkness. Kissing, deep and wet. Skin against skin as lingerie is removed. Your breath fast and heavy against my neck, responding to the deep whisper of my voice. The roughness of rope around your torso, your ankles...your wrists. Being positioned, manipulated...commanded. My darkest desires written on the sweet tapestry of your beautiful body. Though we may only have met a short time ago, somehow we become one. Propelled by an ancient, animalistic desire we race toward an ecstasy few experience. The strength of my presence nothing short of psychological captivation, seduction and sexual possession. The allure of your submission rich in femininity and borne on an inner strength from confidence and a knowledge of self. Let me know if this resonates with you. I'm seeking one special woman with a submissive soul and an adventurous heart who can meet weekdays once or twice each month. I want someone to shine with, to blaze hot and burn indelible memories of passion together. Come into my darkness for a few hours and you will never look back. PS: Please don't contact me if you don't live in the United States or only interested in money."

Lets hold hands, stare at the ceiling, and talk about our feelings. Build a safe place where we can both grow stronger - as individuals. Explore the ups and downs of life. And kink. Encourage, support, and comfort each other - inside and outside of the bedroom. Explore emotional / sexual highs and lows together. Go to the edge as a team. Then come back to reality. Hand in hand. Looking for a long term relationship. Someone to share my life with. A best friend to have sexy adventures with. We can start online or long distance. If things go well we can meet in person. I want to live with a kinky partner. I have a house here and am likely to stay. 1. Looking to start as friends. 2. Looking to build a D/s relationship with a submissive 25-45. Start in the bedroom and slowly work the dynamic out of the bedroom. 3. Looking for love and romance - with a side of handcuffs. One day - a collar. My life took me to dark places. I walked through the fires. I was forged in them and came out stronger. Do you want to delve into the darkness with me? We can find things to enjoy and explore. We can laugh at the darkness. We can find pleasure there. Together. Who am I? - I try to make the world a better place. I know how hard life can be. No one has to go through life alone. I love sharing the lessons my life taught me. I can connect with most people pretty easily. I overcame many obstacles to become the person I am today. I have stories to share. Stories about my travels and the people I met. Stories about injuring myself the first night of a 2 week trans-atlantic cruise - really, not fair life. Stories about all my favorite songs. 6 foot. Big Handsome Man. Beard. Glasses. Charming. Contagious laughter. I do not smoke, drink, or do drugs. Financially secure. Multiple degrees. I am well educated, intelligent, and understanding. I am very good at breaking down complicated concepts and pulling out something simple and clear. I enjoy the search for answers to questions I never knew I had. I have been kinky by myself. I had difficulty finding people who understood. Until now. It is a wonderful feeling - being accepted and understood. Being seen. When I discovered bdsm - I found a place to belong. Where things make sense. I am pansexual. Hearts not parts. I am open to all genders and body types. The more I like you mentally - the more I will like you physically. I tend to fall for people through nerdy conversations about passions. Lets get deep on something one of us cares about. We can learn from each other. I recently learned about the real pirates of the Caribbean - yo ho! Huge Disney fan! I enjoy spending time with friends. I travel about once a year - many of my travels these days are deep into the corners of the human mind. I have a weakness for accents. My natural southern accent is one of my strengths. I love talking on the phone / through voice chat. I love getting to know people through long rambling conversations. I love to dream and improvise. I am very silly. I love making people laugh. I have a darker sense of humor. I am pretty relaxed overall - but I love getting excited and enthusiastic about things. My love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I am incredibly optimistic. I accept things as they are - then find a path forward. I am kind and compassionate. I am empathetic and emotionally intelligent. I am nurturing. I like being the person that my friends can rely on. I love music. I have a thing for rap, rock, 80s pop hits (I CAN go for that), and music with really deep lyrics. I love how my feelings will magically line up with songs I am listening to. I love musicals like Hamilton (Wait for it!). I love falling into any storytelling experience. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I like watching Netflix. I love playing video games - especially JRPGs. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). I like documentaries. I love mythology. I love superhero, horror, crime, sci-fi, fantasy, action, comedy, thrillers. I love magic and stand up comedy. I love when they defy expectations. Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. It keeps me laughing during good and bad times. I occasionally host board game nights with my friends. I enjoy going to the movies and the occasional escape room. I love museums. Seeking - Passionate. Caring. Understanding. Curious. Nurturing. Affectionate. You love to listen. You like to tease, laugh, and play. You have an open mind. You love sharing your thoughts and feelings. You are comfortable with vulnerability. You are enthusiastic and willing to explore our kinks together. What am I looking for in a relationship? - Companionship. Romance. Intimacy and kink with someone I can trust, rely on, and depend on. Someone I can lean on during hard times. Someone to cum with and someone to talk to. We can tease each other with inside jokes and bad jokes. Laughing until we hurt and we have to stop to catch our breath. We can help each other get what we want. Help bring our fantasies to life. Inside and outside of kink. Inside BDSM - I like flipping between Daddy and Dom mode. I love the contrast between sweet and sadistic. I love showering my submissive with praise and affection. And degradation. Using them to satisfy myself. Training them to satisfy me. You will make my needs and getting me off - especially orally - a priority. There is a lot of intimacy in being worshipped orally. I will encourage you with edging, teasing, and denial. I will reward you with multiple orgasms, forced orgasms, etc. We can discuss this - and more as we get comfortable with each other. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. We can find your limits and keep them sacred or push them until we find new ones. Limits are - scat, blood, weapons, needles, heavy impact play, dangerous breathplay and choking. Hold my hand. Let's build a safe place. A relationship with trust, respect, and vulnerability. Together. I can be your bright, shining light in the darkness. You can be mine. Send me a PM - What resonated with you? Ask me anything. Good Luck everyone! Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day."

374,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,26M4F - I've been dreaming about you for years. Seeking a girl with a true servants heart. I want to create a 24/7 dynamic based on an intimate relationship of service and devotion. I want to own the person my life has been leading up to. (online at first),0,bc36es,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/bc36es/26m4f_ive_been_dreaming_about_you_for_years/,2019-04-12 04:14:19,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest.

They are my gifts for you and now you will wear them. You will bear them. You feel me throughout the day, the dull aches and the searing sting. You smile and wince and glow. You feel them whenever you want to be reminded that you are mine. You feel them every time you sit down or move a certain way. Finally, you gasp and moan and your pelvis squirms when I tell you to feel pleasure. My touch is different now. My fingers glide across your beckoning wetness and I whisper, ""You are such a good girl. Such a pretty, obedient girl. I am so happy you are mine. You are all I ever wanted."" I kiss the tear away from your warm cheek as my finger pushes you open. I love the taste of your tears. I love how you feel inside. I want you to be my online submissive. l want to take you to that emotional edge and linger there with you, holding you precariously over the abyss of fear and pain and buried memories. I want to feel the surge of power in my body that I will get from holding your vulnerability in my hands and deciding what to do with it. I will use it to penetrate you forcefully and fill you: your mind, your body, your emotions, your spirit. Then I will break them all and make whats left of you mine. Write me now."
376,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,33 [M4F] A symphony of submission - Dominant chord seeks his final resolution,7,bcs3dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/bcs3dv/33_m4f_a_symphony_of_submission_dominant_chord/,2019-04-14 02:11:52,"I. **Prelude** -Sonata form- The introduction begins starkly, coldly, unassumedly - as if the melody, stated subtly in the strings, is unaware it is being performed. Ambiguous in its tonality, its structure, it wanders with equal parts mystery and invitation, slipping under the radar of the unattuned ear, only offering exactly enough allure to implore the most curious and imaginative to listen on. As a second line joins in imitation, we learn of our main subject. He is a compendium of counterpoint, a chorus of contradiction, a discord of dichotomy. Often cold, distant, reserved to the world - yet infinitely warm, giving, protective of those he holds dear. Polite and proper - yet delectably depraved. The harmony hovers between major and minor - the listener, already, is unsure what they are hearing, yet innately certain that they must follow it. The first theme states itself unexpectedly plainly for such an evocative overture. It is happy, thoughtful, creative, searching, active, quirky, sensitive, light. Rich in texture, warm in harmony, inventive in melody. It follows most of the traditional formulae for such a classical structure and meets the eye as entirely typical - the average listener would surely pass it by and toss the entire work into the overwhelming pile of pieces that had nothing of substance to share. The transition into the secondary material is where the movement truly shines. Suddenly, yet not unsettlingly, the inimitable darkness of the introduction resurfaces with astounding aptitude from the otherwise ordinary primary material. Were it not so masterfully crafted, the listener might think them entirely separate works from entirely different composers - however the maestro at work here seems a master of juxtaposition who has surely wrestled with such diametric deviations for decades. In the blink of an eye, with the very same elements which had only moments ago finished stating the opening material, a wave of tumultuous color washes over the orchestra, sweeping and swelling towards glorious climaxes that seem unearned given how quickly the music has come upon us, yet unquestionably warranted and appropriate - only to pull the sound back at the last turn of phrase, booming brass giving way to whispering woodwinds just when the ear expected an ardent arrival. The most impressive feature of the movement is the effortless ease with which the two exist together without contention or conflict. The music never truly reaches the dynamic heights to which it is clearly capable, yet remains surprisingly satisfying nonetheless. The listener is left moved, changed, shaken - yet in dire need of more. The movement closes in the same unassuming nature with which it began, and a short pause signifies the denouement. The musicians turn their pages silently, almost reverently, so as not to disturb the sacred hush that has enraptured the audience. II. **Mind** -Rondo- Left with craving curiosity from the first movement, the listener is pleasantly surprised to hear the second open with a light, quirky scherzo. Overflowing with capricious whim and inventiveness - yet retaining a perspective of depth and solemnity. Effervescent grace notes enhance the melodys already unique and fascinating shape, while frequent and unexpected dissonances, both in tone and timbre, keep the ear on its toes - it is clear the composer is telling us an elaborate and wonderful joke and, furthermore, delighting in the process. The movements inner sections depart briefly from the eccentricity of the main theme. Once effusive, vociferous, passionately lush; once introspective, intense, brilliantly introverted. Each note carries its meaning with purpose - whether a string of highly specific intervals or a vast landscape of less poignant cascades of color. Each return is more pleasing than the next, and the single movement seems an entire symphony of shades, from the esoteric and existential to the noetic and nerdy. The curiosity and creativity of the writing seem truly endless, and as the movement closes with a final suggestive quip, the listener wonders what other worlds the composer may have shown her, had he more time. III. **Heart** -Minuet and Trio- In striking contrast to the calculated nature of the second movement - with its almost unspoken expectation for subtle subterfuge and imminent innuendo - the third opens with a simple dance. Innocence and purity seem the left and right feet as the music holds its listener close - and holds little back. The gestures are intimate, integral, intoxicating, inviting, the harmonies sweet, sweeping, swelling, swaying. With no elaborate instrumentation or clever construction, the music itself is the theme. The musicians play with complete, terrifying sincerity - there is no virtuosity, no technical fireworks, no impressive invention, only raw, beautiful, imperfect humanity. The sacred solemnity of the minuet gives way to a trio nearly bursting with the purest of joys. Utter rapture overtakes the orchestra as almost nave celebrations of absolute ecstasy bounce boundlessly between the walls of the hall. The sheer, contagious splendor of immaculate happiness overcomes the listener to the point of simultaneous laughter and tears. The trio reaches a bubbling climax, and the music returns the listener to the minuet with a most infectious smile and sense of deep peace. A wave of immense, incredible warmth washes over the audience as the movement at last comes to rest. IV. **Body** -Theme and Variations- Only after the sincerity and emotional openness of the third movement can the fourth reveal itself, unlock itself, expose itself. While many other pieces would open with this movement, even with precious, pitiful little introduction, the composer here holds it in highest regard, and has made us earn the right to enjoy its many intricate pleasures and crashing climaxes - a right the listener should aim to take full advantage of as often as practically possible. The theme carries the emotional vulnerability and nakedness into the physical, tactile realm - remnants of the minuet remain ever present throughout. But where the previous music touched on the abstract, the ethereal, here we are grounded immediately in the earthy, the carnal, the visceral, the animal. Soft clarinets coaxing melodic curves give way to pounding percussion carelessly crashing mallet into head, setting every molecule of air in the hall on fire. The variations are a game of contrasts and creativity. All imaginable elements at the composers disposal are used to full effect - from the highest, shrill whimper of the piccolo to the most guttural, low bellow of the tuba - from the painstakingly slow, undulating rhythm with saintly patience to the reckless, ravenous, raucous runs with the abandon of a sinner - from the most gentle, calming caress to the most violent, severe strike - the only unifying feature of the movement seems to be unabashed, unapologetic hedonism in its most depraved, most disturbed state. Each return of the theme seems to suggest a satisfying supposition, but inescapably and inexorably invites the intended into increased improvisation. The movement collapses into a much needed - and well earned - rest, the exhaustion of the musicians exertion evident. Warm tingles begin to lift off the skin as the final sustained chords drift into nothingness. The energy of the music lingers long into the silence that follows. V. **Soul** -Fugue- Divine. Inexpressible. Profound. Perfect. The subject transcends the mortality of mere musicians playing notes on pages. It is almost still. Quiet. One step away from the flawless beauty of pure silence. Eyes close, so as to not mar the ears with unnecessary information or influence. The music simply *is*, and no amount of words can ever properly capture the holy harmony that holds the whole spirit helpless. As painfully beautiful as music, words, movement, art can be, *nothing* in this world can ever hope to hold a candle to the perfect beauty of two souls finding their missing halves and uniting into one. The fugue reaches a stretto where subject and episode converge, where yin meets its yang, where melodies once dissonant on their own unite to form perfect harmony, where long journeys full of struggle, pain, sorrow, doubt, imperfection are immediately made worth every step. The piece ends with the tonic, resonant and grounded in the bass, and the dominant lingering blissfully in the top voice. The open, major chord is repeated three times with baited breath between. The strings keep vibrating long after the bow has been lifted, the conductor holds his hands high, hesitating to herald the end of the experience, the audience barely breathes, unable to break the perfect moment they wish would last forever. After what seems an eternity, the conductor lowers his hands. The musicians sheathe their instruments and relax their postures. A timid applause starts from the balcony and spreads respectfully through the house, people make small talk through humble bows, uncomfortable with enduring such vulnerability much longer. Programs are folded into purses and a mass exodus soon leaves the once bustling concert hall empty. Except for *one*. Perhaps, this time, she will be brave enough to venture backstage and say hello. --- Long for my soul. Hunger for my body. Cherish my heart. Start with my mind."

I'm looking for a kinky play partner in Chicago to further explore kinks, fantasies, and general sexuality. **I'm 30, live in River North, and am originally from Chicago...** I've been seriously kinky- as in making kink exploration a priority, experimenting, and even partaking in the Chicago community- for about 5 years now. On top of kink, my passions include: cooking, spiritual study, design, video games, music &amp; movies, travel, and architecture, to name a few. Kink wise, I've evolved and shifted here and there to where I currently stand. I am definitely *Dominant,* and enjoy being in control; I've discovered I'm not a very jealous person, and a true hedonist, this has played into some of my kinks shaping (like group play &amp; swinging), and my desire to explore them. **My biggest kinks**, or biggest kink- as you'll see from my history, is extreme dirty talk. I love communication in and out of the bedroom; I think it's incredibly important to maintain any kind of relationship, but especially one where we're playing with kinks, fantasies, and each other. I also love anal, cum play, fashion play, free use, pet play, role play, toy use, edging, orgasm control, rough oral, public, exhibitionism, voyuerism, being rough, cock worship, sleep play, group, attention play... and a few others. I'm most curious to explore more deeply what I haven't been able to, that is swinging, group play, and cuckqueaning. When it comes to a partner I prefer aggressive, confident, service-oriented submissives. A sub who needs dominance constantly asserted, I find... well, boring (nothing against people who enjoy it, of course). I long for someone who wants to be the biggest slut in the room, someone who imagines all the ways they can fuck, just as I do. Someone who loves pleasing and giving, but also enjoys receiving and being pampered. I'm looking for the kind of girl who reads- or even better- posts on r/stupidslutsclub. There have been a lot of relationships I've had with mismatched sexuality, still plenty of kinky relationships where the sub thought that being a sub meant just laying there. If you're new, make no mistake, this shit takes work on both sides. Communication, vulnerability, *and* trust are required to go where I want go and do what I want to do. **Kinks I'm not into** include scat, blood, vomit, knifes, needles, extreme violence, resistance... **What I'm trying to create relationship wise** is something intimate and vulnerable where we can share, fuck, and grow. I'm looking for a fellow sex scientist, someone submissive in the bedroom, not outside it. Together, I want to create a relationship to explore our kinks and fantasies, and try things that maybe we didn't even think we'd like. I'm open to it being casual, or developing into something serious, monogamous or open (I love the idea of cuckqueaning, and of hot-wifing/hot-husbanding). So long as there's trust, unconditional communication, and us respecting our own- and each others- boundaries I don't think anything bad can happen that can't be dealt with. **As for you**, I need you to be intelligent, driven, strong, capable, and a total, stupid fucking slut. Someone who is brave enough to communicate unconditionally, and is seeking to build something just like me. [Someone who laughs at this comic](URL or at least gets it. Physically speaking, I'm 5'10'', 175, white, handsome face, great cock. If you're the type to ghost, flake, or fail to communicate (whether it's communicating affection or rejection) I'd rather you not reach out, thank you. If you are interested send a picture of yourself (your face, a faceless photo, a nude, something with clothes on, whatever), and **explain why you felt compelled to reach out.** I promise I will respond, whether it's with a photo and an invitation to chat, or to let you know I don't feel a physical attraction, I will pay you that courtesy. Happy spring."

That may not have worked - but - I can not snap my fingers. Let me try - This IS the post you are looking for - waves hands.. No? We may have to imprint the ""mind control magical spells"" - as we go. First - I want to thank everyone for reading this piece of my soul. I am well educated, intelligent, and understanding. I am charming and funny. I live with chronic pain - I can explain it all in detail as we get to know each other. It has taken a long time to get comfortable sharing this part of my life with someone - and here I am. For that AND kink. I am a homebody. I go out with friends every now and then. I travel when possible. I love learning about different thought systems and pulling out nuggets of wisdom and absorbing that into my own personal belief system. If it makes sense to you and you can support it - it is a validly held belief. I am growing and changing. I want to do it with someone. That is what she said. I want someone here beside me - to be my cheerleader (inside and outside of the bedroom - super bonus points if you already have an outfit). A best friend to enjoy my life with. Someone to have sexy adventures with. Someone to feel safe with in every way. I am silly and love making people laugh - even if it is just myself. Looking for friends and the possibility of something more. Looking for the right connection that can build into a romantic partner. Someone to trust, rely on, and depend on. Life likes to throw things at us when we least expect them. There are times we need to step back and pause - everything. Which is why we need a foundation to fall back on - no matter what is happening. A vanilla foundation we can add bdsm sprinkles to over time. If we are close, we can see each other often. If we are far away, we can get together later. I work well with people who are - assertive, confident, genuine, direct, specific, emotional, inquisitive, and vulnerable. Seeking someone 25-45. A submissive or a switch. Someone to slowly and carefully explore all of my kinks and fantasies with. In conversation and BDSM. Someone who wants to understand and be understood. Someone I can connect and grow with - emotionally and sexually. We can see and accept all of each other. I love learning about people and their passions. Do you love, respect, and treasure vulnerability? Me too! I love sitting in, talking about, processing, and working to understand thoughts, feelings, and emotions. We can explore our minds together. Go spelunking and enjoy discovering whatever we come across. I have been kinky for a very long time - but had difficulty finding people who understood. Until now. It is such a wonderful feeling - being accepted and understood. When I discovered bdsm - I knew I found a place where I belonged. I connect with people on a deep and emotional level. I am very introspective. I love breaking things down and really understanding them. Lets talk it out! I am interested and curious - I want to know every story and really understand what made you who you are. I want to know what you think and I want you to know what I think. The deeper this goes - the more openly and transparently we can discuss our feelings, perspectives, thoughts, emotions and physical / emotional pain with each other. Everything is valid. I have a darker sense of humor (think - Cards Against Humanity). 6 foot. Big Handsome Man. Beard. Glasses. Huge Disney fan! I love nerding out about politics (Communism - great in theory, horrible in execution), sex, philosophy, and video games. I have a deep love of music. I love how my feelings will magically line up with the songs I listen to. I love quoting song lyrics and singing songs when talking to people. I love playing JRPGs - currently working my way through Yo-kai Watch 3. The Witcher 3 is one of my all time favorite RPGs. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). My favorite tv show is The Wire. My favorite movies are Avatar and Singin' in the Rain. I love falling into any storytelling experience - comic books, anime, and books. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I love mythology, magic, and stand up comedy. I love being surprised by punchlines and the way they use words to entertain. Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. I enjoy watching the Marvel movies. I occasionally host board game nights with my friends. My top 3 love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I love to cuddle, snuggle, and spoon - be close together. I am gentle, caring, and nurturing. I love being there for people. I am very good at it. I love being taken care of and nurtured. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. Let's explore each other and build something meaningful. Let's build a safe place together. We can build a relationship with trust, respect, vulnerability, and honesty. Together. I can be your bright, shining light in the darkness. You can be mine. Now for the sexy part because people need to get to sleep / back to work - yes, that means you. I am pansexual. I love people. I am interested in exploring with others alongside my partner - eventually. I lean towards the dominant end of the spectrum. I love the mental and emotional part of BDSM. Kinks / Sprinkles - dirty talk, oral, deepthroat, ageplay, dark ageplay, petplay, degradation, trap / femboy / sissy, threesomes, begging, orgasm control, outfit control, incest, breeding, dd/lg, md/lb, nursing, ownership, collaring, freeuse, objectification, 1950s housewife, domestic service, raceplay, misogyny, and the rest (Here on Gilligan's Island!). Limits - weapons, needles!!!, blood, scat, choking and breathplay Softer limit - heavy impact play I want to mix nurturing, gentle, and sweet with sadistic - I want to do horrible / beautiful things to you after I / we dress you in beautiful outfits. I want to dive deep into everything that brings us pleasure, to understand how and why. Then, we can use this knowledge to please each other - like we have all the answers to a test. We can tease and torture each other with words because we know each other so well. I enjoy time as a daddy and a little - nurturing and being nurtured. My little side is dominant sometimes - I want mommy to hold me close, massage me, nurse me, and rock me - but I also want to make her my sex toy. My dominant fantasies include - A harem, CNC (music factory!), training someone to love the things I love over time - with orgasms, conditioning, and more! I am not locked into any specific dynamic. I want to try to find what we like as we go - I have never dominated you before. And I will not - until we have built something in person. I'd do anything for love (but I won't do that). We can not jump right to a 24/7 collared TPE before I meet your parents. I may not work well with brats - the resistance confuses me. I want to explore so much in person with the right person. Discover our favorite things together over time. The more we explore - the more we will find. Make mistakes and turn them into inside jokes. Have a lot of awkward fun together. The destination is an illusion. Getting there and staying there is the fun part. Lets focus on the present. Together. Do not hesitate to send me a PM if you want to get to know me better. Tell me what resonated with you and tell me your favorite song(s). Good Luck everyone! Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day!"
379,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,26M4F - I've been dreaming about you for years. I'm seeking a girl with a true servants heart. I want to create a 24/7 dynamic based on an intimate relationship of service and devotion. I want to own the person my life has been leading up to. (online at first),5,beoxpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/beoxpq/26m4f_ive_been_dreaming_about_you_for_years_im/,2019-04-19 04:25:06,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short.

It really hurts and the feeling consumes you and focuses your mind. You suddenly feel helpless and weak, but glowing inside. Radiating with desire. I see both the fear and trust as your moistening eyes look at me. I hear a begging whimper. Your lip quivers. The next blow is harder, swifter. In exactly the same spot. You reflexively beg for mercyreally beg this time. Your breath deepens, more desperate. Your hips writhe and buck after you feel my bare palm strike your ass. I turn your head and force you to look at the marks on your body. Red and purple welts. The spots grow, become splotchy, uneven, with a dark red center that rises from your skin. I love those marks. They are my gifts for you and now you will wear them. You will bear them. You feel me throughout the day, the dull aches and the searing sting. You smile and wince and glow. You feel them whenever you want to be reminded that you are mine. You feel them every time you sit down or move a certain way. Finally, you gasp and moan and your pelvis squirms when I tell you to feel pleasure. My touch is different now. My fingers glide across your beckoning wetness and I whisper, ""You are such a good girl. Such a pretty, obedient girl. I am so happy you are mine. You are all I ever wanted."" I kiss the tear away from your warm cheek as my finger pushes you open. I love the taste of your tears. I love how you feel inside. I want you to be my online submissive. l want to take you to that emotional edge and linger there with you, holding you precariously over the abyss of fear and pain and buried memories. I want to feel the surge of power in my body that I will get from holding your vulnerability in my hands and deciding what to do with it. I will use it to penetrate you forcefully and fill you: your mind, your body, your emotions, your spirit. Then I will break them all and make whats left of you mine. Write me now."

Here are the two types of men I have found myself drawn to over the years: &amp;#x200B; **Alpha Bulls** \- These type of men are typically, but not always, dominant (at least seemingly) in their day to day life. They feel a sense of deep connection to the physical power of their muscle and the utility of their genitalia. They may not understand why, but they feel a duty larger than themselves to hone and shape themselves to achieve the optimal physical state of the body that was given to them. The pursuit of vitality, health and virility are innate drives that push them forward. Many of them discover that their ultimate purpose is to develop into the most useful form of the human male animal that they can become to serve and please the more powerful and in-control feminine energy of women that creates and fuels life itself. They recognize its superiority and work tirelessly to honor and serve it. &amp;#x200B; **Servants** \- These are men who do not have the confidence nor fulfill the physical purpose of a traditional ""bull"" but still appreciate and recognize the power of feminine energy. They tend to serve in other ways... for a woman's amusement or pleasure, fulfilling tasks, etc. These men tend to become weak and discombobulated when in the presence of an authentically dominant woman and need more help and guidance from her to fulfill their purpose. They need more gentle and tender handling from dominant women as they are understandably intimidated by the more widely accepted and stereotypical role that a strong ""man"" or ""bull"" sets. They are in need of management and care-taking as a relief from the impossible burden of meeting that traditional male stereotype. &amp;#x200B; If you feel that either of these descriptions personally resonate with who you are... let's have a conversation. I am looking to find more of these types of men to help me more accurately refine what it is that drives and motivates me as a dominant woman. ***Also... it is a simple desire and need of mine to express my power and receive pleasure.*** &amp;#x200B; I am looking to interview and potentially explore some of these concepts with you online. These explorations include sexual exercises that promote your submission and surrender to me. I am mature, direct, strict yet tender and affectionate when necessary. Both of our safety and comfort is paramount and is a top priority to ensure before delving into anything that requires any sort of vulnerability. I will not ""jump in"" to anything straight away. &amp;#x200B; Logistically, I would ideally prefer to remain on mic as I speak with you on cam over a messaging platform such as Skype. If this type of scenario is acceptable to you, and what I've expressed here intrigues you, please send me a PM here. Although our connection is what is most important, your visual appearance is not insignificant in my decision-making. So, if you're are comfortable sharing a photo of yourself with your initial message, you will be moved up the list in my response order."

Thus my presence here. I'd love to find a Dominant woman who'd find pleasure in tasking me with playing, not because I would enjoy it, but because that kind of power and control fuels Her. I'd be willing to show Her my compliance over Skype if we've built up some trust as that would enhance the feeling of vulnerability for me. Now I do have limits...namely blood, scat, extreme pain (though honestly I don't know my limits), children, or anything that would get us in actual trouble. Beyond that I'm flexible. On the kink front, I find particular arousal in anal penetration, prostate play, mild cbt, edging, denial, ruined orgasms, that sort of thing. If this sounds like something that might appeal to you, then I look forward to hearing from you and chatting a bit more :)"
383,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,34 [M4F] (San Francisco) Experienced online sub seeks IRL Domme,0,bfre9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/bfre9b/34_m4f_san_francisco_experienced_online_sub_seeks/,2019-04-22 03:40:58,"I have been exploring power exchange dynamics for the past 12 years. Initially, I was exclusively dominant. I found it so incredibly fulfilling to know that a woman trusted me enough to share that part of herself with me and valued me in a way that made her want to me to have control over her. I spent a long time trying out various forms of dominance, ultimately discovering that I was especially drawn to the mental and emotional aspects. Understanding why a woman was drawn to submission and using this knowledge to craft erotically uncomfortable tasks for her. Humiliation and degradation, tailored to her desires and the reasons for them, were always prominent parts of my dominance. It was just enthralling to design challenging tasks that were specifically engaging for a particular partner. A few years ago I was browsing reddit and elsewhere, as I often did, looking for a new submissive woman to play with. I had been looking for a few days and hadnt had any luck. For some reason it struck me that I was really investing a lot of time into this search. That I was really desperate for a womans attention. It was embarrassing. And for some reason I found that feeling exciting. I started thinking about the typical imbalance - men spend hours hoping to find someone to talk to them while women always have plenty of options available (which I recognize comes with its own stress and difficulties). I found myself wondering what I might be willing to do just to maybe just get a woman to talk to me. Within just a few days, I found myself revealing intimate and embarrassing secrets to women, hoping they might find them intriguing enough to talk to me. Before long I was letting them assign me tasks, sexual and otherwise, that they might find exciting or even just amusing. After about a year, I found myself doing absolutely degrading things and discovering an immense satisfaction in being able to serve women in that way. Over this time, I have submitted, to varying degrees, to a lot of different women, and I have found submission much more natural and comfortable than I ever found dominant. There is just something so embarrassingly exciting about letting a woman take advantage of my desperate need for sexual attention. But all of my experience as a sub has been online, and now Id like to know what its like to be in the presence of a strong, dominant woman who knows about this part of me. To feel her touch me (or not), to let her use me (or not) as she pleases. I want to know what its like to give myself to her in that way. There is one difficulty: Im married. Of course, I wont blame any women that dont want to even speak with me for this reason. But even if youre still interested in secretly exploring with me despite my committed relationship, it means that it will take some time for me to feel comfortable. For me to feel safe despite the inherent vulnerability of engaging in this sort of play in person. But Im willing to invest the time it takes to get to that point and Im looking for someone else that is as well. My name is David. Im 34, live and work in SF near Union Square. Whether youre an experienced Domme or just curious about discovering your dominant side, please let me know if youd care to chat."

I'm looking for a kinky play partner in Chicago to further explore kinks, fantasies, and general sexuality. I'll also be in NYC April 25th to the 29th, and Stockholm from the 8th of May to the 5th of June. **I'm 30, live in River North, and am originally from Chicago...** I've been seriously kinky- as in making kink exploration a priority, experimenting, and even partaking in the Chicago community- for about 5 years now. On top of kink, my passions include: cooking, spiritual study, design, video games, music &amp; movies, travel, and architecture, to name a few. Kink wise, I've evolved and shifted here and there to where I currently stand. I am definitely *Dominant,* and enjoy being in control; I've discovered I'm not a very jealous person, and a true hedonist, this has played into some of my kinks shaping (like group play &amp; swinging), and my desire to explore them. **My biggest kinks**, or biggest kink- as you'll see from my history, is extreme dirty talk. I love communication in and out of the bedroom; I think it's incredibly important to maintain any kind of relationship, but especially one where we're playing with kinks, fantasies, and each other. I also love anal, cum play, fashion play, free use, pet play, role play, toy use, edging, orgasm control, rough oral, public, exhibitionism, voyuerism, being rough, cock worship, sleep play, group, attention play... and a few others. I'm most curious to explore more deeply what I haven't been able to, that is swinging, group play, and cuckqueaning. When it comes to a partner I prefer aggressive, confident, service-oriented submissives. A sub who needs dominance constantly asserted, I find... well, boring (nothing against people who enjoy it, of course). I long for someone who wants to be the biggest slut in the room, someone who imagines all the ways they can fuck, just as I do. Someone who loves pleasing and giving, but also enjoys receiving and being pampered. I'm looking for the kind of girl who reads- or even better- posts on r/stupidslutsclub. There have been a lot of relationships I've had with mismatched sexuality, still plenty of kinky relationships where the sub thought that being a sub meant just laying there. If you're new, make no mistake, this shit takes work on both sides. Communication, vulnerability, *and* trust are required to go where I want go and do what I want to do. **Kinks I'm not into** include scat, blood, vomit, knifes, needles, extreme violence, resistance... **What I'm trying to create relationship wise** is something intimate and vulnerable where we can share, fuck, and grow. I'm looking for a fellow sex scientist, someone submissive in the bedroom, not outside it. Together, I want to create a relationship to explore our kinks and fantasies, and try things that maybe we didn't even think we'd like. I'm open to it being casual, or developing into something serious, monogamous or open (I love the idea of cuckqueaning, and of hot-wifing/hot-husbanding). So long as there's trust, unconditional communication, and us respecting our own- and each others- boundaries I don't think anything bad can happen that can't be dealt with. **As for you**, I need you to be intelligent, driven, strong, capable, and a total, stupid fucking slut. Someone who is brave enough to communicate unconditionally, and is seeking to build something just like me. [Someone who laughs at this comic](URL or at least gets it. Physically speaking, I'm 5'10'', 175, white, handsome face, great cock. If you're the type to ghost, flake, or fail to communicate (whether it's communicating affection or rejection) I'd rather you not reach out, thank you. If you are interested send a picture of yourself (your face, a faceless photo, a nude, something with clothes on, whatever), and **explain why you felt compelled to reach out.** I promise I will respond, whether it's with a photo and an invitation to chat, or to let you know I don't feel a physical attraction, I will pay you that courtesy. Happy spring."

She's just waiting to reply! ;),1,bghkwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/bghkwr/46m4f_i_found_the_perfect_sub_shes_just_waiting/,2019-04-24 01:17:25,"Hello there. I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games until all hours. (Way too much WoW lately) - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. - Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. - Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. - Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting. - Obedience and compliance, as well as meticulous control and attention is what gets me going. - *Extras:* Slut shaming, behavior modification focused degradation/humiliation, body marking, ownership enforcement, etc. **In my perfect world, my submissive partner would be:** - Based here in the US, preferably in the east coast for timezone purposes. - Between 25-50 years old. - Available *sometime* within my available weekday hours (7a-7p EST) - Highly attentive and communicative. - Looking to live our long distance/separate lives together as much as we possibly can. Not confining ourselves to specific areas of sharing our lives together but opening up every facet of our lives to one another over time and trust. - Excited by the idea of mutual obsession, infatuation, and utter devotion. - Experienced OR actively learning and reading to gain more experience. - A strong speaker with high expectations for command of the English language . - Witty, dry sarcasm, dark humor are all a plus (please don't drown me in your lol's. I'll admit I am a sucker for a good placed GIF though). - Emotionally available. - Married or unmarried, tethered or untethered is irrelevant. Must be transparent with me and my expectation is some degree of monogamy even if you are in a LTR or married at some point. I'm not looking to be #3 in your rotation. To clarify further, in a long term concept with someone who is also married/in a LTR, I'm not looking for either of us to be in a relationship (physical or emotional) with anyone outside of each other and our respective partners. **Communication:** - Hangouts (text, voice/video calls), telegram, emails, kik (as a last resort unfortunately), snail mail (PO box -- I'm not that insane), or in person. I've posted here before and met some amazing people, but ultimately long term wise, it hasn't lasted to what I've wanted. If you aren't interested in having deep conversations or in writing detailing responses, please don't bother to reach out to me. Include a name or alias that isn't your screen name, A/S/L, communication preferences, and precisely what in this post moved you to reach out. Thank you."

Do you love, respect, and treasure vulnerability? Are you great at communication? Me too! Seeking someone 25+. Someone kind, caring, funny, and a good listener. A switch or submissive. Someone to help me explore my kinks and fantasies. Someone who wants to understand and be understood. I work well with people who are - genuine, direct, specific, emotional, and inquisitive. Looking for friends and the possibility of something more. Looking for the right connection that can build into a romantic partner. Someone to trust, rely on, and depend on. If we are close, we can see each other often. If we are far away, we can get together later. I have been kinky for a very long time - but had difficulty finding people who understood. Until now. It is such a wonderful feeling - being accepted and understood. I found a place to belong. Intelligence is sexy - teach me all about you. I dream of finding another pansexual switch - like me. We will explore and dominate / submit each other. We can find joy in all the different roles and occasionally with other people. Together. The most important thing to me is being able to share all of myself with someone. We can see and accept all of each other. I missed my opportunity to explore sex and kink and my desires - before my life changed 10 years ago. I will need the help of a caring and supportive partner. To do it now. I have a lot of lost time to make up for! I live with chronic pain. I understand myself and my body very well because of it. It taught me to appreciate what I have. At the end of law school my chronic pain appeared. Every plan I had for my life fell through my hands like sand through an hourglass. Slowly. The pain did not stop. I finished law school anyway. I have scratched and clawed and built a new life for myself - inside the ruins of my old one. I am satisfied. I am enough. I have come a very very very long way. I stopped chasing the dream of a pain free life. I learned how to work and live with the pain. To not fight it. To not resist it. To feel it and accept it. To understand it. To investigate it. Like an emotion. I am in pain and that is ok. Now - I am on the way up and I am chasing my dreams. My kinky and non kinky dreams. I want to live and enjoy my life. When I can. I hope to find more people that can understand my needs - who can give my feelings and pain a space to exist. There is no cure. What helps the most is encouragement, support, listening, and acceptance. I am growing and changing. I want to do it with someone. That IS what she said. I want someone here beside me - to be my cheerleader (inside and outside of the bedroom - SUPER bonus points if you already have an outfit). A best friend to enjoy life with. Someone to have sexy adventures with. Someone to feel safe with in every way. I am a homebody because of my pain. I go out with friends when I can - movies and escape rooms. I travel when possible. I love learning about different thought systems and pulling out nuggets of wisdom and absorbing that into my own personal belief system. If it makes sense to you and you can support it - it is a validly held belief. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. I am passionate about dirty talk, oral, degradation, dd/lg, md/lb, freeuse, trap /femboy / sissy, domestic service, outfit control, orgasm control, sensory deprivation, and dark ageplay. And the rest (Here on Gilligan's Island!). I want to learn and grow with someone I trust. I connect with people on a deep and emotional level. I am very introspective. I love breaking things down and really understanding them. I love sitting in, talking about, processing, and working to understand feelings. Lets talk it out! I am interested and curious - I want to know every story and really understand what made you who you are. I want to know what you think and I want you to know what I think. The deeper this goes - the more openly and transparently we can discuss our feelings, perspectives, thoughts, and emotions with each other. I have a darker sense of humor (think - Cards Against Humanity). 6 foot. Big Handsome Man. Beard. Glasses. Huge Disney fan! I love nerding out about politics (Communism - great in theory, horrible in execution), sex, philosophy, and video games. I have a deep love of music. I love how my feelings will magically line up with the songs I am listening to. I love quoting song lyrics and singing songs while talking to people. I love playing JRPGs - currently working my way through Yo-kai Watch 3. The Witcher 3 is one of my all time favorites. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). My favorite tv show is The Wire. My favorite movies are Avatar and Singin' in the Rain. I love falling into any storytelling experience - comic books, anime, video games, and books. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I love mythology, magic, and stand up comedy. I love being surprised by punchlines and the way they use words to entertain. Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. I enjoy watching the Marvel movies. I occasionally host board game nights with my friends. My top 3 love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I love to cuddle, snuggle, and spoon - be close together. I am gentle, caring, and nurturing. I love being there for people. I am supportive, empathetic, and a great listener. I love teamwork. Honesty. Togetherness. The thought of knowing that we will work hard and build something amazing together. That we can both enjoy for a long time. Reading and researching and studying and comparing likes and notes and desires. So we can discover and enjoy emotional and sexual highs together. Lets laugh, cuddle, fuck, talk about our feelings, and have a great time. Send me a PM - if you want to get to know me better. Good Luck everyone! Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day!"

I have a special place in my heart for women with sexual proclivities on the more... masochistic side. Knowing that about someone drives me nuts. It doesnt have to be explicit, but once I figure it out, thru conversation or otherwise, my heart just flutters... the ability to be vulnerable like that, to trust me with that vulnerability, and to top it all off, to derive sexual pleasure (from me!) indulging in whatever thing it is that makes your legs shake. Always makes me feel like a lucky man. For example, you might like (and this is NOT an exhaustive list NOR is it a checklist NOR does this list mean that these things are musts or even a wish list. These are just things that IVE experienced; what gets YOU wet might be totally different, which is totally cool, and exciting might I add): - having your hair pulled - having things around your neck (like my hand, or a collar, etc) - being spanked (in any way, hands or tools, from behind, maybe being hit other ways, etc) - having your nipples get a lot of attention (with varying intensity) - anything involving my or your mouth, maybe some teeth, maybe some tongue, maybe some fingers at the same time - butt stuff (this tends to be a sensitive topic so Ill leave it at that but will note the goal is always orgasm. Further inquiries are certainly welcome lol) - Ive been known to get quite playful so, like, tickling? Thats a form of torture, right? Lol Or sort of wrestling/being pinned down? I think you get the idea. All that said, I understand that getting to a point where someone is comfortable enough with someone else to reveal sexual desires that might make them feel vulnerable takes some work. This is a tough conversation to broach in most settings, which is why Im posting here! If youre interested, lets talk! Lets talk until theres nothing left to talk about. I hope Ive exhibited that Im pretty much an open book. So to get things going, I guess what Im really looking for is a fwb sort of situation. I live just south of philadelphia, work in the legal world, and am told Im attractive  Im clean, hygienic, and take care of myself and would expect that of you. For a pic, I can send you my kik username, theres one there. Happy to send others to verify. Im using my main acct bc Im on mobile and currently out of the country so trying to keep it anonymous here. Of course, were talking about sex here and part of that is sexual attraction, so shoot me a dm and Ill send you the kik username, you can take a look and decide from there. Id of course want to see who Im talking to too! But thats secondary to all of the above. Anywho, Ill be on pins and needles!"

I love learning about different thought systems, pulling out nuggets of wisdom, and absorbing them into my own personal belief system. I love long rambling conversations about everything and nothing. My love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I love to cuddle, snuggle, and spoon - be close together. I am gentle, caring, and nurturing. I am supportive, empathetic, and a great listener. I connect with people on a deep and emotional level. I am very introspective. I love breaking things down and really understanding them.

Big Handsome Man. Beard. Glasses. Huge Disney fan! I am a homebody. I enjoy spending time with friends. I travel when possible. I have a darker sense of humor (think - Cards Against Humanity). I love nerding out about BDSM, philosophy, and video games. I have a deep love of music. I love how my feelings will magically line up with the songs I am listening to. I love quoting song lyrics and singing songs mid conversation. I love playing JRPGs - currently working my way through Yo-kai Watch 3. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). My favorite tv show is The Wire. My favorite movies are Avatar and Singin' in the Rain. I love falling into any storytelling experience. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I love mythology, magic, and stand up comedy. I love being surprised by punchlines and the way they use words to entertain. Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. I enjoy watching the Marvel movies. I occasionally host board game nights with my friends. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. Some of my kinks - oral, deepthroat, degradation, dd/lg, freeuse, cnc (music factory!), dark ageplay, domestic service, outfit control, orgasm control, sensory deprivation, threesomes, worshipping, objectification, collaring, and ageplay. And the rest (Here on Gilligan's Island!). We can discover and enjoy emotional and sexual highs together. Send me a PM - Make me laugh! Good Luck everyone! Thank you for reading.

It really hurts and the feeling consumes you and focuses your mind. You suddenly feel helpless and weak but glowing inside. Radiating with desire. I see both the fear and trust as your moistening eyes look at me. I hear a begging whimper. Your lip quivers. A teardrop pools at the edge of your eyelid. The next blow is harder, swifter. In exactly the same spot. You reflexively beg for mercyreally beg this time. Your breath deepens, more desperate. Your hips writhe and buck after you feel my bare palm strike your ass. I turn your head and force you to look at the marks on your body. Red and purple welts. The spots grow, become splotchy, uneven, with a dark red center that rises from your skin. I love those marks. They are my gifts for you and now you will wear them. You will bear them. You feel me throughout the day, the dull aches and the searing sting. You smile and wince and glow. You feel them every time you sit down or move a certain way. You feel them and you are reminded that your body is my playground and I make the rules. Finally, you gasp and moan and your pelvis squirms when I tell you to feel pleasure. My touch is different now. My fingers glide across your beckoning wetness and I whisper, ""You are such a good girl. Such a pretty, obedient girl. I am so happy you are mine. You are all I ever wanted."" I kiss the tear away from your warm cheek as my finger pushes you open. I love the taste of your tears. I love how you feel deep inside. I want you to be my online submissive. l want to take you to that emotional edge and linger there with you, holding you precariously over the abyss of fear and pain and buried memories but keeping you safe. I want to feel the surge of power in my body that I will get from holding your vulnerability in my hands and deciding what to do with it. I will use the power to penetrate you forcefully and fill you: your mind, your body, your emotions, your spirit. Then I will break them all and make whats left of you mine. Write me now."
390,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,46(M4F) - I found the perfect sub! She's just waiting to reply! ;),1,bk9uvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/bk9uvy/46m4f_i_found_the_perfect_sub_shes_just_waiting/,2019-05-04 01:37:45,"Hello there. I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games until all hours. (Way too much WoW lately) - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. - Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. - Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. - Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting. - Obedience and compliance, as well as meticulous control and attention is what gets me going. - *Extras:* Slut shaming, behavior modification focused degradation/humiliation, body marking, ownership enforcement, etc. **In my perfect world, my submissive partner would be:** - Based here in the US, preferably in the east coast for timezone purposes. - Between 25-50 years old. - Available *sometime* within my available weekday hours (7a-7p EST) - Highly attentive and communicative. - Looking to live our long distance/separate lives together as much as we possibly can. Not confining ourselves to specific areas of sharing our lives together but opening up every facet of our lives to one another over time and trust. - Excited by the idea of mutual obsession, infatuation, and utter devotion. - Experienced OR actively learning and reading to gain more experience. - A strong speaker with high expectations for command of the English language . - Witty, dry sarcasm, dark humor are all a plus (please don't drown me in your lol's. I'll admit I am a sucker for a good placed GIF though). - Emotionally available. - Married or unmarried, tethered or untethered is irrelevant. Must be transparent with me and my expectation is some degree of monogamy even if you are in a LTR or married at some point. I'm not looking to be #3 in your rotation. To clarify further, in a long term concept with someone who is also married/in a LTR, I'm not looking for either of us to be in a relationship (physical or emotional) with anyone outside of each other and our respective partners. **Communication:** - Hangouts (text, voice/video calls), telegram, emails, kik (as a last resort unfortunately), snail mail (PO box -- I'm not that insane), or in person. I've posted here before and met some amazing people, but ultimately long term wise, it hasn't lasted to what I've wanted. If you aren't interested in having deep conversations or in writing detailing responses, please don't bother to reach out to me. Include a name or alias that isn't your screen name, A/S/L, communication preferences, and precisely what in this post moved you to reach out. Thank you."

You can tell my posting history that I'm a catastrophe but at least, I don't care enough to use a throwaway. Now onto things I really want people to understand. I really love cute pet boys and I want to pet all cute boys. I can spend hours doing just that. My role for GFD directly stems from a hidden maternal instinct (hidden because I hate children). That being said, really can't get behind MDLB - being called mummy sort of makes me feel real freaking gross. I don't have a low libido but I really want to work into having a romantic vanilla relationship first before a BDSM one. It's hard to pinpoint what I get out of this - I think it appeals to me because I love the vulnerability and the aesthetic of it. I want a cute little cat at my feet and I want to feed him, wash him, stroke him. My mantra would be affection before infliction. I am very much interested in the psychology of figuring out how to put someone in their subspace and make them enthralled by me. But I am very eager in consent and control of myself to not take advantage. I will always do what's best for you. As a submissive, I am shy about it. I think because it's a vulnerable part of myself I don't really like talking about it a bunch. I am not a slave, to be quite honest. You can probably ask questions on that. I would like to say I'm a light masochist and I have a particular interest to CNC. I am heavily interested in bondage, crossdressing, pet play, orgasm control, handholding, playing with your hair and kissing you everywhere. Give me a shout."
392,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"21 [F4M] Sweet, submissive, super kinky BDSM ageplayer looking for a special connection for a long-term role play!",5,bkldqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/bkldqo/21_f4m_sweet_submissive_super_kinky_bdsm/,2019-05-04 23:56:20,"Hi everyone!! My name is Emily, and I love to ageplay, among other things (: This post is a little bit unorthodox for this subreddit, but I haven't had luck on some of the more role play-centered subreddits, and considering that I want a real, close connection with my role play partner, and BDSM is very much part of my kink interests, that I would give things a shot here! First of all, what I'm looking for is a friend, but not just any ordinary friend! I'm looking for a friend that is also into BDSM, age playing, and other fun, kinky stuff. Someone that I can talk to about things outside of kink, but who understands my kinky, horny side and can engage with it plenty c; And, importantly, someone with whom I can realize my fantasy of a long-term role play scenario!! Also it's important to note that I am of course over 18 and I'm looking for someone 18 or older as well~ So the basic gist of the scenario is that I play a young girl (we can discuss ages) and you are an older (but still young, probably like 22-26ish) male in my life. I am shy and introverted, and so I don't have very many friends, which makes me fairly lonely and vulnerable. You notice this, and you feel bad for me and want to give me some of the love that I deserve. But more than that, you see my vulnerability as making me a perfect target for your manipulation! So you get on my good side, and slowly rope me in, manipulating me with love, affection, attention, etc., and I submit to you more and more, until eventually you are my owner&lt;3 Now let's go over some kinks!! I have a kinklist found [here (URL Just for the sake of clarity, I should add some notes. First of all, it's not listed under ""Fluids,"" but I am okay with vomit! Second, I put ""No"" under ""Interracial/Raceplay,"" and I want to clarify: I am 100% okay with interracial characters, but I am *not* okay with raceplay, because I'm not down with racism, and even though raceplay is ostensibly not racist, deep down it really is rooted in racist beliefs, and therefore I refuse to partake in it. Third, I put ""Like"" for both kinds of cocks, because I don't much care what the size is, as long as it's not absurdly big or small. Lastly, I hope that this demonstrates that I am *very* submissive, and I love getting super duper kinky &lt;3 Next, a little bit about me and who I'm looking for!! To start off, I have to get serious for a minute, because there are some ""requirements"" I have for any potential partners. This might sound weird to include in this post, but politically I consider myself a Marxist-Leninist. I mention this simply to explain that I hold very far-left beliefs, politically, economically, and - to get to the relevance to this post - socially. This means that I am against sexism of any and all kinds, against homophobia, transphobia, racism, all that sort of stuff. This is a big deal to me, and most of the time I post for role-play partners I am swarmed with messages from guys that don't respect women at all, or otherwise have some disgusting views that voluntarily revealed to me shockingly early, and I'm trying to get away from that. If you don't share my respect for women and my disdain for bigotry of all kinds, then please do not message me. Second, I am looking for someone who is a competent writer! I like descriptive writing, consistent tense and perspective (we can discuss what tense and perspective we want to use together, but once we decide, I want to stick to it), and overall quality writing. I'm not looking for Pulitzer-winning writing or anything, and I certainly can't offer that, but as long as you have a good grasp of the English language and decent writing and storytelling techniques, I think we can have lots of fun together (: Well, *jeez*! This ended up being sooo much longer than I meant o.o So I'll just cut this off for now!! I hope to hear from you soon&lt;3"
393,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,31 [M4F] Real Pain. Real Humiliation. Real Degradation. Is anyone out there that truly has a sadistic mind?,3,blh5wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/blh5wc/31_m4f_real_pain_real_humiliation_real/,2019-05-07 06:23:37,"Like the title says, its been a while since Ive met a real sadistic mind like myself. Meeting online is often finicky, and I get that. More often than not these things lead to nowhere. Whether that be because of either party. It happens. However it would be nice to meet someone that craves real domination. That needs a sick, sick, primal mind to control them, hurt them, break them and then bring them back to life. This isnt for the weak hearted. Also, this isnt just about sex. Sex is nice. Sex is great. However its the mental aspect that drives me. Its knowing I own your body as well as your mind. The vulnerability of allowing yourself to be completely taken. The trust that comes with that is maybe the most satisfying feeling. Unfortunately as this lifestyle has become more popular, there have been many misleading posts and meetings. People think they know what they want, they often dont. Theres nothing wrong with exploring and learning what it is you like. I encourage you to be as open as possible. Try everything. I will say though if you fit into that category of not knowing, this post is not for you. Although it goes both ways. Faux Doms think being dominant is just being a dick, or a narcissist. It aint that, kid. Theres compassion that has to be shown along with the dominance. Especially with the things that will be done to you. If that isnt understood through communication, it can become very one sided and selfish. Now Im ranting. If youve made it this far I applaud you! All in all, Im just looking for a woman that understands what I mean. Maybe youve had the same issues on the opposite end and its become just as frustrating for you too. Youve been meeting people that dont quite get it, that dont quite know what it means to be as dominant as youve been searching for. If thats the case feel free to PM me. At the very least, we can discuss what the hell has been going on. Looking forward to hearing from you."

I really am searching for love in the wrong places but I am after for something exclusive and tangible. Online relationships bore me and I'd love to have some relatively close to me which adds pressure of not finding really anyone. My main dynamic is pet play and I am very much into GFD as much as I am into being a sub - I'm a switch and it'd be really great that you were too! My role for GFD directly stems from a hidden maternal instinct (hidden because I hate children). That being said, really can't get behind MDLB - although this is a nave and ironic statement, it just seems way too immoral for me. I really want to fall in love with someone before pursuing a BDSM relationship. Sexually compatiable is a biggie but without love, what's the point? Being a domme appeals to me because I love the vulnerability of it and being a submissive appeals to me because I hold no responsibility. I am very much interested in the psychology of figuring out how to put someone in their subspace and make them enthralled by me. As a submissive, I am shy about it. I think because it's a vulnerable part of myself I don't really like talking about it a bunch. I hate having to write out kinks because as much as I expect the wrong sort of attention from sort of post, it bores me half to death to be treated as a fetish.

395,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,27M4F - I've been dreaming about you for years. I'm seeking a girl with a true servants heart. I want to create a 24/7 dynamic based on an intimate relationship of service and devotion. I want to own the person my life has been leading up to. (online at first),1,bmc8fl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/bmc8fl/27m4f_ive_been_dreaming_about_you_for_years_im/,2019-05-09 09:05:23,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short.

397,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] To share your weakness is to make yourself vulnerable. To make yourself vulnerable is to show your strength.,6,azlhzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/azlhzm/30_m4f_to_share_your_weakness_is_to_make_yourself/,2019-03-11 09:40:38,"I admit, I think about that quote far too often. Nonetheless, vulnerability is at the center of what this dynamic should be. One cannot submit without first being vulnerable. To share your weaknesses, to share your dreams, goals, insecurities, fears, darkest thoughts with a partner, and know that he will be there no matter, not judging for anything that you have shared. Vulnerability is not easy. Nothing worth doing is easy. But it's crucial as a stepping stone to submission. The second half of the quote is just as important as the first half. When you show vulnerability, is not a weakness. You show strengths by being vulnerable, by submitting. I don't want a doormat, but I want someone who submits with her head held high. Submission is a gift that you do not give to just anyone. You have a hard time finding a Dom worth respecting, I suspect. Most Doms don't get the subtleties of control and dominance. They focus too much on dominating your mind and do not focus enough on your mind and emotions. I am a 30 year old man, living in the DC area, where I work in a government position (don't worry, not a Trump fan). I have been involved with D/s for near a decade now, with several long term relationships on and offline, with a wide variety of dynamics, from strict TPE to more paternal DD/lg, and everything in-between. I have an active social life, mostly spent with a great smaller group of friends. The rest of my free time is spent in nature or in front of a computer. I love to swim, love to hike and enjoy video games. I would love to find someone who shares more than just her kinky with me, who has similar interests and hobbies. Speaking of interests, I am interested in many topics, movies, books, TV, politics, psychology, philosophy and more. When it comes to D/s relationships, I am strict, firm, creative and open-minded. No kink you have will shock me and I will be eager to make your fantasies become a reality. I focus a lot on dominance outside the bedroom, enjoying control in every aspect of life, beyond just sexually. Personality-wise, I am organized, driven, focused and calm. I plan things to the smallest detail and you will often find me making lists to improve my efficiency. I have found that this side of me works especially well in D/s relationships as well, where I can help improve your life and productivity, motivating you to be better than you have been on your own. I am looking for someone to spend my day with, to talk to and get to know, to explore our minds together. Someone with a personality, who is able to hold a conversation, knows how to ask the right kinds of questions and who feels like something is missing in their lives. Maybe it is a sense of direction or maybe it is missing someone to whisper filthy things in your ear. I am open to both long distance and local. I enjoy taking my time and getting to know someone well. Will you allow yourself to be vulnerable? I am waiting."
398,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,26M4F - Seeking a girl with a true servants heart. I want to create a 24/7 dynamic based on an intimate relationship of service and devotion (online at first),2,azy18l,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/azy18l/26m4f_seeking_a_girl_with_a_true_servants_heart_i/,2019-03-12 07:04:59,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon."

You will never *get* me. That said, as Reddit goes, almost all my favorite Reddit friends have come from this sub, so good on y'all, even the shitheel little neckbeards who seem to be waiting on their perch to downvote any post I throw out here. Heads up, fellas. Domming is like all great arts. You either have it or you don't and all the downvotes in the world won't hide the fact that most ""Doms"" are abusive sociopaths who prey on vulnerability and crave power for power's sake without the last fuck to give about the mental, physical and spiritual health of their subs. Anyway, assuming all that helped cull the herd a bit, I'm looking for a new partner in crime. I do seem to have developed a sweet tooth for younger pets and while I cut my teeth Domming in a very formal, disciplinary way I seem to be settling into a comfortable fatherly/mentor role, so if you're just curious and want to whet your paws, come say hello. But, I can't overemphasize enough just how valuable experience can be in finding just the right fit. Looks matter. To you as well as me. We all like what we like, but I tend to actually have pretty broad tastes, so age, race, nationality and the like are all open. I'm happy to verify, as you should be. I prefer Kik or Skype, but if it's meant to be, I'm sure we can sort out the details. Kinks also matter. I have lots of them, few limits and generally filthy as fuck, so: no shit, no animals, no snuff. I was recently told I'm actually a soft top. I'm new to that term, but I try to be firm but fair and I take aftercare as a great privilege and an essential responsibility that goes along with having another human wilfully submit to you. But, aftercare should be the least of your concerns, because if I can't find my ideal mate, I'll make one of my own and if that means cobbling together a filthy, savage beast from all the bits and pieces out here, well, then, so be it. So, my ""type?"" Morbidly obese or skeletal remains don't do much for me, but beyond that I love phat, juicy curves *and* little pixie waifs that might well fit in the palm of my hand. I like to party. Burners are a plus. You can either handle your own shit or you can't. If you can't, please go be someone else's catastrophe. While I'm open to a wide range of physical characteristics and definitely love the female form in all it's many, splendid glories, the sexiest part of you to me is the couple pounds of cholesterol between your ears, and though you're a sub I'm looking for an intellectual equal. Anti-vaxers, flat-earthers, and general junk science bullshit adherents as well as anyone dumb and/or masochistic enough to vote for that piece of shit can all fuck right off. If, however, youd like to serve you Master as he attempts to salvage what's left of the Age of Reason and Western Civilization, all while watching, being watched, lots of denial/edging, dirty talk, phone play, big, sticky messes and other related shenanigans - by all means come say hello. Online for now, but, again, if it's meant to be we will sort out the details. Cheers, James 5'11, 190, short brown hair, blue eyes, trimmed beard, two tattoos, broad hairy chest, dad bod and a fat cock. "
400,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,46(M4F) - I found the perfect sub! She's just waiting to reply! ;),0,b07fkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/b07fkw/46m4f_i_found_the_perfect_sub_shes_just_waiting/,2019-03-12 23:52:54,"Hello there. I've posted this on an old account previously, so if you've seen this before that's why. I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games until all hours. (Way too much WoW lately) - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. - Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. - Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. - Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting. - Obedience and compliance, as well as meticulous control and attention is what gets me going. - *Extras:* Slut shaming, behavior modification focused degradation/humiliation, body marking, ownership enforcement, etc. **In my perfect world, my submissive partner would be:** - Based here in the US, preferably in the east coast for timezone purposes. - Between 25-50 years old. - Available *sometime* within my available weekday hours (7a-7p EST) - Highly attentive and communicative. - Looking to live our long distance/separate lives together as much as we possibly can. Not confining ourselves to specific areas of sharing our lives together but opening up every facet of our lives to one another over time and trust. - Excited by the idea of mutual obsession, infatuation, and utter devotion. - Experienced OR actively learning and reading to gain more experience. - A strong speaker with high expectations for command of the English language . - Witty, dry sarcasm, dark humor are all a plus (please don't drown me in your lol's. I'll admit I am a sucker for a good placed GIF though). - Emotionally available. - Married or unmarried, tethered or untethered is irrelevant. Must be transparent with me and my expectation is some degree of monogamy even if you are in a LTR or married at some point. I'm not looking to be #3 in your rotation. To clarify further, in a long term concept with someone who is also married/in a LTR, I'm not looking for either of us to be in a relationship (physical or emotional) with anyone outside of each other and our respective partners. **Communication:** - Hangouts (text, voice/video calls), telegram, emails, kik (as a last resort unfortunately), snail mail (PO box -- I'm not that insane), or in person. I've posted here before and met some amazing people, but ultimately long term wise, it hasn't lasted to what I've wanted. If you aren't interested in having deep conversations or in writing detailing responses, please don't bother to reach out to me. Include a name or alias that isn't your screen name, A/S/L, communication preferences, and precisely what in this post moved you to reach out. Thank you. "

Im 24, male, white, 59, normal/average weight, feminist, and on a winding upward career path in environmental tech. I lean to the homebody side of the social spectrum and have lots of varied hobbies (video games, reading about history, hiking/kayaking/adventuring, sports, foodie activities, podcasts, digital art etc). Im always trying to learn something new! &amp;#x200B; Ive tried to live my life so far open minded, focusing on personal happiness and self-improvement. Ive learned from my past partners and dynamics that I really need to get to know my partners to establish mutual trust before having any sort of kink-based dynamic. Im not one to send one-word texts, dick pics or passive-aggressive responses. I *am* one to need to restrain myself from sending a thousand personal questions to satiate my appetite to learn about you and how to make you laugh. &amp;#x200B; Open communication is absolutely critical for my relationships- this means talking about desires, limits, interests, relationship boundaries, etc. Similarly, consent and respect are concepts I take very seriously in all facets of my life. From my experience this communication is particularly necessary to make relationships like this work, even if it means taking more time and moving slowly. &amp;#x200B; I have experience with many different kinks and types of play, and love them all in their own ways. I love actively learning more about BDSM and sexuality, as well as talking about it. As previously mentioned, I am a nurturing, guiding Dom, but I have a sweet sadistic side involving liking to overwhelm and overstimulate my sub with intense sensation. I really like rules and training, such as positions, responses, etc. I prefer to reward and praise than punish, and similarly love to give and deny pleasure over using pain. However, there are definitely times and places for pain and punishment, and I don't shy away from them. I crave getting into a partners mind completely, learning every nook and cranny of their sexuality to use against them in the best way possible. I find it much more empowering to make someone want to submit to me, and prove it, than to take power from them. Orgasm control, sensation play, relentless teasing, dirty talk and humiliation are my top kinks, but Im very open minded and love helping partners explore their interests. I can give more details about my kinks, limits etc if we talk more. &amp;#x200B; Im primarily looking for online female partners for now with the potential to eventually meet in person-- while Im in the US Northeast, Im not exactly sure where I will be within the next year or two. Im not tied down to any particular location yet, so hit me up, I might be coming to a town near you! Im also interested in talking with couples who are switchy, looking to share dominance or explore subbing for me together. I am open to either polyamory or monogamy, and will fully respect the boundaries of any kind of relationship I am in. &amp;#x200B; If this sounds like anything youre interested in, hit me up! If not and you read this far anyway, I wish you the best on your kinky journey and hope you find what youre looking for. :) &amp;#x200B; (A sampling of conversation topics that would get me talking for ages: What would your dream life look like? What do you fear? Do you like thunderstorms? What 3 things do you care about most? What food could you absolutely not give up? Justin, Travis or Griffin? What is your Myers Briggs personality type? Hot take: Are Myers Briggs personality types bullshit? Weirdest music you listen to? Do you like documentaries about cults and little lost corners of history? Know a DM I can play with and learn from? Did I mean that in a BDSM or DnD context? Want to start a back porch garden?)"

The next is harder, swifter. In exactly the same spot, You reflexively beg for mercyreally beg this time. Your breath deepens, more desperate. Your hips writhe and buck after you feel my bare palm strike your ass. I turn your head and force you to look at the marks on your body. You see the red and purple. The spots grow, become splotchy, uneven, with a dark red center that seems to pulse. They are my marks and now you will wear them. You will bear them. You will feel them throughout the day, the dull aches and the searing sting. You will smile and wince and glow. You will feel them whenever you want to be reminded that you are mine.

I want you to love my little space and crave for me to be in it more. I don't think I should be calling you Daddy after a week of talking and you shouldn't expect me to. ""Daddy"" means so much and I only want to bestow that on someone who deserves it and wants to be that for me. What you can expect from me: Loyalty, honesty, vulnerability, cuteness, brattiness. This is serious for me and I will pretty much do what it takes to find my Daddy and keep him in my life. I am black with big brown eyes and black hair past my shoulders; I'm 5'4. I'm looking for long-term so if you want FwB or just someone to call you Daddy in bed, it's not me. Also please be older than me (Doesn't matter how much older) and in the United States. There is sooooo much more I could say (and I feel like I've said so much already), but I suppose I should keep the rest for PMs. So please, message me and let's see if perhaps you're my Daddy and I'm your little girl."
404,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] Chicago - Looking for an Aggressive-Submissive Play Partner to Build Kink Relationship With,0,b2j7ah,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/b2j7ah/30_m4f_chicago_looking_for_an/,2019-03-19 01:13:09,"Hi. My name is John, and I'm looking for a kinky play partner in Chicago to further explore our kinks and selfs, share great conversation, and have amazing sex. **I'll start with a bit of information about me...** I'm 30, live in River North, and I freelance a couple different roles. I've been seriously kinky- as in making my kink exploration a priority, trying things, and even partaking in the Chicago community- for about 5 years now. On top of kink, my passions include cooking, spiritual study, design, video games, music &amp; movies, travel, architecture, to name a few. Kink wise, I've evolved and shifted here and there to where I currently stand. I am definitely *Dominant,* and enjoy being in control; I've discovered I'm not a very jealous person, and a true hedonist, this has played into some of my kinks shaping, and my desire to explore them. **My biggest kinks**, or biggest kink- as you'll see from my history, is extreme dirty talk. I love communication in and out of the bedroom; I think it's incredibly important to maintain any kind of relationship, but especially one where we're playing with kinks, fantasies, and each other. I also love anal, cum play, fashion play, free use, pet play, role play, toy use, edging, orgasm control, rough oral, public, exhibitionism, voyuerism, being rough, cock worship, sleep play, attention play, certain forms of age play. I've discovered that I prefer aggressive, confident, service-oriented submissives. A sub who needs dominance constantly asserted I find... well, boring (nothing against people who enjoy it, of course). I long for someone who wants to be the biggest slut in the room, someone who imagines all the ways they can fuck, just as I do. Someone who loves pleasing and giving, but also enjoys receiving and being pampered. I'm looking for the kind of girl who reads- or even better- posts on r/stupidslutsclub. There have been a lot of relationships I've had with mismatched sexuality, still plenty of kinky relationships where the sub thought that being a sub meant just laying there. If you're new, make no mistake, there's work to be done on both sides. Communication, vulnerability, trust are required to go where I want go and do what I want to do. **Kinks I'm not into** include scat, blood, vomit, knifes, needles, extreme violence, resistance... **What I'm trying to create relationship wise** is something intimate and vulnerable where we can share, fuck, and grow. I'm looking for a fellow sex scientist, someone submissive in the bedroom, not outside it. Together, I want to create a relationship to explore our kinks and fantasies, and try things that maybe we didn't even think we'd like. I'm open to it being casual, or developing into something serious, monogamous or open (I love the idea of cuckqueaning, and of hot-wifing/hot-husbanding). So long as there's trust, unconditional communication, and us respecting or own and each others boundaries I don't think anything bad can happen that can't be dealt with. **As for you**, I need you to be intelligent, driven, strong, capable, and a total, stupid fucking slut. Someone who is brave enough to communicate unconditionally, and is seeking to build something just like me. (Someone who laughs at this comic](URL or at least gets it. Physically speaking, I'm 5'10'', 175, white, handsome face, great cock. I'm looking for someone slender as I love being able to pick up and toss around my sub, height doesn't matter to me. Thank you for reading, and I look forward to hearing from you."
405,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,M4F26M4F - I'm looking to give all of myself to a girl with a true servants heart. I want to create a 24/7 dynamic based on an intimate relationship of service and devotion (online at first),1,b2pjr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/b2pjr5/m4f26m4f_im_looking_to_give_all_of_myself_to_a/,2019-03-19 10:10:35,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon."

It really hurts and it consumes you. You suddenly feel helpless and weak. But glowing. I see both the fear and trust as your moistening eyes look at me. I hear a begging whimper. The next is harder, swifter. In exactly the same spot, You reflexively beg for mercyreally beg this time. Your breath deepens, more desperate. Your hips writhe and buck after you feel my bare palm strike your ass. I turn your head and force you to look at the marks on your body. You see the red and purple. The spots grow, become splotchy, uneven, with a dark red center that seems to pulse. They are my marks and now you will wear them. You will bear them. You will feel them throughout the day, the dull aches and the searing sting. You will smile and wince and glow. You will feel them whenever you want to be reminded that you are mine. You will feel them every time you sit down or move a certain way. Finally, you gasp and moan and your pelvis squirms when I tell you to feel pleasure. My touch is different now. My fingers glide across your beckoning wetness and I whisper, ""You are such a good girl. Such a pretty, obedient girl. I am so happy you are mine. You are all I ever wanted."" I kiss the tear away from your warm cheek as my finger pushes you open. I love the taste of your tears. I want you to be my online submissive. If you have read this far, you understand the potential for an online Dom to exert such powerful control over your body. l want to take you to that emotional edge and linger there with you, holding you and feeling you quiver. I want to feel the surge of power in my body that I get from your vulnerability and loss of control. I want to penetrate you forcefully and fill you: your mind, your body, your emotions, your spirit.

409,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,26M4F - Seeking a girl with a true servants heart. I want to create a 24/7 dynamic based on an intimate relationship of service and devotion (online at first),0,b68w6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/b68w6w/26m4f_seeking_a_girl_with_a_true_servants_heart_i/,2019-03-28 06:56:09,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon."
410,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] To share your weakness is to make yourself vulnerable. To make yourself vulnerable is to show your strength.,0,b6p7a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/b6p7a2/30_m4f_to_share_your_weakness_is_to_make_yourself/,2019-03-29 09:19:25,"I admit, I think about that quote far too often. Nonetheless, vulnerability is at the center of what this dynamic should be. One cannot submit without first being vulnerable. To share your weaknesses, to share your dreams, goals, insecurities, fears, darkest thoughts with a partner, and know that he will be there no matter, not judging for anything that you have shared. Vulnerability is not easy. Nothing worth doing is easy. But it's crucial as a stepping stone to submission. The second half of the quote is just as important as the first half. When you show vulnerability, is not a weakness. You show strengths by being vulnerable, by submitting. I don't want a doormat, but I want someone who submits with her head held high. Submission is a gift that you do not give to just anyone. You have a hard time finding a Dom worth respecting, I suspect. Most Doms don't get the subtleties of control and dominance. They focus too much on dominating your mind and do not focus enough on your mind and emotions. I am a 30 year old man, living in the DC area, where I work in a government position (don't worry, not a Trump fan). I have been involved with D/s for near a decade now, with several long term relationships on and offline, with a wide variety of dynamics, from strict TPE to more paternal DD/lg, and everything in-between. I have an active social life, mostly spent with a great smaller group of friends. The rest of my free time is spent in nature or in front of a computer. I love to swim, love to hike and enjoy video games. I would love to find someone who shares more than just her kinky with me, who has similar interests and hobbies. Speaking of interests, I am interested in many topics, movies, books, TV, politics, psychology, philosophy and more. When it comes to D/s relationships, I am strict, firm, creative and open-minded. No kink you have will shock me and I will be eager to make your fantasies become a reality. I focus a lot on dominance outside the bedroom, enjoying control in every aspect of life, beyond just sexually. Personality-wise, I am organized, driven, focused and calm. I plan things to the smallest detail and you will often find me making lists to improve my efficiency. I have found that this side of me works especially well in D/s relationships as well, where I can help improve your life and productivity, motivating you to be better than you have been on your own. I am looking for someone to spend my day with, to talk to and get to know, to explore our minds together. Someone with a personality, who is able to hold a conversation, knows how to ask the right kinds of questions and who feels like something is missing in their lives. Maybe it is a sense of direction or maybe it is missing someone to whisper filthy things in your ear. I am open to both long distance and local. I enjoy taking my time and getting to know someone well. Will you allow yourself to be vulnerable? I am waiting."

My name is John. I'm looking for a kinky play partner in Chicago to further explore our kinks and selves, share great conversation, and have amazing sex. **I'm 30, live in River North, and am originally from Chicago.** I've been seriously kinky- as in making kink exploration a priority, trying things, and even partaking in the Chicago community- for about 5 years now. On top of kink my passions include cooking, spiritual study, design, video games, music &amp; movies, travel, architecture, to name a few. Kink wise, I've evolved and shifted here and there to where I currently stand. I am definitely *Dominant,* and enjoy being in control; I've discovered I'm not a very jealous person, and a true hedonist, this has played into some of my kinks shaping, and my desire to explore them. **My biggest kinks**, or biggest kink- as you'll see from my history, is extreme dirty talk. I love communication in and out of the bedroom; I think it's incredibly important to maintain any kind of relationship, but especially one where we're playing with kinks, fantasies, and each other. I also love anal, cum play, fashion play, free use, pet play, role play, toy use, edging, orgasm control, rough oral, public, exhibitionism, voyuerism, being rough, cock worship, sleep play, group, attention play, certain forms of age play. I've realized that I prefer aggressive, confident, service-oriented submissives. A sub who needs dominance constantly asserted I find... well, boring (nothing against people who enjoy it, of course). I long for someone who wants to be the biggest slut in the room, someone who imagines all the ways they can fuck, just as I do. Someone who loves pleasing and giving, but also enjoys receiving and being pampered. I'm looking for the kind of girl who reads- or even better- posts on r/stupidslutsclub. There have been a lot of relationships I've had with mismatched sexuality, still plenty of kinky relationships where the sub thought that being a sub meant just laying there. If you're new, make no mistake, there's work to be done on both sides. Communication, vulnerability, trust are required to go where I want go and do what I want to do. **Kinks I'm not into** include scat, blood, vomit, knifes, needles, extreme violence, resistance... **What I'm trying to create relationship wise** is something intimate and vulnerable where we can share, fuck, and grow. I'm looking for a fellow sex scientist, someone submissive in the bedroom, not outside it. Together, I want to create a relationship to explore our kinks and fantasies, and try things that maybe we didn't even think we'd like. I'm open to it being casual, or developing into something serious, monogamous or open (I love the idea of cuckqueaning, and of hot-wifing/hot-husbanding). So long as there's trust, unconditional communication, and us respecting or own and each others boundaries I don't think anything bad can happen that can't be dealt with. **As for you**, I need you to be intelligent, driven, strong, capable, and a total, stupid fucking slut. Someone who is brave enough to communicate unconditionally, and is seeking to build something just like me. [Someone who laughs at this comic](URL or at least gets it.

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with?

And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

Fear. Obedience. Love, that you might know my Will, and that I might discern your Nature; Love which shall bind us together and illuminate us from within. Love which cracks open our chests in the still moments of the evening to bare the beating hearts inside, that we both might see the stories and truths and scars of one another. Love which demands nakedness and vulnerability; love which is defenseless, which abolishes masks, and commits to the glory of two souls blazing brilliantly in each others full and unobstructed light. Fear, that my Will may be stricken into you; not fear of pain or bondage, which you gladly receive, but the fear and awe of Deity, of someone who grasps onto your very soul. You shall know my cruelty as an ecstatic glory, and with merciful wounds from an eager flail you shall be mended. The flagellation of your skin and the imprisonment of your body shall compose my worshipful torture-arts, by which we shall sanctify your orgasms as blessed rituals of dark fervor which marry the numinous and the carnal. Obedience, that you might become my Will, and that I might perfect your Nature. With the grace of your submission shall I be humbled and sanctified; with the guidance of my command shall you be sharpened and glorified. In this alchemy of souls, we shall come together as opposites to find our unity and be made whole through a covenant of trust. Of my worth I shall make for you a collar, and if you find it beautiful, your esteem shall fashion a lock. In this way, we shall evolve and grow, and set ourselves upon the divine tasks of a life of glory. For this, these things I demand, and these things you shall give: Love. Fear. Obedience. Also, I get to touch your butt. Thats part of the deal too. &amp;#x200B; My name is Khan, though some call me Rosko, and still others call me by my birth name. Im here to find a bubbly little darkling to take into my care, so that I can love and abuse her in all the right ways. I live vaguely north of the Seattle area, and am a relatively recent transplant from all the way out in Kentucky. I moved for a whole host of reasons - work, education, lifestyle, etc - and its kind of a crazy story. But, after a while out of the Lifestyle due to extenuating circumstances, and now that Ive got myself properly settled here in WA, Im ready to find someone to share my life with. Life thus far has taught me that vanilla relationships just dont cut it for me. Theres just something missing, you know? I need that intimacy, that trust, that primal aspect which comes with a genuine D/s relationship. And so here I am, searching for a submissive to care for. &amp;#x200B; So, who am I, really? [This is me](URL Hello! Its always so difficult to pick and choose labels, so that you can package yourself up for the internet, isnt it? I never quite know where to begin, and where to end. I am a great many things, including but not limited to (and in no particular order): a nerd (games, anime, all sorts of stuff), a foodie/cook, a socialist/progressive, a stoner (who does not condone BDSM play while intoxicated), an occultist, and kinda-sorta-maybe a writer/aspiring philosopher. Eclectic would be a good word, I suppose. Im kind of an open book, but the bulk of my pages tend to deal with very obscure topics. I dont fit very well into a nutshell - theres a lot of labels that fit me, but none that really define me. Physically, I dont really know how to describe myself. Historically, Ive always been heavier, but thanks to recent diet and lifestyle changes, Ive lost a ton of weight. Once upon a time, I was fat, but now Im not fat, but Im not really skinny either. So, I dunno, I guess hefty, but not chunky would be a good descriptor? I dont really weigh myself that often, because it messes with my headspace for the diet. But, I am comfortably below 200 lbs as of the last few check-ins, and Im 5 10 tall, if that gives you a better idea. My weight is still falling, albeit more slowly than when I started the diet, though I kind of like where Im at now. Deep blue-grey eyes, long flowing hair, thick luxurious beard - I mean, whats not to love? My hobbies tend towards the creative and the nerdy. I write when I can, and I cook nearly every day in some form or another. I like to write about religion and philosophy, and I like to cook (and eat) absurdly good tasty food of any and every genre. I try to keep myself active when I can, but Im also down to just get stoned and play some games or binge a series on netflix from time to time too. I love anime, and my tastes are kind of all over the map. I also love games and my tastes are fairly specific - I really love city-building games and RPGs. I also play Overwatch semi-regularly (though Im not very good lol).Music-wise, Im a little bit everywhere - metal, techno, folk music - but nowadays Im mostly listening to death metal. Im also really down for whatever - what kinds of trouble can we get ourselves into? Concerts, hiking, camping, BDSM events, festivals, anything and everything. I want us to go on adventures together! Lets go get lost in Seattle and find somewhere weve never been. Lets go explore nature together on the peninsula. Wanna go to a renn faire? Cause that sounds awesome. Lets go find and create all those precious experiences that enrich our lives, together. Its so weird describing your own personality traits, but Ill start off by saying that Im (hopefully) not nearly as pretentious or dramatic as my opening paragraph implies, I just have a bit of a taste for the theatrical. Im a pretty laid back person, generally speaking. (though, obviously, youll be seeing a stricter side of me...) A little bit of relaxed stoicism with a hefty dollop of passion on various topics might be a good descriptor? I genuinely enjoy conversing about touchy or controversial topics like politics and religion, even with people I dont necessarily agree with. I find peoples beliefs to be fascinating. I hate interpersonal drama deeply. Im a little reserved when you first meet me, but after a while I open up to reveal a dry witty interior with streaks of creamy goofball humor to freshen the palette. My love language is touch - If were in the same room, Ill generally want physical contact. Im an absolute oxytocin junkie, and its been a while since I had a good fix. That aside, I wouldnt call myself particularly clingy, except perhaps in large complex social situations, for which I really need an anchor person. I dont like parties, and am much more in favor of smaller more intimate get-togethers. If you put me on the traditional DnD moral plane, I would be somewhere off to the top right of chaotic good, and to the bottom left of lawful evil, that weird point where they loop back around and meet each other at their extremes. Im very adamant on staring objective reality directly in the face, but Im also keenly aware of the universal need to disregard that reality in favor of more personal ways of thinking. I see no inherent conflict between spirituality and materiality. The world is a scary, complex place, and none of us are nearly as smart or impartial as we think we are. But, I think that world is still worth exploring, and I think its still worth it to be passionate about things you believe in. But, it can be lonely out there. Why dont we explore it together? &amp;#x200B; Who are you, ideally? Female, mid-twenties, petite, intelligent, weird. I like witchy gothy nerdy types of girls. Im a darkly natured sort of person, but I tend to maintain a fairly positive outlook, so Id like to share my life with someone who is likewise dark, but still bubbly and cheerful. I want someone with whom I can laugh - mirthfully at the good, and bitterly at the bad. Im looking for someone kid-less, as I currently have no plans for children. (Not opposed for the future, just not the currently foreseeable future) I will happily help you raise fur-babies though. (Im generally a cat person, but I still really like dogs too!) Ideally, I would like someone who doesnt smoke tobacco but does smoke weed. Im looking for someone who has enough life experience to understand how much life can really suck, but enough wisdom and passion to understand why we must nevertheless pursue life relentlessly. I want someone who can see past the material, while still remaining firmly rooted in it. I want someone who can appreciate the spiritual while not being consumed or addled by it. I need someone who can indulge equally in the thrill of adventure and the comforts of home and hearth. Im looking for someone to write a story with, maybe even the story of the rest of our lives. As for the physical - I like smaller/shorter women. I want to be able to properly manhandle you and move you around. When you get mouthy, Id love to be able to just pick you up and throw you over my shoulder. Wouldnt that be fun? Im newly 27, and so Im looking for someone in my same age category, maybe slightly younger than me. I also love longer hair - ponytails are natures perfect submissive-grip! Id like someone in the same general weight category as me - not too big but still a bit of squish. Bonus points if the squish is in the right places. Keywords include: petite, thicc, small, soft, and one of the best words in the english language, buxom. Double bonus points if you take bruises well. Which segues very nicely into...What sorts of recreational activities might we enjoy together? However many paragraphs in, finally getting to the meat and potatoes of it all - I am looking for a submissive with whom to have a balanced D/s relationship. Not really looking for a switch or anything primarily vanilla - I have zero interest in switching. What I **do** have an interest in, however, is making you suffer in all kinds of fun and imaginative ways (as well as all of the favorite traditional ways!). I am an unabashed sadist. My bread and butter, so to speak, is impact play. The exhilarating snap of leather on flesh, the sweet sting of impact, the rhythm, the power, the soft ripple of skin as your body tissues dissipate the energy, the bright red welt which raises up to declare my mark upon you, the soft gasp and moan as your whole being is washed in pain. All of it fills my with a deep and unending joy. I do most of my best work with a good old fashioned riding crop, but Ive used other implements as well. Im moderately experienced with a flogger, and Ive also used a carriage whip quite extensively. Im also quite fond of leather bondage. Nothing quite beats the classic leather collar and cuffs. They pair together with so many things! - spreader bars, leashes, all sorts of fun stuff - even rope! Ive relatively recently gained an appreciation/interest/ability with rope as well. Im still decidedly a novice with rigging, but Ive got the basics under my belt. (Rope classes are actually something Id ***really*** love for us to do together!) Now I just need someone to practice on... care to volunteer? Im also into, like, a lot of fetishes. I generally define my fetishes more by a list of highlights and a few notable no-gos, just to give an outline. In my view, sexuality is an exploration thing - Im always down to try new stuff, and theres few things I completely rule out. (Scat, vom, excessive blood, a few select roleplay ideas) Aside from whips and ropes, I also love to get into it with sensation play of all sorts - candle wax, wartenberg wheels, feathers and oils and whatnot. One of my more prominent fetishes is incest/DDlg roleplay. I also enjoy the occasional bit of consensual nonconsent. Roleplay in general is something I can get really into - lets get wild and just explore, see what crazy ideas we find hot. Also, its oddly vanilla all considered, but Ive always wanted to try food play. (Like, yeah, Ive had whipped cream sucked off my dick, and Ive done some truly evil things with a ginger root before, but Ive never really leaned into it, ya know?) Ive never really had much of a chance to explore it either, but Ive also got a little bit of exhibitionism in me. Additionally, I greatly enjoy group sex, and would like to explore that further as well, though Im a bit more experienced in that department. Which segues nicely into... This is the paragraph where I mention that I am polyamorous, and would very much like for you to be as well. Im not trying to start a harem or, like score a threesome bro, nice or whatever. (Though I wont lie to you and say that enjoyment of group sex isnt a factor, lol) The truth is, I find jealousy to be a tiresome and useless emotion. Polyamory is, in my view, simply more comfortable in that regard. Poly also takes more honesty and openness to work properly, which I dont see as a bad thing. Overall, I just feel polyamory as being a more healthy relationship style. When were out together in public, I want us to be able to check out cure girls asses together, or I want you to feel comfortable pointing out hot guys to me. That point, where were secure enough with our own sexualities and with our own relationships with each other that we can begin to share our sexuality with other people - that is what a healthy relationship feels like to me. For the first little while of our relationship, I would of course like it to be very much about us, though. I want us to have a firm foundation to stand on before including other people. The rest is all stuff best left for deeper conversations as we get to know each other and flesh out our relationship and our limits with one another. But suffice it to say, Im not a one penis policy bro, or whatever. I was actually part of a MFM V-triad/open-polycule for a few years. I just want us to be able to eventually expand our sexuality and intimacy beyond just us, and reap the emotional and relationship benefits that come with that ambition. As for the actual dynamic itself - I am looking primarily for a balanced D/s dynamic, one which roots us both in our roles, but still gives breathing room for us to communicate as equals about our relationship. Ive actually had a full 24/7 TPE relationship before, and it went remarkably well for as long as it did, given my inexperience at the time. Ive decided, though, that I do need a bit more balance. I want, generally speaking, for us to be able to inhabit our roles while around one another, and interact mainly within a D/s context. To me, that includes not just the obvious stuff such as the whippings and the rules and the bondage, but the more subtle and gentle sides of Dominance and submission as well. Balance, in my mind, means that we can inhabit our roles, but be willing to set them aside at times for the sake of communication, recuperation, and building a more solid foundation for our relationship. That being said, what would those roles actually look like? My goal in this relationship is simple: Whip you into a better person while simultaneously making myself known to you as a truly evil bastard. The priority of any Dom should, ofcourse, be the care of their submissive. Towards that end, I want to make your life better. I honestly cant really extrapolate on that too much, since at the moment of writing this I dont really know anything about you. But just know that I see my care as a Dom towards my submissive to be a sort of metaphysical duty. I kind of take a philosophical approach to it, which means its one of those talking til 2 am kinds of conversations. But, all that aside, I would *also* very much like to make your life a living hell for my own amusement. I enjoy psychological play, and love to put on a little bit of a show. The anticipation and fear that precedes the torture is almost as delicious as the torture itself. I dont often dole out proper punishments, except for proper violations of protocol - I dont really do funishments, as I find the idea of you suffering purely for my amusement and pleasure to be far more fun and satisfying than having to justify everything with a transgression. If you do something worthy of punishment, you will be punished with something you *dont* like. Im not really looking for a switch or uber-brat. A little brattiness here and there is all good, but at the end of the day you should want to be my good little girl more than you want to mouth off. I dont mind a little struggle, but I am still looking to be obeyed. That doesnt always mean letting me torture you or have my way with you, ofcourse. Sometimes it just means resting your head on my knee as you kneel in front of me. Sometimes its a simple yes Sir when I ask you for something while were out in public. Sometimes it means letting me care for you when youre sick. Sometimes its me making you scrub the kitchen because you mouthed off just a bit too much. And sometimes it's me treating you to a home cooked meal because I have a freshly cleaned kitchen. My point is, I want to be your Dominant, and I want you to be my submissive, in the intense moments *and* the gentle moments, because both are precious to me. I want someone to seek out adventures with, both in the world and in the bedroom. I want more than just a girlfriend, and I want more than just a slave - I want a submissive life-partner with whom I can have a balanced D/s relationship. I want a sub I can look up to and admire, even as she sits at my feet. I want to know and understand you as an equal so that I can be worthy and fit as a Dominant in moulding you as a submissive. I want a real, sincere relationship, on both D/s and vanilla levels. And I want that to translate into a thriving dynamic that fulfills both of us fully. I crave both the intense moments of pure sadism and depravity but also the softer, gentler moments of more mundane, domestic Dominance and submission. I want to guide you, order you, care for you. I want those quiet nights in just cooking and eating together, playing games together, talking about all of the weird and crazy things there are out there in the world, showing each other cool and freaky things on the internet. I want us to have crazy stories about all the places weve been to and the things weve done together. I want us to have incredibly graphic stories of debauchery and perversion that would make the vanilla folk uncomfortable and likely cause both of our families to disown us if they found out. I want us to have really mundane stories about that time we ran out of toilet paper, or milk, or something. (But lets not tell those stories cause I dont wanna be *that* couple) I want life, is what Im saying. And if youre reading this, and youve made it this far, and this all sounds up your alley, then I might just want that life to be with you. We live in a scary world, and its only getting crazier. But its worth it for us to go out there and explore it anyways, because the boredom and spiritual atrophy which comes from complacency and isolation are more lethal than anything the world has to offer. So, wont you come along with me on this crazy journey called life? Also, again, I get to touch your butt. Cant emphasize that enough. There will be butt-touching."

You suddenly feel helpless and exhilarated. You reflexively beg for mercyreally beg. But you need more. More intensity. More vulnerability. Harder and faster. You want to lose yourself. The fear in your eyes invites me inside. I explore your body with pain. Covering every inch of your skin with more pain, more hurt, more tears. I make you you look at the marks on your body. I hold your hand and gently glide your finger over the parts that hurt. And then I bring your finger to my lips and softly kiss it. You see red and purple. The marks grow beneath your skin; they become splotchy, uneven, with a dark red center. They are my marks. They show the world my ownership. Your pride and devotion grows each time I strike your body, because you see what it does to me. Like nothing else can and nobody else ever will. You feel them throughout the day, the dull aches and the searing sting. You smile and wince. You feel them whenever you want to be reminded that you are mine and that you are important to me. You feel them every time you sit down or move a certain way. Sometimes it feels good to touch the places that hurt, not only to soothe them, but also to feel the connection to me. Finally, you gasp and moan and your hips writhe when I allow you to feel pleasure. My touch is different now. I massage the hot flesh and bring my mouth to your ear and whisper, ""You are such a good girl. Such a pretty, smart, obedient girl. You are perfect and I am so happy you are mine. I kiss the tear away from your cheek. This is our life together, with you as my online submissive. l take you to that mental edge and linger there with you. Every day. I draw power from your vulnerability and loss of control. I penetrate your entire being: your mind, your body, your emotions. Your spirit. I break them all and make them mine. Write me now."

In particular, Im referring to the misogynistic themes.* *However, for some out there, my mere politics might also be worthy of a Trigger Warning. If that happens to be the case with you, then please, dont be offended. If you must leave a venomous comment, then I can only hope you get some catharsis out of it.* *** *** **INTRODUCTION:** This is going to be a *very* long post, so I will keep this introduction part relatively short. Unlike a great deal of the females here on Reddit, I do not get flooded with responses; which is to say, you have all the time you need to respond to this prompt. And considering how lengthy this post actually *is*, perhaps it would be best experienced if you bookmarked it and read it at your leisure. Even if you dont reply, I hope you enjoy the story below regardless. I had a lot of fun writing it. And, please, dont take it too seriously, folks. *...Its just a story.* *** *** **ABOUT MYSELF:** Im twenty-four years old. I stand six-foot-three, with broad shoulders and an athletic build. I have blond hair and bright, blue eyes. Handsome features, with a pale complexion. Ive always had an extremely dominate disposition toward sex. Over the years, Ive cultivate a talent for creative degradation/humiliation. Ive also developed a keen eye for imaginative objectification/dehumanization. This is largely because I pride myself on having a unique brand of domination, one which is both distinct and nuanced. To me, the psychological aspects of domination are just as important as the physical ones, if not more so. I have too many kinks to be able to list them all coherently. Even this [kink-list](URL doesnt do a very good job of expressing the depths or subtleties of my depraviltiy *(itll have to do for now, though)*. My only hard-limits are children, animals, scat and submitting to women. Everything else can be negotiated, so long as the right context is involved. My experience with this misogyny as a kink is rather extensive, both online and off. Im happy to share some sordid tales, if thats the sort of thing that youre interested in. Your current level of experience, however, *isnt* a qualifying factor. If youre new to this particular scene and you are hesitant to jump into the deep end, I dont mind being your soft introduction; and conversely, if youre confident and experienced with this sort of thing, then I wont waste your time with the shallow end of the pool. My intensity will match yours  or, exceed it by a reasonable degree. Ive been told that my approachable and accommodating tone when writing these posts is counterintuitive for any serious Dominant advertising their services, especially one who specializes in degradation/humiliation. While I understand the obvious wisdom of this, I still prefer to reserve my *worst self* until after some initial understanding has been established between us. I know this is not a popular way of doing things on r/BDSMpersonals and I acknowledge that it risks being a pretty major turn-off for some. Establishing that understanding might take as little as a single exchange of messages back and forth, or it could take several; that honestly depends more on you and your sensitivities than it does me and mine. For now, simply know that Im being on my best behaviour. After we connect privately, youll get a taste for my *deplorable* side... I should probably take a moment now to mention my politics, since thats something thatll become relevant shortly. Im a good distance right of centre, with strong individualist leanings. As far as politically incorrect beliefs go, I harbour more than a few of those. But, we can discuss those beliefs in more detail later on. For now, I think thats enough about me. *** *** **WHO IM SEEKING:** Im seeking a devout Leftist, to put it as simply as I can. Someone whos ideological bubble I can *pop*... You should be older than I am *(at least thirty, please, although exceptions can certainly be made)*. Anyone over the age of forty will go straight to the front of the line, especially if theyve been a lifelong feminist. Pictures are not required, although they are always appreciated. Im not concerned with your appearance *(meaning nothing is a deal-breaker for me)*, but I do **strongly** prefer that you converse *(or roleplay)* using your own looks. It just makes things a little more grounded and immediate. My taste in women is as diverse and contextual as my kinks, so I wont bother attempting to articulate *my type*. I will say one thing, however. My tastes often favour those who can not be described as ordinary, for better or for worst. This means you likely have no need to be shy about your appearance. The things you consider flaws, I very well might consider assets. *** *** **WHAT IM SEEKING, AS A DOM:** A little bit of everything, to be honest. That includes  but certainly isnt limited to  the following: * Simple conversation; * Providing education/re-education; * Sharing our experiences/fantasies; * Roleplaying. I guess Im here for all the things that youd naturally expect on this sub-Reddit; except, I prefer to dabble in a little of everything. If theres something specific that youd like to approach me about, go ahead; Im always open to hear whats on your mind. Even if I dont accept your offer, Im not going to judge you for making it. If youre primarily looking for an RP session, please give me a general idea of the scenario and kinks you desire, then Ill respond with a decent-sized *(and well written)* introduction to the RP. I enjoy crafting detailed prompts, especially when theyve been commissioned from me and they include your personal kinks. So long as it lines up with my own kinks *(somewhat, at least)*, Ill be willing to indulge your fantasy and help to flesh it out properly, no matter how taboo it is. You can be very specific with your request, or you can simply give me a rough idea of what turns you on and Ill *run wild* with it. I prefer long-term roleplaying, which develops slowly and gains momentum over time. Some of the best scenarios Ive ever roleplayed built-up and crescendoed over the course of days, or even weeks. With the right investment, those exchanges gained an agency all their own. Thats what Im looking for, even if it means that sometimes we have to sacrifice the most immediately satisfying outcome for necessary story set-up. That said... Im also content with the occasional short-term session *(if Im not already committed to a long-term one)*. *** *** **WHAT IM SEEKING, AS A BULL:** In addition to seeking a female Sub, Im also potentially interested in meeting couples who are curious about cuckolding. If youre relatively new to cuckolding, we can begin with an introduction of sorts. I think youll find that Im more accommodating than most Bulls on Reddit; at least, in this regard. I also like to think that Im a pretty good teacher. Then, we can progress organically from there  even if we have to take baby-steps. Im open to a wide variety of interactions when it comes to cuckolding, including: * Simply corresponding back and forth *(either as a group or one-on-one)*; * Providing education/guidance to uncertain couples *(I can effectively wear two hats, the second being that of a quasi-couples therapist/confidante)*; * Engaging in virtual cuckolding *(this can include audio/pictures/videos, but doesnt necessarily have to)*; * Roleplaying all sorts of scenarios *(again: together, or just between two of us)*; * You can also commission a piece of erotica from me. I love writing personalized smut for couples to enjoy together. Sometimes, I even like to include instructions through-out the story, to make it a more interactive reading experience. I dont mind if youre married or simply dating, but I do prefer that youre both over thirty and somewhat committed. If your relationship isnt built on a sturdy enough foundation to survive the possible after-shock resulting from this experiment, then Id rather not do it in the first place. My intentions are never to harm the well-being of others, only to provide a form of *escapism*  even if it happens to be a fairly taboo and unconventional form. *** *** **WRITING SAMPLE:** We met in early 2017, on a frigid January morning, in the heated midst of the *Womans March*. You were standing in a tight circle of protesters, each of you wearing identical knitted pussy-hats over yours frozen ears, and each of you holding a placard more naive and absurd than the last. *(Yours read: **The Patriarchy Can Eat a Dick**. At least you had a sense of irony, I suppose; the others were far worse.)* I approached you with a camera-man and a microphone, feigning sympathy with your cause. I seemed genuine and respectful when making my request  not to mention *a little* charming  so you gladly agreed to do an interview with me. In the theatre of your mind, you couldnt help but imagine seeing yourself bloviating on YouTube later that day, then immediately sharing the link with everyone you knew. It wouldnt be as good as getting yourself on the news, but there was still plenty of time left in the day for that... Whenever the *Womans March* would be brought up in the course of conversation  not just during this Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, but for *years* to come  your family and friends would associate *your name* with it. But, thats not what happened; at least, not how youd imagined it would happen... It took a few minutes for you to realize that I was treating you as some sort of inside joke, mocking your responses subtlety enough so that my audience would know to laugh along, without spoiling the joke by letting you in on the fact that it was at your expense. You thought the interview would likely be posted on some Alt-Right YouTube channel to incite mockery. Enraged and indignant, you and the circle of pussy-hat wearing protesters stormed away violently, trying to take away my microphone in the process. It didnt work. You found the YouTube video Id posted a week later and contacted me shortly afterward, threatening legal action. *(In the comments section, theyd taken to either calling you that attention whore or the older one with the nice tits. Your pussy-hat was clearly knitted by hand, which itself inspired a whole separate chain of comments, pondering on what it must be like to grow-up with a psycho mother who thinks making genitalia out of yarn constitutes meaningful political action. One commenter wondered if you chose that ugly off-pink coloured wool to match the dusty shade your actual cunt.)* After a few days of exchanging heated emails back and forth, you decided not to pursue any legal action. Not because youd realized that you had no case, which was indeed correct, but because youd started to... *enjoy* my replies. It was nearly impossible to admit to yourself, but it was true, all the same. My messages were unapologetic and raw, but still understanding and sympathetic in their own way. You found yourself slowly being seduced by my worldview; not convinced, but compelled; *enchanted*, even. It was like taking some exotic drug, both intoxicating and freighting. You never mentioned our private conversations to anyone, because you feared what your friends and family would think of you exchanging emails with a Nazi *(your words, not mine)*. Even when my popularity surged to ridiculous heights, you kept our correspondence secret. In time, my emails became one of the few aspects of your day-to-day life which you anticipated. That, and sneakily watching my YouTube videos with your headphones, so no one would know the ideological and personal conflict you felt. After our correspondence had already taken on a familial  albeit not quite friendly  tone, the video Id made of you suddenly gained viral traction, causing GIFs of your comedically exasperated expression to spread like wild-fire. Thankfully, your family remained oblivious of your over-night internet infamy. You never saw the meme posted anywhere you regularly interacted online  within *your bubble*, that is  but once you peeked over the ideological fence, you saw it *everywhere*... Reddit, Twitter, Imgur, *EVERYWHERE*. Itd become ubiquitous amongst right-wing trolls, whod use the GIFs to solicit a cheap laugh. Others had taken to gleefully tormenting your own Twitter account, like sadistic gremlins praying on your sudden vulnerability in the spot light. You deleted your account, telling your family that youd simply grown tired of social-media. You even encouraged them to do the same, in hopes that youd limit their chances of being exposed to your humiliation. Basically, *you were the new Trigglypuff...* I brought up your new found status as a meme a few times during our conversations, mostly with an apologetic air, but sometimes with what approached humoured indifference. I reassured you that the joke didnt have any legs to it, and that people would move on eventually  likely sooner rather than later. Infuriated and hurt, you asked me how Id feel if my family saw *me* being made fun of in public. I told you that I wouldnt like it at all, no more than I enjoyed being labeled a sexist or a Nazi, simply for understanding economics enough to know that the *Pink Tax* and the *Wage Gap* were both self-propagating, self-serving myths. That street goes two directions, I said. Even though Id seemed cruel about the whole ordeal, you did hear me call the meme lame and over played during a livestream. The meme came from my show and I dont even think its that funny. Get a grip, folks... And sure enough, your infamy seemed to vanish, as if in the blink of an eye. Everyone moved on; there were other Trigglypuffs, and no ones attention span is that long. Eventually, the frequency of our emails tapered off. You still watched my YouTube channel regularly, always alone and always with private browsing turned on, but we had no further contact. That is, not until January of the following year, when I sent you a message out-of-the-blue. I asked if you were going to the *Womans March: Redux*. When you confirmed that you were leaving your family at home to protest for the weekend, I suggested that you change your plans... Id also been planning to attend the march, hoping to trick another gullible participant into becoming a lucrative meme. You were pretty lucrative, you know that? But then, I told you that Id recently reconsidered, now suspecting that the *Womans March* had become a case of diminishing returns. I decided that Id take the weekend off from producing content. Instead of interviewing uneducated protesters for a laugh, I was going to take a well-earned rest. *(Making a video five days a week can take a toll on you after a while.)* I booked a good hotel room for two nights. You were invited to join me, I mentioned, too casually to be trusted. I told you that I made sure it would have an excellent view of the protests taking place on the street down below. Why stand out there in the cold, when the two of us could simply watch the surreal, estrogen-induced spectacle from a distance? I pitched it as your vacation from Feminism. Wouldnt it be more productive if the two of us had a long, civil conversation in my hotel room? Why stand out there, screaming at the top of your lungs and achieving nothing but welcoming more ridicule? ...Join me, instead. Maybe the two of us could get somewhere. Hell, maybe even a proper interview? Something more dignified that last time. After you rejected my offer, feeling shocked and repulsed by what you thought were *obvious* sexual implications, I replied with my hotel and room number regardless. Then, I mentioned that if you found yourself standing out there in the cold, feeling dumb and miserable, you could always come join me. The invitation was an open one. Still beside yourself and throughly disgusted by my approach, you asked *how stupid I thought you were?* You dont want to prove your point, you said. You just want to *fuck* me. Then, you sent a follow-up email sent thirty seconds later: Youre disgusting... *Yuck dude.* I thought better of you... So yeah, I must be pretty stupid I guess.* My reply came a second later. No, sweetheart. Youve got it backwards. I want to *fuck you* to *prove my point*. Youre right about what I intend to do, but not about my intentions. I very much want to prove something to you.. You didnt reply to that; you *couldnt* reply to *that*. You attended the *Womans March*, just like youd always planed to. After some deliberation, you packed your hand-knitted pussy-hat into your carry-on bag. You werent going to let a bunch of twenty-something virgins bully you into silence. *That wasnt who you were,* you decided. But, Id been right about one thing, youd come to realize. While standing out there in the street, holding your placard high above your head and chanting loudly, you felt *dumb* and throughly *miserable*. Every few minutes, you caught yourself looking up at the large hotel which loomed above the street, wondering which window was mine. *...Could I see you?* You found it increasingly hard to hold the placard above your head with enthusiasm. You began checking your email, wondering if Id sent you a message. When you saw that I hadnt, you scrolled up and looked at my room number again... *Do I go to him?*, you asked yourself. The mere idea of going to my hotel room caused a your skin to feel like it was on fire. Whenever you caught yourself considering the idea *seriously*, a wave of dread would then suddenly wash over you, extinguishing the giddy excitement youd felt only moments before. Until eventually, the cold rationality failed to put out the burning sensation within you. After hesitating for a long moment, you left your placard in a near-by bush and began walking toward the hotels lobby at the end of the street. *I wonder if hes watching me right now... I wonder if he already knows hes won...* *** *** **FORMALITIES** If youve read this far, Im going to assume that youre *considering* replying to this. If thats the case, lets get some of the formalities out of the way. Please include your age and a brief description of yourself. We can go from there and discuss what youre seeking after the introductions are made. *(And please, dont be shy. I respond to all the replies I receive.)* For now, take care, be safe and dont let the occasional judgemental pricks on here get you down. And if I dont ever hear from you, I hope you at least had some fun reading the short story I provided."
420,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,46(M4F) - I found the perfect sub! She's just waiting to reply! ;),1,aqbbfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/aqbbfc/46m4f_i_found_the_perfect_sub_shes_just_waiting/,2019-02-14 07:50:01,"Hello there. I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games until all hours. (For the Horde!) - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. - Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. - Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. - Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting. - Obedience and compliance, as well as meticulous control and attention is what gets me going. - *Extras:* Slut shaming, behavior modification focused degradation/humiliation, body marking, ownership enforcement, etc. **In my perfect world, my submissive partner would be:** - Based here in the US, preferably in the east coast for timezone purposes. - Between 25-50 years old. - Available *sometime* within my available weekday hours (7a-7p EST) - Highly attentive and communicative. - Looking to live our long distance/separate lives together as much as we possibly can. Not confining ourselves to specific areas of sharing our lives together but opening up every facet of our lives to one another over time and trust. - Excited by the idea of mutual obsession, infatuation, and utter devotion. - Experienced OR actively learning and reading to gain more experience. - A strong speaker with high expectations for command of the English language . - Witty, dry sarcasm, dark humor are all a plus (please don't drown me in your lol's. I'll admit I am a sucker for a good placed GIF though). - Emotionally available. - Married or unmarried, tethered or untethered is irrelevant. Must be transparent with me and my expectation is some degree of monogamy even if you are in a LTR or married at some point. I'm not looking to be #3 in your rotation. To clarify further, in a long term concept with someone who is also married/in a LTR, I'm not looking for either of us to be in a relationship (physical or emotional) with anyone outside of each other and our respective partners. **Communication:** - Hangouts (text, voice/video calls), emails, Kik, snail mail (PO box -- I'm not that insane), or in person. I've posted here before and met some amazing people, but ultimately long term wise, it hasn't lasted to what I've wanted. If you aren't interested in having deep conversations or in writing detailing responses, please don't bother to reach out to me. Include a name or alias that isn't your screen name, A/S/L, communication preferences, and precisely what in this post moved you to reach out. Thank you. "

You suddenly feel helpless and exhilarated. I see both the fear and trust in your moistening eyes. You reflexively beg for mercyreally beg. Your breath deepens, more desperate. Your hips writhe after you feel my bare palm again on your ass. You feel the marks on your body. Then I turn your head and force you to look at them. You see the red and purple. The spots grow, become splotchy, uneven, with a dark red center that seems to pulse. They are my marks and now you will wear them. You will feel them throughout the day, the dull aches and the searing sting. You will smile and wince and glow. You will feel them whenever you want to be reminded that you are mine. You will feel them every time you sit down or move a certain way. Finally, you gasp and moan and your pelvis squirms when I tell you to feel pleasure. My touch is different now. My fingers glide across your beckoning wetness and I whisper, ""You are such a good girl. Such a pretty, obedient girl. I am so happy you are mine. You are all I ever wanted."" I kiss the tear away from your warm cheek as my finger pushes you open. I want you to be my online submissive. l want to take you to that emotional edge and linger there with you. I want to feel the surge of power in my body that comes directly from your vulnerability and loss of control. I want to penetrate you forcefully: your mind, your body, your emotions, your spirit. I will break them all and make them mine and pull them close to my heart. You read this and you know. You feel it. You will be the one. Write me now."

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."
423,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] To share your weakness is to make yourself vulnerable. To make yourself vulnerable is to show your strength.,5,armomf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/armomf/30_m4f_to_share_your_weakness_is_to_make_yourself/,2019-02-18 04:27:32,"I admit, I think about that quote far too often. Nonetheless, vulnerability is at the center of what this dynamic should be. One cannot submit without first being vulnerable. To share your weaknesses, to share your dreams, goals, insecurities, fears, darkest thoughts with a partner, and know that he will be there no matter, not judging for anything that you have shared. Vulnerability is not easy. Nothing worth doing is easy. But it's crucial as a stepping stone to submission. The second half of the quote is just as important as the first half. When you show vulnerability, is not a weakness. You show strengths by being vulnerable, by submitting. I don't want a doormat, but I want someone who submits with her head held high. Submission is a gift that you do not give to just anyone. You have a hard time finding a Dom worth respecting, I suspect. Most Doms don't get the subtleties of control and dominance. They focus too much on dominating your mind and do not focus enough on your mind and emotions. I am a 30 year old man, living in the DC area, where I work in a government position (don't worry, not a Trump fan). I have been involved with D/s for near a decade now, with several long term relationships on and offline, with a wide variety of dynamics, from strict TPE to more paternal DD/lg, and everything in-between. I have an active social life, mostly spent with a great smaller group of friends. The rest of my free time is spent in nature or in front of a computer. I love to swim, love to hike and enjoy video games. I would love to find someone who shares more than just her kinky with me, who has similar interests and hobbies. Speaking of interests, I am interested in many topics, movies, books, TV, politics, psychology, philosophy and more. When it comes to D/s relationships, I am strict, firm, creative and open-minded. No kink you have will shock me and I will be eager to make your fantasies become a reality. I focus a lot on dominance outside the bedroom, enjoying control in every aspect of life, beyond just sexually. Personality-wise, I am organized, driven, focused and calm. I plan things to the smallest detail and you will often find me making lists to improve my efficiency. I have found that this side of me works especially well in D/s relationships as well, where I can help improve your life and productivity, motivating you to be better than you have been on your own. I am looking for someone to spend my day with, to talk to and get to know, to explore our minds together. Someone with a personality, who is able to hold a conversation, knows how to ask the right kinds of questions and who feels like something is missing in their lives. Maybe it is a sense of direction or maybe it is missing someone to whisper filthy things in your ear. I am open to both long distance and local. I enjoy taking my time and getting to know someone well. Will you allow yourself to be vulnerable? I am waiting."

Authenticity is the goal here. Big me: I live in Sunny Florida and I'm a student as well (Working on my Masters). In my down time I enjoy reading and writing. I play piano and love to be by the water. Memes are my second language, so if you don't like them this may not work out lol. Little me: I don't really have an age I gravitate towards but my little space is spent cuddling my stuffs and coloring (trying to stay in the lines, bu always failing D: ) When I get angry or frustrated I scrunch up my face and when I'm sad or scared I retreat to hide. I can be a brat, but I will always strive to be called your good girl. I spend so much of m time being big me and having to ""adult"" that I want to just have moments where I don't have to do anything and just be little and carefree. What I want: I want to be your ""sweet baby angle"" lol your ""cute dumb baby faced girl"" I want to take this slow and REALLY get to know you. I want you to love my little space and crave for me to be in it more. I don't think I should be calling you Daddy after a week of talking and you shouldn't expect me to. ""Daddy"" means so much and I only want to bestow that on someone who deserves it and wants to be that for me. What you can expect from me: Loyalty, honesty, vulnerability, cuteness, brattiness. This is serious for me and I will pretty much do what it takes to find my Daddy and keep him in my life. I'm black, curvy, 5'4 I'm looking for long-term so if you want FwB or just someone to call you Daddy in bed, it's not me. Also please be older than me (Doesn't matter how much older) and in the United States. There is sooooo much more I could say (and I feel like I've said so much already), but I suppose I should keep the rest for PMs. So please, message me and let's see if perhaps you're my Daddy and I'm your little girl.

I have been sessioning on-and-off for around 2 years, so I can understand the feelings of a sub very well - the shame and excitement of being under someone's control, the rush of endorphins that accompanies a punishment, the allure of being a eager slut, ready to do whatever is commanded to earn your reward! I very much enjoy exploring that side of myself, but lately I've been taken with the idea of supporting someone who wants to experience these feelings themselves as well. Of course, I understand that enjoying D/s dynamic requires a strong bond of trust, and that the exploration of fetishes is every bit a shared journey - I view bdsm as an experience to be mutually enjoyed, both dom and sub should be having fun, and if that stops, the scene should stop right there. Exploring your fantasies is absolutely something to be embraced, but safety, sanity and informed consent are the backbone of any healthy relationship, anything short of that is abuse, and should never be tolerated! With the important disclaimer out of the way, I'd like to introduce myself a little more: I'm 28, I live in the East Midlands but I'm able to travel, 6'2"", long dark-blonde hair, beard, glasses - kind of a mixed intellectual/metalhead/hippie look going on. I'm university educated and work a full time job, but outside of work I'm kind of a geek, with an interest in games, horror, science fiction and fantasy. I'm a little bit of an introvert, but once I get to know someone my sarcasm and cheesy humour start to shine through. I don't take myself too seriously, as I feel life should be about enjoying yourself! I'd like to get to know you if you're someone who's looking to explore themes of domination and submission in a relationship with a patient, accepting and adventurous partner. Whether you're a budding Switch, or are set exclusively on one side of the spectrum, I think it's a wonderful thing to be confident of what you like and embrace your desires. Outside of someone being tied up and teased, I want to be a friend you can confide in and be comfortable with, while in a scene, I always believe in equality, even if there are themes of power exchange at play. My experiences in bdsm have included bondage, impact play, breath control, sensory deprivation, teasing and orgasm control, cock/dildo worship, facesitting, and anal play. As a sub, I'm curious to potentially explore elements of chastity and service submission, while on the dominant side I feel the most important thing is to be receptive to what my partner wants, and help them explore their fetishes. I have some limits on anything that involves blood or serious violence, bodily waste, or needles (they really creep me out, but I'm strangely ok with cosmetic piercings, weird how these things work out...) I have a small selection of toys and restraints, which I'm sure can be expanded upon, depending on what we come to enjoy. I have a fondness for gags, both in the submissive thrill of wearing them, and the feelings of power and control that comes with putting one on a willing partner. In some ways, I think being gagged allows you to express more of your true nature, and there are so many interesting options available! Silence is golden, as they say, but an open mouth leaves room for other fun possibilities. I also have a have an appreciation for many of the wild and imaginative designs that make up kink fashion. From the irresistible power exuded by a dominant woman in clad in a black corset and boots, to the erotic vulnerability of a submissive kitten in delicate lace. Often the right amount of tasteful exposure is far more alluring than nothing at all, and if you like looking and feeling sexy then I'd love to spoil you with naughty little gifts... Kink can be an immensely fun journey, and one that I hope we might have the opportunity to explore together!"

(Online to start),0,atvs6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/atvs6c/25m4f_passionate_master_seeks_his_true_slave_for/,2019-02-24 01:01:01,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soont"

429,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] To share your weakness is to make yourself vulnerable. To make yourself vulnerable is to show your strength.,2,aub38m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/aub38m/30_m4f_to_share_your_weakness_is_to_make_yourself/,2019-02-25 05:51:57,"I admit, I think about that quote far too often. Nonetheless, vulnerability is at the center of what this dynamic should be. One cannot submit without first being vulnerable. To share your weaknesses, to share your dreams, goals, insecurities, fears, darkest thoughts with a partner, and know that he will be there no matter, not judging for anything that you have shared. Vulnerability is not easy. Nothing worth doing is easy. But it's crucial as a stepping stone to submission. The second half of the quote is just as important as the first half. When you show vulnerability, is not a weakness. You show strengths by being vulnerable, by submitting. I don't want a doormat, but I want someone who submits with her head held high. Submission is a gift that you do not give to just anyone. You have a hard time finding a Dom worth respecting, I suspect. Most Doms don't get the subtleties of control and dominance. They focus too much on dominating your mind and do not focus enough on your mind and emotions. I am a 30 year old man, living in the DC area, where I work in a government position (don't worry, not a Trump fan). I have been involved with D/s for near a decade now, with several long term relationships on and offline, with a wide variety of dynamics, from strict TPE to more paternal DD/lg, and everything in-between. I have an active social life, mostly spent with a great smaller group of friends. The rest of my free time is spent in nature or in front of a computer. I love to swim, love to hike and enjoy video games. I would love to find someone who shares more than just her kinky with me, who has similar interests and hobbies. Speaking of interests, I am interested in many topics, movies, books, TV, politics, psychology, philosophy and more. When it comes to D/s relationships, I am strict, firm, creative and open-minded. No kink you have will shock me and I will be eager to make your fantasies become a reality. I focus a lot on dominance outside the bedroom, enjoying control in every aspect of life, beyond just sexually. Personality-wise, I am organized, driven, focused and calm. I plan things to the smallest detail and you will often find me making lists to improve my efficiency. I have found that this side of me works especially well in D/s relationships as well, where I can help improve your life and productivity, motivating you to be better than you have been on your own. I am looking for someone to spend my day with, to talk to and get to know, to explore our minds together. Someone with a personality, who is able to hold a conversation, knows how to ask the right kinds of questions and who feels like something is missing in their lives. Maybe it is a sense of direction or maybe it is missing someone to whisper filthy things in your ear. I am open to both long distance and local. I enjoy taking my time and getting to know someone well. Will you allow yourself to be vulnerable? I am waiting."

I love to watch and observe every little detail. I pay attention. I note things. I enjoy the little behaviors and mannerisms others dont get to see or which you may not even be aware. The thing, though, is that Ive never had any interest in the creepiest version of this kink. I have no interest in snooping or peeping. I would get nothing from the experience if you didnt know I was watching. No, quite the opposite. For me, a significant portion of the thrill is that she knows shes on display, she knows every little thing is being scrutinized. That power imbalance, that vulnerability, that exposure, thats what I love. So Im here today seeing if any women share this interest (or a complementary version of it). I recognize this type of dynamic would take a lot of time to build to, and it would need to conform to your comfort levels. I have plenty of ideas of how this could be customized, though. We dont have to go full Truman show to make this work. There are plenty of forms of media, and I think frequent journaling/messaging or even just prompt responses and frank honesty could work. Theres a lot of mindset to this, and so we would just need to chat and see if it falls into place for us. If youre interested I would love to hear from you. "

I have a fair amount of experience in kink and D/s, and I'd like to explore even more with someone whom I can (at minimum) be great friends with. While I am looking for something casual I am still open to more serious dynamics if connection is there/right. **Who am I**? Well, I think of myself as an intelligent, considerate, lightly-eccentric-in-a-good-way gentleman. I'd say I have a silly/ridiculous sense of humor (I enjoy innuendo a lot (title of my sex tape), and also enjoy high-brow stuff too. I find myself attracted to movies and music more than books (I'm a big quoter), but I can and do read (from time to time). **I pride myself** on being considerate, perceptive, and observant; I'm very good at communication, and while I seem gifted in self-aware-ed-ness I can also go to obliviousness faster than Trump can piss off a everyone. Physically speaking I hear that I'm *quite* handsome (if you're over 60) and cute (if you're not). I like shopping, and as such cultivating a sense of style. Oh, and I'm 5'10, 175 pounds, average build. My favorite things about me are my face and my cock (if I'm not *dicking* about). Kink wise **I am a total hedonist**. Choice is sexy to me, so I'm all about service-submission, zero disobedience, and a sub choosing out of a love to please, rather than a love to be 'forced'. I like being spoiled by my sub because I like to spoil her in return. **Kinks I must have** with my partner: * Cock worship * Free use * Anal * Cum play * Fashion play * Extreme dirty talk (this one is my favorite and most important) The list is a lot longer, those are my favorites. My **hard limits** are: * Permanent Marking * Scat * Blood * Needles * Intense pain * Extreme bondage * Brats/disobedience * Vomit * Illegal acts (children, animals, et cetera) **What I'm looking for** besides compatibility in kink, is similar qualities I embody. I'm more of a birds of a feather than opposites attract, though I don't close any doors. Be as emotionally intelligent and open, considerate and kind as you are sexual and kinky. Be able to **communicate** shamelessly, directly, probably with some amount of vulnerability too. Communication is one of the top reasons I got into D/s; communication is required for a strong, healthy D/s relationship, and I want someone who appreciates that neither of us will be a mind reader at the start. Communication is also my biggest kink, I'm all about it. Also, be uninhibited in your pursuit, comfortable in exploration; which to me is a big part of all this. When I picture my partner and I, (*not that I was a huge fan of this movie*) I picture the dynamic between Deadpool and Vanessa (with my partner being only slightly more submissive/obedient); I like a sexually aggressive, dirty minded, pleasing partner. Someone who is passionate about exploration and their own sexuality. I want a girl who, while she is my submissive sub/slave can easily handle herself, and though I can (would, and may at times), can/likes to fight her own battles. Distance wise I'm looking for someone local to Chicago. I live in River North and am happy to host. When you do message me, convey the same type of information I've done here.

And yet, that's not why you clicked this post and we both know that. You have always craved someone controlling your mind as much as your body, someone who can probe your mind in the most devious ways, someone who can demand vulnerability and actually bring you there as well. I am a lot more than my kinky side. I have a good career (as a lawyer), a good social life, healthy interests and I think I make a good conversationalist. You are just as likely to find me in the stands of a football match as you are finding me watching a musical. I read a lot and have a nerdy side. I challenge myself often and regularly, especially to try new experiences, from traveling to new places to trying new food to bungee jumping (highly recommend!). I have been in D/s relationships for over a decade at this point. I know what I want and I am looking for someone who can make me happy. In return, I will hopefully make you just as happy. My focus is on psychological control and play, holding you accountable to tasks and rules in a strict manner. I have high expectations but also make sure that meeting them will be rewarded well. I do have a paternal side as well, caring for those that are mine, but it's fair to say that my main focus is on the stricter and darker sides of dominance. When I say I want to probe your mind, I am not just using a phrase. I ask a lot of questions, often ones that you may not have been asked in that form before. I don't care for small talk. I want to get to real you, the one you have not shared with anyone, not your family, friends or your ex boyfriends. I want to get to know the scared, insecure girl hidden within the darkness of your mind, who craves to be owned completely. I believe beautiful dominance can have a lot of benefit to the life of a submissive in need of structure. Structure can help you lead a better life, being healthier, being more thoughtful and kind to others around you, being a better student or worker, being happier. A lot of us have this emptiness inside of us, the thing that makes us lay awake at night wondering if there is something missing. I believe that by bringing out the best in you, I can fill that emptiness with love, adoration, respect and obedience. I have many kinks and am very open-minded. Even if our kinks do not match 100%, we should have no problem enjoying ourselves. Here is a list: [URL In general, my main focus is more on the control of the relationship in general rather than one specific kink. I enjoy TPE or at least getting close to it, controlling various aspects of your life, the more the better. Obviously things start slow. I want to get to know you fully first, I will not rush into a relationship. In order to take as much control as I want, it takes time. And it takes time for you to trust me too, to open up about your desires, to be vulnerable and let your walls down. I am not someone who expects that right away, but I always push steadily and deeper. Given the nature of this and the focus on the mind, I am also happy to start online if you live elsewhere. I love traveling, so I have no issue with distance, though obviously it would be easier if you were in the UK. I am also on the East Coast of the US regularly though. I don't really have a type, except of what I described above. I want someone willing to explore this, willing to open up over time. I tend to enjoy feminine girls, who are not afraid to be themselves. Whether that is a confident woman in a stressful career or an insecure, needy girl who just wants to find a purpose. Obviously there are a lot more variations and I am happy to hear which one you are. So tell me about yourself."

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal.

You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul.

Quite the contrary, at 6'7"" I am probably bigger, taller and stronger than most men you have come across before. I am sure you have been overwhelmed by a man before, but never quite like this. And yet, that's not why you clicked this post and we both know that. You have always craved someone controlling your mind as much as your body, someone who can probe your mind in the most devious ways, someone who can demand vulnerability and actually bring you there as well. I am a lot more than my kinky side. I have a good career (as a lawyer), a good social life, healthy interests and I think I make a good conversationalist. You are just as likely to find me in the stands of a football match as you are finding me watching a musical. I read a lot and have a nerdy side. I challenge myself often and regularly, especially to try new experiences, from traveling to new places to trying new food to bungee jumping (highly recommend!). I have been in D/s relationships for over a decade at this point. I know what I want and I am looking for someone who can make me happy. In return, I will hopefully make you just as happy. My focus is on psychological control and play, holding you accountable to tasks and rules in a strict manner. I have high expectations but also make sure that meeting them will be rewarded well. I do have a paternal side as well, caring for those that are mine, but it's fair to say that my main focus is on the stricter and darker sides of dominance. When I say I want to probe your mind, I am not just using a phrase. I ask a lot of questions, often ones that you may not have been asked in that form before. I don't care for small talk. I want to get to real you, the one you have not shared with anyone, not your family, friends or your ex boyfriends. I want to get to know the scared, insecure girl hidden within the darkness of your mind, who craves to be owned completely. I believe beautiful dominance can have a lot of benefit to the life of a submissive in need of structure. Structure can help you lead a better life, being healthier, being more thoughtful and kind to others around you, being a better student or worker, being happier. A lot of us have this emptiness inside of us, the thing that makes us lay awake at night wondering if there is something missing. I believe that by bringing out the best in you, I can fill that emptiness with love, adoration, respect and obedience. I have many kinks and am very open-minded. Even if our kinks do not match 100%, we should have no problem enjoying ourselves. Here is a list: [URL In general, my main focus is more on the control of the relationship in general rather than one specific kink. I enjoy TPE or at least getting close to it, controlling various aspects of your life, the more the better. Obviously things start slow. I want to get to know you fully first, I will not rush into a relationship. In order to take as much control as I want, it takes time. And it takes time for you to trust me too, to open up about your desires, to be vulnerable and let your walls down. I am not someone who expects that right away, but I always push steadily and deeper. Given the nature of this and the focus on the mind, I am also happy to start online if you live elsewhere. I love traveling, so I have no issue with distance, though obviously it would be easier if you were in the UK. I am also on the East Coast of the US regularly though. I don't really have a type, except of what I described above. I want someone willing to explore this, willing to open up over time. I tend to enjoy feminine girls, who are not afraid to be themselves. Whether that is a confident woman in a stressful career or an insecure, needy girl who just wants to find a purpose. Obviously there are a lot more variations and I am happy to hear which one you are. So tell me about yourself."

Emotionally balanced and looking for a D/s relationship or a steady play partner. I am single and unattached (divorced). Im not lifestyle and I look clean cut and one would never guess. Seeking someone to share time with and get to know and have more deep exploration with each other over time. Being able to connect on a vanilla level is a must. Not a 24/7 thing, unless we want it to me. Daddy dom play is enjoyable. Ive posted a few times before and Im always surprised at the lack of responses. I could use some ideas. Reddit seems to be pretty beat or maybe my posts are not up to snuff. No idea. Ill take your suggestions. I have good experience as a Dom. I can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy control and teaching someone about the darker pleasures. Newbies are ok. I tilt a little more towards the BD than SM as I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. In particular Im skilled with rope play, and love bondage, exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I consider myself high EQ and I look academic, like a modern professor Ive been told. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning. When replying please state age, general location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation. I prefer to move to kik or texting on google voice and starting on vanilla topics. Please tell me two vanilla things about you and lets see if we would fit into each other snuggly, deeply, naughtily "
440,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] To share your weakness is to make yourself vulnerable. To make yourself vulnerable is to show your strength.,1,ahhfwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/ahhfwv/30_m4f_to_share_your_weakness_is_to_make_yourself/,2019-01-19 12:31:37,"I admit, I think about that quote far too often. Nonetheless, vulnerability is at the center of what this dynamic should be. One cannot submit without first being vulnerable. To share your weaknesses, to share your dreams, goals, insecurities, fears, darkest thoughts with a partner, and know that he will be there no matter, not judging for anything that you have shared. Vulnerability is not easy. Nothing worth doing is easy. But it's crucial as a stepping stone to submission. The second half of the quote is just as important as the first half. When you show vulnerability, is not a weakness. You show strengths by being vulnerable, by submitting. I don't want a doormat, but I want someone who submits with her head held high. Submission is a gift that you do not give to just anyone. You have a hard time finding a Dom worth respecting, I suspect. Most Doms don't get the subtleties of control and dominance. They focus too much on dominating your mind and do not focus enough on your mind and emotions. I am a 30 year old man, living in the DC area, where I work in a government position (don't worry, not a Trump fan). I have been involved with D/s for near a decade now, with several long term relationships on and offline, with a wide variety of dynamics, from strict TPE to more paternal DD/lg, and everything in-between. I have an active social life, mostly spent with a great smaller group of friends. The rest of my free time is spent in nature or in front of a computer. I love to swim, love to hike and enjoy video games. I would love to find someone who shares more than just her kinky with me, who has similar interests and hobbies. Speaking of interests, I am interested in many topics, movies, books, TV, politics, psychology, philosophy and more. When it comes to D/s relationships, I am strict, firm, creative and open-minded. No kink you have will shock me and I will be eager to make your fantasies become a reality. I focus a lot on dominance outside the bedroom, enjoying control in every aspect of life, beyond just sexually. Personality-wise, I am organized, driven, focused and calm. I plan things to the smallest detail and you will often find me making lists to improve my efficiency. I have found that this side of me works especially well in D/s relationships as well, where I can help improve your life and productivity, motivating you to be better than you have been on your own. I am looking for someone to spend my day with, to talk to and get to know, to explore our minds together. Someone with a personality, who is able to hold a conversation, knows how to ask the right kinds of questions and who feels like something is missing in their lives. Maybe it is a sense of direction or maybe it is missing someone to whisper filthy things in your ear. I am open to both long distance and local. I enjoy taking my time and getting to know someone well. Will you allow yourself to be vulnerable? I am waiting."

Basically, I'm 95% cocky daddy-dominant with a mischievous grin and a whole lotta ""this is for your own good,"" and 5% total klutzy goof of a submissive who LIVES to please and make lives easier and be useful by almost any means. I have very little experience as a bottom, but generally I'm either very ""make me"" (in a more CNC way than a bratty one) or very service-oriented, intensely desperate to please. Usually the latter unless we're really comfortable with each other. But definitely both. This is going to be a longpost, I apologize; while my physical needs are varied and flexible, I'm seeking a very specific dynamic. I don't want a 24/7 TPE. I don't even want a relationship in the usual sense. I don't want to follow orders outside of the house and probably not even out of the bedroom. I want a friend, somebody who wants to drink beer and get dinner and loves the way I visibly relax when they put their hand just a little too high up my thigh. Me: nonbinary butch. aka a masculine woman who dresses like a dude and still has all my lady bits. They/them preferred, short, chubby, mixed, unexpectedly broad-shouldered, strong, stubborn, ginger, extremely expressive, generally unshaven out of laziness. Trauma survivor, at length. Kinsey 5, for short; VERY bi but definitely need an emotional/intellectual connection with men in particular before I feel safe enough to be vulnerable. I love all kinds, though if you are a cis man I would be more into a genuine FWB dynamic; I usually don't have successful relationships with non-dudes. Currently have big tits with hypersensitive nipples but am having a double mastectomy later this year, hopefully. Please reread that part. Polyam and long-term partnered. Can host in Brooklyn but generally prefer not to for headspace reasons. Also: librarian, musician, dancer, powerlifter, pet owner, retired prodomme. I do have a clothing fetish, but as a bad metaphor, I don't want a grey, arms-length, shiny-unsmudged-latex relationship. I want something cozy and familiar, like heavy blankets and body heat and hands around my throat. (You don't have to choke me. Just show me that you could, because I trust you.) I want you to be someone I can trust with my safety and vulnerability, especially on the days I don't feel so great about myself. I want to be teased and beaten and rendered senseless, but not by someone who thinks they're entitled to that level of trust from me right out of the gate. Who understands that I've been through a lot of shit that's broken me down, and as a result, ""do what you will with me"" takes on an absolutely enormous significance in terms of emotional and physical vulnerability. Who respects the submission of a fierce-ass bitch who has chosen to get on their knees for you, even if some days you might need to use a heavy hand to keep me there even when I'm a sobbing mess. It's more important to me to have someone who I like and respect as a friend, and who I happen to have kinky sex with, than it is for the initial dynamic to be sexually charged. (AKA: it's totally great and awesome to read this, think it sounds like something you might be interested, and then message me just to talk about, idk, ska music or my collection of ironic bandanas or my pet rabbit or somesuch. I'm gonna assume that if you respond like a coherent human, that you're into what I'm into. The next and more important step, what we're gonna do when we're NOT having filthy kinky sex, is a great start.) To give you an idea of what I'm about: Hell yes: face-fucking (just short of gagging), roughhousing, deep thuddy impact play, cunt slapping, punching, genderplay, spanking, incessant dirty talk, a surprising amount of romantic-ass kissing, begging, going down on you constantly, denim, undressing and being undressed, being fucked from behind while you choke me with one arm and play with my tits with the other, group sex, quickies, all kinds of roleplay. Just fuck me all the time. Fuck my face all the time. Line your friends up. I'll be smiling so hard my face hurts even as the tears are running down because my jaw hurts so bad. Yes with the right person: CNC (BIG TIME), Daddy kink like whoa (big time -- even if I don't mean to, I WILL say it, so please don't shame me for it) , being casually used (ie you wake up in the middle of the night, roll over, move my underwear aside, fuck me until we come, and then roll back over and go to sleep while I'm still dripping), facials, crying during sex, questioning the limits of safewords, threatening to choke me out and fuck my ass Super hot but confusing in that ""vagina, no, why are you like this"" way: cuckolding, cheating fantasies, intox/drugs, fucked-up and super-inappropriate roleplay including ageplay, rape, incest, forced impregnation. ""Babygirl."" Under the right circumstances: forced orgasms, bondage, public play, collars, rimming (I will eat your ass until I can't breathe, especially in the shower) Absolutely no thank you: anal beyond rimming and, like, the occasional finger or small plug (although I will gladly be the person doing the penetration, that's my jam). Raceplay or any of that shit. Anything having to do with children or animals. Nipple abuse. Things that don't affect whether or not we'd be compatible, as far as I'm concerned: your race, height, weight, or other physical/ethnic characteristics; your gender and/or gender assigned at birth; your BDSM experience level (as long as you're willing to listen and learn). I'm 420- and alcohol-friendly but also not judgmental of sober folks -- most of the people I hang out with are sober and I rarely drink. Things I do care about: safer sex and your STI status, your understanding of consent and boundaries, that you won't judge me for my heinous taste in television, my crazy-dog-person status, or the fact that I've re-read The Dresden Files like seven times in 2018 alone, or that I'm really, really into professional wrestling Someone who is just careful with me and sweet, and doesn't think constantly pushing boundaries is appropriate or correct. Who trusts that I know myself and my own limits, but also pays attention to how I react and errs on the edge of caution unless we decide otherwise. Who isn't afraid to ask the awkward questions and have the weird conversations. Someone who understands not just the what, but the why. Someone who's proud of me. But most importantly, somebody I can care about and be emotionally invested in, and truly consider a friend/loved one, and vice versa. Thanks for your time "

A passionate, skilled, strict and caring Master seeks his forever slave (online at first)",1,aiubcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/aiubcm/m4f25m4f_you_will_give_me_your_heart_and_your/,2019-01-23 12:33:22,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. Let's start with some definitions slave: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. Dominant: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. Master/slave relationship: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. What will this relationship consist of: Active submission: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. Daily controls: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. Daily tasks: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. Weekly sessions: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. Punishments: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. What will be expected of you: Commitment: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. Devotion: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. Communication: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. Trust: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. Emotional intimacy: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. Physical intimacy: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. What you can expect from me: A Strong Hand: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. A Warm Heart: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. If you're interested Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

I am a lot more than my kinky side. I have a good career (as a lawyer), a good social life, healthy interests and I think I make a good conversationalist. You are just as likely to find me in the stands of a football match as you are finding me watching a musical. I read a lot and have a nerdy side. I challenge myself often and regularly, especially to try new experiences, from traveling to new places to trying new food to bungee jumping (highly recommend!). I have been in D/s relationships for over a decade at this point. I know what I want and I am looking for someone who can make me happy. In return, I will hopefully make you just as happy. My focus is on psychological control and play, holding you accountable to tasks and rules in a strict manner. I have high expectations but also make sure that meeting them will be rewarded well. I do have a paternal side as well, caring for those that are mine, but it's fair to say that my main focus is on the stricter and darker sides of dominance. When I say I want to probe your mind, I am not just using a phrase. I ask a lot of questions, often ones that you may not have been asked in that form before. I don't care for small talk. I want to get to real you, the one you have not shared with anyone, not your family, friends or your ex boyfriends. I want to get to know the scared, insecure girl hidden within the darkness of your mind, who craves to be owned completely. I believe beautiful dominance can have a lot of benefit to the life of a submissive in need of structure. Structure can help you lead a better life, being healthier, being more thoughtful and kind to others around you, being a better student or worker, being happier. A lot of us have this emptiness inside of us, the thing that makes us lay awake at night wondering if there is something missing. I believe that by bringing out the best in you, I can fill that emptiness with love, adoration, respect and obedience. I have many kinks and am very open-minded. Even if our kinks do not match 100%, we should have no problem enjoying ourselves. Here is a list: [URL In general, my main focus is more on the control of the relationship in general rather than one specific kink. I enjoy TPE or at least getting close to it, controlling various aspects of your life, the more the better. Obviously things start slow. I want to get to know you fully first, I will not rush into a relationship. In order to take as much control as I want, it takes time. And it takes time for you to trust me too, to open up about your desires, to be vulnerable and let your walls down. I am not someone who expects that right away, but I always push steadily and deeper. Given the nature of this and the focus on the mind, I am also happy to start online if you live elsewhere. I love traveling, so I have no issue with distance, though obviously it would be easier if you were in the UK. I am also on the East Coast of the US regularly though. I don't really have a type, except of what I described above. I want someone willing to explore this, willing to open up over time. I tend to enjoy feminine girls, who are not afraid to be themselves. Whether that is a confident woman in a stressful career or an insecure, needy girl who just wants to find a purpose. Obviously there are a lot more variations and I am happy to hear which one you are. So tell me about yourself."
446,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] To share your weakness is to make yourself vulnerable. To make yourself vulnerable is to show your strength.,1,ak165g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/ak165g/30_m4f_to_share_your_weakness_is_to_make_yourself/,2019-01-27 01:15:07,"I admit, I think about that quote far too often. Nonetheless, vulnerability is at the center of what this dynamic should be. One cannot submit without first being vulnerable. To share your weaknesses, to share your dreams, goals, insecurities, fears, darkest thoughts with a partner, and know that he will be there no matter, not judging for anything that you have shared. Vulnerability is not easy. Nothing worth doing is easy. But it's crucial as a stepping stone to submission. The second half of the quote is just as important as the first half. When you show vulnerability, is not a weakness. You show strengths by being vulnerable, by submitting. I don't want a doormat, but I want someone who submits with her head held high. Submission is a gift that you do not give to just anyone. You have a hard time finding a Dom worth respecting, I suspect. Most Doms don't get the subtleties of control and dominance. They focus too much on dominating your mind and do not focus enough on your mind and emotions. I am a 30 year old man, living in the DC area, where I work in a government position (don't worry, not a Trump fan). I have been involved with D/s for near a decade now, with several long term relationships on and offline, with a wide variety of dynamics, from strict TPE to more paternal DD/lg, and everything in-between. I have an active social life, mostly spent with a great smaller group of friends. The rest of my free time is spent in nature or in front of a computer. I love to swim, love to hike and enjoy video games. I would love to find someone who shares more than just her kinky with me, who has similar interests and hobbies. Speaking of interests, I am interested in many topics, movies, books, TV, politics, psychology, philosophy and more. When it comes to D/s relationships, I am strict, firm, creative and open-minded. No kink you have will shock me and I will be eager to make your fantasies become a reality. I focus a lot on dominance outside the bedroom, enjoying control in every aspect of life, beyond just sexually. Personality-wise, I am organized, driven, focused and calm. I plan things to the smallest detail and you will often find me making lists to improve my efficiency. I have found that this side of me works especially well in D/s relationships as well, where I can help improve your life and productivity, motivating you to be better than you have been on your own. I am looking for someone to spend my day with, to talk to and get to know, to explore our minds together. Someone with a personality, who is able to hold a conversation, knows how to ask the right kinds of questions and who feels like something is missing in their lives. Maybe it is a sense of direction or maybe it is missing someone to whisper filthy things in your ear. I am open to both long distance and local. I enjoy taking my time and getting to know someone well. Will you allow yourself to be vulnerable? I am waiting."
447,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,46(M4F) - I found the perfect sub! She's just waiting to reply! ;),1,al1did,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/al1did/46m4f_i_found_the_perfect_sub_shes_just_waiting/,2019-01-30 02:57:04,"Hello there. I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games until all hours. (For the Horde!) - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. - Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. - Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. - Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting. - Obedience and compliance, as well as meticulous control and attention is what gets me going. - *Extras:* Slut shaming, behavior modification focused degradation/humiliation, body marking, ownership enforcement, etc. **In my perfect world, my submissive partner would be:** - Based here in the US, preferably in the east coast for timezone purposes. - Between 25-50 years old. - Available *sometime* within my available weekday hours (7a-7p EST) - Highly attentive and communicative. - Looking to live our long distance/separate lives together as much as we possibly can. Not confining ourselves to specific areas of sharing our lives together but opening up every facet of our lives to one another over time and trust. - Excited by the idea of mutual obsession, infatuation, and utter devotion. - Experienced OR actively learning and reading to gain more experience. - A strong speaker with high expectations for command of the English language . - Witty, dry sarcasm, dark humor are all a plus (please don't drown me in your lol's. I'll admit I am a sucker for a good placed GIF though). - Emotionally available. - Married or unmarried, tethered or untethered is irrelevant. Must be transparent with me and my expectation is some degree of monogamy even if you are in a LTR or married at some point. I'm not looking to be #3 in your rotation. To clarify further, in a long term concept with someone who is also married/in a LTR, I'm not looking for either of us to be in a relationship (physical or emotional) with anyone outside of each other and our respective partners. **Communication:** - Hangouts (text, voice/video calls), emails, Kik, snail mail (PO box -- I'm not that insane), or in person. I've posted here before and met some amazing people, but ultimately long term wise, it hasn't lasted to what I've wanted. If you aren't interested in having deep conversations or in writing detailing responses, please don't bother to reach out to me. Include a name or alias that isn't your screen name, A/S/L, communication preferences, and precisely what in this post moved you to reach out. Thank you. "

You suddenly feel helpless and exhilarated. You reflexively beg for mercyreally beg. But you want more. You need more. You expose your fear, making your suffering your gift to me, showing me your vulnerability, letting me explore the deep nuances of your physical and psychic pain. I give you more. So much more. First you feel them and then you see them. The marks on your body. You see the red and purple marks. They grow, become splotchy, uneven, with a dark red center. They are my marks. They show my ownership. You wear them with pride and part of you wants everyone to know, but you know that it's our secret. You feel them throughout the day, the dull aches and the searing sting. You feel them whenever you want to be reminded that you are mine. You feel them every time you sit down or move a certain way. Sometimes it feels good to touch the places that hurt, to soothe them. Finally, you gasp and moan and your hips writhe when I allow you to feel pleasure. My touch is different now. I massage the hot flesh and whisper, ""You are such a good girl. Such a pretty, obedient girl. I am so happy you are mine."" I kiss the tear away from your cheek. I want you to join me in an online kink relationship that embodies this scenario, in which I am your Dominant and you are my submissive. l want to take you to that psychic edge and linger there with you. The edge where you lose yourself in the intense intimacy of pain. Where the boundaries between us disappear. Where each increment in your sweet agony takes us further inside one another. I want to feel the power that comes when I immerse myself in your vulnerability and loss of control. I will penetrate you in every way: your mind, your body, your emotions. Your spirit. I will break them all and make them mine. You read this and you feel it. You know you are different. You know deep in your soul that I could be the man whose desire to hurt you is the only way to realize your darkest shadow desires. To be fully yourself. And now the only way forward is for you to follow me to dark, forbidden places. I await your response."

Im laying in bed after watching half blood prince for the gazillionth time, and all I can think about it how much Id rather be doing a meaningful task for somebody that means a lot to me. Theres just that crazy amount of satisfaction that comes from over achieving. Not just for anybody though, from someone that I give everything to; all my strengths and all my weakness and all my fear and vulnerability. Theres nothing quite like doing something difficult and being rewarded with a good girl. # About me: Hi. Im a boredlittleprincess. By day, I tackle problems and tell people what to do. By night, I don tights and a cape and punch up the good guys (coz being a villain is SO much cooler). Im your entirely average 24 year old female friendly neighbourhood submissive, only GOD do I hate spiders. Which sucks for me, living in Australia. I have a terribly dark sense of humour, which quite frequently gets me into hot water. I think Im kinda funny, in a dad-joke, roll your eyes and giggle kind of way. I am educated and I have a full time job and no children that I am aware of unless one fell out of me when I was asleep and crawled off into the wilderness or something. In which case, I hope it inherited its fathers sense of direction. I am verbose and I love to read. I love science fiction movies and books. I love to cook and am a proud vegan (dont worry I wont shove my beliefs down your throat, I promise). I love rock climbing and hiking and the snow and being outdoors. I love video games and enjoy playing my switch. Looks wise Im petite, quite thin but I think I have some booty and lil tiddies. I am a big mixed bag of ethnicities and Im very proud to have a cultural background. I work out regularly but I dont eat as often as I should. Working on it. Its all well and good to say the good things but most important is the vulnerability. The most important person in the world once said to me, I see all of you, and I love all of you. Id like to find that again. I had a turbulent upbringing with a mentally unstable mother, and I have been through my own trauma, which in turn, has made me fragile. I guess you could say I have mommy issues. I suffer from anxiety and depression and an eating disorder, however I actively attend therapy and am working on being healthier. Im extremely clingy and self destructive and Ill second guess everything and doing myself over and over. Again, Im working on this too. # About you: Be Loki. If you cant be Loki, then be star lord. Ok ok ok. Just be yourself. I like honest people. You need to be patient. Preferably male, although I kissed a girl once and that made me all kinds of tingly. Im attracted to intelligence and passion. Turn on my brain and Ill melt. I like guys that know what they want and know how to get it. Naturally dominant so that I fall into line. I tend to be a brat so I need a firm, yet loving, hand. Be interesting. Make me want to be more interesting to impress you. Have interests and hobbies and share them with me. I want to know everything and be involved. I take pride in my physical appearance and Id hope that youre the same; well groomed and a moderate level of fitness are a plus. You dont need to be an Adonis, but if you cant out run me then how will you ever catch me? # What Im looking for: A relationship of some description. Im flexible. Im not sure if Im poly... I think I might be... Id like it to have mostly vanilla dynamic with some D/s daddy/little flavour sprinkled in there. Not ALL the time, Im a regular human too... but enough to keep it interesting and to scratch my itch to please you. Think... coffee dates only Im wearing the outfit you picked out for me, and I know that when we go home Ive earned ten spanks for poking my tongue out at you. Id like someone I can trust and that trusts me in return, so I can be my true self, bad parts and all, and be completely looked after, cherished and loved, as I will love you in return. I hope youre out there, I dont bite!"

455,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,24 [F4M] Australia/Online Sub looking for blue eyes white dragon... but I guess a Dom will do!,1,amzpmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/amzpmm/24_f4m_australiaonline_sub_looking_for_blue_eyes/,2019-02-04 19:25:33,"Its past midnight on an early Monday morning. Im laying in bed after watching half blood prince for the gazillionth time, and all I can think about it how much Id rather be doing a meaningful task for somebody that means a lot to me. Theres just that crazy amount of satisfaction that comes from over achieving. Not just for anybody though, from someone that I give everything to; all my strengths and all my weakness and all my fear and vulnerability. Theres nothing quite like doing something difficult and being rewarded with a good girl. # About me: Hi. Im a boredlittleprincess. By day, I tackle problems and tell people what to do. By night, I don tights and a cape and punch up the good guys (coz being a villain is SO much cooler). Im your entirely average 24 year old female friendly neighbourhood submissive, only GOD do I hate spiders. Which sucks for me, living in Australia. I have a terribly dark sense of humour, which quite frequently gets me into hot water. I think Im kinda funny, in a dad-joke, roll your eyes and giggle kind of way. I am educated and I have a full time job and no children that I am aware of unless one fell out of me when I was asleep and crawled off into the wilderness or something. In which case, I hope it inherited its fathers sense of direction. I am verbose and I love to read. I love science fiction movies and books. I love to cook and am a proud vegan (dont worry I wont shove my beliefs down your throat, I promise). I love rock climbing and hiking and the snow and being outdoors. I love video games and enjoy playing my switch. Looks wise Im petite, quite thin but I think I have some booty and lil tiddies. I am a big mixed bag of ethnicities and Im very proud to have a cultural background. I work out regularly but I dont eat as often as I should. Working on it. Its all well and good to say the good things but most important is the vulnerability. The most important person in the world once said to me, I see all of you, and I love all of you. Id like to find that again. I had a turbulent upbringing with a mentally unstable mother, and I have been through my own trauma, which in turn, has made me fragile. I guess you could say I have mommy issues. I suffer from anxiety and depression and an eating disorder, however I actively attend therapy and am working on being healthier. Im extremely clingy and self destructive and Ill second guess everything and doing myself over and over. Again, Im working on this too. # About you: Be Loki. If you cant be Loki, then be star lord. Ok ok ok. Just be yourself. I like honest people. You need to be patient. Preferably male, although I kissed a girl once and that made me all kinds of tingly. Im attracted to intelligence and passion. Turn on my brain and Ill melt. I like guys that know what they want and know how to get it. Naturally dominant so that I fall into line. I tend to be a brat so I need a firm, yet loving, hand. Be interesting. Make me want to be more interesting to impress you. Have interests and hobbies and share them with me. I want to know everything and be involved. I take pride in my physical appearance and Id hope that youre the same; well groomed and a moderate level of fitness are a plus. You dont need to be an Adonis, but if you cant out run me then how will you ever catch me? # What Im looking for: A relationship of some description. Im flexible. Im not sure if Im poly... I think I might be... Id like it to have mostly vanilla dynamic with some D/s daddy/little flavour sprinkled in there. Not ALL the time, Im a regular human too... but enough to keep it interesting and to scratch my itch to please you. Think... coffee dates only Im wearing the outfit you picked out for me, and I know that when we go home Ive earned ten spanks for poking my tongue out at you. Id like someone I can trust and that trusts me in return, so I can be my true self, bad parts and all, and be completely looked after, cherished and loved, as I will love you in return. I hope youre out there, I dont bite! "

A passionate, skilled, strict and caring Master seeks his forever slave (online at first)",1,aoall4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/aoall4/25m4f_you_will_give_me_your_heart_and_your_soul/,2019-02-08 11:16:41,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you**: *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me**: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

Goals come in all shapes and sizes, but, often the completion of one goal sets in motion the ability to set and complete goals you never thought were possible. As alluring as it is to post a shopping list of kinks and qualities I want in a person I find that it doesn't always yield something substantial. My goal is to build chemistry and trust. To build a friendship and relationship that allows for vulnerability. It is important for me to be someone who makes a positive impact on your life. I am someone who is empathetic and able to assist in healing or overcoming fears. If you have had trouble recently or in the past and need to try to find a way forward I am not afraid to support you. Perhaps you need stability or have urges that you need to act upon in the right situation. I want us both to satisfy our needs. No matter what your situation I encourage you to take a chance and see what happens. I always find it is better to find out and know rather than stay unsure. I am a proponent of being blunt and upfront. Limits and consent are something that are very important to me. I want our interaction to be in a manner that is safe and fulfilling. Ultimately, it is up to you how much you are willing to submit and give. I want to provide an environment that you feel able to give everything and show your vulnerability. I am open minded and willing to give as much as is given. **About me** I am a 29 year old working and living in DFW. I currently work in emergency medicine and will be attending a post graduate school next year. I enjoy helping people and working in the community. My free time is usually spent attempting to maintain a decent sleep schedule. When I'm failing at that I'm running/lifting, playing videogames, goofing around with my dogs. I recently ran the half marathon in Dallas. I do realize physical attractiveness is a factor and am more than willing to show myself to someone I trust. I am 6'2, 220, White, and in good shape. I have great people skills, can work a room, and enjoy working with others. I do however need time alone and see the necessity of it. I listen well and am often the person my friends call when things are not going well. If you made it through my post and are inspired to start talking I welcome you to tell me whatever comes to mind.

I am experienced in this type of arraignment and have found great success in bringing the best out of the girls I have brought low before me. I will become personally invested in your life, and do all I can to help you achieve your goals. If you have me as your owner, you will also have me as your friend. You'll have someone who is passionate about you. Someone who supports you, and understands you. I will always be in your corner. I'll care and be concerned about you. I'll be there for you, at any time of day or night. I'll be your champion, I'll always have confidence in you. You will have someone who is there for you. This relationship will be primarily goal oriented. We will identify areas in your life that need to be improved, and we will together form realistic action plans to tackle those areas together. You will always have a voice, and play an intimate role in forming these plans. Your progress will be tracked in detail, and you will be held accountable for everything we discuss. I am not easy to serve. I will take complete control and demand absolute obedience, vulnerability and respect. Your clothing, food, schedule exercise, grooming, your whole private life will be mine to mold as I decide is pleasing to me and best for you. You will be an object for my pleasure, and I will use you as such, as I see fit. Every inch of you will be mine to see, mine to mold, mine to hurt, mine to pleasure. You will be humiliated, degraded and embarrassed because it pleases me. Your most intimate moments will be shared with me You will be utterly and totally mine. The price is high, but I will not let you down. I will bring organization and accountability to your life. I will actively encourage you and support you. I will make myself available and present to you. I will bring confidence to you when you lack it in yourself, joy to you when you feel down, motivation when you can't find your own. I will celebrate in your successes and share in your failures. It may not be an easy road, the path to improvement and success rarely is, and being my slave will make it harsher and crueler at times. But, I promise, stay on your knees for me, and I will get you where you need to be. When you falter, you will be disciplined, and it will be hard. It will be pure punishment. My focus is creating an experience so unpleasant you will improve your behavior so you do not revisit that place again. During your punishments, you will be humiliated, degraded and stripped in front of me. You will be brought low and scolded on your knees. Along with personally directed and severe spankings/beatings, cornertime, lines, scoldings, loss of privileges, and other physical and non-physical punishments will also be used. All of these punishments will be done safely, with your well-being in the forefront of my mind. Your hard limits will not be used, and your soft limits only used when a serious offense has occurred. Always expect generous and bountiful aftercare. Let me be clear, while I will punish you every single time you deserve it, my end goal is not to punish you. You will find me more than fair and understanding. There will always be an in-depth conversation before a punishment occurs. And while I am strict, and will not let you get away with much at all, I understand sometimes, situations do not call for discipline, but just support and kindness . My end goal is to punish you less and less as time goes on. I want to see you become the person you want to be and I want to celebrate the service and devotion you give me. I'm only looking for one slave at the moment, as I wish to put a great amount of time into you. If you think you might be interested, I'd love a message so we can talk. Thank you for reading."

All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship:* So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission:* What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls:* At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks:* Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions:* I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments:* Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you:** *Commitment:* Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion:* I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication:* Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust:* Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy:* When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy:* Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me:** *A Strong Hand:* As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart:* But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

I am experienced in this type of arraignment and have found great success in bringing the best out of the girls I have brought low before me. I will become personally invested in your life, and do all I can to help you achieve your goals. If you have me as your owner, you will also have me as your friend. You'll have someone who is passionate about you. Someone who supports you, and understands you. I will always be in your corner. I'll care and be concerned about you. I'll be there for you, at any time of day or night. I'll be your champion, I'll always have confidence in you. You will have someone who is there for you. This relationship will be primarily goal oriented. We will identify areas in your life that need to be improved, and we will together form realistic action plans to tackle those areas together. You will always have a voice, and play an intimate role in forming these plans. Your progress will be tracked in detail, and you will be held accountable for everything we discuss. I am not easy to serve. I will take complete control and demand absolute obedience, vulnerability and respect. Your clothing, food, schedule exercise, grooming, your whole private life will be mine to mold as I decide is pleasing to me and best for you. You will be an object for my pleasure, and I will use you as such, as I see fit. Every inch of you will be mine to see, mine to mold, mine to hurt, mine to pleasure. You will be humiliated, degraded and embarrassed because it pleases me. Your most intimate moments will be shared with me You will be utterly and totally mine. The price is high, but I will not let you down. I will bring organization and accountability to your life. I will actively encourage you and support you. I will make myself available and present to you. I will bring confidence to you when you lack it in yourself, joy to you when you feel down, motivation when you can't find your own. I will celebrate in your successes and share in your failures. It may not be an easy road, the path to improvement and success rarely is, and being my slave will make it harsher and crueler at times. But, I promise, stay on your knees for me, and I will get you where you need to be. When you falter, you will be disciplined, and it will be hard. It will be pure punishment. My focus is creating an experience so unpleasant you will improve your behavior so you do not revisit that place again. During your punishments, you will be humiliated, degraded and stripped in front of me. You will be brought low and scolded on your knees. Along with personally directed and severe spankings/beatings, cornertime, lines, scoldings, loss of privileges, and other physical and non-physical punishments will also be used. All of these punishments will be done safely, with your well-being in the forefront of my mind. Your hard limits will not be used, and your soft limits only used when a serious offense has occurred. Always expect generous and bountiful aftercare. Let me be clear, while I will punish you every single time you deserve it, my end goal is not to punish you. You will find me more than fair and understanding. There will always be an in-depth conversation before a punishment occurs. And while I am strict, and will not let you get away with much at all, I understand sometimes, situations do not call for discipline, but just support and kindness . My end goal is to punish you less and less as time goes on. I want to see you become the person you want to be and I want to celebrate the service and devotion you give me. I'm only looking for one slave at the moment, as I wish to put a great amount of time into you. If you think you might be interested, I'd love a message so we can talk. Thank you for reading."
465,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"25[M4F] Seeking an online submissive to love, guide, discipline, enjoy, use, and actively care for. Will you give me your devotion? Your mind, body, heart, and soul?",1,a8h6gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/a8h6gq/25m4f_seeking_an_online_submissive_to_love_guide/,2018-12-22 13:53:58,"Everyone is screwed up, broken, clingy, and scared- Ann Lamont Saw that quote as a headline, and I guess it seemed an appropriate way to begin this personal. And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

I'm interested in meeting a kinky or kink-curious, emotionally available, kind man for cute dates and (possible) sexy times.... and seeing where that takes us, yeah? Also: I'm queer and poly and lean toward ethical non-monogamy, so ideally you'd be flexible towards that. I love art museums, dive bars, indie movie theatres, punk shows, and any media that makes me step back and reassess the world around me. (I listen to a LOT of therapy and sexual health podcasts, and write a LOT of romance fiction, so that's pretty much all you need to know about me) But I digress... I'm 22 years old, tough, tender, and tiny. In all relationships, I'm devoted. Sharp as a whip. I'm curvy, petite in the chest and thick in the booty (where it counts, let's be real), short hair, tattooed, vaguely goth. Think Lena Dunham but 10x cuter and 1000x sweeter. In bed, I have heavily submissive leanings and would love to find a dude with dominant/Dom leanings. I'm into: patience, enthusiastic consent, emotional vulnerability, compassion, open-mindedness, affectionate cruelty, being appreciated beyond my body (and what I can accomplish with it), learning new things, trying new things, sessions that last entire afternoons, frank yet sensitive communication, feeling special, and being special. I also love The Office more than anything in this world. You: 25-45 (ideally late 20's, early thirties) residing in the city of Chicago and able to host. You're able to express yourself emotionally and be vulnerable; you seek this in others. You're kinky as fuck, ideally, and understand that a scene is nothing without mutual trust, safety, and open communication. You're a sadist, hedonist, a Daddy Dom, or a whole other combination of archetypes who love affectionate, firm, uplifting, consensual cruelty. I'd love to know more about you. What makes you tick? What are you passionate about? What are your values? What makes you curious, in and out of the bedroom? *** IMPORTANT*** Please PM me if interested - and only PM. If you leave a comment, Kik me, Fetlife me, show up at my house... you're going to be blocked. Also, photos in first message are ideal (but, you know, privacy - I get it!). Other things that will get you immediately and gleefully blocked:  You don't live in Chicago (the city proper)  You cannot host (this is a big one)  You have zero kink experience  You send me a dick pic  You wax poetic about your dick ()  You're creepy and/or overly graphic and/or objectify me in your messages ps: ONCE AGAIN, NO DICK PICS.

If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave:* The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant:* There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent.

I'm 31 and currently live in California. So here I am, finally posting on reddit. The idea of power exchange, or role reversal, can come off as a little out there in normal dating scenarios, however on some BDSM type sites its almost looked down on as being too ""vanilla"". I'm not looking to have a girl kick me in the balls, or hang me upside down and just whip the shit out of me. Hahaa. (Although I've never experienced it before, so who knows). What I do like, is a girl who is assertive and likes to be in control. I like the feeling of vulnerability and being at the mercy of another person. Although I've never done it, I also like the idea of wrestling/struggling (which I guess borders consensual non-consent). And of course, pegging. There are few things hotter than watching a girl get into being the dominant one; turned on from being in control. If this sounds remotely like something you are interested in, shoot me a PM and ask any questions you may have. Willing to exchange pics, as well. "

Maybe youre struggling in school and consumed with existential dread about your career prospects. Maybe youre feeling conflicted about dark sexual urges you cant seem to avoid. Maybe youre trapped in a toxic relationship you just cant get out of. Or maybe something else altogether. Whatever the reason, you know you need help. You feel lost and you yearn for someone you can trust to help you get your life together. I can give you the support and direction that you need. I can provide you with the discipline and support that it will take to create a life that you find satisfying. This will not happen quickly. You will have to open yourself up to me and share some real emotional vulnerability. I may need to break you down more completely before I can build you back up into what you should be. But eventually I can help you become more content and satisfied with your life. My name is David. Im 32 and I live in SF near Union Square. I am looking for a local sub although our interaction will be mostly online. Im not going to list details of exactly what will happen between us, as our dynamic will depend on your personality and needs.

You see the red and purple marks of my ownership. You feel them throughout the day, the dull aches and the searing sting. You feel them whenever you want to be reminded that you are mine. You feel them every time you sit down or move a certain way. Sometimes it feels good to touch the places that hurt, to soothe them. You sweat and your heart beats faster every time you find an instrument that I ask for, wondering what my plan is for it. You use it as I instruct, going further than you thought you could. You gasp and your hips writhe when I finally allow your hand to seek pleasure underneath your clothes. I am not there physically, but the sensations are intense, real, truly painful; the pleasure, when I allow it, is deeply intimate and raw. The pain and the pleasure cut to your core.

I have good experience, and consider myself a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy control, instructing, and teaching someone about the darker pleasures. Newbies are ok. I tilt a little more towards the BD than SM as I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. In particular Im skilled with rope play, and love bondage, exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. Im the kind that needs some connection. Let's face it, we all have that secret yearning that cannot be easily ignored, and wants to come out with a safe and trusted person. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, finding peak physical pleasures and new ways to unlock myself and others. I am single. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads.

If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave:* The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant:* There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship:* So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission:* What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls:* At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks:* Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions:* I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments:* Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you:** *Commitment:* Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion:* I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication:* Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust:* Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy:* When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy:* Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me:** *A Strong Hand:* As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart:* But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there.

Early last year, I began my exploration into my submissive side. The experience was just a few months, but during that time I felt centered and learned so much more about myself. I had a really successful 2018 professionally, and I think that was at least partially driven by my further development of ""self."" So for 2019, I want to continue to learn about the dimensions inside me that form who I am. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I'm a pretty successful gal--I've got a graduate degree (MD), I own a house, I got power tools for Christmas. I am more than equipped to take care of myself. From the outside looking in, I think most people would think that I want to be in control in all aspects of my life... But little do they know, I want to be good, to please someone, to be taken care of, and make someone happy (...and get bent over the knee for a good spanking). &amp;#x200B; Physical attributes: I'm 5'9 ish with blond/brownish hair who is thicc ish (was keeping the ish thing going there, but I am decently fit). I have no issues verifying once we talk for a bit. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Things I'm looking for: \-a relationship\* \-good conversation that will make me dig deeper and help me discover more about myself. \-someone who respects me and wants to support me and push me appropriately. &amp;#x200B; Things I am open to but not overtly looking for: \-being a couple's plaything (IRL, not virtual). &amp;#x200B; Things I'm not looking for: \-a sexting partner. I have plenty of those and have a pretty popular account with plenty to sext with. \-someone who is married whose significant other is unaware that they're talking to me... &amp;#x200B; \*I am not necessarily looking for a relationship, but my last BDSM thing was attempted FWB and I'm still not over that almost a year later. I think the amount of trust and vulnerability you have to show in a BDSM relationship makes it hard to separate feelings and I'm not sure I'm ready to attempt that again. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; ANYWAY--love to hear from ya. Learning about other people and why they are the way that they are helps me learn more about me. "

This ad is a bit of a novel. I'm going to try to tell you what you need to know about what I bring to a relationship and what I need from you. **Please read it through if you're going to message me**; I'm writing all this because relationships based on mystery are dumb. I want you to know what you're getting in to with me, and I'll want to know what I'm getting in to with you. Be honest, be direct, and don't lie to me - honesty is critical for me in relationships and I will be gone the instant my partner lies about anything remotely consequential. That being said: if you read this post and you think you're a possible fit, please don't be afraid to send me a message. There are three words buried in the text below, and I will respond to any message sent with them. I know it sucks to message people and not get replies, and I won't leave you hanging (even if you're encountering this ad much later, I do still check this account periodically). To people just reading posts because you think it's sexy (and who could blame you): skip the next section for the fun stuff. I am currently looking for an in-person relationship only. Sorry, folks from elsewhere. # About Me I'm in my late 20s and recently immigrated to the Bay Area. As you might guess from that move, I work for a tech company, although I'm not actually a programmer myself. I spend most of my life with one foot in the programming world where I am somehow the least autistic person in a given room with alarming regularity, one foot in the internet-hugbox world of Steven Universe and MLP fans, one foot in the gaming world I've spent a good chunk of my life hanging out in, and one foot in the world of intellectuals who want to build a utopia on the moon or whatever. I have a lot of metaphorical feet, you see. At my best, I'm talkative, friendly, and enthusiastic. I'm fascinated by many things and I will babble on at length about them until someone shuts me up (see the next section on my kink interests for more on how one might do that...). I know a lot about a lot, because one of my favorite things to do is see familiar things in the light of a new perspective. I'm kind and compassionate, although I am sometimes not very good at actually expressing those things. At my worst, I can be melancholy and withdrawn. I live strongly in the moment, which can make it easy to get stuck in a loop of depression in a bad state for the same reason I can get caught in a loop of excited enthusiasm in a good state. On a very bad day I can lash out in anger, though this is pretty rare and I'll apologize a few hours later and feel like shit about it. I can be self-absorbed when I'm not actively paying attention to keep it in check - it's not a thing I'm proud of, it's just a flaw that takes effort to suppress. On a personal level, I alternate between a very narrow region of familiar comfort and wanting to go off on spontaneous adventure. I'm an anxious person by nature, so I think the key word here is security - I'm fine with new experiences when I can decide to have them and to withdraw if I get spooked. I'm about as liberal as you'd imagine from a Bay Area resident and if you're right of center I genuinely don't think we could be friends even if I wanted to be. I try not to be intrusive about it - I just care about people having certain values (e.g., ""being a jerk to people who are suffering is bad"") that as far as I can tell your average conservative doesn't have. I'm trans, and transitioned many years ago. I know this'll put some folks off, but them's the breaks; not something I can control. I've been on hormones for some five years now with fairly good results; I'm pretty much always read as a woman by others and I've lived with people for quite a while without them realizing on their own that I'm trans. I have not, however, had genital surgery, and if I ever go get it it's still some years away. See below under the pros and cons for more on this. I'm also bisexual, but the specific things I like from a dom lead me to favor men particularly for that role (I'm not closed to women, though). The first of the key words is ""lemon"". I'm also conceivably open to poly arrangements, although I wouldn't label myself as explicitly polyamorous in the sense of seeking them out. # Kink and Sex I grew up in a fundamentalist household. Obviously I left that mindset quite a while ago - wouldn't be here if I hadn't! - but at some level, it set some things in my head at a lizard-brain level. Since that's where sexuality lives, I'm a bit weird. Both romantically and sexually, I want some degree of traditional gender roles in play in my relationship. I am not a sexist, and I don't want my partner to be one either...to most people. This is my compromise to myself: in public, in politics, and in my personal dealings I'll stick with my intellectual belief in equality, but at the end of the day I know what some parts of me want. In short, what I am looking for is a partner - presumably a man - who has the same conflict. I want someone who wants, on an emotional/sexual level, to feel in charge, to have an obedient, soft woman at your side, to impose your masculine will on her. I also want someone who at some level feels bad about that, and who would never implement it without consent. I want to be the channel through which you can let those needs loose, to enjoy yourself as a human being with stupid irrational needs without imposing it on someone unwilling. The second of the key words in my profile is ""lime"". I want to be seen as your inferior, to be gently condescended to, to be patted on the head and told ""that's nice, dear"", to be objectified to some extent. And in return, I want to look up to you, to embrace a natural need to please and be approved of, to blush and obey. A lot of this is normal D/S but the gendered nature of it is particularly important to me. While I'm unfortunately not capable of it, I find pregnancy a very exciting idea along the same lines. There aren't many images more sexy to me than imagining my husband looking at a heavily-pregnant me, knowing that he's conquered me inside and out, that I've willingly made my body reshape around his will. It's not just sexy, either - it's comforting and warm and cheerful, like a warm blanket in front of a fire on a cold night. I hate the term itself, but the hucow sub is on my personal porn multi-reddit for a reason! This isn't just a bedroom thing to me, although obviously public expressions of it have to be limited to some extent. I want it to be a private part of the relationship that is most present in sexual settings, but to be part of the relationship at all times at some level. On the modern-relationship to 50s-housewife scale, think something like 20-80 in private to 75-25 in public. I'm not a sadist (well, maybe I am one a little? that's a recent discovery, still working on that). For me, D/S is much more about *status* than it is about pain or power. Gentle condescension and a guiding hand go a lot further with me than humiliation most of the time, though I can be in to the latter in a sexual enough mood. I like praise and support for embracing an inferior role as opposed to a ""look at you, you're such an inferior whorecuntslut"" or whatever. I have, unsurprisingly, a more general interest in other kink. In no particular order, I like: * Transformation: For presumably obvious reasons this is a big one for me, although it's obviously hard to go beyond fantasy with it. I fantasized about changing sex before I transitioned, and today I'm a fan of animal transformations as well, both partial and total. * Hypnosis: Again, probably obvious from what I've written so far. It's all about the halfway loss of control to me: knowing what's changed, knowing how I'm being manipulated/led but feeling the need to follow along anyway. I like to resist and lose, basically. I don't think I've ever gotten into a proper 100% trance the way some people talk about, it's usually more an altered frame of mind and a sense of 'playing along'. But after enough of that, I did see some actual effects from a previous partner, so there's *something* there. * Pet play: Ohhhhh yes. Put me in a kennel on the floor and lock me in, oh please oh please oh please. For me, this is a 'soft' kink; it's about embarrassment, vulnerability, and praise-in-subservience. Again, there's a line between being warmly humiliated and being degraded in my head; the best I can do is ""oh, look at you, you're so happy in your place with &lt;X embarrassing/role-signalling attribute, e.g. collar, pregnant belly, etc&gt;"" is comforting and hot, ""you worthless slut"" is not. * Restraining: I think I like this one. Certainly I like the idea of being tied up and helpless. But I've never gotten to try it in person beyond just wearing a collar. I'm pretty sure it's a like, though. * Some degree of...I dunno what to call it. ""Sister-subbing""? I've never done this, but I actually find the idea of another submissive woman guiding me to join her under her man incredibly exciting. So for you couples, there's one for ya. ...and other stuff, too. I'm weird, if you like a thing, ask; I've left out a few more controversial ones that involve things I like very close to hard ""no""s. In particular, a few things I am not interested in: any toilet-y stuff, actual pain/discomfort/sadism, blood or injury, 'mean' put-downs, and certain kinds of excessively porn-ish talk (I like the role being emphasized, but a lot of 'yeah you're such a slut for cock in your whore hole' sort of things turn me off). Sex itself is still something of a mystery to me. By some measures I'm still a virgin, and the fact that I'm trans and haven't had genital surgery makes the sheer geometry of it difficult to me. I focus my sexuality on kink, and I think for the moment I'd probably do best with a partner who does as well. # Pros &amp; Cons of Me as a Partner **Pros** * Enthusiastic: when I like stuff and get over my shyness, I -really- like it. I spend flights excitedly picking out landmarks on a map, bus rides looking with wonder at the horizon, and don't even get me started on real travel to somewhere new. If anything, expect to have to restrain me rather than try to get a response out of me. * Intelligent: there is absolutely no way to say this without ending up on /r/iamverysmart, but...well, I am. I've spent a fair amount of time with some of the smartest people there are, and I don't have trouble keeping up. * Reasonably high sex drive: it's very spiky, some days it'll roar and I'll be goin crazy and sometimes it'll be low. In general, I think my drive is above-average by a decent margin, which I imagine is a pro for most partners. And I do really enjoy my partner's interest in me. * Trainable: An active interest of mine. A big part of the appeal of subbing is finding myself being molded gently into something I wasn't before, with my consent but only partial control over the process (I really like the word 'process'). * Sweet: I'm compassionate and loving and being in a traditionally feminine role is what I want in a relationship. That means me being the heart of the home, being someone who can bring cheerfulness and emotional support. I take a lot of joy in small things, and I am quite easy to make happy when you understand how I tick. * Honest: This is a big one for me, and something I insist on in a partner. I will not lie to you, nor will I betray your trust in other ways. The fact that anyone ever lies about significant things in a romantic relationship still amazes me. Trust is king in all romantic relationships, and losing it pretty much instantly kills them, at least for me. * Flexible: This goes with honesty. If you want to do something with me, bring it up. I may (depending on the bounds of the relationship) say no or not be interested, but I'm hard to offend and open to new interests. **Cons** * Emotionally chaotic: My recent move to the Bay coincides with a huge improvement in my life circumstances. The last couple of years went really, really badly for me, and I got to see what I'm like on my worst day. While things are a lot better now and seem to be stable for the foreseeable future, I still have a lot of emotional work to do. My moods swing around quite a bit, and I'm still learning to manage depressive and anxious tendencies. * Not very attractive: I've got an alright face and breasts and pass just fine, but I'm quite overweight. This is a thing I'm open to working on, but something my current willpower has not been able to get to with everything else going on. Weight aside, I'm not ugly, but I'm not a stunner either; there are probably better-looking girls out there if that's a primary goal for you. * Low-motivation: This is a weird one. With accountability, I find it pretty easy to do certain things. It's not at all hard for me to work all day at work, for example. But when I come home, I can find it difficult to put even an hour into something that isn't immediately urgent/doesn't have an immediate payoff. This is one place where having a dom is just straight up practical for me, because I am really bad at self-directing. * Sexual handups: It's just really hard for me to have actual sex satisfyingly. Anxieties notwithstanding, I'm happy to suck a dick at will, I'm happy to be touched, but being reluctant to do anal + not having the vagina I'd rather makes this awkward. In general, I fit better with people looking for kink over straight-up sex. **Mixed/Depends On Partner** * Shy: I'm hesitant to do new things and still quite self-conscious. This can be a pro if you like a girl who is vulnerable and a bit embarrassed by things, or a con if you don't like having to tread carefully. I've gotten better about this with time, and I'm making a conscious effort to be more open and vulnerable, but it's a slow process. * Geeky/weird: I've been a pretty serious gamer in the past, I spend a lot of time learning random things that catch my interest, I'm not great at socializing (I usually get along fine but have trouble going from acquaintance to friend), and I tend to have trouble relating to the average person. The third keyword is ""tomato"". A plus if you have a similar like for interesting details or fun trivia, a con if you just want me to shut up about random geography facts. * Trans: Obviously this is a big personal-preference thing. I don't want the trans aspects of my body particularly emphasized (in particular, I have no interest in ever topping anyone), but if my history as a trans woman appeals to you, that's totally okay. I am less distressed by my current anatomy than most trans women, and I am okay with you enjoying the state of my body as long as you're not particularly interested in emphasizing it with me. * Odd kink list: I'm in to a kind of odd mix of things, I assume because of my weird history. Pro if you're into my various odd likes, con if you're not. * Inexperienced in person: I've been kinky online for forever, but I've only had a handful of sexual encounters in person. Pro if you like exploration/teaching, con if you want someone who is already fully comfortable with sex. # What I'm After * Generally left-ish politics. Because I have no tolerance at all for 'global' misogyny, and because the relationship I'm looking for is, let's face it, kind of misogynistic, it's very important that I be able to trust that you seeing me as an inferior is *not* reflecting on women in general (even if we play that it does sometimes). I have an interest in politics and it'd be nice if you did too. * Trustworthiness: Absolutely 100% essential. If I do not trust you, I will not commit to a relationship with you, because I cannot be vulnerable enough to have my needs met. This isn't just not lying, it's understanding what ways I can be taken control of and how far that control can be taken. Occasional missteps are one thing, but being pushed too far makes me close up quickly. * Broadly clean-shaven-ish appearance: Despite my politics and background, I still have a lot of the culture of my upbringing. Tattoos and heavy piercings are major turn-offs, and smoking/drug use (beyond perhaps occasional legal pot) is a hard 'no'. I'm not super picky about weight, although my ideal is certainly a lot closer to healthy than I'm at myself; some degree of fitness would be nice but not required. * Personally stable: I am a moody, chaotic person. I need someone who can roll with that, and ideally act as a counterbalance. I am childish in a lot of ways and need a paternal-ish hand, something that I think the sort of man I'm after would generally enjoy giving. * Dominant, but not mean: I want you to take joy (and yes, sexual satisfaction) in taking me under your arm. I want you to look at me and feel proud that I've chosen my place under you, and I want you to encourage me to take that place, with the knowing that me being in a relationship with you is implicit permission to shape me. But for the most part, I'm after encouragement, leading, and gentle conditioning, not abuse. The line is obviously a bit fuzzy, but if your interest is mainly sadistic, I'm not the girl for you. That should do for now. If you got through that whole wall o'text, congratulations. If you think we'd be a good fit, slap me a PM with those three keywords in it and let's talk. Be direct: I'm hard to offend, so tell me what you want ^(what you really really want). And if not - hey, hopefully you found something sexy if you read that much, so you got something out of it!"

I am experienced in this type of arraignment and have found great success in bringing the best out of the girls I have brought low before me. I will become personally invested in your life, and do all I can to help you achieve your goals. If you have me as your owner, you will also have me as your friend. You'll have someone who is passionate about you. Someone who supports you, and understands you. I will always be in your corner. I'll care and be concerned about you. I'll be there for you, at any time of day or night. I'll be your champion, I'll always have confidence in you. You will have someone who is there for you. This relationship will be primarily goal oriented. We will identify areas in your life that need to be improved, and we will together form realistic action plans to tackle those areas together. You will always have a voice, and play an intimate role in forming these plans. Your progress will be tracked in detail, and you will be held accountable for everything we discuss. I am not easy to serve. I will take complete control and demand absolute obedience, vulnerability and respect. Your clothing, food, schedule exercise, grooming, your whole private life will be mine to mold as I decide is pleasing to me and best for you. You will be an object for my pleasure, and I will use you as such, as I see fit. Every inch of you will be mine to see, mine to mold, mine to hurt, mine to pleasure. You will be humiliated, degraded and embarrassed because it pleases me. Your most intimate moments will be shared with me You will be utterly and totally mine. The price is high, but I will not let you down. I will bring organization and accountability to your life. I will actively encourage you and support you. I will make myself available and present to you. I will bring confidence to you when you lack it in yourself, joy to you when you feel down, motivation when you can't find your own. I will celebrate in your successes and share in your failures. It may not be an easy road, the path to improvement and success rarely is, and being my slave will make it harsher and crueler at times. But, I promise, stay on your knees for me, and I will get you where you need to be. When you falter, you will be disciplined, and it will be hard. It will be pure punishment. My focus is creating an experience so unpleasant you will improve your behavior so you do not revisit that place again. During your punishments, you will be humiliated, degraded and stripped in front of me. You will be brought low and scolded on your knees. Along with personally directed and severe spankings/beatings, cornertime, lines, scoldings, loss of privileges, and other physical and non-physical punishments will also be used. All of these punishments will be done safely, with your well-being in the forefront of my mind. Your hard limits will not be used, and your soft limits only used when a serious offense has occurred. Always expect generous and bountiful aftercare. Let me be clear, while I will punish you every single time you deserve it, my end goal is not to punish you. You will find me more than fair and understanding. There will always be an in-depth conversation before a punishment occurs. And while I am strict, and will not let you get away with much at all, I understand sometimes, situations do not call for discipline, but just support and kindness . My end goal is to punish you less and less as time goes on. I want to see you become the person you want to be and I want to celebrate the service and devotion you give me. I'm only looking for one slave at the moment, as I wish to put a great amount of time into you. If you think you might be interested, I'd love a message so we can talk. Thank you for reading."

I am 27 years old, bisexual, polyamorous, cis female, and curvy. *Why I'm looking for a Daddy:* I like the vulnerability of being a lg. I like the trust and connection that forms with a Daddy. I like being me 100%. I'm more of a middle than a little so while I love cute stuff like stuffies, playing dress up for Daddy, and things of that nature, I don't care for things like dips, bottles, or pacifiers. I do love things like zoos/museums, juice boxes, and anything/everything that's cute, feminine, or pretty. *What I'm looking for:* I'd like a Daddy Dom who's loving, firm, nurturing, a bit sadistic, and wants to help me be the best I can be. My ultimate goal is to be in service to my Daddy as his submissive, his pet, and one of his favorite toys. I have about 8 years of experience with kink and am seeking a Daddy who has a similar amount or more. My perfect Daddy enjoys all of the cute aspects of DD/lg but also enjoys a deeper power exchange and taking control of a super cute girl who's happy to serve. Some of my favorite kinks include impact play, cnc, DD/lg, D/s, bondage, sensory deprivation, objectification, electrical play. The list goes on and on. Ideally, my Daddy should have the following qualities: consistent and articulate communication, honesty, a desire to guide and improve your counterpart, compassion, humor, flexibility, creativity. To me, this role naturally suggests a lot of care and commitment to each other, as any other D/s dynamic would. This can't be achieved in one night, the trust and open/honest communication have to be developed long before I'd agree to a Daddy/girl relationship. Also, I don't get any satisfaction from casual play so I'm only interested in finding someone who wants a long-term relationship. Oh! I'm also kind of a unicorn. I'd be super happy to join an existing DD/lg family, I really want a sister/brother or two to hang out and play with! **Please note that I'm engaged to a wonderful human being so monogamy and I do not mix well. Daddy must be poly.** :) "
484,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,32 [M4F] A symphony of submission - Dominant chord seeks his final resolution,1,ad5su9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/ad5su9/32_m4f_a_symphony_of_submission_dominant_chord/,2019-01-07 01:01:53,"I. **Prelude** -Sonata form- The introduction begins starkly, coldly, unassumedly - as if the melody, stated subtly in the strings, is unaware it is being performed, being presented. Ambiguous in its tonality, its structure, it wanders with equal parts mystery and invitation, slipping under the radar of the unattuned ear, only offering exactly enough allure to implore the most curious and imaginative to listen on. As a second line joins in imitation, we learn of our main subject. He is a compendium of counterpoint, a chorus of contradiction, a discord of dichotomy. Often cold, distant, reserved to the world - yet infinitely warm, giving, protective of those he holds dear. Polite and proper - yet delectably depraved. The harmony hovers between major and minor - the listener, already, is unsure what they are hearing, yet innately certain that they must follow it. The first theme states itself unexpectedly plainly for such an evocative overture. It is happy, thoughtful, creative, searching, active, quirky, sensitive, light. Rich in texture, warm in harmony, inventive in melody. It follows most of the traditional formulae for such a classical structure and meets the eye as entirely typical - the average listener would surely pass it by and toss the entire work into the overwhelming pile of pieces that had nothing of substance to share. The transition into the secondary material is where the movement truly shines. Suddenly, yet not unsettlingly, the inimitable darkness of the introduction resurfaces with astounding aptitude from the otherwise ordinary primary material. Were it not so masterfully crafted, the listener might think them entirely separate works from entirely different composers - however the maestro at work here seems a master of juxtaposition who has surely wrestled with such diametric deviations for decades. In the blink of an eye, with the very same elements which had only moments ago finished stating the opening material, a wave of tumultuous color washes over the orchestra, sweeping and swelling towards glorious climaxes that seem unearned given how quickly the music has come upon us, yet unquestionably warranted and appropriate - only to pull the sound back at the last turn of phrase, booming brass giving way to whispering woodwinds just when the ear expected an ardent arrival. The most impressive feature of the movement is the effortless ease with which the two exist together without contention or conflict. The music never truly reaches the dynamic heights to which it is clearly capable, yet remains surprisingly satisfying nonetheless. The listener is left moved, changed, shaken - yet in dire need of more. The movement closes in the same unassuming nature with which it began, and a short pause signifies the denouement. The musicians turn their pages silently, almost reverently, so as not to disturb the sacred hush that has enraptured the audience. II. **Mind** -Rondo- Left with craving curiosity from the first movement, the listener is pleasantly surprised to hear the second open with a light, happy scherzo. Overflowing with capricious whim and inventiveness - yet retaining a perspective of depth and solemnity. Effervescent grace notes enhance the melodys already unique and fascinating shape, while frequent and unexpected dissonances, both in tone and timbre, keep the ear on its toes - it is clear the composer is telling us an elaborate and wonderful joke and, furthermore, delighting in the process. The movements inner sections depart briefly from the eccentricity of the main theme. Once effusive, vociferous, passionately lush; once introspective, intense, brilliantly introverted. Each note carries its meaning with purpose - whether a string of highly specific intervals or a vast landscape of less poignant cascades of color. Each return is more pleasing than the next, and the single movement seems an entire symphony of shades, from the esoteric and existential to the noetic and nerdy. The curiosity and creativity of the writing seem truly endless, and as the movement closes with a final suggestive quip, the listener wonders what other worlds the composer may have shown her, had he more time. III. **Heart** -Minuet and Trio- In striking contrast to the calculated, quirky nature of the second movement - with its almost unspoken expectation for subtle subterfuge and imminent innuendo - the third opens with a simple dance. Innocence and purity seem the left and right feet as the music holds us close and holds nothing back. The gestures are intimate, integral, intoxicating, inviting, the harmonies sweet, sweeping, swelling, swaying. With no elaborate instrumentation or clever construction, the music itself is the theme. The musicians play with complete, terrifying sincerity - there is no virtuosity, no technical fireworks, no impressive invention, only raw, beautiful, imperfect humanity. The sacred solemnity of the minuet gives way to a trio nearly bursting with the purest of joys. Utter rapture overtakes the orchestra as almost nave celebrations of absolute ecstasy bounce boundlessly between the walls of the hall. The sheer, contagious splendor of immaculate happiness overcomes the listener to the point of simultaneous laughter and tears. The trio reaches a bubbling climax, and the music returns the listener to the minuet with a most infectious smile and sense of deep peace. A wave of immense, incredible warmth washes over the audience as the movement at last comes to rest. IV. **Body** -Theme and Variations- Only after the sincerity and emotional openness of the third movement can the fourth reveal itself, unlock itself, expose itself. While most other pieces would start with this movement, even with precious, pitiful little introduction, the composer here holds it in highest regard, and has made us earn the right to enjoy its many intricate pleasures and crashing climaxes - a right the listener should aim to take full advantage of as often as practically possible. The theme carries the emotional vulnerability and nakedness into the physical, tactile realm - remnants of the minuet remain ever present throughout. But where the previous music touched on the abstract, the ethereal, here we are grounded immediately in the earthy, the carnal, the visceral, the animal. Soft clarinets coaxing melodic curves give way to pounding percussion carelessly crashing mallet into head, setting every molecule of air in the hall on fire. The variations are a game of contrasts and creativity. All imaginable elements at the composers disposal are used to full effect - from the highest, shrill whimper of the piccolo to the most guttural, low bellow of the tuba - from the painstakingly slow, undulating rhythm with the patience of a saint to the reckless, ravenous, raucous, rabid runs with the abandon of a sinner - from the most gentle, calming caress to the most violent, severe strike - the only unifying feature of the movement seems to be unabashed, unapologetic hedonism in its most depraved, most disturbed state. Each return of the theme seems to suggest a satisfying supposition, but inescapably and inexorably invites the intended into increased improvisation. The movement is often hard to follow. V. **Soul** -Fugue- Divine. Inexpressible. Profound. Perfect. The subject transcends the mortality of mere musicians playing notes on pages. It is almost still. Quiet. One step away from the flawless beauty of pure silence. Eyes close, so as to not mar the ears with unnecessary information or influence. The music simply *is*, and no amount of words can ever properly capture the holy harmony that holds the whole spirit helpless. As painfully beautiful as music, words, movement, art can be, *nothing* in this world can ever hope to hold a candle to the perfect beauty of two souls finding their missing halves and uniting into one. The fugue reaches a stretto where subject and episode converge, where yin meets its yang, where melodies once dissonant on their own unite to form perfect harmony, where long journeys full of struggle, pain, sorrow, doubt, imperfection are immediately made worth every step. The piece ends with the tonic, resonant and grounded in the bass, and the dominant lingering blissfully in the top voice. The open, major chord is repeated three times with baited breath between. The strings keep vibrating long after the bow has been lifted, the conductor holds his hands high, hesitating to herald the end of the experience, the audience barely breathes, unable to break the perfect moment they wish would last forever. After what seems an eternity, the conductor lowers his hands. The musicians sheathe their instruments and relax their postures. A timid applause starts from the balcony and spreads respectfully through the house, people make small talk through humble bows, uncomfortable with enduring the vulnerability of that place much longer. Programs are folded into purses and a mass exodus soon leaves the once bustling concert hall empty. *Except for one*. --- Long for my soul, desire my body, cherish my heart. Start with my mind. Its in charge - for now. (Program notes, artist biography, and annotated discography available upon request.)

486,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"18 | F | Alaska/NC - Looking for forever Daddy (Who also is a sadist, dominant, &amp; much more)",1,adkmx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/adkmx1/18_f_alaskanc_looking_for_forever_daddy_who_also/,2019-01-08 05:36:16,"Hi there! Thanks so much for clicking my ad and giving it a read. Ive posted here before in the past with little to no luck. I decided on giving it another shot! Ill start by saying Im going to do my best to keep this ad somewhat organized - but I know that jamming everything Im looking for in terms of a dynamic and a relationship is nearly impossible. With that said, feel free to comment any questions or message me with them! Ive wrote this 3 times, so Im just going to post this one. I know this isnt for everyone, please be respectful. About me: I turned 18 and graduated high school this past May, and I currently work full time. While Im not in school - yet, Im actively trying to figure out what/where I want to end up in life. My main goals are to find happiness, and cultivate a positive, healthy life for myself. Im very driven when I set my mind on something, being successful and finding a compatible partner are some of those things. My hobbies include blogging, writing, reading, painting, coloring, and exploring Alaska while Im living here. I love a long hike with a killer view, it makes for great pictures and memories! I enjoy photographing nature around me, and close friends. Looks wise, Im about 57, blonde, blue eyes, plus size (but actively getting healthier -down 40lbs since this January), glasses, ect. Im also planning on moving to North Carolina this year (shooting for August), so maybe thatll give you more to work with. Ill happily share a picture once we talk for a little while and were both comfy. Im in no rush. Most people would describe me as intelligent, well-spoken, opinionated, strong willed, and respectable. You should be all of those things, too. Truthfully - Im not living my life to the fullest, and Im not achieving everything that I want to. I need someone who will provide me with guidance, rules, love, advice, and discipline. I need someone to hold me accountable, and push me to be my best self. Having a dynamic (that I will describe shortly) will enhance my life in all the right ways, and will bring hopefully both of us eternal happiness. My submissiveness runs deep, theres not a bone in my body that is dominant. I have this void that I feel everyday, by not being loved, controlled, and lead by someone qualified. Its just simply who I am. I need this more than Ive needed anything in my life, I was made to serve and I was made to be a good girl. I was made to be trained and made into the perfect girl. When I think of myself and what terms I most identify with theyre little girl, submissive, and masochist. But its not all that simple, and I dont like limiting myself with labels but for this purpose I will. My absolute dream life looks something like this (maybe not exactly this, but a girl can dream, you know? Dont take this too seriously) - Id be happiest being a dirty little slut most of the time, somehow balanced with being Daddys little girl. Keeping my mouth shut, and doing what is asked of me. I was born to be a submissive slave girl/stay-at-home submissive girl who does everything thats asked of her. The house is always spotless, food is always cooked, all domestic household duties are carried out by me - perfectly, and my daddy is always, ALWAYS, taken care of. I literally daydream about doing laundry for my future Daddy, and doing everything for him. His needs would always be above mine, Im not that important anyways. I get beaten all the time, I have marks all over my body but guess what! It doesnt matter bc Im home. black eyes, choke marks around my neck, broken bones, cuts- none of it is relevant because nobody sees me. I have rules, punishments, and all the love in the universe. Im pushed to be the best version of myself, Im taken care of. All that matters is me taking care of my owner. All that matters is me dedicating legitimately all of my being to becoming his ideal girl, molding myself into what exactly he needs and making sure every single one of his needs are met. All Ive ever wanted was to give myself to someone, and have them take everything in return. Give me no say in what I do. Just let me listen to you and be your good girl. Its all about that balance between love and consensual abuse for me. I want to know you love me so much when youre beating me bloody. My favorite things in the world are DD/lg, consensual abuse, gaslighting and giving up all control. 24/7. Being a little girl is quite integral to who I am, and it would be incredible to find someone who embraces my little side - encourages it even! Nothing is better than slipping into little space with someone you adore. I want someone who wants to meet my stuffies and love them like I do, enjoys how silly I get when Im little and makes me feel safe enough to really regress. Being a submissive is just who I am. Ive always been submissive, and I cant switch. I crave being useful and earning my dominants love. I dont want control over my life. I want someone who is more experienced than I to have that control. Someone like a father figure, as I mentioned previously. I want to give it all to someone who deserves it, and I want to give all of myself to someone. Being a masochist is an interesting thing. I avoid pain in my everyday life - because ouch? But when its being given to me by someone I look up to - such as my Daddy, its a different pain. Its a pain that I cant get enough of. Its my drug. I love pain in all forms. Physically and mentally. Mental abuse intrigues me, and Ive experienced it lightly - consensually of course. If anything I wanted much more of. Physical abuse is very much something I need - and not just limited to the bedroom. None of this is just for the bedroom, this is all 24/7. If I smart off to you, there shouldnt be any reason for you not to punch me. I need to be kept in my place, I want someone who is strict with me. I want to be a living, breathing version of your specific training and needs. I want to be exactly what youve always wanted. About you: In your heart you should NEED a little girl who needs you - in many, many ways. You want to set rules, structure, and guide your little girl through her life. You want to take on a fatherly role in her life, nothing less than that. Ideally, well create a bond so close Ill love you more than my real father - and we will feel like were really father/daughter. You should crave this. Coloring with me, building pillow forts, teaching me how to sound out big words - Daddy things. You should want to do them and enjoy them. On the other hand there is definitely a sexual side to it. You should enjoy exploring sex when Im feeling little, as well as other dark age play things. You should be older than me, respectable, successful, confident, normal, care about your appearance, and experienced. You should be very serious about your role, and truly want a long term relationship that is integral to who you aren. I want someone who has their life together, and is ready to essentially have a little girl and a partner. Its a dream of mine to have a dynamic that feels like a true father/daughter relationship. You should be wanting a real relationship, that ideally is monogamous and 24/7. You should be free of any STDs. You should be looking for something real - which means meeting IRL and more if we click. No solely online relationships. While itd be great to find someone here - Im not expecting that. However - if were together, we are going to have to see each other somewhat regularly, keep that in mind. Im not looking for something where traveling isnt possible for us. Having a relationship like this wont work solely online. Dont waste my time or yours if thats what youre wanting. Experienced means knowing what it means to be a dominant, and have the right motives when it comes to this type of relationship. You want to be someones lifeline, you want to be depended on. You should crave control. You should be a sadist who enjoys and needs to inflict physical and mental pain/damage. Most importantly- get off on my pain and suffering. You should be a Daddy who enjoys everything about DD/lg. From rules and punishment, to forcing me into little space. These things should be integral to who you are, and they should be things you need in your life. If they arent, we are not on the same level and we wont be compatible. When I attempt to explain the kind of Dominant that I am looking for, leadership is the word that I seem to fall back on time and again. I was drawn into this lifestyle by the erotic temptations of bare bottom spankings. As my awareness grew, through conversations, reading and connections I came to see that I have a deeply submissive nature. Of course, Ive had to learn to fake it, to get out there in the world and not only survive but also thrive. I live passionately, with conviction, I have a strong sense of my values and these help guide me. But when you fake something, its truly exhausting. Nothing beats being my true self. To be with a man who not only wants to dominate but wants to lead, he doesnt just see my as a sexual toy, a plaything, someone who is willing at a moments notice to do his bidding. He wants to climb inside my head and riffle around and set up camp in there, he wants to know me and all of my complexities. Through our conversations, sharing intimacies, funnies, weird little backstories of our lives, honesty, sometimes the painful gut wrenching kind, that is how we grow together and over time I become his most cherished possession. He slowly learns my goals, dreams and aspirations and he takes pleasure in leading me, supporting me, watching me blossom as he supports me to follow my passions. I become an extension of him that he is proud of. I represent him as I go out into the world, lighter, freer, because he shoulders many of the stresses and burdens that I had been carrying before he came into my life. He does this because its in his nature, he enjoys it. As I am a natural submissive he is a natural leader he cuts through my worries like a warm knife on butter, he sees things differently to the way I do and its where his strengths lie. In turn I give myself to him, its a sweet submission, respectful, caring, loving and open, he takes my neediness and my worries and he gives me structure and routine and I feel safe, cared for and loved. I adore caring for him and he teaches me how best I can support him, the practical, emotional, sexual. Its a two way street and we both show our vulnerability to strengthen our connection. As our connection deepens my main focus becomes to please him. Life becomes so uncomplicated and yet so rich and rewarding when pleasing him is my priority. Well, thats my ad. I hope this somehow reaches the right person, and I can find the Daddy that Ive always needed. Im not looking to jump into a dynamic - this will be taken very slowly to ensure we have a great foundation before anything else if were compatible. If you find yourself interested please take the time to write a well formulated message - if you dont I simply wont respond. Put your age, location, and what exactly youre looking for in your message. The closer you are to me, the better. Thanks for taking the time to read this! "

I'm 5'11, 160, fairly good shape, great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy slipping into a dom role with someone who enjoys slipping into a submissive role. Im looking for an ongoing D/s relationship that isnt love or marriage but yet has a strong connection and ongoing desire to explore together. No STDs is a must and minimal other partners is important but open to negotiation. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy control, instructing, and teaching someone about the darker pleasures. Newbies are ok. I tilt a little more towards the BD than SM as I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. In particular Im skilled with rope play, and love bondage, exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. Im the kind that needs some connection. Let's face it, we all have that secret yearning that cannot be easily ignored, and wants to come out with a safe and trusted person. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, finding peak physical pleasures and new ways to unlock myself and others. I am single and unattached. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on kik or texting on google voice on vanilla topics. Looking forward to something new in 2019 "

This Dom Daddy understands how to participate in complex psychological play for self improvement and self exploration. I'm hoping for someone experienced enough to understand emotional play in a scene, how to build it and manage it, which means you have basic education in human behavior and understand the phrase ""emotional sadism."" **About me:** There is a wall in-front of my little that you will need to manage to get what you want. I've had to put it there to protect my vulnerability because of so many of you. It's thick and it's long and I feel like the more I try to get my needs met, the more I add to the wall instead of tearing it down like I want. On this side of the wall is a strong accomplished bitch that doesn't put up with your lying inconsistent shit. Behind the wall is a dirty, raw, scared little thing that is 4-6yo. Online Dom's have been like feral animals that I need protection against. Think of this like a video game with levels...If you can recognize the wall....you can crush it, demo it, frame a door in it, find and open a window, step around it, climb over it.....whatever metaphor pleases you, just know that I won't let you deeply in right away, and that there maybe some labor involved.....like a warriors quest. You may need to start at level 1 and slowly journey to the wall, collecting your weapons of destruction on the way.

Especially about your ability to be consistent. cybersex slowly transitioned to real time play and commands. I won't do anything until I want to do it for you..... So ask carefully. Anticipate 2-4 weeks before I will start obeying you. cybersex/roleplay/real life commands 1-2x a week at night (minimum): **8-11pm PST**. Why so specific you all have asked? Because I get home from work at 8pm....so .....that's when I'm actually free!!!!!!! At that point I smoke a bowl of weed, I can get in bed with my sexy toys and stuffies or I get in the bath and melt away with you into the land of dirty naughty depraved subspace.....during this window I can give private concentrated time into the depths of my mind, and expect the same in return.

A passionate, skilled, strict and caring Master seeks his forever slave (online at first)",1,adyhp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/adyhp3/25m4f_you_will_give_me_your_heart_and_your_soul/,2019-01-09 07:22:01,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave:* The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant:* There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship:* So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission:* What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls:* At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks:* Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions:* I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments:* Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you:** *Commitment:* Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion:* I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication:* Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust:* Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy:* When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy:* Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me:** *A Strong Hand:* As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart:* But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

But first, allow me to sell myself. I have a lot of my shit together. Not all of it, but most of it. Ive got a great career in healthcare that Im passionate about. Im surrounded by a solid group of friends and family. My dog is such a good boy. Ive got a fairly decent life that Im content with, but Id be remiss to leave out how soul-crushingly lonely it gets at times. And a girl had...needs. What exactly do I need? I want us to be one of those couples that hones in on our complementary strengths and uses them to bring out the best in one another. I like vulnerability and accountability. The psychological aspect of D/s is what Im most drawn to. Clicking with someone on that level is one of the most wonderful feelings. As far as what Im looking for, you should be monogamous, relationship-oriented, and live in the California Bay Area. Personality-wise, I get along best with people who have a bit of an edge and are more on the extroverted side. I try to stay fairly active and would love an exercise partner (totally justifies going out for beer and wings amirite). A sharp tongue, quick wit, and a strong drive are fairly attractive traits. So are good personal hygiene and grooming, and wearing properly fitted clothes. I love going to concerts and this past month saw Jawbreaker, The Menzingers, and Lucero. Running and hiking have been the best antidepressants Ive tried. I dont drink more than three times a month, dont smoke, and very infrequently use cannabis. Im 55, brunette, medium complexion, and chubby (but consistently making progress towards my goal weight). Ive been told Im cute and am fairly confident that I clean up pretty well. I put a good deal of effort into my physical appearance and dress more on the girlier end of the spectrum. Im a liberal and an atheist, and to that end prefer someone with similar ideals. So uhhhh...if this strikes a cord with you, send me a message and tell me a bit about yourself. I expect us to exchange photo verification fairly quickly and would expect us to meet within the next week or two if we hit it off with textual chemistry. "

You'll have someone who is passionate about you. Someone who supports you, and understands you. I will always be in your corner. I'll care and be concerned about you. I'll be there for you, at any time of day or night. I'll be your champion, I'll always have confidence in you. You will have someone who is there for you. This relationship will be primarily goal oriented. We will identify areas in your life that need to be improved, and we will together form realistic action plans to tackle those areas together. You will always have a voice, and play an intimate role in forming these plans. Your progress will be tracked in detail, and you will be held accountable for everything we discuss. I am not easy to serve. I will take complete control and demand absolute obedience, vulnerability and respect. Your clothing, food, schedule exercise, grooming, your whole private life will be mine to mold as I decide is pleasing to me and best for you. You will be an object for my pleasure, and I will use you as such, as I see fit. Every inch of you will be mine to see, mine to mold, mine to hurt, mine to pleasure. You will be humiliated, degraded and embarrassed because it pleases me. Your most intimate moments will be shared with me You will be utterly and totally mine. The price is high, but I will not let you down. I will bring organization and accountability to your life. I will actively encourage you and support you. I will make myself available and present to you. I will bring confidence to you when you lack it in yourself, joy to you when you feel down, motivation when you can't find your own. I will celebrate in your successes and share in your failures. It may not be an easy road, the path to improvement and success rarely is, and being my slave will make it harsher and crueler at times.

During your punishments, you will be humiliated, degraded and stripped in front of me. You will be brought low and scolded on your knees. Along with personally directed and severe spankings/beatings, cornertime, lines, scoldings, loss of privileges, and other physical and non-physical punishments will also be used. All of these punishments will be done safely, with your well-being in the forefront of my mind. Your hard limits will not be used, and your soft limits only used when a serious offense has occurred. Always expect generous and bountiful aftercare. Let me be clear, while I will punish you every single time you deserve it, my end goal is not to punish you. You will find me more than fair and understanding. There will always be an in-depth conversation before a punishment occurs. And while I am strict, and will not let you get away with much at all, I understand sometimes, situations do not call for discipline, but just support and kindness . My end goal is to punish you less and less as time goes on. I want to see you become the person you want to be and I want to celebrate the service and devotion you give me.

You can tell my posting history that I'm a catastrophe but at least, I don't care enough to use a throwaway. -- Now onto things I really want people to understand. I really love cute pet boys and I want to pet all cute boys. I can spend hours doing just that. My role for GFD directly stems from a hidden maternal instinct (hidden because I hate children). That being said, really can't get behind MDLB - being called mummy sort of makes me feel real freaking gross. I don't have a low libido but I really want to work into having a romantic vanilla relationship first before a BDSM one. I am very much willing to conform to what you want from a Domme but there are dark fantasies of wanting to protect sweet boys and hurt them too. It's hard to pinpoint what I get out of this - I think it appeals to me because I love the vulnerability and the aesthetic of it. I want a cute little cat at my feet and I want to feed him, wash him, stroke him. My mantra would be affection before infliction. I am very much interested in the psychology of figuring out how to put someone in their subspace and make them enthralled by me. But I am very eager in consent and control of myself to not take advantage. I will always do what's best for you. My GFD fantasies have been mainly non-sexual but have festered crude ideas on what I would like to expect of my boy.

502,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"26M4F - Committed, devoted Dominant seeks eager, charming, kind, warm, obedient, adorable, brilliant spunky slave girl to give everything to in a 24/7 TPE relationship. (online to begin)",1,a1wwtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/a1wwtj/26m4f_committed_devoted_dominant_seeks_eager/,2018-12-01 08:56:05,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. Let's start with some definitions slave: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. Dominant: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. Master/slave relationship: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. What will this relationship consist of: Active submission: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. Daily controls: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. Daily tasks: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. Weekly sessions: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. Punishments: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. ** What will be expected of you:** Commitment: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. Devotion: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. Communication: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. Trust: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. Emotional intimacy: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. Physical intimacy: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. What you can expect from me: A Strong Hand: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. A Warm Heart: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. If you're interested Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

505,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,44 [M4f] Denver. Looking for an adult Parent/child relationship,1,a38hns,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/a38hns/44_m4f_denver_looking_for_an_adult_parentchild/,2018-12-05 14:50:11,"Hello Kinksters, Stats: Married, 5'10"". I'm not that guy on Twitter with the same username. To my uneducated eye there are 3 general flavors of DD/lg. 1. Age play and little space based kink. So the arrangement is about inducing little space and being a caretaker to the person in that space. 2. Fetish based kink. This is about the erotic attachment to certain childhood items: school uniforms, undies, pacis, etc. 3. Parent/child flavored D/s or M/s relationships. This is about playing with the power and control dynamics of Parent/child relationships. The D/s version is based around the feeling of control, and of being controlled through rules and punishments. The M/s version is based about the parental feeling of guidance, mentoring, and raising; and the feeling of obedience and service to your parent. And of course, most real life relationships have some versions of all three of these flavors. But I'm looking for the woman who falls squarely in #3. She is looking for that feeling of having a Father, just BDSM version. She wants to be guided, led, and to please her Daddy. She wants to serve her Daddy and know that she makes her Daddy proud. Her Daddy might ask her to do some very difficult things, but only because it's for her own good, or because it pleases him. She's not very into punishment because not pleasing Daddy is punishment enough. She lives to hear ""Good girl"" or hear her Daddy call her by her name. To me M/s is about making the internal external. It is a co-creation. It only appears to be one sided because one side gets to have the intuition and make the commands. But in reality it's the other side that really controls the dynamic. Where's Master's power if the slave doesn't want to obey? So I'm not going to tell you what to do as much as lead you to bring what is inside of you into the light. With kinky people vulnerability and honesty leads to a power dynamic. For us the only kind of relationships that gets us right where the hurt is, and reaches us deep inside is polarized. So we'll start egalitarian and find ourselves slipping into our roles, like slipping into our most comfortable shoes. It won't start off with much sexual emphasis. I need to know what you are as an individual. I need to know what you are like when you are being your authentic self. That's the only way to connect with you. Only then does the connection develop to physical intimacy. So, ask me questions, or say Hi if you're curious. "

When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul."

I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave:* The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant:* There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship:* So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission:* What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls:* At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks:* Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions:* I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments:* Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you:** *Commitment:* Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion:* I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication:* Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust:* Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy:* When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy:* Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me:** *A Strong Hand:* As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart:* But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

I'm 5'11, 160, fairly good shape, great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy slipping into a dom role with someone who enjoys slipping into a submissive role. I have good experience, and consider myself a bit tender, but can be very strict and enjoy control, instructing, and teaching someone about the darker pleasures. Newbies are ok. I tilt a little more towards the BD than SM as I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. Let's face it, we all have that secret yearning that cannot be easily ignored, and wants to come out with a safe and trusted person. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on kik or texting on google voice on vanilla topics. "

If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life.

The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable.

That's somewhat intentional, because I'm pretty open with regard to what I'm looking for. You should be very submissive (or at least *want* to be very submissive), and I seriously *prefer* you be pale and have a relatively big butt. (Bonus points if the thought of being impregnated makes you feel even more owned and turned on.) If you're into the idea of a guy being mean to you because you're cute, charming, smart, do endearing things--then we'll probably get along. I'm into crying, genuine laughter, facial expressions caused by pain, and big cute pale butts. Intelligence is extremely attractive as well. ----- Though very experienced with BDSM sex, I've hesitated up to now to post on any of the BDSM subreddits because, overall, I don't much feel that I fit in with the culture. (This has always been a problem.) I'm not a geek, not into gaming, and really not into a lot of the jargon. Nothing against anyone who is, really--its just not me. ----- I know it's difficult to be submissive--even online--so I understand a degree of trepidation, but excessive shit testing and more than a small amount of brattiness will annoy me. Ideally this would all result in a serious-but-casual, ongoing online thing, with a good amount of voice on Skype or whatever. (Though Wickr is my favorite platform.) Hopefully we can both find something we need, which would ideally include a good degree of intensity, and emotional vulnerability on both sides. Message me if you're interested."

My identity as an empath and a sub has been concretely established for as long as I can remember. I connect strongly with others. I crave rawness and honesty. Im afraid to be vulnerable (like most) but I choose to ignore that fear in most, if not all, cases. I am myself. I wish I could say Im *unapologetically* myself, but Ill probably apologize a lot. Choosing to be vulnerable, however, does not mean I will be immediately so. My submission is continually earned. The many Doms with whom Ive spoken seem to wholeheartedly understand that concept at the beginning. In my experience though, our definitions of submission, continually, and earned rarely match up. In the cases where we finally did reach an understanding, we found we werent as perfect of a match as previously thought. Thats ok. We learned. I am better for those experiences; and I dont regret any of them. I seek understanding, compassion, humility, and The Chase. **My desired dynamic is fluid, a constant chase, a ceaseless grapple for power in which I (hopefully) lose.** I will not *let* you win. I will try; I will exert effort. If were a good match, you will almost always win. And when you do, I will be the most obedient, kind, gracious, nurturing, lovely submissive. Because I recognize that you truly deserve it, and I cant help but desire to serve you in that moment. What Im *not* looking for is a partner who defines The Chase as a dramatic on-again-off-again saga. Im seeking intelligence and humor and wit and laughter and comfort. Not heartbreak. If thats not you, again, *thats ok*. Were just not the right match. In the past, Ive identified as Bratty. More recently, Ive realized those bratty tendencies were actually a hint of switch. Yikes. This part is new to me. **I am NOT a switch. I need a dominant partner.** I dont want to overtake my Dom. But I do want the person with whom I connect to be undone by me. I want *shared* vulnerability. If thats not you, again *thats ok.* I also need my partner to recognize that these tendencies are a part of me and handle them gently, even playfully. Im looking for my virtual, covalent bond. Perhaps you and I are just ionic. (I just did some research to make sure my chemistry recall was accurate. Turns out: many ionic bonds actually take *more* energy to break than covalent bonds. Ugh! Now my metaphor is ruined, but hopefully you get the point.) God. This is so long; Im sorry. Some final notes, and Ill shut up. Im not a brat, a little, a pet, or a slave. Im...something else? (Labels can be helpful to begin a conversation or study, of course, so Id never decline someone who likes them.) I dont do 24/7 or TPE, and for some reason Im specifically not interested in letting you choose my outfits. I gravitate toward Daddy Doms, but I will never be comfortable calling someone Daddy. I have a strong emotional masochistic streak and connect well with sadists. Important: I am happily attached irl. Connecting with me will never result in an irl encounter.

(Online at first)",1,9r4lo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/9r4lo9/25m4f_seeking_my_soulmate_a_beautiful_trusting/,2018-10-25 09:50:34,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non\-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound\-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship \(trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.\) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self\-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now \(although I do have my favorites\), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time\-intensive \(I will work with your schedule\). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real\-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare \(the part where I serve you and your needs\) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you:** *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep\-seated fears \(even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly\-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. *What you can expect from me*: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon."

You expose your fear, making your self-inflicted suffering your authentic gift to me, showing me your vulnerability, letting me feel your desire to give your body to me. You see the red and purple marks of my ownership on your body. You make them. You feel them throughout the day, the dull aches and the punctate sting. They give you certainty that you are mine: you can feel my ownership whenever you need to be reminded. You feel my control all the time, every time you sit down or move a certain way. You sweat and your heart beats faster every time you find an instrument that I ask for, wondering what my plan is for it. You gasp when I finally allow your hand to soothe, to seek pleasure underneath your clothes. Our bond is a paradox because I am not there physically, but the sensations are intense, real, truly painful; the pleasure, when I allow it, is deeply intimate and raw. This will be our online life together. I want to take you to the limits of your physical experience of this world. l want join you at that psychic edge, immersed in you and your loss of control.

Someone who finds it in him to develop such a close relationship despite the distance.* I am attracted to BDSM, especially D/s because of this strong bond between two person. The vulnerability involved in this dynamic scares me, because how could you possibly give so much to someone and trust that he will do right by you? Yet, this is what I desire. I am looking for a 24/7 TPE, it will be monogamous, will start online but will evolve to in real life, it will definitely be something that goes well beyond the sex. I do not expect 24/7 right from the beginning, but this is the end goal. I am located in the GMT+4 Time zone. I am looking for more than just sex. Don't get me wrong, I want a tight grip around my throat that literally takes my breath away and let lose just seconds before I faint, you could pull me against you and hug me but I'd rather have you slap me and bring me to my knees and shove your cock in my mouth gagging me. You don't stop there, you drag me, pull me up and bend me over the kitchen counter and fuck the hell out of me. I want this but I want more than this. I want a Dom who tells me that I want you to call me Sir, not just because I enjoy it but because I find a sense of respect in it. *I want a Dom that takes the time to explain me the meanings behind the tasks assigned to me.* I want someone who will **willingly** take these little extra steps. I am the kind of submissive who will always wait for your return home, come take your bag from the car and kneel while I take your shoes off. *I want to invest myself in someone and know that they are invested in me too.* Some of my kinks: Consensual non consent, Behavior modification, Impact play, Bondage, Hypnosis, Rules and Tasks, Rituals/Mantras **Who am I?** I am wandering right now and I am working towards bringing structure to my life. I love structure, todo lists. Working a 9-5 job gives me the ability to define my day from the time I wake up to sleep, and it gives me the satisfaction that I am achieving something everyday, but strip work from my life and I lose balance. I work a 9-5 but I do not like the corporate work structure, I feel like I am living to work rather than the contrary. By the way, I am a developer. I love coding this is why I chose it as a job. I love reading Romance, I just recently picked up reading, I am a slow reader, and I am currently looking into diversifying my reading to self-development books. I love going to the gym, I love jogging, I participate in trails when the trail season is on. I am however overweight and I am actively working on it. I just love to eat. I can eat an entire pizza on my own and after that I can still eat a pint or two of ice cream. My love for chocolate biscuits knows no ends and I want a relationship that matches this. I can listen to pop at one moment and then rock at another. I can listen to the same song days in a row but I still wouldn't remember the lyrics of the song. I don't remember any lyrics, I like watching TV shows but I don't remember any punch lines, maybe apart from HULK SMASH, you've failed this city and penny penny penny. I like following Marvel movies, but before a new release I have to do a marathon of the previous ones, because well, I forget. I wear my heart on my sleeve and I am pretty fragile. I have issues, self-confidence issues, body image issues and some others that do not necessarily fall under a label, or maybe I did not find the label yet. **The catch.**  My kinks are pretty vast and I am always open to try something at least once, but we need to make sure that we both enjoy the same kinks, because for instance I can give you control over the way I do my hair, but if you always want me to tie my hair when I am out of the house, this will be an issue.  With some people I tend to take the upper hand, with some people I tend to shut down. I have not found the middle ground yet. I know there is one and I am trying to find it **I am open to anyone older than me.** Age difference is hot but it can be an issue. If the age difference is high, you have seen much more of life than I have, you may know what is it that you want and where you are heading in life, the same cannot be said for me, I am still discovering myself, struggling with what I want from life, I am rather unstable right now. Conversations can be hard because interest can differ widely too. **Why am I seeking online first?** I am neither from the US nor from Europe, so relocating for me is harder than what you might think. Immigration policies are not so welcoming. I am however working towards moving out in about 2 years, Canada if my CRS score meets the requirements, or Germany if I still want to pursue a masters and Germany still gives the facilities to international students. If things work well between us, I wouldn't mind meeting your for holidays, we could go to Disney Land and sex dungeons. We could talk lengthily about this if you decide to message me. **NB**: There is so much more to tell, but I hope I was able to give you a picture of what I am looking for. If you want to clarify something, please go ahead and message me. If what I am looking for happens to be what you are looking for, I will be more than happy to talk to you. **Please, if you made it this far and decide to message me,** 1. Be single with no kids. 2. Be ready to talk to me every single day, I love long texts, if you are the one word, one sentence person, chances are that this won't last. "

If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave:* The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant:* There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship:* So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission:* What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls:* At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now (although I do have my favorites), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks:* Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions:* I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments:* Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. ** What will be expected of you:** *Commitment:* Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion:* I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication:* Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust:* Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy:* When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy:* Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. **What you can expect from me:** *A Strong Hand:* As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart:* But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon"

I tilt a little more towards the BD than SM as I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it.

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non\-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound\-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship \(trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.\) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship.

530,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,46(M4F) - I found the perfect sub! She's just waiting to reply! ;),1,9i8nri,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/9i8nri/46m4f_i_found_the_perfect_sub_shes_just_waiting/,2018-09-24 00:15:57,"Hello there. I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. As a person, I am Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games until all hours. (For the Horde!) Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. As a Dominant, I am Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. Physically, I am According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. A Note on Kinks: Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. The Highlight Reel: Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting.

531,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,46(M4F) - I found the perfect sub! She's just waiting to reply! ;),0,9ibs89,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/9ibs89/46m4f_i_found_the_perfect_sub_shes_just_waiting/,2018-09-24 06:46:55,"Hello there. I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games until all hours. (For the Horde!) - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. - Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. - Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. - Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting. - Obedience and compliance, as well as meticulous control and attention is what gets me going. - *Extras:* Slut shaming, behavior modification focused degradation/humiliation, body marking, ownership enforcement, etc. **In my perfect world, my submissive partner would be:** - Based here in the US, preferably in the east coast for timezone purposes. - Between 25-50 years old. - Available *sometime* within my available weekday hours (7a-7p EST) - Highly attentive and communicative. - Looking to live our long distance/separate lives together as much as we possibly can. Not confining ourselves to specific areas of sharing our lives together but opening up every facet of our lives to one another over time and trust. - Excited by the idea of mutual obsession, infatuation, and utter devotion. - Experienced OR actively learning and reading to gain more experience. - A strong speaker with high expectations for command of the English language . - Witty, dry sarcasm, dark humor are all a plus (please don't drown me in your lol's.

You want to hurt. I want to hurt you. But I will make you hurt yourself. You will beg for mercy, really beg, while yearning for more. You will expose your fear, making your self-inflicted suffering your authentic gift to me, showing me your complete vulnerability, letting me experience your profound, eager desire to sacrifice your body to me. You see the red and purple marks of my ownership on your body. You make them. You feel them throughout the day, the dull aches and the punctate sting. They give you certainty that you are mine: you can feel my ownership whenever you need to feel safe. You feel my control all the time, every time you sit down or move a certain way. You sweat and your heart beats faster every time you find an instrument that I ask for, wondering what my plan is for it. You gasp when I finally allow your hand to soothe, to seek pleasure underneath your clothes. It is a paradox, our bond, because I am not there physically, but the sensations are intense, real, truly painful; the pleasure, when I allow it, is deeply intimate and raw. This will be our online life together. I want to take you to the limits of your physical experience of this world. l want join you at that edge, immersed in your deepest self, a sexual sadist claiming your body as his own. This isnt for everyone, God no, but you know its for you, because of a soft voice deep inside you, the voice that youve tried to silence. But now she is whimpering, crying to be free, clawing, reaching out desperately, grabbing you by the throat. Come to me now, before the thoughts stop you. "

So this is kind of an awkward post to write, but I don't really know where else to post this. In short, earlier tonight I was in a really intense scene with someone that I had met in a local dungeon. We went back to my apartment to continue talking and eventually play. I'm not inexperienced, so I know what to establish with a dominant before playing with them. We talked about our limits and what we both expected from one another. In addition, I specifically stressed that I need aftercare after any scene. We continued to play, and then when he was done, he just got dressed and left. I'm one of these subs that requires a lot of aftercare after any sort of scene, especially because I enjoy being degraded, which this dominant did. *A lot*. After this entire situation, he didn't give me any explanation as to why he left. We only exchanged first names, so I have no way to ask him any questions about why he just left me there. I may not have known this person for long, but I did give him a lot of trust and vulnerability to choose to play with him and show him the submissive side of myself. I know I shouldn't blame myself for any of this, but I can't help but feel like I did something wrong to him to make him leave me there. I suppose what I'm looking for now is just someone to talk to and make me feel a bit better. I still have all of those thoughts in my head about what he called me, which doesn't sit well with me when I'm not in a scene. I'm aware that I seem needy and spoiled, but I've just never been in this situation before. If you want to talk to me and help make me feel a bit better, please don't hesitate to message me. I'm open to talking to anyone. Thank you in advance, Marlena"

If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non\-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound\-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship \(trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.\) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self\-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now \(although I do have my favorites\), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time\-intensive \(I will work with your schedule\). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real\-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare \(the part where I serve you and your needs\) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you:** *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep\-seated fears \(even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly\-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. *What you can expect from me*: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon."

I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention.

Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul.

You see marks of my ownership on your body. You feel them throughout the day, the dull aches or the punctate sting. The give you certainty that you are mine. You feel my control all the time, every time you sit down, every time I allow your hand to seek pleasure underneath your clothes, every time you find an instrument that will hurt, wondering what my plan is for it. You feel confused. I am not there physically, but the sensations are intense, real, truly painful; the pleasure, when I allow it, is deeply intimate and raw. You have never met me, yet the bond of you feel with me is a constant as you navigate your daily life, under his watchful control. This is online sadomasochism. This will be your submission to me.

If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non\-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound\-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship \(trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.\) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self\-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now \(although I do have my favorites\), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time\-intensive \(I will work with your schedule\). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real\-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare \(the part where I serve you and your needs\) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you:** *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep\-seated fears \(even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly\-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. *What you can expect from me*: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you.

I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short.

I am glad youre a least a little intrigued. A little about me, I am an intelligent and strong woman who both craves adoration and obsession. I am a sort-of-scientist and appreciate a bit of a brain. I need to be with someone who can be deep and open, but doesnt necessarily dive into philosophy too much. As a scientist, I find philosophers quite draining and exhausting, but I do need someone who looks deeper than surface level. I could maybe enjoy the philosophy after a dance with Mary Jane. I am 57 with brown hair, pale skin, gray eyes, and am bigger (thick thighs save lives?). I am well informed, but I am not nerdy in the gaming/pop culture sense. I am not in anyway opposed to someone with these hobbies so long as you know its not my thing so much. I do like cute animals, light political discussion, quirks and oddities, honesty, dad jokes, and vulnerability when appropriate. Kink-wise, I have played (a little) on both ends and enjoy aspects of being a sub as well as aspects of being a Domme. I think the most important part is a solid connection and emotional attraction. The best relationships I have had started small and grew, so I am not going to go into depth as I think conversation will flow or not regardless of whether you like being spanked or are fond of seeing someone piss their pants. I am pretty open to safe consensual play. I do have a couple hard limits I will list just to rule out a complete disconnect: no blood, scat, or marks from pain/pleasure that would last more than 1 hour. I also have a life, so I need someone online who does expect daily contact but understands 4-5 hour gaps are likely. As a Domme or in a Dom I do tend to lean toward the gentler side, but I am open to other things as well if it feels right with you. "

Your body and mind. You will give me everything. I'm a strict and caring Master and I seek a forever slave.",2,9d8a1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/9d8a1v/26_m4f_are_you_unhappy_unfulfilling_relationships/,2018-09-06 02:36:06,"**TL;DR;** * I seek a long-term slave that seeks complete devotion to their master. * I don't expect submission from the get-go. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. A slave gives up her freedom of choice to her Master. If you read to the end of this, it might be the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** **slave:** The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. **Dominant:** There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. **Master/slave relationship:** So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. What will this relationship consist of: **Active submission:** What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. **Daily controls:** At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now, rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. **Daily tasks:** Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. **Weekly sessions:** I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. **Punishments:** Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you:** **Commitment:** Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. **Devotion:** I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. **Communication:** Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. **Trust:** Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. **Emotional intimacy:** When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. **Physical intimacy:** Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan.

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

I live in the US, work three jobs, and have way too many hobbies for my own good. I love meeting new people and get along with basically everyone. **You:** Sweet but firm, confident, dependable, body-positive with an appreciation for chubby girls.

I'm looking for someone who wants to collaborate on rules and enforce structure through regular monitoring + reasonable rewards/punishments, with some kinky fun in between. The specifics of that are fully negotiable, but I want it to be a positive experience, absolutely not a fat humiliation thing. I genuinely really like my body and if you don't have a thing for big girls this isn't going to work out because I need to feel comfortable being vulnerable with you. I know it's a lot to ask for, but in return I promise this will be fun. I have lots of kinks and an insatiable appetite for rough, filthy sex. I'm not shy, I absolutely love dirty talk and showing off while we get to know each other. I'm really into obedience and being a good girl, and even though it's fun to push your buttons I'm not at all a bratty sub who makes submission like pulling teeth. If you're nice and we have chemistry then I'll really want to please you. If that kind of arrangement ticks some boxes for you, I'd love to chat and find out if we're a good fit."

549,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"27 [F4M/MF] Seattle (Sub 4 Dom) Traditional gender dynamics w/light-to-moderate 24/7 elements. Long w/plenty of details, pros/cons.",5,90cmu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/90cmu2/27_f4mmf_seattle_sub_4_dom_traditional_gender/,2018-07-20 13:43:56,"# Intro Hi there, /r/BDSMPersonals. This ad is a bit of a novel. I'm going to try to tell you what you need to know about what I bring to a relationship and what I need from you. **Please read it through, if you're going to message me**; I'm writing all this because relationships based on mystery are dumb. I want you to know what you're getting in to with me, and I'll want to know what I'm getting in to with you. That being said: if you read it and you think you're a possible fit, please don't be afraid to send me a message. There are a couple of words buried in the text below, and I will respond to any message sent with them. I know it sucks to message people and not get replies, and I won't leave you hanging (even if you're encountering this ad much later, I do still check this account periodically). I am looking mostly for an in-person relationship, so people local to me are strongly preferred. Relocation is not entirely out of the question for an exceptional match, but closer is better. # About Me (Outside of Kinks) I'm a woman in my late 20s living in the greater Seattle area. I grew up in the South under a fundamentalist family, which is definitely responsible for some of the things I like. Even though I outgrew my homeland and my family's politics...well, the lizard-brain portions of my head were sort of set. At some level, this is an important part of womanhood to me, and I've given up trying to pretend otherwise. Appearance and culture wise I'm pretty generic-white-American, the sort of person who finds the Olive Garden pleasantly exotic. I'm fairly overweight but otherwise reasonably attractive, averaging out somewhere in the middle of the bell curve. I'm a very erratic person. My energy levels and mood change a lot day to day, to the point that there's been suspicion I might be bipolar (but that hasn't really panned out). When I get in to things, I get very into them, only to abandon them entirely days later. I'm shy and trust slowly. People haven't actively backstabbed me, but a rocky upbringing left me with a lot of emotional scars. I will take some time to truly open up - I'll *talk* about just about anything, but actually easing in to contact and action is harder. Expect me to get spooked sometimes. I am transgender, and transitioned some years ago now. I pass fine, but have not had (and do not currently plan to have) genital surgery. I have been on hormones for some years, however, and otherwise look/feel/etc like any other woman (in particular, I got lucky enough to get solid, full breasts). If this is a dealbreaker for you, well, there ya go. If not, make sure you include the word bacon in your message title. I'm bisexual, with a preference for women appearance-wise and a preferance for men kink-wise. I'm open to partners of both sexes, although men tend to work better in practice (again, we'll get to this). I'm open to poly relationships with a couple, though I haven't been in one before. I'm well-educated and intelligent, with a huge range of intellectual interests. Get me to start talking about them, and I will never, ever shut up about it (and will probably love you for it). My movie/TV/etc. preferences are pretty standard for a Redditor, I think. I like witty postmodern comedies of the Community or 30 Rock mold and dramas of epic or tiny scope - it better be a person at stake or the whole world. They're hard to sum up otherwise, but aside from my love for stupid over-happy pop music I don't think you'll be too surprised by any of them. # The Relationship I'm Looking For I like gender equality. I'm all for access for both men and women to whatever they'd like to do, and I've got very little tolerance for jerks who'll reject someone out of hand because of their sex. It's really important to me that you believe this too, and strongly, because... ...well, because that's my belief about the world. But beliefs about the world aren't always where your heart goes, are they? In *my* relationship, I want pretty traditional gender norms: not because it has to be that way in general, but because that's the place I want to choose in life, next to someone who wants a woman who chooses such a thing freely. I would spend a paragraph going on about how this is weird. But if you're the sort of person I'm looking for, I don't think you need it. I think you get, at some level, that it's not contradictory to have nice civilized liberal beliefs day to day, but still have a caveman brain that wants to club me over the head, drag me back to your cave, and make tons of little caveman babies with me (or for me to have those beliefs and still melt at the idea of such a thing). I don't just want this in the bedroom. I want to be directed, guided, and molded by my partner, to bloom under his management and to yield up the fruits of that care to him. I want to be *your* woman, in the most possessive sense of the pronoun: obedient and lower-status, with an understanding that you, as a man, are in command of our relationship and, ultimately, our home. That doesn't mean I wear a collar whenever we go out - it means I won't need one, because the power dynamics are agreed to regardless. I am not a masochist, and I don't like actual pain. For me, kink is about differences in *status*, and I don't pair well with true sadists. I am looking for something that is sort-of 24/7, in the sense that while actual sex-kinkiness should be kept mostly to the bedroom (and I *am* kinky in other respects), I do actually want to find someone who wants to be the leader in a home and who wants his woman to generally accept his decisions and judgment. I want to defer and lean on you day to day, but not to be a helpless slave, if that makes sense. I'm still a person, I'm just a person who chooses not to be an independent one. My body and my mind, in this dynamic, will be at your service. What you make of me would be yours to take pride in, and how you choose to enjoy me would be at your pleasure. That's my role in this dynamic. Emotionally, my role would be to help ""charge"" you - to be a source of energy and excitement and untamed joy. And sexually...well, you can fill in the blanks, on that one. In return, I need guidance, understanding, and structure. I need someone who can even out some of the wild energy that I bring to a relationship, someone who can channel that raw power into something productive. I need someone who understands when to push past an unfounded anxiety and when to pause and comfort. I will ask you for permission before I do things for myself - but in the event that I ask, my usual expectation is that you'd say yes unless you have some good reason not to, because I wouldn't ask if I didn't feel it were important. I need day to day, even hour to hour, management to make the most of what I have. I hate trying to impose it myself, and I will literally give you all I am if you're willing to help me grow. In short: I bring some high-quality clay. I need a good sculptor. # Kinks &amp; Sexual Stuff * Gender roles: We kinda went through this one above, didn't we :) * Transformation: For presumably obvious reasons this is a big one for me. I fantasized about changing sex before I transitioned, but I'm a fan of animal transformations as well, both partial and total. Hard to play out in person, obviously, but a very big one for me. * Hypnosis/Mental Domination: Again, probably obvious from what I've written so far. It's all about the halfway loss of control to me: knowing what's changed, knowing how I'm being manipulated/led but feeling the need to follow along anyway. I like to resist and lose, basically. I don't think I've ever gotten into a proper 100% trance the way some people talk about, it's usually more an altered frame of mind and a sense of 'playing along'. * Pregnancy &amp; related: Unfortunately not something I'm biologically capable of, but it's a super hot thought anyhow. I have a hard time finding an image that turns me on more than the idea of being heavily pregnant and being looked at by the father of my children, with the sense that he's just savoring me and my body. I have something of a 'hucow' thing too, although the term always seemed weird to me. * Pet play: Ohhhhh yes. Put me in a kennel on the floor and lock me in, oh please oh please oh please. For me, this is a 'soft' kink; it's about embarrassment, vulnerability, and praise-in-subservience. It's hard for me to explain the line between being warmly humiliated and being degraded in my head; the best I can do is ""oh, look at you, you're so happy in your place with &lt;X embarrassing/role-signalling attribute, e.g. collar, pregnant belly, etc&gt;"" is comforting and hot, ""you worthless slut"" is not. * Restraining: I think I like this one. Certainly I like the *idea* of being tied up and helpless. But I've never gotten to try it in person beyond just wearing a collar. I'm pretty sure it's a like though so I put it in. * Some degree of...I dunno what to call it. ""Sister-subbing""? I've never done this, but I actually find the idea of a submissive woman guiding me to join her under her man incredibly exciting. So for you couples, there's one for ya. * Sorta-kinda ageplay. I have *zero* interest in calling someone ""daddy"" (it's a huge turn-off), but I do like the power asymmetry that ageplay can bring to the table. Kind of picky about this, but I really enjoy it if it's done right. # The Good Stuff I Bring * Enthusiasm: You will find very few people more enthusiastic than me when I get in to a thing. Once you get past shyness or anxiety from me, I light up like a Christmas tree. * Intelligence: The last time I wrote one of these posts, I got some folks who were sort of blowing me off as an arrogant bitch for explaining this. But I really am very, very smart, something most people notice within a pretty short time in a room with me. * Libido: I like sexy things. Even when I'm not in a mood to initiate them, I'm not hard to warm up. Quite frankly, I consider being available sexually a big part of my role in the kind of relationship I'm looking for, and you can expect me to make a priority of it. * Malleability: I am willing, even eager, to be reshaped in the directions you want. Some things are harder for me to change than others, of course, but again, I think of this as part of my responsibilities as a sub - to be available to be changed as my partner/dom/owner/husband/whatever sees fit. * Sweet: I care deeply about people in general, and in the right mood, I'm very affectionate. I'm not hard to make happy when you know me well, and when I'm happy I can light up a room in no time. * Honest: Absolutely and completely. This is essential to me, both for myself and from you. I don't tolerate dishonesty in a relationship, nor do I ask you to. Ultimately, the goal is to carve out a life for two, and that cannot happen if the people involved are hiding things from half of the relationship. * Flexible: I'm open-minded, and I'm not going to hate you for a suggestion as long as it's not something grossly immoral. If there's something you want to try, bring it up! # The Bad Stuff About Me * Unstable: My moods are all over the damn place. I can go from extremely cheerful to depressed in two seconds flat for just about no reason, and I have no real knowledge of how to control this to much of any degree. * Appearance: As above, I'm not ugly, but I am overweight. Hopefully you're either okay with that or into it, at least for now - although this is one of those things I'd really like to change but lack the self-direction to do. * Temper: It's rare for my temper to burst out, but it does once in a while, and it can be pretty biting. I'm getting better about this with time, though. * Discipline: Outside of kink and romance, this is part of why I want this sort of life. Directing myself even a little bit takes enormous energy. This is a glaring weakness, and something that the best mental-health professionals I've been able to find have been utterly unable to help me with - but past experience suggests that outsourcing it to someone else works pretty well. In short: this is a part of what I get out of giving you a body and mind to play with. If you're cool with that, note that the second secret word is cheeseburger. * Hangups: Despite my fairly kinky personality, I'm sexually inexperienced. Until I transitioned in my early 20s, I hadn't even been touched sexually before, and I remain a sorta-kinda virgin depending on where you draw the line. These are things that can be worked past - but they do have to be worked past. ----------------- # Things You Might or Might Not Like About Me * Shy: I'm hesitant to do new things sometimes, and I can be quite self-conscious. This can be a pro if you like a girl who is vulnerable and a bit embarrassed by things, or a con if you don't like having to tread carefully. * Geeky/weird: I've been a pretty serious gamer in the past, I spend a lot of time learning random things that catch my interest, I'm not great at socializing (I usually get along fine but have trouble going from acquaintance to friend), and I tend to find odd things engaging. A plus if you have a similar like for interesting details, gaming, or fun trivia, a con if you just want me to shut up about whatever random thing I just learned on a Wikipedia binge. * Trans: Obviously this is a big personal-preference thing. I don't want the trans aspects of my body particularly emphasized (in particular, I have no interest in ever topping anyone), but if my history as a trans woman appeals to you, that's totally okay (a past partner, for example, liked the fact that being a woman - and thus the inferior in our relationship - was a deliberate choice of mine). * Odd kink list: I'm in to a kind of odd mix of things, I assume because of my weird history. Pro if you're into my various odd likes, con if you're not. * Inexperienced in person: I've been kinky *online* for forever, but I've only had a handful of sexual encounters in person. Pro if you like exploration/teaching, con if you want someone who is already fully comfortable with sex. * Timid: It is very difficult for me to trust and surrender. I -can- do it, but it takes doing and time, and it relies on you being able to handle me when I'm freaking out a little. The pro here is that once I trust you, I'm an open book; the con is that it's not easy to get me there. ------------------ # What I'm Looking For * A man - or possibly a woman or couple, although these might tweak things somewhat - who is interested in both caring for and being served by me. Let's say somewhere +- 5 years from me, so 22-32 or so, but I'm not *super* picky about that within reason. * Local. I am willing to consider possible people at a distance, but only in cases of a very good match. * Generally left-ish gender politics. It is absolutely essential that I be able to trust that your enjoyment of this relationship dynamic is limited to us and to consenting situations. If you're a legitimate redpiller or like Trump, we're not gonna get along, and I'm sure as hell not going to trust you to the degree necessary for such a dynamic. * Intelligence: I like to learn things and explore, and I would like a partner who wants to do so as much as I do. A good education, broad scientific and philosophical interests, a willingness to consider strange ideas and hypotheticals, and a love for finding joy in looking at mundane things is a big part of making me like you as a person, not just as a sexual/romantic partner. Basically, I'm looking for someone who'll look at a rock and go ""holy shit, there was a glacier here thousands of years ago and it left a scratch there and that's crazy cool"". * Trustworthiness: **Absolutely 100% essential**. If I do not trust you, I will not commit to a relationship with you, because I cannot be vulnerable enough to have my needs met. This isn't just not lying, it's understanding what ways I can be taken control of and how far that control can be taken. Occasional missteps are one thing, but being pushed too far makes me close up quickly. * Broadly clean-shaven-ish appearance: Despite my politics and background, I still have a lot of the culture of my upbringing. Tattoos and heavy piercings are major turn-offs, and smoking/drug use (beyond perhaps occasional legal pot) is a hard 'no'. I'm not super picky about weight, although my ideal is certainly a lot closer to healthy than I'm at; some degree of fitness would be nice. * Financially stable: Well yeah, this is a plus, and I won't lie about that. Obviously of particular importance if you want me in the home full-time at some point. * Personally stable: I am a moody, chaotic, difficult to manage person. I need someone who can roll with that, and ideally act as a counterbalance. I am childish in a lot of ways and need a paternal hand, something that I think the sort of man I'm after would generally enjoy giving. * Dominant, but not mean: I want you to take joy (and yes, sexual satisfaction) in taking me under your arm. I want you to look at me and feel proud that I've chosen my place under you, and I want you to encourage me *to* take that place, with the knowing that me being in a relationship with you is implicit permission to shape me. But for the most part, I'm after encouragement, leading, and gentle conditioning, not abuse. The line is obviously a bit fuzzy, but if your interest is mainly sadistic, I'm not the girl for you. I think that'll do for now. If you got through that whole thing, bravo. And as I said at the start, if you think we'd be a good fit, no matter your situation/sex/number of people, **send me a PM, seriously, it's cool**. The worst I'll do is say no. No fear, guys, I just wrote a long-ass novel about how I want to be some guy's toy, you're not going to insult me if you're not actually mean."

Thus my presence here. I'd love to find a Dominant woman who'd find pleasure in tasking me with playing, not because I would enjoy it, but because that kind of power and control fuels Her. I'd be willing to show Her my compliance over Skype if we've built up some trust as that would enhance the feeling of vulnerability for me. Now I do have limits...namely blood, scat, extreme pain (though honestly I don't know my limits), children, or anything that would get us in actual trouble. Beyond that I'm flexible. On the kink front, I find particular arousal in anal penetration, prostate play, mild cbt, edging, denial, ruined orgasms, that sort of thing. If this sounds like something that might appeal to you, then I look forward to hearing from you and chatting a bit more :)"

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. Let's start with some definitions slave: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. Dominant: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. Master/slave relationship: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. What will this relationship consist of: Active submission: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. Daily controls: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now, rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. Daily tasks: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. Weekly sessions: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. Punishments: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. What will be expected of you: Commitment: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. Devotion: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. Communication: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. Trust: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. Emotional intimacy: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. Physical intimacy: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. What you can expect from me: A Strong Hand: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. A Warm Heart: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. You'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. If you're interested Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon."
553,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,20[F4R] Little/middle looking for possible mentor?,5,93759p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/93759p/20f4r_littlemiddle_looking_for_possible_mentor/,2018-07-31 05:26:17,"Hello! Ive been fiddling around with this idea for a couple of months now but only recently came to terms with me genuinely wanting to give it a try. I have posted a few other places in the last while so, yes, I have made a few posts here and there but I am still looking. I live in New York and would like someone who may be on similar time lines or at least can be flexible with scheduling. Feeling like I actually matter is pretty important, visa versa, but I understand about jobs and more. Life is life but knowing ahead of time of whats going on is always appreciated. I have three animals but the one I own is a dog which her name is Cookie, a Shih Tzu, and she's about eight. I really do love all animals though and have had many throughout my life. :P My interests are really wide; I love music and some of my favorite artists right now are Oh Wonder. I love reading but I rarely find time to do it anymore, writing, hiking, arts and crafts, YouTube, some gaming, and a few others that will come up as we talk! Im also pretty in tune with spiritual stuff and just recently got my very first Tarot cards which I love so, so much! Ill also add that I am quite tall, 58, and I am overweight but genuinely putting effort into getting it off. I have red hair and hazel eyes. I also have very porcelain skin but absolutely no freckles, shocker. :P Sorry if that isnt your thing but wanted to put it out there so I didnt waste your time! So, now on to the whole mentor ordeal, I know this isn't common but bare with me! I've been a little for a long while now but, sadly, I haven't been able to really explore it. I have a ton of problems with letting myself feel comfortable with the role and with added anxiety/depression, I don't get far very easily. I've fluttered around headspaces and what I could imagine as to what I like but I just haven't had anything to give me a reason to why I should do it. When I should do it. How I should do it. You get the gist. I want to explore this and I would hope youd want the same. I'd basically want someone experienced, someone who is willing to give me their time and patience, their compassion and honesty, and their vulnerability and communication. I am not looking for some friends with benefits, in fact, I am not at all sexual in littlespace and anything sexual is a super hard limit for me. Do not push this, please. I'm looking for someone who could possibly give me their nights because, as I've learned, night time is the best time for me and I'd really love a routine of where we could possibly have a ""littlespace"" time. Which would include something like maybe voice chatting so finding someone who can give me some of that time would be fantastic. This could include doing arts and crafts and you helping me! Or it could be literally us watching a movie and chatting. Or it could be us talking about life and the super deep serious stuff. It doesn't matter because I want you to feel comfortable and I want to feel comfortable. I want a companion out of all this, someone who is there for me, and I will be the exact same to you. I also really want to add this in, I do not feel comfortable with someone who is already in a relationship with someone. I am so sorry to have to put this here but I just rather avoid that type of stress/drama. We can talk about details; don't be afraid to ask! This could be a part of where you are merely a temporary mentor for me or it could be long term. The ball is in your court but, please, if you have read all of this to this very point; don't waste your nor my time because I am not a FWB. I would like to move off Reddit when we feel more comfortable, but please do not post in your first private message to me your Kik/discord/skype/whatever. I want to get to know you and you should feel the same! I understand if youre on a phone, just let me know ahead of time, because then I wont mind but if its literally just your user then thatll be a no from me. I hope everyone has a good day/night! Thank you. c: &lt;3"

You will give me everything. I'm a strict and caring Master and I seek a forever slave. ",1,93nzel,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/93nzel/26_m4f_are_you_unhappy_do_you_seek_guidance_and/,2018-08-01 21:03:33,"If you read to the end of this, it might be the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. Let's start with some definitions slave: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. Dominant: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. Master/slave relationship: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. What will this relationship consist of: Active submission: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. Daily controls: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now, rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. Daily tasks: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. Weekly sessions: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. Punishments: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. What will be expected of you: Commitment: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. Devotion: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. Communication: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. Trust: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. Emotional intimacy: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off.

556,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,[23 m4f] Witty Male Minion Seeks Brilliant Overlady for Shared D/s and Life Adventures (SW Ontario),1,95phcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/95phcp/23_m4f_witty_male_minion_seeks_brilliant_overlady/,2018-08-09 06:00:56,"Minions, like me, have been on this planet for a long time. Were all different, but we all share the same goal; to serve, in my case, the most brilliant overlady I can find. Making my dominant happy is a wondrous reason for my existence. But Ive yet to find my perfect fit, and I have no other choice but to keep moving. Until I find the brilliant-est, dominant-est overlady to whom I can submit to, and with whom I can share both D/s and life adventures with. **Who I am:** In brief, Im perfectly imperfect. Im a 23 year old heteroflexible male submissive, who is monogamous with some wriggle room. I dont see being submissive as a role I take on, but rather who I am. This doesnt mean I submit willy-nilly to anyone who calls themselves a dominant; it means that my submissive traits are always a part of me and that I embrace them. As such I would like a Female Lead Relationship (FLR) which I would hope allows both of us to flourish. Moreover, on top of being a submissive, Im first and foremost a human being who is kind, caring, supportive, and an active listener. Every chance I get I will crack a pun, though I ask you to romaine calm and lettuce see if theyre any good. With that, you can probably guess Im a fan of food and youd be correct. Ive worked as a cook for nine years and always love to experiment in the kitchen. Additionally, I have a few life criteria that I try and follow regardless of everything. Two of the main criteria that Ive defined for myself are that I must be creative/express my creativity and that I must always be learning. However, the criterion that may be the most important is to be happy or work towards happiness. **What I'm looking for:** In brief, I'm looking for someone who's imperfectly perfect. I'm looking for a dominant woman and like me, its not a role she takes on, but rather who she is. So long as I'm within her sexuality range, I'm not looking for anything specific. Ideally, I'm looking for someone who is monogamous as well. However, as I said I have some wriggle room on the matter. I would really like someone that is both nurturing and sadistic as she would want to build me up while provoking all sorts of delicious reactions. Please note that Im very reactiony which will cause me to curse and try to run away from whatever is causing me to react (I cant help it). Moreover, I'm looking for someone who would also like a FLR, where given time it could become a complete exchange of authority. I would like a dominant woman to be close to my age (within approx. 10 years) as I want the longest possible time to grow and be together. She should also enjoy puns, banter, can give as good as she gets, and bonus points for being able to use my own logic against me. **Deal-breakers:** Being dismissive or unsupportive of mental health challenges is a hard deal-breaker for me. Im very upfront with my own mental health battles, and would like you to be as well. Im not asking to be fixed nor offering to fix someone. However, like myself, I expect you to be maintaining your mental health, and, if you do experience mental health issues, youre working on improving it. Recreational drugs are something I dont partake in, on any level, and I would like you to be the same. Alcohol is fine, though not to excess. We can discuss what that means. I enjoy the occasional drink, when Im able, but Ive always done so responsibly and Ive never been drunk. Dishonesty is a deal-breaker because it undermines the communication that is absolutely vital to any relationship and especially a D/s dynamic. Having a past and or secrets that you dont want to share is fine. But please be honest with the impact that those may have. Personally, Im extremely honest and open and dont expect the same level from you, but its a welcome surprise if you are. Lastly, well its not exactly a deal-breaker - just impossible - and thats to be sexier than I am; since I plan on being the eye candy of the relationship. =P **Thank you for taking the time to read through this and I hope to hear from you.** Sincerely, Rib P.S Im more than happy to clear up anything and answer any questions about the ad and or me. \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ **Kinks (optional reading):** Consent  Im a straightforward person and find when consent is exchanged in that manner its damn right sexy and desirable. Vulnerability  Opening up my defenses takes a lot for me to do. So when Im in a vulnerable state, whether emotionally or physically, I can easily slip into a state of bliss per se; it just takes being with the right person. Bratting  I like to have fun and dont take things over seriously and if possible push the envelope with what Im able to get away with or provoke. However, I do my best to be respectful with my bratting and keep it within the confines of whats been negotiated and consented to. Pegging  Well pegging holds a special place for me as it does so many wonderful things and creates so many wonderful feelings. Moreover, its fun not being able to walk after a good pegging. Sensory Deprivation  As I mentioned, I react a lot to stimuli so anything that enhances that is a wonderful and damn right horrendous thing for me."

Your mind, body, heart and soul?",3,961djp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/961djp/25m4f_seeking_an_online_submissive_to_love_guide/,2018-08-10 08:54:40,"""Everyone is screwed up, broken, clingy, and scared- Ann Lamont Saw that quote somewhere, and I guess it seemed an appropriate way to begin this personal. And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. A slave gives up her freedom of choice to her Master. If you read to the end of this, it might be the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. Let's start with some definitions slave: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. Dominant: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. Master/slave relationship: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. What will this relationship consist of: Active submission: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. Daily controls: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now, rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. Daily tasks: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. Weekly sessions: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. Punishments: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. What will be expected of you: Commitment: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. Devotion: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. Communication: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. Trust: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. Emotional intimacy: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. Physical intimacy: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. What you can expect from me: A Strong Hand: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. A Warm Heart: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. You'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. If you're interested tell me a little bit about yourself, and what you're looking for. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon."

In the vanilla world I love psychology (doing my masters in clinical), digital art and painting. Im an amateur photographer and love taking pictures. I like driving especially at night with the windows down as its very soothing. I love reading! Im also known to relax to far too many Netflix episodes at one time (totally dont mind giving a partner access to my Netflix and amazon). Im not incredibly social and dont go out very often from anxiety but Id love to ease into a public scene if you desire as we get to know and adapt to each other. Im a naturally born submissive. Ever since my first sexual encounter I felt joy from pleasing a woman and being subservient and serving them. It felt most comfortable and fulfilling for me! As I grew older and discovered bdsm and kink lifestyles I found people writing about their experiences as slaves and started looking at bdsm images. Id find myself imagining I was the woman submitting in those situations and as I discovered femdom I knew that I was meant to be a slave for a partner. I feel pure freedom, empowerment, pleasure, and joy from being able to empower and embolden someone. Physically, emotionally, mentally, and sexually. The image of being their property makes me feel calm and even helps with my anxiety and depression when I JD from scrubs like escape to my mini fantasies and worlds in my head. I truly desire to be a unique object and outlet for someone. A confidant they can openly express and share any fantasy or desire without fear of judgement no matter how dark or extreme and I love the trust honesty and communication of it all. Its such a raw and primal expression of ourselves that its truly a beautiful relationship of two people. I have had trouble meeting anyone to talk to that is actually open to such experiences and lifestyles and I wanted to try here. Please if youre local to Los Angeles or the Valley send me a PM if youre looking to own a slave or sub or have considered it. And please dont be shy about yourself! I think the deeper the submission and dominance goes the more openness and vulnerability there is so Im open to hear and talk about anything you have an attraction too! I also have a kik or hangouts to chat with easier! Just please drop your usernames or emails for it and Ill get back to you! Or ask for mine! Heres to hoping for good luck and acceptance and I hope you have a good day! "

Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. Punishments: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. What will be expected of you: Commitment: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. Devotion: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. Communication: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. Trust: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. Emotional intimacy: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. Physical intimacy: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. What you can expect from me: A Strong Hand: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. A Warm Heart: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. You'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. If you're interested tell me a little bit about yourself, and what you're looking for. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon."
562,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"32 [M4F] - I'm a switch in a submissive mood, looking for a domme/switch for casual, kinky de-stressing",0,8qwv5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/8qwv5p/32_m4f_im_a_switch_in_a_submissive_mood_looking/,2018-06-14 08:53:55,"I hope youre having a nice Wednesday. Long story short, work things have been incredibly stressful this week, and Im in the mood to turn my mind off, and lose control for a bit. Specifically, Im looking to lose control to you. Im 32m, single, and when it comes to kink, Im a bit of a switch, but generally lean dominant. Its been awhile since Ive taken a submissive role, but since Ive had to make a lot of stressful decisions this week, Id like to hand the reins over to you. To be clear, Im not looking to use you to vent, and my mental health is just dandy, just looking to de-stress in a fun way. As for you, maybe youre a bit bored this evening, maybe just horny. Maybe youre curious about having control over somebody, but have been too shy to explore that, or maybe youre a seasoned domme looking for her newest sub. Im very open-minded, and Im up for anything from something very fleeting (performing a quick 10min task for you), to being controlled all night, to something ongoing over several days/weeks/indefinitelywhatever you have in mind. Im into a wide variety of kinks, and would enjoy doing my best to fulfill whatever ideas you have in mind. Here is a list of some, but it is not exhaustive and Im willing to try whatever comes to mind as long as its safe, sane, and within my limits (also listed below). * Orgasm Control: Edging/Forced/Ruined/Denied. Giving control of my sexual pleasure to somebody I just met makes me feel vulnerable but excited. I love the suspense of not knowing if/when Im going to get release, and the thrill of knowing somebody I barely know has that power over me. Im not above begging when I get desperate. * Humiliation/degradation: This is pretty wide-ranging and gets back to that vulnerability. In my everyday life, I can be very confident and dont always take well to authority. Being called names or submitting to humiliating, belittling, or embarrassing tasks for your amusement, while remaining very polite and respectful, really breaks me into that submissive mindset. It makes me so uncomfortable, but turns me on. * Light to medium pain: Spanking, wooden spoons, rubber bands, clamps, CBT. This pushes a lot of the same buttons as humiliation, just in a different way. * Forced exercise: Makes me feel the same way as the last two in many ways. * Bondage/restrictions: Restricting my movement, whether with rope/twine, or just rules about how I can move around (walking vs crawling). Not being allowed to say common words, having to refer to myself or to you in a certain way. Rules about use of furniture. These sorts of things can be a subtle, frustrating, and/or persistent reminder of my submissive role. * Creative/unusual: One of the great things about the internet is being able to explore your fantasies. I like when you are willing to share a creative or unusual fantasy, and let me be your guinea pig. I can give you a few examples of these Ive encountered when we talk, if you like. This is getting long, so I will stop here, but I have several kinks beyond this list and I can share more with you in private. It is not necessary that you like all or even most of these, but wanted to give you some idea of my mindset as a submissive. Limits include illegal, involving friends/family, dangerous, bodily fluids (pee/bladder control is ok), showing face, permanent damage. Looks-wise, I am 510, average body type (sort of a dad bod, but have no kids), short brown hair, brown eyes, tan, stubble. I am open to any age and body type, as long as you are 18+. I am willing to send a faceless pic with any custom verification, and I can communicate through voice, cam, or text chat, depending on your preference. As the submissive, I am perfectly willing to use your messenger of choice. Thanks if you made it this far. Please send me a message if youd be interested, or even if youre not sure and just want to chat. We can introduce ourselves, and take it from there."
563,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,25 [F4A] Sub / Europe - The missing piece to experiencing love vividly.,4,8rrg6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/8rrg6g/25_f4a_sub_europe_the_missing_piece_to/,2018-06-18 00:41:22,"Ive been reminded often enough the right person might be reading, so its hard for me to justify not trying again, even if putting myself out there has been overwhelming. Some basics: Im attracted to all genders, live in Europe and am looking for someone who is based here as well, for something with the potential to grow into a lasting long-term relationship. I want something in person, even if it must be long distance at the start, provided we can meet beforehand. The most important things to me: being seen as a person instead of a doll you can mold, and slowly shaping the extent of the D/s connection to whatever feels natural to both, if we ever grow to care about each other. Finding someone to share my life with has been at the end of my to dos list - I have many ambitions, although they dont often translate clearly outwards, mostly because I strive to annihilate ego in all I do; trying to create work that has a positive impact, do what I can towards building a kinder and better world, that is what truly matters to me. Ive struggled to contain the amount of feelings inside of me, to make sense of all of it, to access myself as good, or bad, yet Ive been slowly coming into my own identity, and it feels as if its finally time. There might be some seeming contradictions. But I can offer you the certainty of knowing who I am, and therefore what I can give you, and what I want. Someone who can enrich my life, my understanding of the world and my own ever-evolving sense of being, rather than looking to complete it. Someone to practice love, openness, growth, vulnerability with. What would be a more beautiful way to explore that, than a connection of this kind, with all the intimacy it entails? I want an opportunity to feel safe enough to expose myself, my truth, my own darkness, as well as provide the space for someone else to do the same, creating something real together. I want the risk that comes with reaching for something total, once trust is built and love is felt, instead of wasting years tip-toeing around my own fears. Looking for it here not because specific kinks are important for me or my sex life, but because I want to experience love vividly, and I want it to be pure, and it feels as though this might be the missing piece. Its not difficult to find people that want to tie me up or hold me down, but sharing this understanding of what a relationship can be with a partner, and having their core be compatible with mine, thats hard, because the overall psychology of D/s and what that can bring to a connection mean so much me. I want someone with whom this resonates, whose believes align with mine, who has the ability to see through me and make me want to stay, when all I usually feel is like leaving everything behind. Someone with a sense of adventure thats also directed inwards, who finds the idea of building a shelter for, and in someone else fulfilling. "

A passionate, skilled, strict and caring Master seeks his forever slave (online at first)",5,8u8zv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/8u8zv9/26m4f_you_will_give_me_your_heart_and_your_soul/,2018-06-27 21:56:26,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non\-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound\-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship \(trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.\) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self\-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now \(although I do have my favorites\), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time\-intensive \(I will work with your schedule\). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real\-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare \(the part where I serve you and your needs\) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you:** *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear.

To be honest, I've had a rough couple of weeks and am looking for a toy to help me forget and relax. I would love to have a handsome, mature, creative man that enjoys serving and pleasing. A bit about me: I am a 42 year old successful, intelligent woman who holds a pretty high-stress, powerful job in my everyday life. In the free time that I have, I enjoy jogging, reading, relaxing at the lake, and a good stand-up special to make me laugh :). My approach to this type of experience is one that places the utmost importance on trust, communication and respect. I would hope this would be the norm, but unfortunately, it is not always. It is a two-way street, and although the specific standards may differ between individuals, they must be fully communicated and discussed before anything begins. D/s requires vulnerability and authenticity for it to be a satisfying experience and no one should ever make themselves vulnerable without well-defined boundaries and any and all concerns addressed beforehand. Please be prepared to have a real discussion about this... not just a scripted listed of limits. That said I'd like to be very upfront about what I'm looking for and limitations from my side. Because of my aforementioned career and other personal circumstances, I unfortunately have to be very discreet. My preferred method of interaction with you is over mic. That said, I am a very visual person, and I love being in control over the physical body of a man in real-time and seeing the non-verbal feedback to inform my next move. In other words, seeing you on cam while I speak to you on mic. I'm fully aware this may be a full-stop deal breaker for most.. and I completely accept that. I'm just putting out my honest desire to see if there is a match. Regardless, trust will always be established before anything moves forward. Now, when it comes to explaining what I enjoy doing, I hesitate to give a cold list of kinks.. but I understand the need to match general interests. So, generally, I enjoy JOI, body inspections, orgasm control, edging, ruined orgasms. Again, the chemistry between two people can organically lead us into many other types of kinks, so these are not definitive. Things I will absolutely not do are: findom, bathroom play, blood and (hopefully this would be an obvious one) anything illegal. Also, I am not necessarily looking for a long-term commitment but it is something I'm open to if the chemistry is right. I have a very soft and tender personality, but not without the ability to be firm and disciplined with you when it is necessary. I will always respect you and have no interest in being harmful or cruel. As far as what I'm looking for in a sub: Absolutely my #1 requirement is a dedication to clear and honest communication. Without clear, authentic communication about what each other are feeling, this doesn't work. I gain no pleasure from a silent partner. Getting to know you and learning about what motivates your desires is what fuels the majority of my pleasure and attraction to a sub. On a more physical, primal level though I enjoy a fit man with some body hair and a nice smile. I know exactly what I like physically in a man and can give very specific details when we connect. Like I said at the beginning of this, I've been stressed, so this may not be the best or most clear representation that I could've given.. but I tried. My apologies if it's been rambling or winding. I'll do my best to clear up anything for you in a one-to-one conversation if interested. If you'd like to try it, please send me a message here on reddit.

In the best interest of both of us, this is going to be meticulously written, and long. Keep in mind, this is big-girl me talking. **Getting physical characteristics out of the way:** I am in my early 20s. I am a small girl with an hourglass figure. Big, bright eyes. Dark, wavy hair that falls past my shoulders. I look rather young, so if you are into that (and I hope you are), Id imagine wed have considerable physical chemistry. I prefer reasonably fit, classy men, white, hispanic or asian, no older than 35. **About you:** You are ambitious and a hard-worker. You have a zeal for living life to its fullest, and this reveals itself in the choices and decisions you make. You have an appetite for learning about the world, reveling in the elation of travel and exploration. You do not have any addictive behaviors or tendencies towards drugs, alcohol, casual sex, or video games. You are, of course, a knowledge-seeker. We can keep each other engaged for hours in thoughtful conversation. Your intelligence impresses me. But you are also *emotionally intelligent*, and highly empathetic. This is what draws me to you. This is what captivates me, mind and body, and allows me to entrust you with my vulnerability. You understand your role as a caregiver to someone with the capacity to make sense of her world, but is nevertheless fearful of it, and who needs her Daddy. You are patient, and you are honest in the words you speak. You desire to be the center of my world and little space, and to indulge in ageplay with me. **About me:** I am in school, getting a four-year degree. I am *insatiably* curious. I have a defined purpose in life, and career and life goals that lead me towards fulfilling that purpose. In my eyes, however, our relationship, your career, and my career are not (or should not be) all mutually exclusive. To me, they are vital elements of the *larger picture*: the two of us building a home and life together as a fulfilled and satisfied Daddy and babygirl couple. Well, if that is your deepest desire, as it is mine. This means that I will be supportive and encouraging of you and your aspirations. **Miscellaneous:** I am not a little who needs immediate responses from you 24/7, but what is necessary is structure, consistency, and quality to our communication and time spent together. This means that we will take time out of our evenings a few times per week for phone calls. On that note, you are ideally somewhere in North America, near EST. I am open to an LDR with the potential to be together in-person. That was a lot to read, so thank you. If you message me, I will assume you have read the above, and I will be very excited to hear from you. I understand I have not provided much about my interests, hobbies, kinks or little space activities. We can get into those one-on-one. Everything I have laid out, I feel, is a foundation for getting to know each other further. I know you are out there somewhere, Daddy, waiting to scoop me up into your arms."
568,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"23 [M4F] Brand New Submissive Ready To Take The Leap, Looking For A Domme Online",2,8wxvjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/8wxvjx/23_m4f_brand_new_submissive_ready_to_take_the/,2018-07-08 10:56:49,"Introduction First and foremost, I would like to say hello to anyone who may have stumbled upon this post. Whether or not you are ultimately interested, I still appreciate the time spent reading. To be entirely honest, I'm quite nervous to finally write this out. While the prospect of finding a domme is exciting, the truth of the matter is this level of vulnerability is scary. I'm generally a private person, and baring my heart like this is difficult for me. That said, being able to be vulnerable is one of the most beautiful aspects of BDSM. Over the last few weeks I have learned so much about myself, and this lifestyle. Anxiety aside, I think I'm ready to take the next big leap. Please have patience while I ramble my way through this, and explain what it is I'm looking for. About Me A little about me, agnostic to any kinks. I love to create things, and a lot of my hobbies revolve around creation. Painting watercolors, writing poetry, baking cookies. I also adore playing video games, and overthinking tv shows. Definitely an introvert, and my ideal day is a quite night in reading a book. At the moment I am a student working towards getting a degree in Behavioral and Brain Science, although I am interested in learning about anything and everything. What else is important? Thinking of stuff off the cuff is surprisingly hard. Thor is the hottest Avenger. There we go, got to the truly important information. In all seriousness I guess I should stop stalling, and get to the blush inducing parts. Interests The honest truth is I don't know what my interests are, at least not for certain. There's a fundamental difference between fantasy and reality. Given I have no prior experience in this world, it seems misleading to me to simply spout off a list of kinks. What I can do is explain why certain things sound appealing. Submissiveness in general seems like a wonderful jumping off point. For a very long time now I've had this need to belong to another person, that's the best way I've been able to describe it. There's a quote I remember from years ago that has always stuck with me. ""To give up control is to be free,"" and with that in mind I am ready to be free. I definitely lean heavily towards the more gentle side, loving the cute stuff as much as the naughty. Often, I find myself fantasizing about a hand wrapped around my neck. It's not squeezing, just gently caressing the delicate skin. The emotion that fills me with more than anything isn't fear or excitement, instead it's comfort. Which at the end of the day is what I'm looking for, comfort. Maybe you found that little tidbit informational, maybe not. Ultimately I'm ready and willing to explore, try new things out together in an attempt to learn where my place is in this world. Limits My limits are much more defined compared to kinks. Although I am prepared to push myself, these are issues I am not going to budge on. Hopefully you can respect that fact. I'm against anything nonconsensual, open and honest communication is of the utmost importance. Anal play, fluids, age play, humiliation, and severe pain are also a hard limit. This should go without saying, but aftercare is a must. On Trust What's most important to me is trust. There's no greater show of trust than to give yourself to another completely, as I mentioned at the top of this (seems like forever ago with all my rambling). Being exposed, vulnerable, raw. To then have that fear and uncertainty be met with adoration instead of admonishment, it's a validation of the bond that's been built. Trust like that takes time, it's a never ending process that continues as both parties grow. I'm not expecting, nor do I want to jump right in to playing. Let's get to know one another first. What I'm looking for is something longterm, so that we can built a genuine trust with one another. It's not about finding any domme, it's about finding the right one. If my only goal was to get off, there are easier avenues. With another person comes a deeper emotional connection. Closing Statements I know online is difficult, but I'm ready to put in the effort necessary to make this work. I also know the prospect of a brand new sub must be daunting, and is a big responsibility to take on. If you want a poetic way of looking at it, I am a piece of marble for you to carve yourself upon. Quite honestly you are a saint if you've made it this far. If I've happened to garnered your interest wit my jumbled thoughts, I would absolutely love to hear from you. Feel free to ask me any questions, I'm sure I'm bound to have forgotten something important. Even if you're not interested, I'm more than happy just to chat. Thank you so very much for taking the time and energy to read all the way through, I really do appreciate it. Have a wonderful rest of your day, and thank you again."

Thus my presence here. I'd love to find a Dominant woman who'd find pleasure in tasking me with playing, not because I would enjoy it, but because that kind of power and control fuels Her. I'd be willing to show Her my compliance over Skype if we've built up some trust as that would enhance the feeling of vulnerability for me. Now I do have limits...namely blood, scat, extreme pain (though honestly I don't know my limits), children, or anything that would get us in actual trouble. Beyond that I'm flexible. On the kink front, I find particular arousal in anal penetration, prostate play, mild cbt, edging, denial, ruined orgasms, that sort of thing. If this sounds like something that might appeal to you, then I look forward to hearing from you and chatting a bit more :)"

I'm pleased with some of the responses I've gotten, and I'm exploring some fun possibilities. Still, I can't help but wonder if perhaps I should be posing a different question. So now, in addition to sending me info about your interests, disposition, and what you look like, I'd also like to know what feminism means to you, and/or how feminism informs the way you interact in kinky spaces with submissives. This will tell me a lot about what you're made of (... and what you could make me do). Me: 22 years old, tough n' tender service submissive. Tiny. Delightful. Devoted. Sharp as a whip. Curvy, tattooed, would fit right in on Suicide Girls, probably. There's some more info about what I look like in my [past ](URL [posts](URL and I will, of course, send you a photo if I'm interested. You are: 25-45 (ideally late 20's, early thirties) residing in the city of Chicago and able to host, experienced with ongoing kinky relationships. You live your life with compassion, care, and positivity. You're able to express yourself emotionally and be vulnerable; you seek this in others. You have an intuition about people, can catch on to what they're hiding and what they might be afraid of. You're stable and feel confident you can provide stable, steady support and meet with regularity. You're kinky as fuck, and understand that a scene is nothing without mutual trust, safety, and open communication. You're a sadist, hedonist, a Daddy Dom, or perhaps a whole other combination of archetypes who love affectionate, firm, uplifting, consensual cruelty/degradation. When it comes to men, I don't have a ""type"" at all, though I'm partial to men who look like [Alton Brown](URL and have the sadistic, devious streak of his Cutthroat Kitchen persona. I also enjoy men who dress well - not in any specific style, but in a way that you can clearly tell they put care into it. Your outlook is much more important than what you look like. Attraction can always grow, provided there's a seed of lust there to start from. I'm flexible around what I'm looking for, always trying to find that sweet spot between having the structure and boundaries I need, and being open enough to account for multiple possibilities. So at the moment I'm open to: Full-on Dominants, semi-casual play partners, people who just wanna be part of group sex with me, and people who might want to go with the flow. (Not my strong suit, admittedly, but I'm trying.) I'm into: patience, enthusiastic consent, emotional vulnerability, compassion, open-mindedness, affectionate cruelty, being appreciated beyond my body (and what I can accomplish with it), learning new things, trying new things, sessions that last entire afternoons, frank yet sensitive communication, feeling special, and being special. I also love The Office more than anything in this world. Also into: service submission, spanking, structure, consequences for misbehaviour, ample praise, filthy blowjobs, dirty talk, the nurturing nature of Daddy Doms, discussing kink till I'm blue in the face, hairpulling, bruises, orgasm denial, sex in public, being lovingly called a slut, affirmation, tenderly degrading piss stuff, choking, forehead kisses, nicknames just for me, being held down, being pushed around, being a messy girl. And, well. Lots more. *** IMPORTANT*** Please PM me if interested - and only PM. If you leave a comment, K*k me, Fetlife me, show up at my house... You're going to be blocked. No take-backs. And as usual, if you don't live in Chicago (the city proper), cannot host (this is a big one), have zero kink experience, send me a dick pic, and/or don't pay close attention to the details of the post, I will not hesitant to block you. And, I can't believe I still have to say this, but: DON'T BE A CREEP. (ALSO, PLEASE DON'T TELL ME ABOUT YOUR DICK. I DON'T CARE, UNLESS WE ARE IN A SCENE AND IT IS, CONSENSUALLY, ALL UP IN AND AROUND MY (sub)SPACE. THEN I'M INTO IT. BUT ONLY THEN.)

If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non\-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound\-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship \(trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.\) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self\-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now \(although I do have my favorites\), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time\-intensive \(I will work with your schedule\). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real\-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare \(the part where I serve you and your needs\) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you:** *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep\-seated fears \(even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly\-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. *What you can expect from me*: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short.

If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non\-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound\-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship \(trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.\) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self\-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now \(although I do have my favorites\), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time\-intensive \(I will work with your schedule\). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real\-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare \(the part where I serve you and your needs\) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you:** *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this.

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul.

I have been dabbling into the usual femdom kinks (I'd love to elaborate but keeping this post brief), and lately gone wandering into more embarassing stuff like mild feminisation, exhibitionism, and some others. after reading a few too many kinky erotica and getting inspired by lesbian seduction-y videos. It just sounds so so wrong for a guy, as I'm not like that personality wise IRL and quite dominant in other areas, yet find submission and vulnerability this inexplicably brings along rather erotic at the same time for some reason. I haven't been able to talk about it much with anyone who'd enjoy this due to the sensitive nature of it, so would love to explore this with anyone who liked the sound of this, in any way, be it roleplay, exchange casual messages, discuss situations, or even through audio/cam. I'd love to explore this dynamic in any way you'd like, and I'm open to including other things that you find entertaining. Outside of these, I'm passionate about photography, modern art, craft beer, british panel shows, and pizza. I'm a slim, fit lad from the UK, hung, with average build. I have access to a Skype cam, mic, Kik, or anywhere else that'd you'd prefer. Shoot me a PM anytime, cheers."

A passionate, skilled, strict and caring Master seeks his forever slave (online at first)",2,8p4qcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/8p4qcx/26m4f_you_will_give_me_your_heart_and_your_soul/,2018-06-07 07:51:35,"Welcome, and thank you for being here. If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non\-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound\-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship \(trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.\) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self\-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now \(although I do have my favorites\), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time\-intensive \(I will work with your schedule\). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real\-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare \(the part where I serve you and your needs\) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you:** *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep\-seated fears \(even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly\-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. *What you can expect from me*: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon."

That being said, trust and, honest communication is essential. I'm a dominant with sadistic tendencies from Vancouver that has just finished attending university for environmental science. For the past four years, I've been casually exploring the Victoria and Vancouver kink scenes, mostly through instructional/newbie classes combined with a couple of regular munches. Beyond the educational and social components of community, I am unlikely to stray as I'm not much of a voyeur nor an exhibitionist. I suppose that leaves me in the fairly green territory, but, I know when to admit I don't know something, and am very respectful of boundaries and consent. I'm quite tall (6'3""), somewhat heavy set (although, this is changing after going to the gym regularly for the last 3 months), educated, non-smoking, drug and disease free, open minded, and comfortable with who I am. I enjoy learning to the point where I am always reading/working on something that has piqued my interest. Ideally, I'll find someone else that enjoys deep conversations. When I want my mind to wander, painting, music and the occasional video game does the trick. My exploration has led to my six primary interests: bondage/movement restriction, impact play/pain, breeding/bareback sex, degradation, service, and ANR. For bondage, I conditioned my own set hemp rope about three years ago. I'm currently learning more about the nervous and circulatory systems to prevent rope injuries and how identify them. In addition to that, I need to attend more rope dojos before attempting more complicated bondage. Beyond that, I'm open to exploring other fetishes/kinks in a risk aware and consensual manner. I also happen to be quite creative, so if a dominant/submissive dynamic forms, play time and punishments will be unique and varied. I'm able to adjust to most situations quite easily so I'll always stay on top and be in command of you. I'll lead with a quiet, but, sure confidence that will have you looking to me for your instructions. Please note that I am monogamous and not poly. My Top Six Interests: * Bondage/Movement Restriction * Impact Play/Pain * Breeding/Bareback sex * Degradation * Service * ANR Hard Limits: * Needles * Watersports * Scat If you are interested send me a PM. We can communicate there or shift to skype, kik or on fetlife. "

And yes Im talking to you; the dominant and gorgeous woman who makes my knees tremble and that makes me what to submit. **About me:** In brief, Im perfectly imperfect. Im a 23 year old heteroflexible male submissive, who is monogamous with some wriggle room. I dont see being submissive as a role I take on, but rather who I am which means Im always submissive. This doesnt mean I submit willy\-nilly to anyone who calls themselves a dominant; it means that my submissive traits are always a part of me and that I embrace them. As such I would like a Female Lead Relationship \(FLR\) which I would hope allows both of us to flourish. Moreover, on top of being a submissive, Im first and foremost a human being who is kind, caring, supportive, and an active listener. Every chance I get I will crack a pun, though I ask you to romaine clam and lettuce see if theyre any good. With that, you can probably guess Im a fan of food and youd be correct. Ive worked as a cook for nine years and always love to experiment in the kitchen. Additionally, I have a few life criteria that I try and follow regardless of everything. Two of the main criteria that Ive defined for myself are that I must be creative/express my creativity and that I must always be learning. However, the criterion that may be the most important is to be happy or work towards happiness. **About you:** In brief, youre imperfectly perfect. Youre a dominant female and like me, its not a role you take on, but rather who you are. Also your sexuality can be whatever as long as it means youre attracted to me. Ideally, I would like you to be monogamous as well. However, as I said I have some wriggle room on the matter. Youre nurturing and sadistic as you want to build someone up while provoking all sorts of delicious reactions. Please note that Im very reactionate which will cause me to curse and try to run away from whatever is causing me to react \(I cant help it\). Ideally, youd like a FLR too where given time it could become a complete exchange of authority. Youre close to my age \(within approx. 10 years\) arguments sake\) as I want the longest possible time to grow and be together. You enjoy puns, banter, can give as good as you get, and bonus points for being able to use my own logic against me. **Deal\-breakers:** Being dismissive or unsupportive of mental health is a hard deal\-breaker for me. Im very upfront with my own mental health battles, and would like you to be as well. Im not asking to be fixed nor offering to fix someone. However, like myself, I expect you to be maintaining your mental health, and, if you do experience mental health issues, working on improving your mental health it. Recreational drugs are something I dont partake in, on any level, and I would like you to be the same. Alcohol is fine \- however, not to excess. I enjoy the occasional drink, when Im able, but Ive never drunk to excess or been drunk. Dishonesty, we all have secrets and thats fine. However, being dishonest or lying breeds doubt and mistrust.

Lastly, well its not exactly a deal\-breaker \- just impossible \- and thats to be sexier than I am; since I plan on being the eye candy of the relationship. =P Thank you for taking the time to read through this and I hope to hear from you.

Vulnerability  Opening up my defenses takes a lot for me to do. So when Im in a vulnerable state, whether emotionally or physically, I can easily slip into a state of bliss per se; it just takes being with the right person. Bratting  I like to have fun and dont take things over seriously and if possible push the envelope with what Im able to get away with or provoke. However, I do my best to be respectful with my bratting and keep it within the confines of whats been negotiated and consented to. Pegging  Well when I get pegged and cant walk afterwards its something special and perhaps funny at times. Sensory Deprivation  As I mentioned, I react a lot to stimuli so anything that enhances that is a wonderful and damn right horrendous thing for me."

If you are reading this personal, it is because you are also looking for something more. For one of you, for the girl this truly speaks to, at the end of this personal comes the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence of this personal. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. **Let's start with some definitions** *slave*: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non\-concrete. Look for the difference between slave in BDSM and a submissive on google and you'll get thirty different answers. I'm not going to play that game. The reason I'm using the terminology is because I firmly believe the stronger the power transfer in a D/s relationship, the stronger the devotion and trust. That's something I want to encourage. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. *Dominant*: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound\-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship \(trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.\) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self\-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now \(although I do have my favorites\), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time\-intensive \(I will work with your schedule\). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real\-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare \(the part where I serve you and your needs\) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you:** *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep\-seated fears \(even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly\-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. *What you can expect from me*: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon."

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound\-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. *Master/slave relationship*: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship \(trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.\) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self\-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. **What will this relationship consist of:** *Active submission*: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. *Daily controls*: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now \(although I do have my favorites\), rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. *Daily tasks*: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time\-intensive \(I will work with your schedule\). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. *Weekly sessions*: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real\-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare \(the part where I serve you and your needs\) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. *Punishments*: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. **What will be expected of you:** *Commitment*: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. *Devotion*: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. *Communication*: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. *Trust*: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. *Emotional intimacy*: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep\-seated fears \(even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. *Physical intimacy*: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly\-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. *What you can expect from me*: *A Strong Hand*: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. *A Warm Heart*: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. If you need someone to proofread an essay for you, I'll be getting my red marker out. Someone to help you out with math? I'm terrible at math, find someone else.The point is that you'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. **If you're interested** Well, you've read all this way, so let's keep it short. Just message me. Tell me a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for, and why this ad caught your interest. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon."

I love every aspect of being dominant with a sub. Theres nothing that gets me off more than turning a well-mannered, educated, all round seemingly vanilla man into an obedient, thirsty slut to use as I please. I am looking for a partial live-in sub that I can play with after a long day at work or have a fuck fest during the weekend with some toys, restraints and very kinky ideas. If its not clear to you by now, Im very much in objectification and I like feeding off that vulnerability. Im a rather patient and calm mistress and actually enjoy the process of training a sub. I do love some aspects of pain and degradation but always with consent, within limits and with plenty of aftercare to follow. If youre a good boy then you may not have to worry about that. Again, I say partial live-in sub because I have a busy work schedule and nights and random times just work best. I may also give you tasks during the week to prepare for when me meet. I cant have you forgetting your place and I know you long to be controlled. I have had this Dom/sub dynamic in the past and it worked out fantastic before I ended up moving. I want this to be on my time and just the thought of my sub on his knees and begging when I walk in never gets old. As for the qualities I look for in a sub, obedience, honesty and loyalty stand out. If you cant vocalize your concerns and limits then we wont be a good fit. Safety is my first priority. As for loyalty, I dont want to worry about my health while playing with you. You will be MY personal toy. Lucky for you, kink makes me a special type of horny that vanilla cant match. We will also be discreet. I do want to mention that if I feel that you need to stay over more or youre becoming borderline roommate status then I will expect you to pay some of the rent. I work hard and live comfortably so Im definitely not looking for a freeloader. Random fact but my place has a really nice gym. You may want to remember that when I plug your ass and make you workout with me ;) Im attracted to different body types and am not picky about it as much as I am about faces and personalities. I mean if Im sitting on it and smothering it with my pussy then it better look nice when I look down. I prefer older men but I wont write off someone my age especially if they are funny. We may have some stumbles as you learn how to please me but its ok to laugh about it sometimes. I understand that it will take sometime for us to trust each other and since I want this to be on going, we can go at a pace that works. This should be fulfilling to you too - my sub is a sub and not a doormat. Do not contact me if you dont live in DC or surrounding areas. DMV in general is fine if you commute but Im not going to put up with flakiness. Im not interested in online so dont ask. If this is a dynamic that you will commit to and desire more than I do then take the leap and message me. I dont bite too hard and will elaborate about my kinks, expectations and myself."

That being said, trust and, honest communication is essential. I'm a dominant with sadistic tendencies from Vancouver that has just finished attending university for environmental science. For the past four years, I've been casually exploring the Victoria and Vancouver kink scenes, mostly through instructional/newbie classes combined with a couple of regular munches. Beyond the educational and social components of community, I am unlikely to stray as I'm not much of a voyeur nor an exhibitionist. I suppose that leaves me in the fairly green territory, but, I know when to admit I don't know something, and am very respectful of boundaries and consent. I'm quite tall (6'3""), somewhat heavy set (although, this is changing after going to the gym regularly for the last 3 months), educated, non-smoking, drug and disease free, open minded, and comfortable with who I am. I enjoy learning to the point where I am always reading/working on something that has piqued my interest. Ideally, I'll find someone else that enjoys deep conversations. When I want my mind to wander, painting, music and the occasional video game does the trick. My exploration has led to my six primary interests: bondage/movement restriction, impact play/pain, breeding/bareback sex, degradation, service, and ANR. For bondage, I conditioned my own set hemp rope about three years ago. I'm currently learning more about the nervous and circulatory systems to prevent rope injuries and how identify them. In addition to that, I need to attend more rope dojos before attempting more complicated bondage. Beyond that, I'm open to exploring other fetishes/kinks in a risk aware and consensual manner. I also happen to be quite creative, so if a dominant/submissive dynamic forms, play time and punishments will be unique and varied. I'm able to adjust to most situations quite easily so I'll always stay on top and be in command of you. I'll lead with a quiet, but, sure confidence that will have you looking to me for your instructions. Please note that I am monogamous and not poly. My Top Six Interests: * Bondage/Movement Restriction * Impact Play/Pain * Breeding/Bareback sex * Degradation * Service * ANR Hard Limits: * Needles * Watersports * Scat If you are interested send me a PM. We can communicate there or shift to skype, kik or on fetlife. "

I am 27 years old, bisexual, polyamorous, cis female, and curvy. *Why I'm looking for a Daddy:* I like the vulnerability of being a lg. I like the trust and connection that forms with a Daddy. I like being me 100%. I'm more of a middle than a little so while I love cute stuff like stuffies, playing dress up for Daddy, and things of that nature, I don't care for things like diapers, bottles, or even coloring books. I do love educational things like zoos/museums, juice boxes, and anything/everything that's cute, feminine, or pretty. *What I'm looking for:* I'd like a Daddy Dom who's loving, firm, nurturing, sadistic, a bit controlling, and wants to help me be the best I can be. My ultimate goal is to be in service to my Daddy as his submissive, his pet, and one of his favorite toys. I have about 8 years of experience with kink and am seeking a Daddy who has a similar amount or more. My perfect Daddy enjoys all of the cute aspects of DD/lg but also enjoys power exchange and taking control of a super cute girl who's happy to serve. Some of my favorite kinks include impact play, cnc, DD/lg, D/s, bondage, sensory deprivation, breath play, objectification, electrical play. The list goes on and on. Ideally, my Daddy should have the following qualities: consistent and articulate communication, honesty, a desire to guide and improve your counterpart, compassion, humor, flexibility, creativity. To me, this role naturally suggests a lot of care and commitment to each other, as any other D/s dynamic would. This can't be achieved in one night, the trust and open/honest communication have to be developed long before I'd agree to a Daddy/girl relationship. Also, I don't get any satisfaction from casual play so I'm only interested in finding someone who wants a long-term relationship. Oh! I'm also kind of a unicorn. I'd be super happy to join an existing DD/lg family, I really want a sister or two to play with! **Please note that I'm engaged to a wonderful human being so monogamy and I do not mix well. Daddy must be poly.** :)"

I'm not actually that entitled! But if you found something in you enticed by the title as you opened it, perhaps we ought explore that inclination together. I'm looking for something mature, communicative, and kinky. I'm absolutely open to a relationship developing but not especially aiming for that with this post. What am I looking for is someone: - Submissively inclined; experience not required. Playful psychological switchiness is good, too. - Intellectual and conversational; inclined to philosophize and introspect while cuddling. - Open minded and looking explore fantasies, dirty banter, and a whole range of naughty things. - Anything from petite to large. There are many facets to attraction and I don't rule much out, physically. Me: - Lukewarm on labels but primal daddydomish. I'm not into ageplay but I'm naturally affectionate and supportive. Fairly experienced with much I still want to do. - My primary kink is intimacy, which is to say, unique to each person. Vulnerability and taboo heighten intimacy for me. - Safe, sane, no anger issues, genuine. - I'm overweight. Not extreme, but not everybody's cup of tea. Nonetheless I have good stamina, am well endowed (very thick), and all around sexually capable. Lastly, some of my specific kinks include restraints, teasing, denial, squirting, cum, rules and punishments, and on and on. Again, for me it is about intimacy and creating an experience unique to each person I'm with. If that appeals to you, I'd love to chat. (I'm in Harlem. I can host but have roommates. Can travel as well. 420 friendly is a plus, my treat, but no pressure.)"

I'm a fella who is interested in all this kinky shit, and dammit, I reckon I'll have to find someone like me. Such a chooooore. Alright, Ive got a lot of info to provide, because Im complex (like you and most everyone) so here we go! I'm 24, 6ft tall, fit/slim/toned, and attractive enough that I sometimes stare at myself in the mirror. I am a regular human being, so I'm educated, employed, and social. I live in a bachelor pad with a misogynist title. Im from Tennessee. I write fiction, overthink films, play occasional video games, and read various subjects (currently on a Murakami novel, just finished the Iliad, making my way through a history book on the early Christian church). I listen to podcasts about WWI, social interaction, and the rediscovery of lost faith. I worry about my emotional vulnerability, the existence of God and spirituality, the eventual cold death of the universe, and whether its morally okay to be mildly sadomasochistic. Anyway, I am looking for someone who has a frame of mind similar to my own. Intelligent, asks the big questions, doesnt care about the mundane parts of life. Kinks : bondage, forced/ denied orgasms, choking, spankings, rules and punishments, ageplay, light pain, pet play, wardrobe control/requirements. Gentle domming is loving and sexy and just the best. It's about the kinks and sex, sure, but deeper down, it's about sharing the moment with someone you trust implicitly. Being able to put aside the frivolous sexy stuff and just appreciate the actual person and how they think is kinda the end goal. Anyway, if you're into something else that's awesome, let me know! Chances are I could be persuaded. Sub, Dom, Switch, doesnt matter, Im not sure what Im looking for, maybe it can be longterm, maybe not. I dont expect something specific. Limits: Anything with other guys (I'm a one-man show, cha-ching!), scat, blood, really just anything dangerous or gross. I also (regrettably) have a kik account. PM me and all your wildest dreams will come true!"

I have a lovely, rather submissive, wife that I'm not willing to give up. You can be the only man in my life, but not the only. So if that is a definite no to you, then I'm not the right one for you. She does know of my current search, if not all the reasons behind it. I get tired of being in charge all the time. At work I'm the head bitch in charge, and at home I am too. It exhausts me at times. I feel like I can never show any weakness or vulnerability. My job is high position, high pressure in a very male dominate industry. A job I rule with an iron fist. Most men consider me intimidating. I don't want to be that person with you, I want someone I can be sweet and occasionally silly with. I want you to see my softer side, my fears. I'm looking for a Daddy. Not a Master, not a Sir. I'm looking for an emotional connection before a sexual one. I want someone who will give scold me and praise me. Someone who likes to be in control of food choices, exercise, sexual release, and other day to day activities. Looking for someone older than me, younger than me or even my own age isn't something I'm into. Also please have your shit together, everyone has drama and baggage, but if that's all you are please move on. Physically most people aren't disappointed. If you are into full figured (this bows not mean fat) pale skinned redheads, you'll probably be into me. "

I'm not actually that entitled! But if you found something in you inclined to obey the title as you opened it, perhaps we ought explore that inclination together. I'm looking for something mature, communicative, and kinky. I'm absolutely open to a relationship developing but not especially aiming for that with this post. What am I looking for is someone: - Submissively inclined; experience not required. Playful psychological switchiness is good, too. - Intellectual and conversational; inclined to philosophize and introspect while cuddling. - Open minded and looking explore fantasies, dirty banter, and a whole range of naughty things. - Anything from petite to large. There are many facets to attraction and I don't rule much out, physically. M Me: - Lukewarm on labels but primal daddydomish. I'm not into ageplay but I'm naturally affectionate and supportive. Fairly experienced with much I still want to do. - My primary kink is intimacy, which is to say, unique to each person. Vulnerability and taboo heighten intimacy for me. - Safe, sane, no anger issues, genuine. - I'm overweight. Not extreme, but not everybody's cup of tea. Nonetheless I have good stamina, am well endowed (very thick), and all around sexually capable. Lastly, some of my specific kinks include restraints, teasing, denial, squirting, cum, rules and punishments, and on and on. Again, for me it is about intimacy and creating an experience unique to each person I'm with. If that appeals to you, I'd love to chat. (I'm in Harlem. I can host but have roommates. Can travel as well. 420 friendly is a plus, my treat, but no pressure.) "

I am a 20 year old switch who leans towards the mommy side of things. I have been in the community for a few years now and have had a wide variety of partners, dominant and submissive both! That being said, i lean much more towards the domme side of things myself. Taking on a little is a big responsibility so i expect things will be slow moving so we can really get to know eachother! In my vanilla life im the manager of a restaurant. I do a lot of hands on artsy stuff, like sewing and painting and crafting. I am pagan so i spend a decent amount of time exploring my craft and the world around me, although for my partner spirituality doesnt really matter! As long as youre not a meanie you can believe whatever you believe. As a Domme, I consider myself a nice mix of both soft and strict. I love snuggles and play time and helping my little get into that headspace that allows them to relax. I even have a playroom set up in my house! I like having control so i am big on set expectations and rules, but of course thats something that we will get into as time passes. The main thing that attracts me to ageplay is the vulnerability. its not everyday you can look at someone and say ""i want you to put me in a diaper and get me a sippy cup of milk while i color you pictures and watch cartoons"". Its a very brave thing to be a little! that being said, I consider myself a very transparent person. If we are going to be vulnerable with each other we need to be entirely honest and open. As for my partner, im open to talking to just about anyone. I am specifically looking for a female or nonbinary/fluid identifying partner, though, so please be respectful of that. If youre interested in chatting dont be afraid to shoot me a message! i hope youre having a wonderful day!"

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to sadism and absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

Those of you who are here more to fantasize than to PM (God knows I've done enough of that) can skip down to the 'sexual history' section, where I get into some colorful detail about what gets my motor running. If you think you're interested **don't be afraid to PM me**! I **will** respond to proper PMs, and I'll do it honestly, even if my honest response is ""I'm not interested"". I know it sucks ass to get crickets after a message eight trillion times in a row, guys, and I'm not gonna leave you hanging. **I do ask that you read the whole post before messaging,** (there's a keyword buried down there as a filter) and that you're clear upfront if you're messaging for any reason other than interest in pursuing such a relationship. Anyway. ---------------- # About Me *I am not a concept! But I don't hate the idea of being kinda seen as one...* - Not Clementine, *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* I'm a woman in my late 20s living in the south Seattle area, and I'm looking to try something I've dipped my toes into a bit (see the history section below) a bit more seriously: namely, I want to be in a fairly traditional relationship dynamic, where I (as a woman) am obedient and lower-status to my partner (presumably as a man - however, I am bisexual, and if there is by some chance a woman interested in this dynamic with her I'm open to that). However, I want to be clear that this is *not* something I want to suggest or impose on the world at large - if you're an actual misogynist in the sense of ""lol women can't do stuff"" in general, I'm not interested. I am, for the most part, looking for a **relationship**, not just a one-off, although sufficiently intriguing ideas might not be ignored (again, you've got nothing to lose! take a shot!). Ideally this would be in-person, but relocating within the U.S. for the right partner is not out of the question down the line. I was raised in a southern fundamentalist home. I've long since left that world, but at some level, deep in the less-rational parts of my brain, this is what being a woman is to me. This is my compromise to myself, as a modern woman who believes very much in equality but still wants a good strong hand behind me and a firm place in the world that is quite specifically gendered. I am looking for something that is sort-of 24/7, in the sense that while actual sex-kinkiness should be kept mostly to the bedroom (and I *am* kinky in other respects), I do actually want to find someone who wants to be the leader in a home and who wants his woman to generally accept his decisions and judgment. I want to defer and lean on you day to day, but not to be a helpless slave, if that makes sense. I am happy to be 'molded' or trained to some extent; see the sexy section below. I am trans, and long-since transitioned. I pass fine, but have not had (and do not currently plan to have) genital surgery. I have been on hormones for some years, however, and otherwise look/feel/etc like any other woman (in particular, I have a couple quite grabbable breasts). If this is a dealbreaker for you, well, there ya go. Outside of the bedroom, I'm a capable professional who teaches for a living. I have a master's degree and an interest in almost every aspect of the world, and am someone who is rarely if ever out of interesting things to say. If you like details and trivia and all the fascinating, amazing little interconnections of the world, you'll find me a companion more than worth your time and energy. I'm a good cook and I get better all the time. I'm politically fairly liberal, by which I mean that my *positions* are liberal as all hell and I basically think everyone right of center is kind of a dumbass, but I'm difficult to offend with good faith and do not go about my life looking for fights. I tend to like media that is either complex/deep with a lot of philosophical gray areas (like, say, *Firefly* or KOTOR2) or that is straightforward and stirs up something pure (like *300* stirring up epic ""woo, fuck yeah!"" or *Despicable Me* stirring up maternal ""d'awww!""). I'm not an easy person to know. I have a lot of internal contradictions (says, unnecessarily, the feminist-ish woman looking to be barefoot in the kitchen) that even I don't understand a lot of the time. The key-word is 'lime'. I want to work these out and try to experience parts of me that haven't gotten to play, and I hope you're the sort of person who wants to explore me through and through, because to the right dom-type I'm an open and (to hear previous partners tell it) interesting book. I'm bisexual, as mentioned above, and open to some degree of polyamory. This can be as simple as 'occasional outside play partner' or involve me submitting to e.g. a couple as part of a home. Non-traditional folks, don't be afraid to message; I am open to unicorn-ing. I trust slowly, and will not jump in to anything super serious overnight. However, I am happy to start with the asymmetry in the relationship, even on e.g. a first date. I honestly think it would be easier, given that the end goal is to put myself at your feet, to just never think of you as anything but my superior. On a practical level, that doesn't mean I won't protect myself, though, and giving an order I feel the need to disobey is bad news and likely to disrupt or end the relationship on the spot. -------------------- # Sexual History *Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because one of the effects of traditional-relationship submission is to depress your ability to want anything else. As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the final loser would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually obscenely biological.* *I_Am_A_Lemon usually played to lose.* - Not Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy When I first transitioned, I actually thought I only liked girls. But one guy - who is still a current partner to me, but who is far away and actively encourages me to look for a relationship that can proceed more than ours can - ended up running into me on one of the random RP sites. We played a bit, and he...well, convinced me, heh. He was warm but firm; he respected my views but believed I'd be happier under a man, and eventually he got me to try it. It took a while, and a lot of internal reluctance! ""Eh, guys"" became ""hmm, guys"" became ""Oh, no, I don't like guys, I'm just sitting here beet red, panting, and damp at the idea of one fucking me!"" became ""you want me to wear a collar?"" became ""hmm, I guess I could try giving head"", became ""Jesus Christ I'm sleeping in my collar and imagining my man watching me happily"" became ""I'm a good little housewife and I need to obey my man"". In short, despite the weird contradiction it has with my views, it is hard for me to get around the fact that I *am* a submissive woman, for whom a traditional place next to a man is an important part of womanhood. I can't get pregnant, obviously, but I'd sure as hell like to; the thought of my husband looking at me with pride at me, the woman he's conquered outside and in makes my heart pound, even when I just type it. It feels *really* good, and it genuinely makes me feel happy and safe when I don't think about it too hard (when I do, I still get occasional ""what are you doing? be strong and independent etc etc"" pangs, although these have gotten rarer over time). I've had a chance to explore a lot with this partner, and my like for the idea goes pretty deep. I enjoy the thought of shaping myself to some extent to my man's wishes: finding his likes and pursuing them, and especially the idea of finding myself internalizing what I'm told. This last has already happened to some extent; with my explicit consent he's done his best to deepen this side of me, and the partner I'm looking for here would (with trust established) have the same consent. I'm a whole person, with my own wants and will and abilities, but I want that person to be yielding and malleable - and if over time I'm shaped into something I wasn't before, so much the better. (At this point I have to pause for a sec. Hooo boy do I get warmed up around this stuff :P) I have, unsurprisingly, a more general interest in other kink. In no particular order, I like: * Transformation: For presumably obvious reasons this is a big one for me. I fantasized about changing sex before I transitioned, but I'm a fan of animal transformations as well, both partial and total. My current partner has added a particular kink for becoming his fleshlight to the list &lt;.&lt; * Hypnosis: Again, probably obvious from what I've written so far. It's all about the halfway loss of control to me: knowing what's changed, knowing how I'm being manipulated/led but feeling the need to follow along anyway. I like to resist and lose, basically. I don't think I've ever gotten into a proper 100% trance the way some people talk about, it's usually more an altered frame of mind and a sense of 'playing along'. * Pet play: Ohhhhh yes. Put me in a kennel on the floor and lock me in, oh please oh please oh please. For me, this is a 'soft' kink; it's about embarrassment, vulnerability, and praise-in-subservience. It's hard for me to explain the line between being warmly humiliated and being degraded in my head; the best I can do is ""oh, look at you, you're so happy in your place with &lt;X embarrassing/role-signalling attribute, e.g. collar, pregnant belly, etc&gt;"" is comforting and hot, ""you worthless slut"" is not. * Restraining: I think I like this one. Certainly I like the *idea* of being tied up and helpless. But I've never gotten to try it in person beyond just wearing a collar. I'm pretty sure it's a like though so I put it in. * Some degree of...I dunno what to call it. ""Sister-subbing""? I've never done this, but I actually find the idea of a submissive woman guiding me to join her under her man incredibly exciting. So for you couples, there's one for ya. * Sorta-kinda ageplay. I have *zero* interest in calling someone ""daddy"" (it's a huge turn-off), but I do like the power asymmetry that ageplay can bring to the table. Are you noticing a theme here? ...and probably other stuff, too. I'm weird, if you like a thing, ask. In particular, a few things I am **not** interested in: any toilet-y stuff, actual pain/discomfort/sadism, blood or injury, 'mean' put-downs, and certain kinds of excessively porn-ish talk (I like the role being emphasized, but a lot of 'yeah you're such a slut for cock in your whore hole' sort of things turn me off). ---------------------------- # Pros &amp; Cons of Me as a Partner *Women have a much better time than men in this world; there are far more things forbidden to them* - Oscar Wilde **Pros** - Enthusiastic: when I like stuff and get over my shyness, I -really- like it. If anything, expect to have to restrain me rather than try to get a response out of me. - Smart: I have a master's degree, there are few subjects I can't talk about intelligently, I'm interested in current affairs, and I learn more every day. I'm a sub, not a bimbo - although you might take particular joy in having a capable woman under you instead of one who couldn't do much else. - Reasonably high sex drive: it's very spiky, some days it'll roar and I'll be goin crazy and sometimes it'll be low. In general, I think my drive is above-average by a decent margin, which I imagine is a pro for you. And I do really enjoy my partner's interest in me. - Trainable: An active interest of mine. A big part of the appeal is finding myself being molded gently into something I wasn't before, with my consent but only partial control over the process (I really like the word 'process'). - Sweet: I'm compassionate and loving and being in a traditionally feminine role is what I want in a relationship. That means me being the heart of the home, being someone who can bring cheerfulness and emotional support. I take a lot of joy in small things, and I am quite easy to make happy. - Honest: This is a big one for me, and something I insist on in a partner. I will not lie to you, nor will I betray your trust in other ways. I don't always understand myself, but I will always be honest to the best of my understanding. The fact that *anyone* lies in a romantic relationship still amazes me. Trust is king in all romantic relationships, and losing it pretty much instantly kills them, at least for me. - Flexible: This goes with honesty. If you want to do something with me, bring it up. I may (depending on the bounds of the relationship) say no or not be interested, but I'm hard to offend and open to new interests. **Cons** - Unstable: This is a big one! I have decent reason to believe I am mildly bipolar II, and will be seeing a doctor about this in the near future. I'm moody and can fall into very difficult-to-help depression. One of the reasons this relationship model appeals is having someone to steady me out a bit and to act as a counterbalance to the chaotic and contradictory nature of my own mind. - ""Meh"" appearance: I've got an alright face and breasts and pass just fine, but I'm quite overweight. This is a thing I'm open to working on, but something my current willpower has not been able to get to. Weight aside, I'm not ugly, but I'm not a stunner either; there are probably better-looking girls out there without much trouble finding them. Date me for my mind and my interests, not my body, basically :P - Temper: It's rare (once every month or two, usually, although great stress can elevate that), but it's nasty. I'm doing my best to work on this, and I expect treating the instability will help somewhat. Most of the time, I'm nice and pleasant, but on a really bad day I can burst. - Low-motivation: With accountability, I'm fine. If you give me clear standards and a command, and I recognize that I'm subservient to you, I'll get it done. But I need the accountability badly. It's also of paramount importance not to burn me out! If I'm close to it, I'll let you know so that I can be properly released from whatever command is doing so, but if I'm coming to you with that it's probably important that you *do* give me permission to stop. - Sexual handups: In particular, it's just really hard for me to have sex satisfyingly. I'm happy to suck a dick at will, I'm happy to be touched, but being reluctant to do anal + not having the vagina I'd rather makes this awkward. In general, I fit better with people looking for kink over straight-up sex. **Pro or con, depending** - Shy: I'm hesitant to do new things and still quite self-conscious. This can be a pro if you like a girl who is vulnerable and a bit embarrassed by things, or a con if you don't like having to tread carefully. - Geeky/weird: I've been a pretty serious gamer in the past, I spend a lot of time learning random things that catch my interest, I'm not great at socializing (I usually get along fine but have trouble going from acquaintance to friend), and I tend to find odd things engaging. A plus if you have a similar like for interesting details or fun trivia, a con if you just want me to shut up about whatever random thing I just learned on a Wikipedia binge. - Trans: Obviously this is a big personal-preference thing. I don't want the trans aspects of my body particularly emphasized (in particular, I have no interest in ever topping anyone), but if my history as a trans woman appeals to you, that's totally okay (e.g. my current partner actually likes the fact that being a woman - and thus the inferior in our relationship - was a deliberate choice of mine). - Odd kink list: I'm in to a kind of odd mix of things, I assume because of my weird history. Pro if you're into my various odd likes, con if you're not. - Inexperienced in person: I've been kinky *online* for forever, but I've only had a handful of sexual encounters in person. Pro if you like exploration/teaching, con if you want someone who is already fully comfortable with sex. - Timid: It is very difficult for me to trust and surrender. I -can- do it, but it takes doing and time, and it relies on you being able to handle me when I'm freaking out a little. The pro here is that once I trust you, I'm an open book; the con is that it's not easy to get me there. ---------------- # What I'm looking for: *And then her heart changed, or at least she understood it; and the winter passed, and the sun shone upon her...I want to be a healer, and love all things that grow and are not barren.* - Eowyn, The Lord of the Rings * A man - or possibly a woman or couple, although these might tweak things somewhat - who is interested in both caring for and being served by me. Let's say somewhere +- 5 years from me, so 22-32 or so, but I'm not *super* picky about that within reason. * Local. I am willing to consider possible people at a distance, but only in cases of a very good match. * Generally left-ish politics. Because I have no tolerance at all for 'global' misogyny, and because the relationship I'm looking for is, let's face it, kind of misogynistic, it's very important that I be able to trust that you seeing *me* as an inferior is not reflecting on women in general. I have an interest in politics and it'd be nice if you did too. * Intelligence: I like to learn things and explore, and I need a partner who wants to do so as much as I do. A good education, broad scientific and philosophical interests, a willingness to consider strange ideas and hypotheticals, and a love for finding joy in looking at mundane things is a big part of making me like you as a person, not just as a sexual/romantic partner. Basically, I'm looking for someone who'll look at a rock and go ""holy shit, there was a glacier here thousands of years ago and it left a scratch there and that's crazy cool"". * Trustworthiness: **Absolutely 100% essential**. If I do not trust you, I will not commit to a relationship with you, because I cannot be vulnerable enough to have my needs met. This isn't just not lying, it's understanding what ways I can be taken control of and how far that control can be taken. Occasional missteps are one thing, but being pushed too far makes me close up quickly. * Broadly clean-shaven-ish appearance: Despite my politics and background, I still have a lot of the culture of my upbringing. Tattoos and heavy piercings are major turn-offs, and smoking/drug use (beyond perhaps occasional legal pot) is a hard 'no'. I'm not super picky about weight, although my ideal is certainly a lot closer to healthy than I'm at; some degree of fitness would be nice. * Financially stable: Not a requirement, but a plus, especially if you want me as a full-time housewife down the line. Important if you want me focused on my place in the home, obviously. * *Personally* stable: I am a moody, chaotic, difficult to manage person. I need someone who can roll with that, and ideally act as a counterbalance. I am childish in a lot of ways and need a paternal hand, something that I think the sort of man I'm after would generally enjoy giving. * Dominant, but not mean: I want you to take joy (and yes, sexual satisfaction) in taking me under your arm. I want you to look at me and feel proud that I've chosen my place under you, and I want you to encourage me *to* take that place, with the knowing that me being in a relationship with you is implicit permission to shape me.

I am a 20 year old switch who leans towards the mommy side of things. I have been in the community for a few years now and have had a wide variety of partners, dominant and submissive both! That being said, i lean much more towards the domme side of things myself. Taking on a little is a big responsibility so i expect things will be slow moving so we can really get to know eachother! In my vanilla life im the manager of a restaurant. I do a lot of hands on artsy stuff, like sewing and painting and crafting. I am pagan so i spend a decent amount of time exploring my craft and the world around me, although for my partner spirituality doesnt really matter! As long as youre not a meanie you can believe whatever you believe. As a Domme, I consider myself a nice mix of both soft and strict. I love snuggles and play time and helping my little get into that headspace that allows them to relax. I even have a playroom set up in my house! I like having control so i am big on set expectations and rules, but of course thats something that we will get into as time passes. The main thing that attracts me to ageplay is the vulnerability. its not everyday you can look at someone and say ""i want you to put me in a diaper and get me a sippy cup of milk while i color you pictures and watch cartoons"". Its a very brave thing to be a little! that being said, I consider myself a very transparent person. If we are going to be vulnerable with each other we need to be entirely honest and open. As for my partner, im open to talking to just about anyone. I am specifically looking for a female or nonbinary/fluid identifying partner, though, so please be respectful of that. If youre interested in chatting dont be afraid to shoot me a message! i hope youre having a wonderful day!"

That being said, trust and, honest communication is essential. I'm a dominant with sadistic tendencies from Vancouver that has just finished attending university for environmental science. For the past four years, I've been casually exploring the Victoria and Vancouver kink scenes, mostly through instructional/newbie classes combined with a couple of regular munches. Beyond the educational and social components of community, I am unlikely to stray as I'm not much of a voyeur nor an exhibitionist. I suppose that leaves me in the fairly green territory, but, I know when to admit I don't know something, and am very respectful of boundaries and consent. I'm quite tall (6'3""), somewhat heavy set (although, this is changing after going to the gym regularly for the last 3 months), educated, non-smoking, drug and disease free, open minded, and comfortable with who I am. I enjoy learning to the point where I am always reading/working on something that has piqued my interest. Ideally, I'll find someone else that enjoys deep conversations. When I want my mind to wander, painting, music and the occasional video game does the trick. My exploration has led to my six primary interests: bondage/movement restriction, impact play/pain, breeding/bareback sex, degradation, service, and ANR. For bondage, I conditioned my own set hemp rope about three years ago. I'm currently learning more about the nervous and circulatory systems to prevent rope injuries and how identify them. In addition to that, I need to attend more rope dojos before attempting more complicated bondage. Beyond that, I'm open to exploring other fetishes/kinks in a risk aware and consensual manner. I also happen to be quite creative, so if a dominant/submissive dynamic forms, play time and punishments will be unique and varied. I'm able to adjust to most situations quite easily so I'll always stay on top and be in command of you. I'll lead with a quiet, but, sure confidence that will have you looking to me for your instructions. Please note that I am **monogamous** and not poly. My Top Six Interests: * Bondage/Movement Restriction * Impact Play/Pain * Breeding/Bareback sex * Degradation * Service * ANR Hard Limits: * Needles * Watersports * Scat If you are interested send me a PM.

Hey there, /r/BDSMPersonals. Those of you who are here more to fantasize than to PM (God knows I've done enough of that) can skip down to the 'sexual history' section, where I get into some colorful detail about what gets my motor running. If you think you're interested **don't be afraid to PM me**! I **will** respond to proper PMs, and I'll do it honestly, even if my honest response is ""I'm not interested"". I know it sucks ass to get crickets after a message eight trillion times in a row, guys, and I'm not gonna leave you hanging. **I do ask that you read the whole post before messaging,** (there's a keyword buried down there as a filter) and that you're clear upfront if you're messaging for any reason other than interest in pursuing such a relationship. Anyway. ---------------- # About Me *I am not a concept! But I don't hate the idea of being kinda seen as one...* - Not Clementine, *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* I'm a woman in my late 20s living in the south Seattle area, and I'm looking to try something I've dipped my toes into a bit (see the history section below) a bit more seriously: namely, I want to be in a fairly traditional relationship dynamic, where I (as a woman) am obedient and lower-status to my partner (presumably as a man - however, I am bisexual, and if there is by some chance a woman interested in this dynamic with her I'm open to that). However, I want to be clear that this is *not* something I want to suggest or impose on the world at large - if you're an actual misogynist in the sense of ""lol women can't do stuff"" in general, I'm not interested. I am, for the most part, looking for a **relationship**, not just a one-off, although sufficiently intriguing ideas might not be ignored (again, you've got nothing to lose! take a shot!). Ideally this would be in-person, but relocating within the U.S. for the right partner is not out of the question down the line. I do not expect to jump entirely into this dynamic from minute one. I'd expect to date semi-normally, to get a feel for one another, before any commitments of that sort are made. But I'd like to do that dating with the understanding that such a relationship is what you and I both want. I'm not a doormat, I'm a sub, and that means I do look out for my own well-being until and unless I trust you to the point that I'm willing to surrender that responsibility. I was raised in a southern fundamentalist home. I've long since left that world, but at some level, deep in the less-rational parts of my brain, this is what being a woman is to me. This is my compromise to myself, as a modern woman who believes very much in equality but still wants a good strong hand behind me and a firm place in the world that is quite specifically gendered. I am looking for something that is sort-of 24/7, in the sense that while actual sex-kinkiness should be kept mostly to the bedroom (and I *am* kinky in other respects), I do actually want to find someone who wants to be the leader in a home and who wants his woman to generally accept his decisions and judgment. I want to defer and lean on you day to day, but not to be a helpless slave, if that makes sense. I am happy to be 'molded' or trained to some extent; see the sexy section below. I am trans, and long-since transitioned. I pass fine, but have not had (and do not currently plan to have) genital surgery. I have been on hormones for some years, however, and otherwise look/feel/etc like any other woman (in particular, I have a couple quite grabbable breasts). If this is a dealbreaker for you, well, there ya go. Outside of the bedroom, I'm a capable professional who teaches for a living. I have a master's degree and an interest in almost every aspect of the world, and am someone who is rarely if ever out of interesting things to say. If you like details and trivia and all the fascinating, amazing little interconnections of the world, you'll find me a companion more than worth your time and energy. I'm a good cook and I get better all the time. I'm politically fairly liberal, by which I mean that my *positions* are liberal as all hell and I basically think everyone right of center is kind of a dumbass, but I'm difficult to offend with good faith and do not go about my life looking for fights. I tend to like media that is either complex/deep with a lot of philosophical gray areas (like, say, *Firefly* or KOTOR2) or that is straightforward and stirs up something pure (like *300* stirring up epic ""woo, fuck yeah!"" or *Despicable Me* stirring up maternal ""d'awww!""). I'm not an easy person to know. I have a lot of internal contradictions (says, unnecessarily, the feminist-ish woman looking to be barefoot in the kitchen) that even I don't understand a lot of the time. The key-word is 'lime'. I want to work these out and try to experience parts of me that haven't gotten to play, and I hope you're the sort of person who wants to explore me through and through, because to the right dom-type I'm an open and (to hear previous partners tell it) interesting book. I'm bisexual, as mentioned above, and open to some degree of polyamory. This can be as simple as 'occasional outside play partner' or involve me submitting to e.g. a couple as part of a home. Non-traditional folks, don't be afraid to message; I am open to unicorn-ing. I trust slowly, and will not jump in to anything super serious overnight. However, I am happy to start with the asymmetry in the relationship, even on e.g. a first date. I honestly think it would be easier, given that the end goal is to put myself at your feet, to just never think of you as anything but my superior. On a practical level, that doesn't mean I won't protect myself, though, and giving an order I feel the need to disobey is bad news and likely to disrupt or end the relationship on the spot. -------------------- # Sexual History *Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because one of the effects of traditional-relationship submission is to depress your ability to want anything else. As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the final loser would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually obscenely biological.* *I_Am_A_Lemon usually played to lose.* - Not Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy When I first transitioned, I actually thought I only liked girls. But one guy - who is still a current partner to me, but who is far away and actively encourages me to look for a relationship that can proceed more than ours can - ended up running into me on one of the random RP sites. We played a bit, and he...well, convinced me, heh. He was warm but firm; he respected my views but believed I'd be happier under a man, and eventually he got me to try it. It took a while, and a lot of internal reluctance! ""Eh, guys"" became ""hmm, guys"" became ""Oh, no, I don't like guys, I'm just sitting here beet red, panting, and damp at the idea of one fucking me!"" became ""you want me to wear a collar?"" became ""hmm, I guess I could try giving head"", became ""Jesus Christ I'm sleeping in my collar and imagining my man watching me happily"" became ""I'm a good little housewife and I need to obey my man"". In short, despite the weird contradiction it has with my views, it is hard for me to get around the fact that I *am* a submissive woman, for whom a traditional place next to a man is an important part of womanhood. I can't get pregnant, obviously, but I'd sure as hell like to; the thought of my husband looking at me with pride at me, the woman he's conquered outside and in makes my heart pound, even when I just type it. It feels *really* good, and it genuinely makes me feel happy and safe when I don't think about it too hard (when I do, I still get occasional ""what are you doing? be strong and independent etc etc"" pangs, although these have gotten rarer over time). I've had a chance to explore a lot with this partner, and my like for the idea goes pretty deep. I enjoy the thought of shaping myself to some extent to my man's wishes: finding his likes and pursuing them, and especially the idea of finding myself internalizing what I'm told. This last has already happened to some extent; with my explicit consent he's done his best to deepen this side of me, and the partner I'm looking for here would (with trust established) have the same consent. I'm a whole person, with my own wants and will and abilities, but I want that person to be yielding and malleable - and if over time I'm shaped into something I wasn't before, so much the better. (At this point I have to pause for a sec. Hooo boy do I get warmed up around this stuff :P) I have, unsurprisingly, a more general interest in other kink. In no particular order, I like: * Transformation: For presumably obvious reasons this is a big one for me. I fantasized about changing sex before I transitioned, but I'm a fan of animal transformations as well, both partial and total. My current partner has added a particular kink for becoming his fleshlight to the list &lt;.&lt; * Hypnosis: Again, probably obvious from what I've written so far. It's all about the halfway loss of control to me: knowing what's changed, knowing how I'm being manipulated/led but feeling the need to follow along anyway. I like to resist and lose, basically. I don't think I've ever gotten into a proper 100% trance the way some people talk about, it's usually more an altered frame of mind and a sense of 'playing along'. * Pet play: Ohhhhh yes. Put me in a kennel on the floor and lock me in, oh please oh please oh please. For me, this is a 'soft' kink; it's about embarrassment, vulnerability, and praise-in-subservience. It's hard for me to explain the line between being warmly humiliated and being degraded in my head; the best I can do is ""oh, look at you, you're so happy in your place with &lt;X embarrassing/role-signalling attribute, e.g. collar, pregnant belly, etc&gt;"" is comforting and hot, ""you worthless slut"" is not. * Restraining: I think I like this one. Certainly I like the *idea* of being tied up and helpless. But I've never gotten to try it in person beyond just wearing a collar. I'm pretty sure it's a like though so I put it in. * Some degree of...I dunno what to call it. ""Sister-subbing""? I've never done this, but I actually find the idea of a submissive woman guiding me to join her under her man incredibly exciting. So for you couples, there's one for ya. * Sorta-kinda ageplay. I have *zero* interest in calling someone ""daddy"" (it's a huge turn-off), but I do like the power asymmetry that ageplay can bring to the table. Are you noticing a theme here? ...and probably other stuff, too. I'm weird, if you like a thing, ask. In particular, a few things I am **not** interested in: any toilet-y stuff, actual pain/discomfort/sadism, blood or injury, 'mean' put-downs, and certain kinds of excessively porn-ish talk (I like the role being emphasized, but a lot of 'yeah you're such a slut for cock in your whore hole' sort of things turn me off). ---------------------------- # Pros &amp; Cons of Me as a Partner *Women have a much better time than men in this world; there are far more things forbidden to them* - Oscar Wilde **Pros** - Enthusiastic: when I like stuff and get over my shyness, I -really- like it. If anything, expect to have to restrain me rather than try to get a response out of me. - Smart: I have a master's degree, there are few subjects I can't talk about intelligently, I'm interested in current affairs, and I learn more every day. I'm a sub, not a bimbo - although you might take particular joy in having a capable woman under you instead of one who couldn't do much else. - Reasonably high sex drive: it's very spiky, some days it'll roar and I'll be goin crazy and sometimes it'll be low. In general, I think my drive is above-average by a decent margin, which I imagine is a pro for you. And I do really enjoy my partner's interest in me. - Trainable: An active interest of mine. A big part of the appeal is finding myself being molded gently into something I wasn't before, with my consent but only partial control over the process (I really like the word 'process'). - Sweet: I'm compassionate and loving and being in a traditionally feminine role is what I want in a relationship. That means me being the heart of the home, being someone who can bring cheerfulness and emotional support. I take a lot of joy in small things, and I am quite easy to make happy. - Honest: This is a big one for me, and something I insist on in a partner. I will not lie to you, nor will I betray your trust in other ways. I don't always understand myself, but I will always be honest to the best of my understanding. The fact that *anyone* lies in a romantic relationship still amazes me. Trust is king in all romantic relationships, and losing it pretty much instantly kills them, at least for me. - Flexible: This goes with honesty. If you want to do something with me, bring it up. I may (depending on the bounds of the relationship) say no or not be interested, but I'm hard to offend and open to new interests. **Cons** - Unstable: This is a big one! I have decent reason to believe I am mildly bipolar II, and will be seeing a doctor about this in the near future. I'm moody and can fall into very difficult-to-help depression. One of the reasons this relationship model appeals is having someone to steady me out a bit and to act as a counterbalance to the chaotic and contradictory nature of my own mind. - ""Meh"" appearance: I've got an alright face and breasts and pass just fine, but I'm quite overweight. This is a thing I'm open to working on, but something my current willpower has not been able to get to. Weight aside, I'm not ugly, but I'm not a stunner either; there are probably better-looking girls out there without much trouble finding them. Date me for my mind and my interests, not my body, basically :P - Temper: It's rare (once every month or two, usually, although great stress can elevate that), but it's nasty. I'm doing my best to work on this, and I expect treating the instability will help somewhat. Most of the time, I'm nice and pleasant, but on a really bad day I can burst. - Low-motivation: With accountability, I'm fine. If you give me clear standards and a command, and I recognize that I'm subservient to you, I'll get it done. But I need the accountability badly. It's also of paramount importance not to burn me out! If I'm close to it, I'll let you know so that I can be properly released from whatever command is doing so, but if I'm coming to you with that it's probably important that you *do* give me permission to stop. - Sexual handups: In particular, it's just really hard for me to have sex satisfyingly. I'm happy to suck a dick at will, I'm happy to be touched, but being reluctant to do anal + not having the vagina I'd rather makes this awkward. In general, I fit better with people looking for kink over straight-up sex. **Pro or con, depending** - Shy: I'm hesitant to do new things and still quite self-conscious. This can be a pro if you like a girl who is vulnerable and a bit embarrassed by things, or a con if you don't like having to tread carefully. - Geeky/weird: I've been a pretty serious gamer in the past, I spend a lot of time learning random things that catch my interest, I'm not great at socializing (I usually get along fine but have trouble going from acquaintance to friend), and I tend to find odd things engaging. A plus if you have a similar like for interesting details or fun trivia, a con if you just want me to shut up about whatever random thing I just learned on a Wikipedia binge. - Trans: Obviously this is a big personal-preference thing. I don't want the trans aspects of my body particularly emphasized (in particular, I have no interest in ever topping anyone), but if my history as a trans woman appeals to you, that's totally okay (e.g. my current partner actually likes the fact that being a woman - and thus the inferior in our relationship - was a deliberate choice of mine). - Odd kink list: I'm in to a kind of odd mix of things, I assume because of my weird history. Pro if you're into my various odd likes, con if you're not. - Inexperienced in person: I've been kinky *online* for forever, but I've only had a handful of sexual encounters in person. Pro if you like exploration/teaching, con if you want someone who is already fully comfortable with sex. - Timid: It is very difficult for me to trust and surrender. I -can- do it, but it takes doing and time, and it relies on you being able to handle me when I'm freaking out a little. The pro here is that once I trust you, I'm an open book; the con is that it's not easy to get me there. ---------------- # What I'm looking for: *And then her heart changed, or at least she understood it; and the winter passed, and the sun shone upon her...I want to be a healer, and love all things that grow and are not barren.* - Eowyn, The Lord of the Rings * A man - or possibly a woman or couple, although these might tweak things somewhat - who is interested in both caring for and being served by me. Let's say somewhere +- 5 years from me, so 22-32 or so, but I'm not *super* picky about that within reason. Since I've been asked, trans men are fine as well. * **Local.** I am willing to consider possible people at a distance, but only in cases of a very good match. * Generally left-ish politics/worldview. Because I have no tolerance at all for 'global' misogyny, and because the relationship I'm looking for is, let's face it, kind of misogynistic, it's very important that I be able to trust that you seeing *me* as an inferior is not reflecting on women in general. I have an interest in politics and it'd be nice if you did too. * Intelligence: I like to learn things and explore, and I need a partner who wants to do so as much as I do. A good education, broad scientific and philosophical interests, a willingness to consider strange ideas and hypotheticals, and a love for finding joy in looking at mundane things is a big part of making me like you as a person, not just as a sexual/romantic partner. Basically, I'm looking for someone who'll look at a rock and go ""holy shit, there was a glacier here thousands of years ago and it left a scratch there and that's crazy cool"". * **Trustworthiness**: **Absolutely 100% essential**. If I do not trust you, I will not commit to a relationship with you, because I cannot be vulnerable enough to have my needs met. This isn't just not lying, it's understanding what ways I can be taken control of and how far that control can be taken. Occasional missteps are one thing, but being pushed too far makes me close up quickly. * Broadly clean-shaven-ish appearance: Despite my politics and background, I still have a lot of the culture of my upbringing. Tattoos and heavy piercings are major turn-offs, and smoking/drug use (beyond perhaps occasional legal pot) is a hard 'no'. I'm not super picky about weight, although my ideal is certainly a lot closer to healthy than I'm at; some degree of fitness would be nice. * Financially stable: Not a requirement, but a plus, especially if you want me as a full-time housewife down the line. Important if you want me focused on my place in the home, obviously. * *Personally* stable: I am a moody, chaotic, difficult to manage person. I need someone who can roll with that, and ideally act as a counterbalance. I am childish in a lot of ways and need a paternal hand, something that I think the sort of man I'm after would generally enjoy giving. * Dominant, but not mean: I want you to take joy (and yes, sexual satisfaction) in taking me under your arm. I want you to look at me and feel proud that I've chosen my place under you, and I want you to encourage me *to* take that place, with the knowing that me being in a relationship with you is implicit permission to shape me. But for the most part, I'm after encouragement, leading, and gentle conditioning, not abuse. The line is obviously a bit fuzzy, but if your interest is mainly sadistic, I'm not the girl for you. I think that'll do for now. If you got through that whole fucking novel, bravo. And as I said at the start, if you think we'd be a good fit, no matter your situation/sex/number of people, **send me a PM, seriously, it's cool**. The worst I'll do is say no.

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to sadism and absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I've been waiting for...for a long time."

I suppose that leaves me in the fairly green territory, but, I know when to admit I don't know something, and am very respectful of boundaries and consent.

From our lounge we have a brilliant view of Downtown Houston and the the Texas Medical Centers skylines. Both light the skye with yellows, blues, violets, and orange against the inky black nights. Glass, stone, and light combine into a beautiful, photogenic scene that cannot be captured thanks to the way the windows are tinted. My floor is the lucky one. The other lounges can see something similar, but only my floor has floor to ceiling windows that cover the entire exterior wall. I cant even study there these days its so beautiful. All I can think is how much I want to stripped and held against those cold, dusty, grimy windows, face first as a cock trusts in and out of my dripping, slick cunt. I want to feel the coldness of the January chill set through my bones, my face, my stomach and my skin. I want that chill all over my body except for where the touch of your hands scalds my skin and the rutting of your cock and my cunt radiate our heat. I want to be pinned to that window until you grow frustrated and growl, pushing me down on the sofa to have access to my dusty, grimy, cold front. In that pitch black room, with only the glow from the moon and the skyscrapers I want that tricked out room can be transformed want your mouth sucking at my nipples, nipping at my lips, and bruising kisses at my neck. I want to be spanked in that lounge, but made to keep quiet, so not to call attention to ourselves. I want to feel that rush, that trill of knowing anyone-my friends, my RA-could walk in on us at any moment. I want to come with a silent scream as you suckle at my clitoris while I stare out the window, captivated by the most phallic of objects: skyscrapers. Im Indie. I enjoy being submissive, especially as a sort of prized pet. DD/lg is a hard limit. I also enjoy I enjoy being praised, petted, and cuddled. I also enjoy breast/nipple play, orgasm denial &amp; forced orgasm. I adore anal play and omoroshi. The vulnerability both make you feel just send electricity through my cunt and my clit. When Ive played my my ass Ive loved the feeling of fullness. Nothing is quite as satisfying as an orgasm simultaneously flowing through your body as your bladder releases the flood youve so desperately been holding in. Your body becomes weightless and I always just moan in relief. Im happy to here from men, women, and trans/non-binary folks. Dont hesitate to PM me! "

I just re-entered the working world after being flattened by a jeep. My parts all work again, but I hurt in some places still. I've had quite a few subs come through my life, and the only ones I was ever interested in keeping around were basically using me for a sex toy. You wouldn't think that'd happen to doms, but it does. It hurts. I hate the perspective that I'm some sort of heartless sex machine who only gets a thrill out of spankings or handcuffs. It's not that at all. I want something much deeper, my heart hurts for it, and I'm tired of dealing with stupid sluts who are just exploring. I want someone of my own. I want to own you. I don't just want to own you, I want to earn it. I want us to know one-another so intimately that the space between our hearts and minds eclipses. When we do acid or shrooms together and fuck, we'll melt perspectives. That's the level of intimate I want. Kink-wise, I'm initially actually pretty flexible. I know that, over time, we'll adapt to one another. You'll give me that tight little ass of yours. I'll set up a CNC scene for you. You'll invite one of your girlfriends over to play with you and make a video for me, because I'm busy working. You'll let me have her, too. I'll tie you to a post and spank you just to watch you squirm. We'll make gentle love in bed in the morning. Sometimes I'll bring a buddy around and we'll spit roast you. You'll use a strap on to please me on occasion. I'll fuck you while we're out on a lunch date in the park. You'll tease me with random naughtiness. You're going to love it. So am I. We're going to love it. And what I want to love most about it is the love. Real connection, vulnerability, support, and comfort. I want someone who will challenge me and isn't afraid to be challenged by me. When I bring my will to bear, I want you to submit to me, but not without a struggle. I respect your voice and your spirit. I want to be on top, but I want to grow together, two snakes rising to unite around the caduceus. In my private, everyday life, I'm currently a content writer. I spend most of my free time creating art (drawings, an album, a book) and I hope to someday support myself with that. If that fails, I might go back to school for a doctorate in psychology, or I might become a tattoo artist. I'm a good looking guy and I'm in good shape. I've got a while to go to get the ab definition back after my accident, but I'm in no hurry. 5'11"", dirty blonde (short now, but it's growing out), blue eyes, and sharp features. I like to do yoga and go on hikes. I eat mostly vegan; you don't have to be pure vegan (I'm not), but we are going to cut the meat-eating way back. I like to play with natural psychedelics, like marijuana, psilocybin, and someday soon I want to try ayahuasca. Anyway, I think I've said enough. I know what I'm looking for and I don't know that I'll find it anytime soon. But if this speaks to you, talk to me. Start that message right now, in a new tab, so you can reference my post to organize your response. Be honest, straightforward, and thorough. I want to know about you. What clicks between us and what doesn't, what do you look like, and do you do any kind of art? Etc. I look forward to meeting you. Regards, Sir"

For the past four years, I've been casually exploring the Victoria and Vancouver kink scenes, mostly through instructional/newbie classes combined with a couple of regular munches. Beyond the educational and social components of community, I am unlikely to stray as I'm not much of a voyeur nor an exhibitionist. I suppose that leaves me in the fairly green territory, but, I know when to admit I don't know something, and am very respectful of boundaries and consent.

The master/slave dynamic in a lot of BDSM falls flat when it starts to seem like play-acting, with the participants falling into roles that are more cultural than natural developments of the situation. It's like trying to tell an authentic espionage story but basing it around the spy tropes in James Bond movies.* I'm very honest about what I'm looking for and what I'm about, so I hesitate to call them kinks. So much of BDSM comes across as bullshit because, in my view, the participants are trying to have their cake and eat it, too -- seeking to tap into something deeper but refusing to fully take the plunge. In a culture where meaningless entertainment abounds, where crimes are not crimes and wrong is right as long as we can pretend we all agree -- where empty consumerism extends even to people (netflix and chill) -- not even our most primal selves are spared. We come up with increasingly elaborate protocols and rationalizations to compensate for the simple fact that it's just too uncomfortable to push past all the noise and be unapologetically fucking *real*. But in this world where truth is an existential threat to many, honest vulnerability is its own reward. I love women -- what with their singsong voices and delicate features -- but I'm so glad I'm not one, and I'm not afraid to rub your face in it. But yeah basically I make it clear that to maintain my interest, she has to embrace her own nature. Dress code, diet, demeanor -- everything. If she is not pleasing, she may as well not exist. Skirts and dresses for ease of access, yes sir/no sir, thank you daddy. No cumming without permission, etc. Collars and cuffs and leashes as necessary, of course. I'm never underhanded or unfair; I cherish her and push her to succeed. But whenever she forgets her place, I pin her down and remind her what she's here for -- as a set of holes to be stretched around my cock. ____ **About me:** I'm very independently happy and honest almost to a fault (clearly). I work hard, spend my money responsibly, know how to dress/keep myself clean/act in public, have a great relationship with my mom, etc. Drug/disease-free, non-smoker, not on any meds, no kids/baby-mama drama. Physically, I'm white, 5'7"", and slim. Toned and healthy but definitely a lightweight. Handsome face. Big green eyes for you to get lost in or whatever. If you like 'cute' guys, I'm basically the cutest. Also, ahem, 6 3/4"". _____ **You should message me if:** You're healthy, happy, and honest, but nonetheless looking for something more. You're not just ""kinda kinky lol"", you existentially crave steady guidance and structure -- serving and dedicating yourself to someone who knows what he wants and how to get it (specifically, you're down with the idea of being a wholesome, roadtripping, snack-sharing, smiling sweetheart in a sundress picking wildflowers one week and a nameless, faceless cunt chained to a bed for use the next). You understand that this kind of thing doesn't happen overnight. You'll be a great mother some day. "

But I don't hate the idea of being kinda seen as one...* - Not Clementine, *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* I'm a woman in my late 20s living in the south Seattle area, and I'm looking to try something I've dipped my toes into a bit (see the history section below) a bit more seriously: namely, I want to be in a fairly traditional relationship dynamic, where I (as a woman) am obedient and lower-status to my partner (presumably as a man - however, I am bisexual, and if there is by some chance a woman interested in this dynamic with her I'm open to that). However, I want to be clear that this is *not* something I want to suggest or impose on the world at large - if you're an actual misogynist in the sense of ""lol women can't do stuff"", I'm not interested. I am, for the most part, looking for a **relationship**, not just a one-off, although sufficiently intriguing ideas might not be ignored (again, you've got nothing to lose! take a shot!). Ideally this would be in-person, but relocating within the U.S. for the right partner is not out of the question down the line. I was raised in a southern fundamentalist home. I've long since left that world, but at some level, deep in the less-rational parts of my brain, this is what being a woman is to me. This is my compromise to myself, as a modern woman who believes very much in equality but still wants a good strong hand behind me and a firm place in the world that is quite specifically gendered. I am looking for something that is sort-of 24/7, in the sense that while actual sex-kinkiness should be kept mostly to the bedroom (and I *am* kinky in other respects), I do actually want to find someone who wants to be the leader in a home and who wants his woman to generally accept his decisions and judgment. I want to defer and lean on you day to day, but not to be a helpless slave, if that makes sense. I am happy to be 'molded' or trained to some extent; see the sexy section below. I am trans, and long-since transitioned. I pass fine, but have not had (and do not currently plan to have) surgery. If this is a dealbreaker for you, well, there ya go. Outside of the bedroom, I'm a capable professional who teaches for a living. I have a master's degree and an interest in almost every aspect of the world, and am someone who is rarely if ever out of interesting things to say. If you like details and trivia and all the fascinating, amazing little interconnections of the world, you'll find me a companion more than worth your time and energy. I'm a good cook and I get better all the time. I'm politically fairly liberal, by which I mean that my *positions* are liberal as all hell and I basically think everyone right of center is kind of a dumbass, but I'm difficult to offend with good faith and do not go about my life looking for fights. I tend to like media that is either complex/deep with a lot of philosophical gray areas (like, say, *Firefly* or KOTOR2) or that is straightforward and stirs up something pure (like *300* or *Despicable Me*). I'm not an easy person to know. I have a lot of internal contradictions (says, unnecessarily, the feminist-ish woman looking to be barefoot in the kitchen) that even I don't understand a lot of the time. The key-word is 'lime', if you message me. I want to work these out and try to experience parts of me that haven't gotten to play, and I hope you're the sort of person who wants to explore me through and through, because to the right dom-type I'm an open and (to hear previous partners tell it) interesting book. I'm bisexual, as mentioned above, and open to some degree of polyamory. This can be as simple as 'occasional outside play partner' or involve me submitting to e.g. a couple as part of a home. Non-traditional folks, don't be afraid to message; I am open to unicorn-ing. I trust slowly, and will not jump in to anything super serious overnight. However, I am happy to start with the asymmetry in the relationship, even on e.g. a first date. I honestly think it would be easier, given that the end goal is to put myself at your feet, to just never think of you as anything but my superior. On a practical level, that doesn't mean I won't protect myself, though, and giving an order I feel the need to disobey is bad news. -------------------- # Sexual History *Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because one of the effects of traditional-relationship submission is to depress your ability to want anything else. As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the final loser would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually obscenely biological.* *I_Am_A_Lemon usually played to lose.* - Not Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy When I first transitioned, I actually thought I only liked girls. But one guy - who is still a current partner to me, but who is far away and actively encourages me to look for a relationship that can proceed more than ours can - ended up running into me on one of the random RP sites. We played a bit, and he...well, convinced me, heh. He was warm but firm; he respected my views but believed I'd be happier under a man, and eventually he got me to try it. It took a while, and a lot of internal reluctance! ""Eh, guys"" became ""hmm, guys"" became ""Oh, no, I don't like guys, I'm just sitting here beet red, panting, and damp at the idea of one fucking me!"" became ""you want me to wear a collar?"" became ""Jesus Christ I'm sleeping in my collar and imagining my man watching me happily"" became ""I'm a good little housewife and I need to obey my man"". In short, despite the weird contradiction it has with my views, it is hard for me to get around the fact that I *am* a submissive woman, for whom a traditional place next to a man is an important part of womanhood. I can't get pregnant, obviously, but I'd sure as hell like to; the thought of my husband looking at me with pride at me, the woman he's conquered outside and in makes my heart pound, even when I just type it. It feels *really* good, and it genuinely makes me feel happy and safe when I don't think about it too hard (when I do, I still get occasional ""what are you doing? be strong and independent etc etc"" pangs, although these have gotten rarer over time). I've had a chance to explore a lot with this partner, and my like for the idea goes pretty deep. I enjoy the thought of shaping myself to some extent to my man's wishes: finding his likes and pursuing them, and especially the idea of finding myself internalizing what I'm told. This last has already happened to some extent; with my explicit consent he's done his best to deepen this side of me, and the partner I'm looking for here would (with trust established) have the same consent. I'm a whole person, with my own wants and will and abilities, but I want that person to be yielding and malleable - and if over time I'm shaped into something I wasn't before, so much the better. (At this point I have to pause for a sec. Hooo boy do I get warmed up around this stuff :P) I have, unsurprisingly, a more general interest in other kink. In no particular order, I like: * Transformation: For presumably obvious reasons this is a big one for me. I fantasized about changing sex before I transitioned, but I'm a fan of animal transformations as well, both partial and total. My current partner has added a particular kink for becoming his fleshlight to the list &lt;.&lt; * Hypnosis: Again, probably obvious from what I've written so far. It's all about the halfway loss of control to me: knowing what's changed, knowing how I'm being manipulated/led but feeling the need to follow along anyway. I like to resist and lose, basically. I don't think I've ever gotten into a proper 100% trance the way some people talk about, it's usually more an altered frame of mind and a sense of 'playing along'. * Pet play: Ohhhhh yes. Put me in a kennel on the floor and lock me in, oh please oh please oh please. For me, this is a 'soft' kink; it's about embarrassment, vulnerability, and praise-in-subservience. It's hard for me to explain the line between being warmly humiliated and being degraded in my head; the best I can do is ""oh, look at you, you're so happy in your place with &lt;X embarrassing/role-signalling attribute, e.g. collar, pregnant belly, etc&gt;"" is comforting and hot, ""you worthless slut"" is not. * Restraining: I think I like this one. Certainly I like the *idea* of being tied up and helpless. But I've never gotten to try it in person beyond just wearing a collar. I'm pretty sure it's a like though so I put it in. * Some degree of...I dunno what to call it. ""Sister-subbing""? I've never done this, but I actually find the idea of a submissive woman guiding me to join her under her man incredibly exciting. So for you couples, there's one for ya. * Sorta-kinda ageplay. I have *zero* interest in calling someone ""daddy"" (it's a huge turn-off), but I do like the power asymmetry that ageplay can bring to the table. Are you noticing a theme here? ...and probably other stuff, too. I'm weird, if you like a thing, ask. In particular, a few things I am **not** interested in: any toilet-y stuff, actual pain/discomfort/sadism, blood or injury, 'mean' put-downs, and certain kinds of excessively porn-ish talk (I like the role being emphasized, but a lot of 'yeah you're such a slut for cock in your whore hole' sort of things turn me off). ---------------------------- # Pros &amp; Cons of Me as a Partner *Women have a much better time than men in this world; there are far more things forbidden to them* - Oscar Wilde **Pros** - Enthusiastic: when I like stuff and get over my shyness, I -really- like it. If anything, expect to have to restrain me rather than try to get a response out of me. - Extremely intelligent: I have a master's degree, there are few subjects I can't talk about intelligently, I'm interested in current affairs, and I learn more every day. I'm a sub, not a bimbo - although you might take particular joy in having a capable woman under you instead of one who couldn't do much else. - Reasonably high sex drive: it's very spiky, some days it'll roar and I'll be goin crazy and sometimes it'll be low. In general, I think my drive is above-average by a decent margin, which I imagine is a pro for you. And I do really enjoy my partner's interest in me. - Trainable: An active interest of mine. A big part of the appeal is finding myself being molded gently into something I wasn't before, with my consent but only partial control over the process (I really like the word 'process'). - Sweet: I'm compassionate and loving and being in a traditionally feminine role is what I want in a relationship. That means me being the heart of the home, being someone who can bring cheerfulness and emotional support. I take a lot of joy in small things, and I am quite easy to make happy. - Honest: This is a big one for me, and something I insist on in a partner. I will not lie to you, nor will I betray your trust in other ways. The fact that *anyone* ever does this in a romantic relationship still amazes me. Trust is king in all romantic relationships, and losing it pretty much instantly kills them, at least for me. - Flexible: This goes with honesty. If you want to do something with me, bring it up. I may (depending on the bounds of the relationship) say no or not be interested, but I'm hard to offend and open to new interests. **Cons** - Unstable: This is a big one! I have decent reason to believe I am mildly bipolar II, and will be seeing a doctor about this in the near future. I'm moody and can fall into very difficult-to-help depression. One of the reasons this relationship model appeals is having someone to steady me out a bit and to act as a counterbalance to the chaotic and contradictory nature of my own mind. - Not very attractive: I've got an alright face and breasts and pass just fine, but I'm quite overweight. This is a thing I'm open to working on, but something my current willpower has not been able to get to. Weight aside, I'm not ugly, but I'm not a stunner either; there are probably better-looking girls out there without much trouble finding them. Date me for my mind and my interests, not my body, basically :P - Temper: It's rare (once every month or two, usually, although great stress can elevate that), but it's nasty. I'm doing my best to work on this, and I expect treating the instability will help somewhat. But sometimes I'm just a huge bitch. - Low-motivation: With accountability, I'm fine. If you give me clear standards and a command, and I recognize that I'm subservient to you, I'll get it done. But I need the accountability badly. It's also of paramount importance not to burn me out! If I'm close to it, I'll let you know so that I can be properly released from whatever command is doing so, but if I'm coming to you with that it's probably important that you *do* give me permission to stop. - Sexual handups: In particular, it's just really hard for me to have sex satisfyingly. I'm happy to suck a dick at will, I'm happy to be touched, but being reluctant to do anal + not having the vagina I'd rather makes this awkward. In general, I fit better with people looking for kink over straight-up sex. **Pro or con, depending** - Shy: I'm hesitant to do new things and still quite self-conscious. This can be a pro if you like a girl who is vulnerable and a bit embarrassed by things, or a con if you don't like having to tread carefully. - Geeky/weird: I've been a pretty serious gamer in the past, I spend a lot of time learning random things that catch my interest, I'm not great at socializing (I usually get along fine but have trouble going from acquaintance to friend), and I tend to find odd things engaging. A plus if you have a similar like for interesting details or fun trivia, a con if you just want me to shut up about random stretches of Alaskan wilderness I just went through on Google Maps. - Trans: Obviously this is a big personal-preference thing. I don't want the trans aspects of my body particularly emphasized (in particular, I have no interest in ever topping anyone), but if my history as a trans woman appeals to you, that's totally okay (e.g. my current partner actually likes the fact that being a woman - and thus the inferior in our relationship - was a deliberate choice of mine). - Odd kink list: I'm in to a kind of odd mix of things, I assume because of my weird history. Pro if you're into my various odd likes, con if you're not. - Inexperienced in person: I've been kinky *online* for forever, but I've only had a handful of sexual encounters in person. Pro if you like exploration/teaching, con if you want someone who is already fully comfortable with sex. - Timid: It is very difficult for me to trust and surrender. I -can- do it, but it takes doing and time, and it relies on you being able to handle me when I'm freaking out a little. The pro here is that once I trust you, I'm an open book; the con is that it's not easy to get me there. ---------------- # What I'm looking for: *And then her heart changed, or at least she understood it; and the winter passed, and the sun shone upon her...I want to be a healer, and love all things that grow and are not barren.* - Eowyn, The Lord of the Rings * A man - or possibly a woman or couple, although these might tweak things somewhat - who is interested in both caring for and being served by me. Let's say somewhere +- 5 years from me, so 22-32 or so, but I'm not *super* picky about that within reason. * Generally left-ish politics. Because I have no tolerance at all for 'global' misogyny, and because the relationship I'm looking for is, let's face it, kind of misogynistic, it's very important that I be able to trust that you seeing *me* as an inferior is not reflecting on women in general. I have an interest in politics and it'd be nice if you did too. * Intelligence: bluntly, you are probably not as smart as I am; very few people are (cue the /r/choosingbeggars link, but it's true!). But I want to get as close as possible. A good education, broad scientific and philosophical interests, a willingness to consider strange ideas and hypotheticals, and a love for finding joy in looking at mundane things is a big part of making me like you as a person, not just as a sexual/romantic partner. Basically, I'm looking for someone who'll look at a rock and go ""holy shit, there was a glacier here thousands of years ago and it left a scratch there and that's crazy cool"". * Trustworthiness: **Absolutely 100% essential**. If I do not trust you, I will not commit to a relationship with you, because I cannot be vulnerable enough to have my needs met. This isn't just not lying, it's understanding what ways I can be taken control of and how far that control can be taken. Occasional missteps are one thing, but being pushed too far makes me close up quickly. * Broadly clean-shaven-ish appearance: Despite my politics and background, I still have a lot of the culture of my upbringing. Tattoos and heavy piercings are major turn-offs, and smoking/drug use (beyond perhaps occasional legal pot) is a hard 'no'. I'm not super picky about weight, although my ideal is certainly a lot closer to healthy than I'm at; some degree of fitness would be nice. * Financially stable: Important if you want me focused on my place in the home, obviously. Not a requirement, but a plus, especially if you want me as a full-time housewife down the line. * *Personally* stable: I am a moody, chaotic, difficult to manage person. I need someone who can roll with that, and ideally act as a counterbalance. I am childish in a lot of ways and need a paternal hand, something that I think the sort of man I'm after would generally enjoy giving. * Dominant, but not mean: I want you to take joy (and yes, sexual satisfaction) in taking me under your arm. I want you to look at me and feel proud that I've chosen my place under you, and I want you to encourage me *to* take that place, with the knowing that me being in a relationship with you is implicit permission to shape me. But for the most part, I'm after encouragement, leading, and gentle conditioning, not abuse. The line is obviously a bit fuzzy, but if your interest is mainly sadistic, I'm not the girl for you. I think that'll do for now. If you got through that whole fucking novel, bravo. And as I said at the start, if you think we'd be a good fit, no matter your situation/sex/number of people, **send me a PM, seriously, it's cool**. And if you just like the idea and thought it was hot, well, feel free to tell me that too &gt;.&gt; No fear, guys, I'm lookin' to be a submissive wife, you ain't gonna insult me if you're not mean. - R"

Here for what the title says. Ok, not really what the title says. But close. Maybe not the heartbreak though. Definitely not that. Never judge a post by its title. Or something like that in the internet age. Thank god for clickbait.* Hey there Reddit. How's it going this fine day? How's 2018 treating you so far? Made any resolutions yet. I have, and that's what I am here for. (probably) My fellow grasshoppers, as you know dating is not easy. And online dating is even less easy. It's often difficult to find a person that just fits. Not like a soulmate (in the beginning at least), but more like a glove that just fits. So you can imagine the chances of finding someone that you like, they like you, all this for a long time and also are on the same level of kinky perversions as yourself. All this for a 'someone' that is a single one out of thousands of millions of possible people and supposed to be 'meant for you'. The chances are very low. But even with all of those impossible odds stacked against any chance of finding anything meaningful and substantial out there in the cesspool of bullshit, it's still possible to hope. Hope that it will be all worth it for that one person that makes it worth it. Maybe I am a bit delusional to think I can find it here, but so be it. It doesnt make sense (mathematically or logically otherwise), but I still believe it is possible to find a glove that fits. I know this reads more like a vanilla dating profile than one geared towards individuals of the BDSM propensity. But that's the whole point. Kinks are just a part of who I am as a whole. They are not my entire being. When I recently discovered my desires of the BDSM variety, I didn't do it by making a Fetlife profile or visiting munches or watching Youtube videos on how to make the perfect restraints out of rope. I don't understand the titles and the rules, to be honest. I am just a guy, who likes to be dominant (and maybe submissive? I'm not sure), that's all. I'd not want to be reduced to a 'to do' list of kinks. Though you can rest assured. There are a ton of dirty, pervy things that will be explored when the right person comes along. The awesome and fun stuff will obviously be a part of whatever that happens, and it will come later. Im much more interested in connecting with as a normal person/human being first. I'm 26, 6'1"" tall, brown eyes, black hair. I have a short beard that I like to trim ever so slightly. I am currently on the bulkier side of things body wise. I had been unhealthy in the past (obesity), and now I am working to take care of my body to the best of my ability. That involves lifting 3 times a week, running 3 times a week (on alternate days), Yoga daily(ok more like 4 times a week), playing a sport or two on the weekends, complemented by a simple yet effective diet. I'm not sure if I look like a stereotypical dom. I look more like an extra large cuddly bear, like Winnie the Pooh. (Unless the stereotypical dom looks like an extra large Winnie the Pooh!) Im also a pretty normal guy. I like to ride on my motorcycle endlessly on an open road, scratch the underbelly of my neighbor's cat (He likes it that cute bastard!), have unexpected bursts of raw, honest emotions in the middle of gatherings that make me afterward go, ""Wait, did I really do that?"" and much more. Also, not a fan of writing about myself. This post has been an exercise in self-discipline. I like a quiet night in versus a loud night out any day of the week. No drugs, smoking, drinking, crazy party any of that. A few hours after we talk, you will feel like youve always known me. I take good care of myself after years of being ignorant about its importance. I can talk days and days about diet and fitness and have grown very very passionate about it. I also have both dom and sub inclinations. Though I think that labels are not very helpful and am still not entirely sure what any of it means and have yet to explore much as Ive not yet found the right person. I believe all of this is much more important than a list of kinks because Im just a human being at the end of the day, with my flaws and imperfections that you should know and hopefully accept and love before we talk our perversions. I see sex and intimacy as beautiful private things, that are born out of a depth of connection and are not pleasures that should be had on a whim. And as you may have experienced this is kinda hard to find. If youre looking to check stuff off a kink list, I am not the person to do this. I want much more than that. I want patience, loyalty, kindness and a metric tonne of cuddles. I'm a romantic sap! But I also want to be able to tease you again and again till you beg me to fuck you. And then fuck you till you beg me to stop. I have simple desires like that! My best friend that laughs at my terrible jokes and lets me have a delusion of being the smarter one while being extremely intelligent herself but modest about it. At the same time, also hungry for me with an extremely creative, dirty and filthy mind! And I don't want to sacrifice one for the other. I guess you could say I am being unrealistic here, but so be it. Maybe this person is just a grand delusion and it's too much to ask of someone. I don't care. I get to live only once. I have to do my best. I'm just hoping that there is someone out there that comes across this research paper length of a post and coincidentally wants this all. To be best friends and create memories as well as loiter in a pool of endless depravity that will lead to mind-blowing orgasms and utter peace. It'll not be for lack of trying that I won't find what I want. I want to find my complement. Different from me, my glove that just fits right. The sub to my dom and maybe the dom to my sub if we so desire. Someone who knows the kind of intimacy this creates and knows the amount of trust needed and the vulnerability that it requires. Or if they don't, then they learn it with me in time. You might see that I haven't said much in terms of details. These will come with time. I would like to take this slow. Age-wise I am pretty open-minded. Don't let our age differences (either more or less) deter you from reaching out. I would ideally really like to have something IRL and meet ultimately. Long Distance or online is not as bankable as a relationship at all. Though I do realize the kind of situation I am in, being from a different continent as most of the users here. And the astronomical chances of finding a traveler here that has similar interests. I do welcome online as well as a result. As for your body, I do realize that beauty and attraction are more than just descriptions like petite or cute or plump. I'd like you to be healthy or at least doing what you can to be healthy, as I know the struggles that come with a fitness journey. Also, love yourself (for lack of a better word) and your body. So I can love it in turn. I should stop writing before I bore you to death. I hope this post serves as an adequate icebreaker. I dont know if Ill find her here, but Im going to try and hope just in case. Nothing is certain, things may or may not take any shape. But you will not find out without reaching out. Now I'm going to ask you to do the most cliche thing possible. Just be yourself. We shall see where things lead and hope for the best. Are you my glove that fits just right?"

Dating sucks. Online dating sucks even more. Oh, yes, lets trade disembodied lists of our favorite movies and books, surely that will foster intimacy and promote longstanding compatibility! said nobody ever. And some of us are nave enough to think we can find that person here. Hi. Im a hopelessfully romantic, not even close to 7 foot tall but most likely taller than you so dont worry its ok I get it, otherwise pretty normal guy who cant believe hes 30 already and who rarely lets his facial hair go past a few days stubble. I know, reddit loves their beards, Im sorry. I like wandering through the park, befriending strangers dogs, singing in the middle of large crowds, and hate writing about myselfkindoflikethis. I will take a quiet night in vs. a loud night out any day of the week, dont drink and have never touched a drug or been to a crazy party, go to church every Sunday, and am probably exactly as boring as Im making myself sound right now. I take excellent care of myself, can talk your ear off about diet and fitness and will probably ask you to come to the gym with me at some point, and think I look ok in a suit as well as out of one. Im also a dom, even though I dont like labels and am still not entirely sure what it means and have yet to explore much of what that even is as Ive been saving it for the right person who I have most likely yet to meet. I mention all of this because its important, much more important than a tedious list of kinks and limits, because Im a person with a life Im passionate about, complete with flaws and imperfections and surprises and depths you should want to learn and love before we discuss our favorite spanking implements (my hands). I never last long on the more blatantly BDSM related sites with their blatantly sexual agenda and blatantly displayed genitalia (SO many questions about that) where people seem to gather to find casual play partners and hairy old dudes to tie them up and take compromising pictures and jump right into things that would take me a really long time to open up to. Maybe Im too old fashioned for this, but Ive always seen sex and intimacy as beautiful, precious, and intensely private things that belong in the confines of a committed, loving relationship, not selfish pleasures to be sought out where, how, and whenever possible. As you might imagine, this has as difficult to live as it has been to find in another person. D/s is not a sexual dynamic to me; the intense and awesome depth of sexuality it can offer is, instead, an expression and reflection of the intense and awesome vulnerability and love that exist between a dom and his sub. The possession, hunger, electricity, utter filth, blissful peace, and terrifying beauty inherent in an ideal dynamic stem from the mind and the heart, over time and trust, not from hormones in a moment of physical weakness. If youre looking to check some kinky sex off your bucket list within the month, kindly look elsewhere, its very easy to find nowadays. I want, I need so much more. I need cuddles, patience, warmth, unconditional praise of my cooking, unabashed nerdiness, unwavering loyalty, unlimited kindness, and an embarrassing amount of kissing. But I also need to be able to stop you mid-sentence with a look, pull you to your knees by your hair, earn and exercise complete control over your orgasms, and call you a good girl knowing full well what that does to you. I need an easily excitable adventure buddy, a fellow connoisseur of terrible jokes, a compassionate old soul, an avid art appreciator, as well as an insatiable oral aficionado, a stalwart spankee (or is it spanko? you know what I mean), and an inexhaustible depth of filth. My best friend who also happens to be my slut. Ive spent too many years trying to sacrifice one for the other and refuse to waste anyones time with being less than completely honest about who I am and what I need. Maybe Im just greedy (spoiler alert: I am). Maybe I want too much and am projecting an impossible fantasy on a fellow imperfect human being. But maybe Im not alone in straddling this contradiction after all. Maybe someone is out there who might happen upon this novel of a post who also needs it all, the full breadth of both extremes; an endlessly rich vanilla relationship full of dates, laughs, memories, and adventures, coupled with an endlessly depraved d/s dynamic full of power exchange, exploration, openness, and earth shattering orgasms. Id much rather write some of my heart out into a text box than remain content in accepting it does not and cannot exist. Time for some real talk; this was written over several days and started in a snarky place with the title but ended in a sincere place and is a fair bit more rambly than intended upon proofreading. Im a dom, and Im looking for a sub. Not a sub, but rather my sub. Like a one and only forever sort of deal that starts in friendship and blossoms into a love that would make the rest of the world jealous if they could ever understand. I want to date like normal people, only knowing that the endgame includes and involves much more than 5 minutes of missionary once a week. Im not looking for my equal; Im looking for my complement. We will likely be very different in many ways, and I hope we can both learn so much from each other as we build a loving relationship alongside a beautiful d/s dynamic. Maybe weve shared the same dream our whole lives and, in some sense, already know each other better than anyone else. As profuse as this post is, Ive left much unsaid. There are, of course, many particulars to discuss and many things to share in time, which I very much look forward to. But well need to take things slowly. I trust too easily and love too quickly and as a result get hurt too often. Start with my mind, and the rest will follow when its ready. In the interests of not wasting anyones time (which you clearly have an abundance of if youre still reading this), Im not looking for anything long distance or online, though well start here (and tell our grandparents we met in the park). I have a pretty firm type if you buy into that (introverted, nerdy, petite, cute, unassuming girl-next-door, since I know Ill be asked) but know that beauty and attraction manifest themselves far deeper than the surface. Just please be healthy and happy with your body, especially if its going to be mine one day. I hope this was enough (and not too much) to ignite the spark we need to connect. I cant promise anything between us, but I can promise we will never know if you dont reach out. Im not going anywhere, dont bite (yet), and am clearly a fan of epically long letters, creativity, and originality. Just be you. Thats all I can ever ask of you, even without knowing you yet. Im ready. Are you?"
626,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"27 [F4M] [F4MF] Seattle - Looking for traditional gender roles. Long &amp; detailed, with pros/cons + guaranteed replies to PMs.",13,7olmtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/7olmtg/27_f4m_f4mf_seattle_looking_for_traditional/,2018-01-07 07:17:36,"Hey there, /r/BDSMPersonals. Those of you who are here more to fantasize than to PM (God knows I've done enough of that) can skip down to the 'sexual history' section, where I get into some colorful detail about what gets my motor running. If you think you're interested **don't be afraid to PM me**! I **will** respond to proper PMs, and I'll do it honestly, even if my honest response is ""I'm not interested"". I know it sucks ass to get crickets after a message eight trillion times in a row, guys, and I'm not gonna leave you hanging. **I do ask that you read the whole post before messaging,** (there's a keyword buried down there as a filter) and that you're clear upfront if you're messaging for any reason other than interest in pursuing such a relationship. Anyway. ---------------- # About Me *I am not a concept! But I don't hate the idea of being kinda seen as one...* - Not Clementine, *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* I'm a woman in my late 20s living in the south Seattle area, and I'm looking to try something I've dipped my toes into a bit (see the history section below) a bit more seriously: namely, I want to be in a fairly traditional relationship dynamic, where I (as a woman) am obedient and lower-status to my partner (presumably as a man - however, I am bisexual, and if there is by some chance a woman interested in this dynamic with her I'm open to that). However, I want to be clear that this is *not* something I want to suggest or impose on the world at large - if you're an actual misogynist in the sense of ""lol women can't do stuff"" in general, I'm not interested. I am, for the most part, looking for a **relationship**, not just a one-off, although sufficiently intriguing ideas might not be ignored (again, you've got nothing to lose! take a shot!). Ideally this would be in-person, but relocating within the U.S. for the right partner is not out of the question down the line. I was raised in a southern fundamentalist home. I've long since left that world, but at some level, deep in the less-rational parts of my brain, this is what being a woman is to me. This is my compromise to myself, as a modern woman who believes very much in equality but still wants a good strong hand behind me and a firm place in the world that is quite specifically gendered. I am looking for something that is sort-of 24/7, in the sense that while actual sex-kinkiness should be kept mostly to the bedroom (and I *am* kinky in other respects), I do actually want to find someone who wants to be the leader in a home and who wants his woman to generally accept his decisions and judgment. I want to defer and lean on you day to day, but not to be a helpless slave, if that makes sense. I am happy to be 'molded' or trained to some extent; see the sexy section below. I am trans, and long-since transitioned. I pass fine, but have not had (and do not currently plan to have) genital surgery. I have been on hormones for some years, however, and otherwise look/feel/etc like any other woman (in particular, I have a couple quite grabbable breasts). If this is a dealbreaker for you, well, there ya go. Outside of the bedroom, I'm a capable professional who teaches for a living. I have a master's degree and an interest in almost every aspect of the world, and am someone who is rarely if ever out of interesting things to say. If you like details and trivia and all the fascinating, amazing little interconnections of the world, you'll find me a companion more than worth your time and energy. I'm a good cook and I get better all the time. I'm politically fairly liberal, by which I mean that my *positions* are liberal as all hell and I basically think everyone right of center is kind of a dumbass, but I'm difficult to offend with good faith and do not go about my life looking for fights. I tend to like media that is either complex/deep with a lot of philosophical gray areas (like, say, *Firefly* or KOTOR2) or that is straightforward and stirs up something pure (like *300* stirring up epic ""woo, fuck yeah!"" or *Despicable Me* stirring up maternal ""d'awww!""). I'm not an easy person to know. I have a lot of internal contradictions (says, unnecessarily, the feminist-ish woman looking to be barefoot in the kitchen) that even I don't understand a lot of the time. The key-word is 'lime'. I want to work these out and try to experience parts of me that haven't gotten to play, and I hope you're the sort of person who wants to explore me through and through, because to the right dom-type I'm an open and (to hear previous partners tell it) interesting book. I'm bisexual, as mentioned above, and open to some degree of polyamory. This can be as simple as 'occasional outside play partner' or involve me submitting to e.g. a couple as part of a home. Non-traditional folks, don't be afraid to message; I am open to unicorn-ing. I trust slowly, and will not jump in to anything super serious overnight. However, I am happy to start with the asymmetry in the relationship, even on e.g. a first date. I honestly think it would be easier, given that the end goal is to put myself at your feet, to just never think of you as anything but my superior. On a practical level, that doesn't mean I won't protect myself, though, and giving an order I feel the need to disobey is bad news and likely to disrupt or end the relationship on the spot. -------------------- # Sexual History *Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because one of the effects of traditional-relationship submission is to depress your ability to want anything else. As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the final loser would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually obscenely biological.* *I_Am_A_Lemon usually played to lose.* - Not Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy When I first transitioned, I actually thought I only liked girls. But one guy - who is still a current partner to me, but who is far away and actively encourages me to look for a relationship that can proceed more than ours can - ended up running into me on one of the random RP sites. We played a bit, and he...well, convinced me, heh. He was warm but firm; he respected my views but believed I'd be happier under a man, and eventually he got me to try it. It took a while, and a lot of internal reluctance! ""Eh, guys"" became ""hmm, guys"" became ""Oh, no, I don't like guys, I'm just sitting here beet red, panting, and damp at the idea of one fucking me!"" became ""you want me to wear a collar?"" became ""hmm, I guess I could try giving head"", became ""Jesus Christ I'm sleeping in my collar and imagining my man watching me happily"" became ""I'm a good little housewife and I need to obey my man"". In short, despite the weird contradiction it has with my views, it is hard for me to get around the fact that I *am* a submissive woman, for whom a traditional place next to a man is an important part of womanhood. I can't get pregnant, obviously, but I'd sure as hell like to; the thought of my husband looking at me with pride at me, the woman he's conquered outside and in makes my heart pound, even when I just type it. It feels *really* good, and it genuinely makes me feel happy and safe when I don't think about it too hard (when I do, I still get occasional ""what are you doing? be strong and independent etc etc"" pangs, although these have gotten rarer over time). I've had a chance to explore a lot with this partner, and my like for the idea goes pretty deep. I enjoy the thought of shaping myself to some extent to my man's wishes: finding his likes and pursuing them, and especially the idea of finding myself internalizing what I'm told. This last has already happened to some extent; with my explicit consent he's done his best to deepen this side of me, and the partner I'm looking for here would (with trust established) have the same consent. I'm a whole person, with my own wants and will and abilities, but I want that person to be yielding and malleable - and if over time I'm shaped into something I wasn't before, so much the better. (At this point I have to pause for a sec. Hooo boy do I get warmed up around this stuff :P) I have, unsurprisingly, a more general interest in other kink. In no particular order, I like: * Transformation: For presumably obvious reasons this is a big one for me. I fantasized about changing sex before I transitioned, but I'm a fan of animal transformations as well, both partial and total. My current partner has added a particular kink for becoming his fleshlight to the list &lt;.&lt; * Hypnosis: Again, probably obvious from what I've written so far. It's all about the halfway loss of control to me: knowing what's changed, knowing how I'm being manipulated/led but feeling the need to follow along anyway. I like to resist and lose, basically. I don't think I've ever gotten into a proper 100% trance the way some people talk about, it's usually more an altered frame of mind and a sense of 'playing along'. * Pet play: Ohhhhh yes. Put me in a kennel on the floor and lock me in, oh please oh please oh please. For me, this is a 'soft' kink; it's about embarrassment, vulnerability, and praise-in-subservience. It's hard for me to explain the line between being warmly humiliated and being degraded in my head; the best I can do is ""oh, look at you, you're so happy in your place with &lt;X embarrassing/role-signalling attribute, e.g. collar, pregnant belly, etc&gt;"" is comforting and hot, ""you worthless slut"" is not. * Restraining: I think I like this one. Certainly I like the *idea* of being tied up and helpless. But I've never gotten to try it in person beyond just wearing a collar. I'm pretty sure it's a like though so I put it in. * Some degree of...I dunno what to call it. ""Sister-subbing""? I've never done this, but I actually find the idea of a submissive woman guiding me to join her under her man incredibly exciting. So for you couples, there's one for ya. * Sorta-kinda ageplay. I have *zero* interest in calling someone ""daddy"" (it's a huge turn-off), but I do like the power asymmetry that ageplay can bring to the table. Are you noticing a theme here? ...and probably other stuff, too. I'm weird, if you like a thing, ask. In particular, a few things I am **not** interested in: any toilet-y stuff, actual pain/discomfort/sadism, blood or injury, 'mean' put-downs, and certain kinds of excessively porn-ish talk (I like the role being emphasized, but a lot of 'yeah you're such a slut for cock in your whore hole' sort of things turn me off). ---------------------------- # Pros &amp; Cons of Me as a Partner *Women have a much better time than men in this world; there are far more things forbidden to them* - Oscar Wilde **Pros** - Enthusiastic: when I like stuff and get over my shyness, I -really- like it. If anything, expect to have to restrain me rather than try to get a response out of me. - Smart: I have a master's degree, there are few subjects I can't talk about intelligently, I'm interested in current affairs, and I learn more every day. I'm a sub, not a bimbo - although you might take particular joy in having a capable woman under you instead of one who couldn't do much else. - Reasonably high sex drive: it's very spiky, some days it'll roar and I'll be goin crazy and sometimes it'll be low. In general, I think my drive is above-average by a decent margin, which I imagine is a pro for you. And I do really enjoy my partner's interest in me. - Trainable: An active interest of mine. A big part of the appeal is finding myself being molded gently into something I wasn't before, with my consent but only partial control over the process (I really like the word 'process'). - Sweet: I'm compassionate and loving and being in a traditionally feminine role is what I want in a relationship. That means me being the heart of the home, being someone who can bring cheerfulness and emotional support. I take a lot of joy in small things, and I am quite easy to make happy. - Honest: This is a big one for me, and something I insist on in a partner. I will not lie to you, nor will I betray your trust in other ways. I don't always understand myself, but I will always be honest to the best of my understanding. The fact that *anyone* lies in a romantic relationship still amazes me. Trust is king in all romantic relationships, and losing it pretty much instantly kills them, at least for me. - Flexible: This goes with honesty. If you want to do something with me, bring it up. I may (depending on the bounds of the relationship) say no or not be interested, but I'm hard to offend and open to new interests. **Cons** - Unstable: This is a big one! I have decent reason to believe I am mildly bipolar II, and will be seeing a doctor about this in the near future. I'm moody and can fall into very difficult-to-help depression. One of the reasons this relationship model appeals is having someone to steady me out a bit and to act as a counterbalance to the chaotic and contradictory nature of my own mind. - ""Meh"" appearance: I've got an alright face and breasts and pass just fine, but I'm quite overweight. This is a thing I'm open to working on, but something my current willpower has not been able to get to. Weight aside, I'm not ugly, but I'm not a stunner either; there are probably better-looking girls out there without much trouble finding them. Date me for my mind and my interests, not my body, basically :P - Temper: It's rare (once every month or two, usually, although great stress can elevate that), but it's nasty. I'm doing my best to work on this, and I expect treating the instability will help somewhat. Most of the time, I'm nice and pleasant, but on a really bad day I can burst. - Low-motivation: With accountability, I'm fine. If you give me clear standards and a command, and I recognize that I'm subservient to you, I'll get it done. But I need the accountability badly. It's also of paramount importance not to burn me out! If I'm close to it, I'll let you know so that I can be properly released from whatever command is doing so, but if I'm coming to you with that it's probably important that you *do* give me permission to stop. - Sexual handups: In particular, it's just really hard for me to have sex satisfyingly. I'm happy to suck a dick at will, I'm happy to be touched, but being reluctant to do anal + not having the vagina I'd rather makes this awkward. In general, I fit better with people looking for kink over straight-up sex. **Pro or con, depending** - Shy: I'm hesitant to do new things and still quite self-conscious. This can be a pro if you like a girl who is vulnerable and a bit embarrassed by things, or a con if you don't like having to tread carefully. - Geeky/weird: I've been a pretty serious gamer in the past, I spend a lot of time learning random things that catch my interest, I'm not great at socializing (I usually get along fine but have trouble going from acquaintance to friend), and I tend to find odd things engaging. A plus if you have a similar like for interesting details or fun trivia, a con if you just want me to shut up about whatever random thing I just learned on a Wikipedia binge. - Trans: Obviously this is a big personal-preference thing. I don't want the trans aspects of my body particularly emphasized (in particular, I have no interest in ever topping anyone), but if my history as a trans woman appeals to you, that's totally okay (e.g. my current partner actually likes the fact that being a woman - and thus the inferior in our relationship - was a deliberate choice of mine). - Odd kink list: I'm in to a kind of odd mix of things, I assume because of my weird history. Pro if you're into my various odd likes, con if you're not. - Inexperienced in person: I've been kinky *online* for forever, but I've only had a handful of sexual encounters in person. Pro if you like exploration/teaching, con if you want someone who is already fully comfortable with sex. - Timid: It is very difficult for me to trust and surrender. I -can- do it, but it takes doing and time, and it relies on you being able to handle me when I'm freaking out a little. The pro here is that once I trust you, I'm an open book; the con is that it's not easy to get me there. ---------------- # What I'm looking for: *And then her heart changed, or at least she understood it; and the winter passed, and the sun shone upon her...I want to be a healer, and love all things that grow and are not barren.* - Eowyn, The Lord of the Rings * A man - or possibly a woman or couple, although these might tweak things somewhat - who is interested in both caring for and being served by me. Let's say somewhere +- 5 years from me, so 22-32 or so, but I'm not *super* picky about that within reason. * Local. I am willing to consider possible people at a distance, but only in cases of a very good match. * Generally left-ish politics. Because I have no tolerance at all for 'global' misogyny, and because the relationship I'm looking for is, let's face it, kind of misogynistic, it's very important that I be able to trust that you seeing *me* as an inferior is not reflecting on women in general. I have an interest in politics and it'd be nice if you did too. * Intelligence: I like to learn things and explore, and I need a partner who wants to do so as much as I do. A good education, broad scientific and philosophical interests, a willingness to consider strange ideas and hypotheticals, and a love for finding joy in looking at mundane things is a big part of making me like you as a person, not just as a sexual/romantic partner. Basically, I'm looking for someone who'll look at a rock and go ""holy shit, there was a glacier here thousands of years ago and it left a scratch there and that's crazy cool"". * Trustworthiness: **Absolutely 100% essential**. If I do not trust you, I will not commit to a relationship with you, because I cannot be vulnerable enough to have my needs met. This isn't just not lying, it's understanding what ways I can be taken control of and how far that control can be taken. Occasional missteps are one thing, but being pushed too far makes me close up quickly. * Broadly clean-shaven-ish appearance: Despite my politics and background, I still have a lot of the culture of my upbringing. Tattoos and heavy piercings are major turn-offs, and smoking/drug use (beyond perhaps occasional legal pot) is a hard 'no'. I'm not super picky about weight, although my ideal is certainly a lot closer to healthy than I'm at; some degree of fitness would be nice. * Financially stable: Not a requirement, but a plus, especially if you want me as a full-time housewife down the line. Important if you want me focused on my place in the home, obviously. * *Personally* stable: I am a moody, chaotic, difficult to manage person. I need someone who can roll with that, and ideally act as a counterbalance. I am childish in a lot of ways and need a paternal hand, something that I think the sort of man I'm after would generally enjoy giving. * Dominant, but not mean: I want you to take joy (and yes, sexual satisfaction) in taking me under your arm. I want you to look at me and feel proud that I've chosen my place under you, and I want you to encourage me *to* take that place, with the knowing that me being in a relationship with you is implicit permission to shape me. But for the most part, I'm after encouragement, leading, and gentle conditioning, not abuse. The line is obviously a bit fuzzy, but if your interest is mainly sadistic, I'm not the girl for you. I think that'll do for now. If you got through that whole fucking novel, bravo. And as I said at the start, if you think we'd be a good fit, no matter your situation/sex/number of people, **send me a PM, seriously, it's cool**. The worst I'll do is say no. No fear, guys, I'm lookin' to be a submissive wife, you ain't gonna insult me if you're not mean. - R"

I'm looking for something mature, communicative, and kinky. I'm absolutely open to a relationship developing but not especially aiming for that with this post. What am I looking for is someone: - Submissively inclined; experience not required. Playful psychological switchiness is good, too. - Intellectual and conversational; inclined to philosophize and introspect while cuddling. - Open minded and looking explore fantasies, dirty banter, and a whole range of naughty things. - Anything from petite to large. There are many facets to attraction and I don't rule much out, physically. - Preferably using some form of BC and open to condomless sex later down the line (testing is no problem). Me: - Lukewarm on labels but primal daddydomish. I'm not into ageplay but I'm naturally affectionate and supportive. Fairly experienced with much I still want to do. - My primary kink is intimacy, which is to say, unique to each person. Vulnerability and taboo heighten intimacy for me. - Safe, sane, no anger issues, genuine. - I'm overweight. Not extreme, but not everybody's cup of tea. Nonetheless I have good stamina, am well endowed (very thick), and all around sexually capable. Lastly, some of my specific kinks include restraints, teasing, denial, squirting, cum, rules and punishments, and on and on. Again, for me it is about intimacy and creating an experience unique to each person I'm with. If that appeals to you, I'd love to chat. (I'm in Harlem. I can host but have roommates.

Im /u/ardent_potatoes. Im just a guy, sitting in front of the Internet, asking it to love me. And by it, I mean you. Yes, *you*. You very specifically. I dont believe in love at first sight. Or even love at first reddit PM. I believe in love being created as the result of a long period of mutual respect and friendship. And if sometimes that mutual respect and friendship *just happens* to involve you having quite the red bum, and maybe even the ~~occasional~~ quite frequent gag in your mouth, blindfold on, while your body is held down and youre reminded just whose little slut you are, so much the better, am I right? Hopefully this relationship will also involve a lot of cuddling and laughing and storytelling and adventures and smiles and happiness and kisses and trust and friends and travel and games and all the other wonderful things that come with a happy, healthy relationship. And conversely, I expect it shall also involve some crying, consoling, sympathy, help, support, care, commitment and compromise. Because everyone is complicated, even littles like you. Any person will tell you that regardless of their sexuality, their sexuality is not the most interesting thing about them. As it happens, Im dominant and a caregiver. As it happens, youre submissive and a little. We complement each other well. Sure, this is important to us. But its not the most important thing. It just is. All your life youve known you needed someone to take care of you, to guide you and put you in your place when you misbehave. Youve known every orgasm would feel that extra bit better had it been earned rather than merely wanted. You feel naked without a collar around your neck. Nothing gives you wilder pleasure than feeling my hand slap hard on your ass or have it wring gently or not-so-gently around your neck. The feeling of vulnerability which sometimes engulfs you and the trust you place in me despite that brings you greater joy than you know how to express with words. Is that more important than the fact that youre a passionate Ravenclaw? Or that you just cant go a day without listening to David Bowie? That you love to help people? That you aspire to be Prime Minister one day? Of course not. I love all those things about you as well. Anyway. Would you like to message me and see if we fall in love? "

I like the vulnerability working out brings; Sweaty, out of breath, blood rushing to your head and wherever else, etc :p I also like to bring people out of their shell, help them out and make them more confident, in a gentle yet controlling way. It's hard to explain, even in my own head. I'm looking for any female subs who are looking to lose a bit/alot of weight, work on their strength or tone, or even just someone who likes getting sweaty and close, and would like to take advantage of my equipment... ;p Others can also enquire, as I'm happy to chat, then hang/workout as friends, with benefits being a free gym :p Anyone interested, please take a look at my profile, drop me a message, etc. You can get to know me a bit first, and, if you do decide to visit my gym, we can figure out some way of you feeling safe doing so (As in, some way of proving I'm not a creepy serial killer, and having others know where you are, etc).

In messages I'm very talkative but in person I love to be the listener rather than the initiator. I'm open minded, with quirky interests, and love to learn about new things. I'm submissive, both sexually and personally (although I'm much more equal here), and curious about exploring a lifestyle based on that. Financially I take care of my own, although I've moved back home for various reasons (although I'm looking to strike out again soon). I'm of average height (5 foot 10) with brown/hazel eyes, and brown curly or wavy hair depending on its mood that day. My body type is average. What am I looking for in the opposite sex? Trust, honesty, and communication. I find these three virtues lacking in many relationships today. Honestly, also dominance and an open mind given the kind of lifestyle I'd like to learn and explore... with open vulnerability and a lack of judgement or taboo. A level of physical attractiveness is nice, but there are all types of attractive qualities and I tend to look at your personality first. A good personality only makes you more beautiful to me on top of everything else. Someone that isn't a partier that needs to go out to be entertained every night and is just as happy staying home and cuddling as they are going to a movie and a resturant. Also someone preferably between the ages of 20 and 35. Addressing the submissive seeking dom aspect, I'm not just looking for a hook up but a connection. A partnership that might lead to more. So sure, its sexual, but it's sexual in expression of self and not in a ""I want to use this emptily"" way. It's a primal truth that's there, uncovered for you to see. Like a book to flip through the pages of. As hobbies I love photography, digital art, driving around aimlessly at night, anything horror related (Halloween is coming!), I'm a pass holder at Disneyland, and I have a compassionate side that enjoys cuddle and netflixing as much (sometimes more) than netflixing and chilling. On top of this with all the trust and vulnerability I'd hope at the very least such a woman would become my best friend and if we find more within it than it's for us to celebrate. Let's exchange a few emails and photos and see where things go. I'd love to hear from you. If you made it this far, have a great day/evening/night :) Edit: I'm cross posting this a bit, but for here I'll mention I do have a FL account if you wish. Send me yours for mine? "

I've been really trying to dig into this; dissecting my thoughts and I think I'm ready. I've been nervous. Overwhelmed. Intimidated. Afraid to get in over my head. Tip toeing around it. Peeking in from the periphery. But I have to at least TRY. Even if it falls on deaf ears (blind eyes in this case?), I have to try. And this post is that attempt. I hope I won't be down voted for where I am in my journey. This is nerve wracking to post and I feel vulnerable admitting my situation. I have very limited experience w D/s and have never been in a romantic/sexual relationship where that was a part of the dynamic. I've discovered I respond to certain facets and want to explore more with the right man. That's where you come in. I day dream about a new adventure. A real and committed relationship where I find someone who excites me. Someone strong and decisive who leads me. Someone who makes me feel safe to discover new things and venture outside my comfort zone. This won't be casual- I'm built for commitment and partnership, deep feelings and giving all I've got. I'll want all of him, even the broken or messy parts of him (because we are all broken and messy) and I would hope he would want all of me- my sensitive nature, my curious mind, my need to be of service. For me to embrace this exploration it needs to be built on a foundation of authentic partnership. Full of humor, trust, appreciation and vulnerability- on both sides to create something amazing and hopefully fulfilling for us both. As you can imagine, I can't go from 0 to 100 in a snap; I can't jump headfirst into this journey of discovery without first focusing on creating a connection and likely begin by having a traditional vanilla relationship with the goal that he would create a safe place and guide me in exploring the D/s dynamic. My biggest fear is that it will be rushed. He should be interested in easing me in...Teaching.....Learning... Nudging.... Guiding...Exploring.. Discovering. What a special bond to build with someone! For me to say ""I have been too afraid but I trust you to lead me."" About me: - I live in the Chicago suburbs - 37 year old professional - confident, very driven and ambitious. I'm a leader at the office but I believe in leading by serving. To serve is part of my DNA - Light brown hair that seems a bit reddish in certain light - 5'3 and size 14 - rubenesque. I embrace my shape and enjoy being womanly. If you like skinny women, I'm not your girl. I'm active but will always be fluffy. - I enjoy my femininity- nice nails, enjoy wearing heels and dresses. Getting dressed up for a fancy evening is always nice but I also enjoy my downtime in jeans and T shirt at a dive bar when possible. Balance. - I have a quick mind and a smart mouth and I admit I'm horribly impatient - I'm very verbal and enjoy a lot of physical touch even when in public. It's a physical manifestation of my connection with someone and I NEED it. Deal breaker if you can't be very affectionate Important to note: - I'm turned on by intelligent men who take action in life and go after what they want. Men who take control and get shit handled. And if they can do that in a calm way,... I seriously swoon. - I don't respond well to being yelled at or ignored. Humiliation and degradation don't turn me on - I am not bratty but I will question things to ensure I understand. To lead me I must trust and respect you. You have to earn that right. Once you have it, you've got me. I will want to take care of you however I can, to make you happy and make you proud - All of the above leads me to believe I would match best with someone who identifies more along the lines of a nurturing ""Daddy Dom"" type (but without the age play) You: - A nurturing dom; firm but fair. Decisive yet caring and affectionate (both physically and verbally) - Also a professional in his mid 30s to late 40s - Encouraging and protective - Preferably lives in Chicagoland. For the right guy I might be able to handle a LD relationship if he is in the Midwest United States. I know this is likely too slow and boring or would require too much patience for many of you but hopefully it resonates with someone. Who wants to take my hand and guide me into this new world? Are you out there? tldr : Seeking committed and fulfilling relationship with nurturing Dom who wants to guide me on my journey into D/s "

Full of humor, trust, appreciation and vulnerability- on both sides to create something amazing and hopefully fulfilling for us both. As you can imagine, I can't go from 0 to 100 in a snap; I can't jump headfirst into this journey of discovery without first focusing on creating a connection and likely begin by having a traditional vanilla relationship with the goal that he would create a safe place and guide me in exploring the D/s dynamic. My biggest fear is that it will be rushed. He should be interested in easing me in...Teaching.....Learning... Nudging.... Guiding...Exploring.. Discovering. What a special bond to build with someone! For me to say ""I have been too afraid but I trust you to lead me."" About me: - I live in the Chicago suburbs - 37 year old professional - confident, very driven and ambitious. I'm a leader at the office but I believe in leading by serving. To serve is part of my DNA - Light brown hair that seems a bit reddish in certain light - 5'3 and size 14. I embrace my shape and enjoy being womanly. If you like skinny women, I'm not your girl. - I enjoy my femininity- nice nails, enjoy wearing heels and dresses. Getting dressed up for a fancy evening is always nice but I also enjoy my downtime in jeans and T shirt at a dive bar when possible. Balance. - I have a quick mind and a smart mouth and I admit I'm horribly impatient - I'm very verbal and enjoy a lot of physical touch even when in public. It's a physical manifestation of my connection with someone and I NEED it. Deal breaker if you can't be very affectionate Important to note: - I'm turned on by intelligent men who take action in life and go after what they want. Men who take control and get shit handled. And if they can do that in a calm way,... I seriously swoon. - I don't respond well to being yelled at or ignored. Humiliation and degradation don't turn me on - I am not bratty but I will question things to ensure I understand. To lead me I must trust and respect you. You have to earn that right. Once you have it, you've got me. I will want to take care of you however I can, to make you happy and make you proud - All of the above leads me to believe I would match best with someone who identifies more along the lines of a nurturing ""Daddy Dom"" type (but without the age play) You: - A nurturing dom; firm but fair. Decisive yet caring and affectionate (both physically and verbally) - Also a professional in his mid 30s to late 40s - Encouraging and protective - Preferably lives in Chicagoland. For the right guy I might be able to handle a LD relationship if he is in the Midwest United States. Tbd on the dynamic. I know this is likely too slow and boring or would require too much patience for many of you but hopefully it resonates with someone. Who wants to take my hand and guide me into this new world? Are you out there? tldr : Seeking committed and fulfilling relationship with nurturing Dom who wants to guide me on my journey into D/s "
647,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"29 [(Trans) M/F] Gothenburg, Sweden / Seeking a more serious play partner",2,76jplt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/76jplt/29_trans_mf_gothenburg_sweden_seeking_a_more/,2017-10-16 02:53:36,"## Hello! I'm a 29-year-old (trans) male and I am looking for a local play partner that will hopefully eventually turn into a special someone where our relationship would extend beyond love and sex. Of especial interest is my desire to explore my submissive side, and I am very much into the D/s dynamic even outside the bedroom, as I've come to realize that D/s is very important to me in my life. To me, D/s is just not a way to have sex, but it is a way of life and how to relate to people close to you, and I would love to find someone to share that lifestyle with, even if it's just initially as play partners. ## About As a person I'm honest, loyal and hardworking, and I strongly value building solid relationships based on trust and respect. There are few things I am ashamed of, and I am willing to talk about most things when it comes to myself. Of course, I do have trust issues, as do most of us, but this is why I value building a lasting relationship together. I've had to deal with a lot of crap in my life, more so than most people my age, and I do need to have those experiences respected. Acceptance is important, and to accept ourselves is to love ourselves and if we cannot love who we ourselves are, then we cannot let others fully love who we ourselves are, either. And while I am not the best at always living up to this myself, I am hardworking and I always spend a great deal of effort on what I do. I also believe in to do as you say and to say as you do, and this is why honesty is another important value of mine. In many ways honesty is similar to authenticity, in that when we are truly honest, we can reveal ourselves in an unconditional way and be truly authentic. Within all that, there is of course a sense of vulnerability involved, and the passion that propels us to be vulnerable with someone else. In such a sense passion is what fuels our willpower to take on any obstacle, and as a person that is capable of feeling a great deal of passion, I too, enjoy pressing other people's buttons in order to push them forward. My partner's failure is therefore ultimately a reflection of myself and I hate letting those I deeply care about down by not being there for them and to help support them in order to realize their best selves. ## Some notes on submission This is also why I do not take the act of submission lightly, since to me, submission is a form of gift that I do not give to anyone who happened to ask for it. I therefore expect the same from you, in that you do not take me and my submission for granted and can see the value in why I do choose to submit to *you* and not someone else. This means that I am not your slave, nor am I going to be your slave, and having left a very abusive relationship in the past, I am not interested in recreating that dynamic, either. Respect, trust and communication are to me the three cornerstones of any healthy relationship, and this applies even more so to D/s. In other words, if I relate to you as your submissive, I truly am *your* submissive, both in terms of mind, body and soul. This is why I do not take submission lightly, and I am only willing to give it to the right person who I believe rightfully deserves it. ## My vanilla life Finally, when I am not caught up in the world of BDSM, I tend to enjoy playing the phone game Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius and I try to find some time to play more games in general and my current list includes getting Nier: Automata and to finish Thief 4 and Final Fantasy XV. I also regularly workout in order to build some muscle and lose the final bits of excess weight, cook nice food to eat and occasionally bake -- yes, I do that, yell at my two cats for being stupid, dabble with photo manipulation and graphics editing, write the occasional short story or poem, hang out with my online friends on Discord, spend way too much time on the internet than I should, and listen to music. I typically enjoy various subgenres of metal, and I'm currently obsessed with Machinae Supremacy again. In other words, I'm just your general kind of nerd of my age who would appreciate some nice company along the way. And if you got this far down without being deterred by that text wall, I'd love for you to send me a message so we can chat a bit more here or elsewhere, and ideally maybe take a fika together (Hint: I really got a sweet spot for pecan pie cakes and pastry). Looking forward to hear from you and see what kind of person you are. But for now, wishing you all the best. -E"

I'm not actually that entitled! But if you found something in you inclined to obey the title as you opened it, perhaps we ought explore that inclination together. I'm looking for something mature, communicative, and kinky. I'm absolutely open to a relationship developing but not especially aiming for that with this post. What I am looking for is someone: - Submissively inclined; experience not required. Playful psychological switchiness is good, too. - Intellectual and conversational; inclined to philosophize and introspect while cuddling. - Open minded and looking explore fantasies, dirty banter, and a whole range of naughty things. - Anything from petite to large. There are many facets to attraction and I don't rule much out, physically. - Preferably using some form of BC and open to condomless sex later down the line (testing is no problem). Me: - Lukewarm on labels but primal daddydomish. I'm not into ageplay but I'm naturally affectionate and supportive. Fairly experienced with much I still want to do. - My primary kink is intimacy, which is to say, unique to each person. Vulnerability and taboo heighten intimacy for me. - Safe, sane, no anger issues, genuine. - I'm overweight. Not extreme, but not everybody's cup of tea. Nonetheless I have good stamina, am well endowed (very thick), and all around sexually capable. Lastly, some of my specific kinks include restraints, teasing, denial, squirting, cum, rules and punishments, and on and on. Again, for me it is about intimacy and creating an experience unique to each person I'm with. If that appeals to you, I'd love to chat. (I'm in Harlem. I can host but have roommates. Can travel as well. 420 friendly is a plus, my treat, but no pressure.) "

I am looking for a non-vanilla partner to engage in non-vanilla (but safe, sane and consensual) kinky sex. I'm a switch, but I lean dominant. Though I prefer the dominant role, it's so hard to find a dominant partner that I would be extremely happy and enthusiastic as a submissive. I'm also comfortable with and have experience with a Dd/lg dynamic. I'm looking for an intimate relationship. Kink is powerful because it involves a lot of vulnerability and trust, and it gets better and better as partners trust each other. I'd like to find a woman with whom I could build that deep, vulnerable and intimate connection to have explosive, incredible kinky sex. I'm also a pretty good writer, so if erotica and smut get you off, I can certainly oblige. I'm 45, white, six feet tall, height-weight proportional with brown hair and green eyes. (pictures to prove it.) I'm considered pretty good looking, and Im told I have an unusually aesthetically pleasing cock. (Also pictures to prove it, but not unless requested, right?) I'm an inventive, perverse and intense lover, looking forward to making your acquaintance.

I would like to find a more honest connection than the ones I have thus far found, but that requires a level of honesty that makes me very nervous, so please forgive and be gentle with my vulnerability here. I've never actually had sex. Never been in any kind of relationship, never been on a date, and I'm 28 years old. People ask *me* why that is like I know the answer; no one's exactly fallen head over heels in love with me and I was busy being traumatized for a lot of the last ten years. (Not by a romantic partner.) Actually, a lot of the last thirty. Dealing with abusive parents does rather take up a lot of one's time. I suppose I shouldn't put that in a romantic ad. But I want to. I want someone who knows *all* of me. The bad parts and the good parts. I have been through a lot. A lot of people on here know me through my roleplaying post history, and if you're interested in my kinks, they are *quite* lovingly detailed through a lot of posts. I'll also put them below. But. But I want someone who *cares* about me. I tried okcupid for a bit and I just - I don't know. I love BDSM. A whole lot. (Obviously. Did I mention the post history?! xD) But I'm also a full person. I insist on and expect to be treated as such. I expect you to see me as a full person, not lesser than you. There will be days when I can't do fun sexy things because my anxiety or depression has reared its ugly head, and sometimes orgasm denial sets off my anxiety (it's my body generally being overexcited, basically). Sometimes it's relaxing. It depends on the day. I know a lot of guys on here want to do the sort of ""I control your whole life"" thing and I don't want that, not at all, nope nope nope. Do I want to get to know you? Yes. Do I want to be intimate with you? Yes. Do I long for and ache for your control over sexytime things and maybe we can do fun little plans for running errands or being at work, or whatever, or have roleplays throughout the day, little teases. But also, can we have nice messages throughout the day? Just to make each other smile? I feel I am at this crux, this - crossroads, impasse, I don't know - of wanting a combination of a boyfriend and a dom. I don't know. I want a person. I also in large part just want to do sex and then leave it at that. I do not want you deciding my outfits. I do not want you deciding anything about my life, besides sex. I don't know what the desire is in people for control over those aspects of their lives, but I don't share it. In terms of safety and feminism - and I am one, a feminist - we have to have in-scene and out of scene. They must be kept separate. In some ways they will bleed into each other but in some ways they can't. My individuality, my personhood, remains intact. This is not negotiable. Bondage is a beautiful fun little give-and-take, a game, but we are people, we are real people. I guess I want someone to talk to, who is into the things I am into, who wants to play, who is maybe interested in soemthing more, something offline, but is okay with just talking. I am looking for connection and that can't be rushed, and I am in no rush. I will not send you pictures within five seconds of meeting you. I will, however, talk with you for days on end. In terms of irl stuff, I live in New York, slightly north of NYC. But I'm open to online relationships too. Like I said, I'm - looking for connections. Sorry this is all so very vague and strange. *I* am very vague and strange. I'm also descriptive and kind and extremely creative and good with words and roleplays and I have lots of hot ideas all the time. I thrive under the attention of a dom :) I like lots of attention. I like being a bit spoiled, teehee. I like being a kitten with a bell on my collar, rolling over for belly-rubs and sleeping in my cage. &lt;3 Lined with satin, of course. Eheheh. Message me. &lt;3 EDIT: I thought it was self-explanatory that I was looking for *single* men, but apparently not. I do not want to talk if you are married. I won't hurt your wife/girlfriend like that. Please only get in contact if you're *single*. "

To the outside world I am a strong and independent woman that is intelligent and focused. Behind closed doors I am a submissive looking to be owned and possessed, physically, mentally and sexually by a confident and perverted gentleman who is not intimidated by a woman with a head on her shoulders. I'm interested in a strict Dom. A disciplinarian. Someone to break me and care for me. To be trained and pushed to be someone who pleases you, someone you want to call your own. You should understand that D/s is more than just a sexual dynamic, it's an intense and amazing vulnerability and love that develops over time. This is a basic need of mine. I'm attracted to older men who are handsome, intelligent, have a sense of humor, and even are slightly arrogant. Communication is key, so fantastic spelling and grammar is required. You should take care of yourself physically /emotionally. You should also have interests outside of this that you are willing to share and talk about. The sexual kinks I have are really just tools to train and control me. They include things like orgasm control and denial, edging, tasks, punishments and discipline, moderate pain, SPANKING, light humiliation, and several more. Limits will be discussed. If you are interested I would like it if you messaged me a little about yourself (your name, age, where you are from, what you look like, what you do for fun, etc.) and your experience in BDSM so we can get to know each other more. In the subject please put the name of your favorite song you are listening to on repeat these days."

I forgot location! I'm SE Wisconsin, not too far from Chicago. Online or local works, or both! Just throwing this out there for the sake of curiosity *(I'm too curious for my own good!)*, as the pragmatic part of me suspects that my imagination is acting up and I'm being a wee bit unrealistic or naive. Hehe! I have, for a long time now, been feeling as though I'm missing something in my romantic/sexual relationships. I find myself craving competence, decisiveness, passion, and action, but being met with anything but. I overwhelm my partners with my ability to express myself, my desire to experiment, my requests to be pushed to the edges. I think I make them feel a little bit emasculated, which is a pity, because I want to make my parter feel the exact opposite. But I'm pretty, strong-willed, and clever. I'm self-aware, and really passionate, and I expect my partner to match (or better, exceed) my character, to know what to do with me. It's a big ask, I think. Add my desire to be used (and used-up), to surrender control, the delight of masochism, and a need for creative variety -- and now you're looking at an awful lot of work for the average guy. Because I'm such a confident, independent personality, I've always avoided exploring BDSM relationships. Over the last few years, I've been exploring, probing, experimenting more and more. I've learned that under the right circumstances, I *love* giving everything up to my partner. I want to be pushed to the edges. I need to be free to be kinky. I want to be used up. I think I am ready to commit myself to a more serious investigative journey. ### What I'm Looking For: - Intellectual foreplay, a lot of it. Mischief. Influence. Seduction. Rewards and consequences. - Erudite conversation (Keep my gears turning please! let's get excited about all the things!) - Wit and charm. Sardonic humor. Dry wit. Amused by the absurd. Brilliant with satire. A clever tease. A subtle flirt. Someone who works in subtext, metaphor, context, inference. Knows exactly the right moments to raise an eyebrow or feign boredom. Surprisingly sweet. Alluring. - Wickedness and creativity, undergirded by some sort of ethical philosophy. Not afraid to get his hands dirty, press buttons, unravel threads, to traverse uncharted lands, to indulge in hedonism, to be tricky and teasing, a little taboo. To build and tear down. With humane limits, an empathic awareness, and woven with love. - Vulnerability and communication; abides in truth. Owns his flaws and mistakes, accepts them in others. Communicates his needs in a multitude of languages (verbal, visual, kinesthetic). Is ready to define questions, uncover possible solutions, and take action. Doesn't need my approval or feedback (though he might seek it for added depth of perspective, for it's own merit). Expects the same from his partner. - Confidence in imperfection; knows sorrow and regret. Is capable of seeing value in himself without needing to elevate his identity to mythical proportions. Knows his talents and gifts, cultivates them, uses them, as best he can in the moment, always adapting and growing. Has bad days and will take advantage of my luminous affection, encouragement, and wisdom. Has good days and makes the most out of them, shares his triumphs with me, lets me celebrate and praise him in a myriad of ways. - Affection and connection; when I am done crying, I want to be bundled up and stroked, cuddled and held firmly. I want pain, I want to be used up, but I want to be filled back up again. I want to be someone's queen bee even if I am crawling on my knees or chained to a post. I want to be looked after -- and I want to be allowed to properly look after you. I want to touch you and validate you, impress you, please you, make you feel strong and sexy, show you the meaning of desire, take all you have to offer. Let me write you poetry and paint you watercolors. --- ### What You Get: - A brain like lightening; want to talk about the marvels of space? discuss developments in AI? Debate the merits of and impact of specific diplomatic actions? Compare and contrast cultural traditions, critique literature, analyze paintings? Let's go rock hounding and bird watching! Build robots! If I don't know it, I will learn it. Watch (join?) me weave webs and dance circles around and between all sorts of ideas and disciplines. Practical application: good conversation and collaboration. - Playfulness: I love to dress up, to roleplay (written! online! in real life! pen and paper! forums. video games. all of it!), to tease, to be very silly, to gorge myself on satire and absurdity, to dance in public. Games, cheerful experimentation, bubbly self expression, sarcastic teasing -- count me in! - A hot date: I clean up nice. I'm artsy, a little eccentric, a teensy bit nerdy, but I've got curves in all the right places and a slim waist. I know how to rock a short asymmetrical bob and a little black dress. I'm not afraid to wear dark red lipstick and heels, nor am I afraid to throw on a pair of slim Carharrt carpenter jeans and a tank top. I've got a warm smile, and I look quite a bit younger than I am. I'm a classic beauty but I'm not fragile or uptight. I range from glamorous night-at-the-opera to sci-fi convention, from thiftstore sundresses covered in paint and charcoal to yoga pants and well fitting t-shirt. - Insatiable Passion: I will *want* you, crave you. once will never be enough. I'll want long, languid, doting lovemaking. Let me spend ages with my head in your lap. You hand up my skirt. I want rough, painful sex. I will want to be filled up, claimed, owned, used, exhausted, craved, exploited, and so on/so forth. - Creativity &amp; Novelty: I make things. I like to write. I am a painter. The only way you'll be bored with me is if you're rather boring to begin with! I can teach you so many new things, and I will want to learn from you. Let's mix things up. Try new hobbies! - Wisdom: I've been through a *lot*, and I've done an enormous amount of personal work and reflection. I'm always learning. I'm patient, empathetic, insightful, and kind. I might be overly hopeful or dangerously curious, but I'm not new to life or naive. And obviously: - Submission and devotion: This is the part that I'm a little new to. I've definitely *attempted* to devote myself to my partners; and I've offered to submit. I haven't found the right counterpart yet. I probably need quite a bit of guidance and seduction. Perhaps a bit of breaking. I am *pretty* sure that if I respect and admire you, I will be a slave to your every whim. I can't do mindless submission - but I'm told that this is antithetical to BDSM anyway. I can't do unquestioning submission, because I am a curious girl and my mind is hungry for truth and experience. I won't worship you like a god, because I'm not interested interested in gods and I don't want perfect power. I want a real, raw, honest human, flaws and all. A man who despite (because?) of all this, is still strong, powerful, beautiful and warm. A man who doesn't think he deserves the world, but is ready go to out and take it on and win regardless. I can be compelled to surrender, and I want to be. I can yield. I can open myself up and give myself away. You can unfold me until there are no more folds (that will take a very long time, however). I will dote on you. Celebrate you. Adore and revere you. I will *see* you. Create for you. *Be* a living work of art for you. I'll follow your lead, seek your approval, take your advice. I'll give it all back to you (when you want it). There's a lot here to unpack and cultivate. But maybe I am not in the right place? You tell me. --- More interests: I'm a teacher, artist (painter!), into board games, video games, fiction, opera, NASA, space, making things, technology, design, hiking, music of all sorts, learning to cook, thinking about gardening, love little animals, embroidery, nerdy nerdy roleplay, karaoke, research for fun, science fiction, sing-a-longs, costumes, long drives over winding roads at night, and lots more. --- There's a lot more to it than this, especially when it comes to the naughtier bits. You deserve a prize for reading this far. So you tell me -- am I looking for a fictional character? Should I be writing a book instead of a personal ad?"
661,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,34/M/Southern Indiana- submissive male seeking feminization (not sissification) from firm but caring [F] dominant.,1,6mwix7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/6mwix7/34msouthern_indiana_submissive_male_seeking/,2017-07-13 06:02:16,"I'm kind of weird: I love feminization, but not sissification. I'm not looking to be treated like a guy in a dress; I feel intensely feminine when I submit, and would prefer to be treated as a natural female. A feminine name, feminine pronouns, feminine acts and actions, all are key to me enjoying my time in this submissive headspace. As for what I have to offer, I am interested in both domestic and sexual submission. My fetishes include: Bondage: I love being helpless. Rope is like a tight hug that doesn't stop. I also love shackles. Lock me in a pair of shackles and tell me i'm not getting out until the house is clean and your place will sparkle. I also love ballgags, handcuffs, chains, blindfolds, suspension bondage, spreader bars, etc... Teasing/orgasm control: I love being teased, I love being forced to cum until i'm begging to stop. I mean, who doesn't?! Some impact play: I like thuddy more than stingy, and i'm not a masochist, but again the appeal of being a submissive is in serving, so I will accept what my domme offers- even if it's pain- with gratitude and above all, pride. Expressions of dominance/power: I want to be reminded that you hold power over me. Your touch, your words, your posture; all of it should remind me that i am yours. I enjoy rules and feel they make the boundaries and expectations of the relationship very clear, which in turn enables me to be the best submissive i possibly can. Outfits: Like i said, i love all feminine clothing. Skirts, dresses, heels, stockings, panties, corsets, garter belts. I prefer classy to slutty, but will wear whatever I am ordered, and there is a certain rush of humiliation and vulnerability when i'm forced to wear more revealing outfits. I love schoolgirl and maid outfits, too. Domestic submission: Cleaning house, preparing meals, giving emotional or physical support to my domme. Seriously, i'm an incredible cook. :) Tickling: I love being tied up and tickled. I especially love having my stocking-clad feet locked in the stocks (those wooden planks that enclose the ankles) and being tickled. Stockings really heighten the sensitivity of my soles. I am also curious about a few things that I haven't had a chance to experience because I would have to be super comfortable with the people involved: Public (or kink-event public) submission: I would love to attend an event in my feminine, submissive personae. A cute dress, lingerie, garter belt, stockings, high heels, and a collar- on display for everyone to see (and hopefully appreciate!). I absolutely would LOVE being shown off. I want to make my domme proud, and if she's wanting to show off her submissive, I must be doing something right! Bisexuality: I am curious about being forced to give oral sex to males. When I say forced, i don't mean my domme just grabbing my hair and shoving my head down on a cock; i mean her understanding that this is something I want to try but that I'm nervous and uncertain and trying overcome some emotional hangups. I would like her to be firm, to guide me and train me. The idea of her ordering me to suck off a guy and then hearing her say ""Good girl....now swallow"" is intensely arousing as a fantasy, but in reality it's something I'm going to have to build up a lot of trust and comfort in order to do. Anal training: I am not really a fan of anal play. I don't even like performing anal as a male. However, I am very attracted to the feminine aspects of being penetrated, and like impact play above, I can find joy and pleasure in serving, even if I find no pleasure in the act by which i serve. I guess that's about it. Lastly, a little about me personally: My submission is driven by a powerful desire to serve. As such, I pride myself on being obedient, thoughtful, and performing my tasks to the best of my ability. I am not at all a brat, or a little. I try to serve with grace, dignity, passion, and above all, absolute obedience. In addition, i feel that the path to becoming a better person is to push your boundaries a little bit more each day, so I'm looking for someone who can help me push the boundaries of my submission, and expand my horizons. Don't be afraid to push me, or to express disappointment if you feel I'm not living up to my full capabilities. I am about 5'9"" (6'2"" in the right heels!) and about 150 pounds, with brown hair I'm currently allowing to grow. My favorite features are my legs (which look DAMN good in the right stockings and heels) and my eyes. If you've read this massive lump of meanderings and qualities, Thank you! I look forward to hearing from you! "

I dont believe in love at first sight. Or even love at first reddit PM. I believe in love being created as the result of a long period of mutual respect and friendship. And if sometimes that mutual respect and friendship *just so happens* to involve you having quite the red bum, and maybe even the ~~occasional~~ quite frequent gag in your mouth, blindfold on, while your body is held down and youre reminded just whose little slut you are, so much the better, am I right? Wait*am I* right? I think so, but I never was much of an empiricist. Hopefully this relationship will also involve a lot of cuddling and laughing and storytelling and adventures and smiles and happiness and kisses and trust and friends and travel and games and all the other wonderful things that come with a happy, healthy relationship. And conversely, I expect it shall also involve some crying, consoling, sympathy, help, support, care, commitment and compromise. Because everyone is complicated, even little princesses like you. Any person will tell you that regardless of their sexuality, their sexuality is not the most interesting thing about them. As it happens, Im dominant. As it happens, youre submissive. As it happens, we complement each other well. As it happens, we fuck a lot. Sure, this is important to us. But its not the most important thing. It just is. All your life youve known you needed someone to take care of you, to guide you and put you in your place when you misbehave. Youve known every orgasm would feel that extra bit better had it been earned rather than merely wanted. You feel naked without a collar around your neck. Nothing gives you wilder pleasure than feeling my hand slap hard on your ass or have it wring gently or not-so-gently around your neck. The feeling of vulnerability which sometimes engulfs you and the trust you place in me despite that brings you greater joy than you know how to express with words. Is that more important than the fact that youre a passionate Ravenclaw? Or that you just cant go a day without listening to Iggy Pop? That you love to help people? That you aspire to be Prime Minister one day? Of course not. All of those things are things I love about you. Does anyone actually listen to Iggy Pop anymore? You may have gathered this, but I lack knowledge about common musical tastes. Im so sorry. I have flaws, I acknowledge this. Anyway. Would you like to message me and see if we fall in love? For practical purposes, Australians and Britons are preferred, as that's where I spend the majority of my time."

Southern Indiana [34M4f]",1,6f04na,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/6f04na/musical_sardonic_petloving_dominant_seeking_a/,2017-06-03 18:11:06,"I suck at beginnings. I would characterize my particular ""style"" of dominance as being like a brick wall. You can challenge it, beat your head against it, charge it all you want, but it's not going to react. I am most comfortable in a relationship that is defined by rules and structure, cause and effect; a thoughtful relationship that considers risk versus reward, conscious effort, and growth. I am a passionate, emotional person attempting to reign in those characteristics with a combination of meditation and a study of the Stoicism school of thought, but my awkward and silly nature still makes itself known more often than is probably appropriate. What am I looking for in a submissive? Let me answer that with another question: What is the sound of one hand clapping? I have some very specific ideas of what I seek in a submissive, but I am hesitant to define her in this message, for fear of making the right woman feel excluded. Instead, I'll go ahead and list some of the characteristics that I feel my partner exhibits. Grace: Don't get me wrong, I don't mind if you trip over your own feet. I much prefer mental grace to physical. The ability to deal with change or upset in a thoughtful manner is super important to me. Impulsiveness is well and good at times, but in a long-term relationship, reactionary behavior is a detriment. With that said, a woman in control of her own body is one of the most arousing things I've ever known. Dancers, actresses- the way they are conscious of their every movement, the poise and elegance they exhibit; I can't get enough. Creativity: As stated, I am a musician. That is not my only outlet of creativity. I also write. My current big project is a DnD module (yes, I'm a nerd) that is gonna make me a fortune with which I can build a dream house with a dungeon behind a hidden bookshelf-door and a fireplace and an enormous kitchen. or not. whatever. I desire that same creativity in my partner. I am a huge proponent of leaving the world better than we inherited it. Creativity is the best way to go about doing that. As the cast of Rent says: ""The opposite of war (destruction) isn't peace- it's creation!"" Creation is also a way that I can come to understand and know my partners. When I observe and understand what someone has created, I come to know them a little better. That kind of connection is fundamentally important to me. Obedience: I don't mind a challenge. Competition is actually very important to me- merit should determine success. However, one of the most important concepts in a D/s relationship is that of trust. I desire, need, and crave for my submissive to trust me to the point she is obedient when I make a decision. As previously stated, I don't mind a challenge and I am more than willing to have a thoughtful discussion with my submissive about a decision I have made (I am, after all, only human and sometimes I don't make the right decision) but when i *have* made a decision, I expect my submissive to back me up to the best of my ability. So that's a couple paragraphs about what I'm looking for. Let's do a couple paragraphs about me, because Id! I am a huge nerd. We're talking Firefly, Gencon, Babylon 5, Dungeons and dragons, Magic: The Gathering, and more. I love to read; my dream house includes 700 square feet of bookshelf space. If you like Terry Pratchett or Michio Kaku, let's talk. I'm very proud of my car. I bought her in 2002, a stock 1993 Nissan 240SX but over time, through hard work and with the help of some good friends, I have transformed her into a unique turbocharged monstrosity that can take all comers. My car is probably more well known than I am in my town. Music. The single most important thing in the world to me. Music is how I will leave this world better than the way I found it. Music is how I express my outrage, joy, confusion, and appreciation. It is my single greatest talent and the validation of my very existence. I listen to pretty much everything. I don't much care for pop music (sterile, bland, commercial) rap (formulaic, pretentious, narcissistic) or country (pandering and image-driven) but there are, of course, exceptions. Sevendust, Breaking Benjamin, Maynard Ferguson, Hopsin, Echosmith, and the soundtrack to Wicked all hold pride of place on my winamp playlist. And that concludes the ""about me."" Let's talk about some of the things I seek in an actual D/s relationship. Dress code: You will wear skirts and dresses. pants, shorts, anything with a crotch (barring panties) will be forbidden. Why? I am attracted to femininity. I am attracted to vulnerability. I love the way a dress or skirt moves alongside the person wearing it. What you wear will make you more conscious of the way you move and the way you sit. And I, I will notice. I will smile with appreciation when I see you shift your weight, cross your legs, or pull down the hem of your dress. Tea: One of the first things I will train you in is tea service. I drink tea. A lot. You will learn how to make tea just how I like it, serve it to me appropriately, and you will take pride in hearing me say ""An excellent cup. Thank you."" Pride: I expect you to be proud of your position as my submissive. I have chosen you. You are unique, capable, and strong. I am not an easy man to serve; and your devotion, your dedication, your ability are beyond question if I've chosen you. Sooooo.....have a nice day, and thanks for reading!"

I've been a collared sub in the past but I am seeking deeper submission/slavehood (within the boundaries of reality of course) ideally within a LTR. For me a good D/s relationship begins with a strong emotional/intellectual connection which is much harder to find than someone who can turn me on through play. I want that unique deep shared space of vulnerability, trust, exposure, boundary pushing, etc that comes when you deeply click in a D/s relationship. I am stable, have a good job, etc. I am intellectually curious, fairly intense, slower to warm up to people but eventually form very close bonds (smaller number of very close friends rather than many acquaintances). I am whereveryougo on FL where you can see pictures and more info. I am not looking for men and I'm also not interested in being a unicorn. I also don't engage in cyber play. I am however open to hearing from women not in NYC who think we would be a good match. Happy hunting!"

I seek intensity, challenge and new meanings. Interests: FLR, T&amp;D, sadomasochism, tech domination, shibari, chastity and the Holy Grail, TPE. D/s or M/s to me is much more about the mental connection - and service - than sexual kink. It's an expression of intimacy, vulnerability and sometimes love (though not necessarily the romantic kind). I don't want to be only worshipped but cared for. Dominance has little to do with what I wear or carry in my hand. I like to fill my mind and ears with Leonard Cohen, Takashi Miike, Nabokov, H.D., Sarah Vaughan, Werner Herzog, Albinoni, Leo Carax, Ra, Bulgakov, The Smiths, Julio Medem, Serge Gainsbourg, Gabriel Orozco, Throbbing Gristle, Carl Jung, The Cocteau Twins, William S. Burroughs, Wong Kar-Wai, Bowie, Surrealists, Verlaine, Nina Simone, Patricia Highsmith, Houellebecq, Tindersticks, Francis Bacon, The Coen Brothers (minus 1 film), ghazal, Os Mutantes, ska, Claude Chabrol, Erik Satie, sculpture, film festivals, alternative theatre. Brutalist Easter egg hunts are fun to me and I have a weakness for pillaging restaurants owned by bad boy chefs (or who just look the part). Pop-up this and that all over London (esp food). Ideally you have a rich inner life too. Vanilla: Omakase, Sabbia Rosa, cult wines, first editions, Taxco Modern, vintage Dior, Dreamliners/ local trains ... are my other interests. What I am NOT: a top; spoiled, bratty princess; fantasy facilitator; fetish dispenser (go to a pro-Domme for that) London is home but I'm currently in the NL. I'm also mixed and definitely not a Barbie Doll or local Dolly Bird so any UKIPpers or PVV supporters should move on. What I'm Looking for Intelligent, respectful, loyal, driven, rational, committed, courageous, self-aware, open-minded submissive. I want a relationship based on connection, communication and control - a power exchange. You should have specific lifestyle requirements (as above) and a genuine desire to serve and submit (not only your bottom!), NOT have on-demand spank-and-wank encounters with loads of latex. Also: no (cam) sessions, no on-demand pics or videos (there are girls here selling those things)! NO NEWBIES, DO-ME SUBS , FANTASISTS OR GIMP SLAVES! You have served before (not in pro sessions) or at least have more than a rudimentary and not fantasy-based understanding of the lifestyle so that 1) your interest extends beyond only activities which arouse you and 2) you understand that I don't wear head-to-toe leather or latex 24/7. No gimps; I want someone pro-actively useful. You should have evolved beyond the fantasy (=porn) images of femdom.' The best sub/ slave is an eternal student, always learning how to please his Domme/ Owner and do his best. Ideally, you are an accomplished high achiever - an alpha male, even - who yearns to be liberated from the demands and complications of the outside world, and need purpose and guidance in your life (in the form of training, tasks, punishment, enforced budget, play, chastity, etc.) and are prepared to explore and push your boundaries. I want a D/s or M/s dynamic with someone I'm mentally and intellectually compatible with, not someone merely obedient. The price of submission is high, the rewards higher still. "

Looking for somebody who is comfortable with themselves. I'm 6'2 and 200 lbs. I have a good job, I own no pets and I live alone. I know everybody says that they're laid back, but I'll tell you I am laid back anyway. I love traveling and road trips just as much as I like spending the night in watching dumb videos. For the rest of the year I am going to see a different music act each week in small towns in my region to soak up some more culture. Gaming is fun as well- board, role playing, PC, it's all good to me. I go to the gym regularly, though I think running is really boring. I'm pretty simple- I could afford a nice car I guess, but things like that just aren't important to me. I'd much rather spend that money on a plane ticket. The nicest thing somebody has told me was that they felt ""comfortable being weird around me."" I also love puns and cheesy jokes- sorry in advance. My kinks aren't necessarily the processes themselves, but rather how my partner reacts and responds. Bondage, toys, teasing, con non-con, and pet play are a partial list of ways I like to get your heart racing, your face flushed, and that fun blend of excitement and vulnerability you get while you're wondering how exactly you'll be used. Overpowering and using you is also something I really enjoy as well. Bottom line: everything is safe, sane and consensual. I was told I was good at giving people ""the look"". I don't desire to share partners, so you'd be all mine (and the other way around too). If you tend to switch, I don't mind trying life out on the sub side on the occasion. You can be shy, talkative, or anywhere in the middle. But you HAVE to be communicative and comfortable with expressing your feelings with me. I know that trust doesn't happen overnight, but it does have to happen. Physical attraction is important as well- you by no means have to be a fitness model but I do prefer people who live a healthy lifestyle (but are not opposed to the idea of spending a lazy day eating ice cream on the occasion). Our interests do not have to sync up 100% but I'd like a decent amount of overlap. I'd really like you to be physically affectionate since I am that way myself. Since I'm tall (6'2), tall girls have always had a special place in my heart, though you can be any height. I live in DFW but am often in Louisiana. Hope to hear from you!"

And yet I feel unfulfilled without the masculine Dominant presence in my life. The lengthy essay below is a subset of my FL profile. Also, this username was created just for the ad. San Francisco Bay Area [Edit: age range 45 - 65. Not a cougar, sorry boys] These words by Madame de Stal resonate with me: The desire of the man is for the woman, but the desire of the woman is for the desire of the man. I am on a self-discovery journey... This trip down the rabbit hole of my secret desires began not all that long ago; it's been just over two years in the public scene, preceded by a year of private exploration. My path to discovering my true nature was an unconventional one - but of course, everything about kink is unconventional. I investigated many different dimensions and test-drove many different experiences, all the while being quite conflicted about who I was and what my cravings were telling me about myself. It took a while to come to terms with what I crave. With the fact that much as I desire physical sensations, even more I desire emotional exchange of power. My search is for a connection with a powerful, self-aware, accomplished Dominant man who could firmly take me to the raw, primal abandonment of the limits. I don't care about his years of experience in the lifestyle, how many FetLife groups he may lead, how frequently he attends events, if at all, or how proficient he could be with tools and toys. No amount of training, and no number of impeccably crafted scenes, can substitute for the true confidence and the quiet power of presence. My work involves world travel and strategic decisions, but I make time for important relationships. The man by my side will sense how to take me powerfully so that I have no choice but to surrender. A confident and assertive man, possessed of both depth and emotion, the man for me would find delight in the challenge of totally mastering this independent, sophisticated woman. To hold me, securely and completely. It takes a strong will, and a deep connection based on trust, vulnerability, and mutual respect, to get to that next level. A man that can captivate my mind, not just my body. Unselfish, willing to negotiate and prioritise. Intellectual foreplay is essential for me. It is in my sapiosexual nature. Intriguing men of bold character and strength will elicit my response. I highly value intimacy and being cherished, I enjoy nuance and witty banter, and I need to feel desired. I am a hedonist, I crave sensations. Pain is one of the sensations, but so is a gentle caress, or a bite, or a feather touch, or a feeling of luxurious fur against the naked skin, or a slow silky glide of a silicone paddle down the inner thigh... I have a lovely collection of floggers and crops, but for me, the most exquisite pleasure is not at the moment of impact, but just after - that echo, that stillness... Not unlike negative space in art. Or a caesura, as an insightful friend reminded me recently. I am seeking a man who will be my anchor. The man who will hold my focus, make me feel safe and cherished. He will be my priority, as I will be his. I am also looking for like-minded friends so we can grow together. A mentor to help me navigate the complexities of relationships and connections. Or, a person who can learn from my discoveries. Or, a fun companion for a workshop. Or, perhaps an occasional but trusted play partner. I am still evolving..."

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I have been yearning for...for a long time."

I'm not looking to be treated like a guy in a dress; I feel intensely feminine when I submit, and would prefer to be treated as a natural female. A feminine name, feminine pronouns, feminine acts and actions, all are key to me enjoying my time in this submissive headspace. As for what I have to offer, I am interested in both domestic and sexual submission. My fetishes include: Bondage: I love being helpless. Rope is like a tight hug that doesn't stop. I also love shackles. Lock me in a pair of shackles and tell me i'm not getting out until the house is clean and your place will sparkle. I also love ballgags, handcuffs, chains, blindfolds, suspension bondage, spreader bars, etc... Teasing/orgasm control: I love being teased, I love being forced to cum until i'm begging to stop. I mean, who doesn't?! Some impact play: I like thuddy more than stingy, and i'm not a masochist, but again the appeal of being a submissive is in serving, so I will accept what my domme offers with gratitude and pride. Expressions of dominance/power: I want to be reminded that you hold power over me. Your touch, your words, your posture; all of it should remind me that i am yours. I enjoy rules and feel they make the boundaries and expectations of the relationship very clear, which in turn enables me to be the best submissive i possibly can. Outfits: Like i said, i love all feminine clothing. Skirts, dresses, heels, stockings, panties, corsets, garter belts. I prefer classy to slutty, but will wear whatever I am ordered, and there is a certain rush of humiliation and vulnerability when i'm forced to wear more revealing outfits. I love schoolgirl and maid outfits, too. Domestic submission: Cleaning house, preparing meals, giving emotional or physical support to my domme. Seriously, i'm an incredible cook. :) Tickling: I love being tied up and tickled. I especially love having my stocking-clad feet locked in the stocks (those wooden planks that enclose the ankles) and being tickled. Stockings really heighten the sensitivity of my soles. I am also curious about a few things that I haven't had a chance to experience because I would have to be super comfortable with the people involved: Public (or kink-even public) submission: I would love to attend an event in my feminine, submissive personae. A cute dress, lingerie, garter belt, stockings, high heels, and a collar- on display for everyone to see (and hopefully appreciate!). I absolutely would LOVE being shown off. I want to make my domme proud, and if she's wanting to show off her submissive, I must be doing something right! Bisexuality: I am curious about being forced to give oral sex to males. When I say forced, i don't mean my domme just grabbing my hair and shoving my head down on a cock; i mean her understanding that this is something I want to try but that I'm nervous and a little uncertain. I would like her to be firm, to guide me and train me. The idea of her ordering me to suck off a guy and then hearing her say ""Good girl....now swallow"" is intensely arousing as a fantasy, but in reality it's something I'm going to have to build up a lot of trust and comfort in order to do. Anal play: I am not really a fan of anal play. I don't even like performing anal as a male. However, I am very attracted to the feminine aspects of being penetrated, and like impact play above, I can find joy and pleasure in serving, even if I find no pleasure in the act by which i serve. I guess that's about it. Lastly, a little about me personally: My submission is driven by a powerful desire to serve. As such, I pride myself on being obedient, thoughtful, and performing my tasks to the best of my ability. I am not at all a brat, or a little. I try to serve with grace, dignity, passion, and above all, absolute obedience. In addition, i feel that the path to becoming a better person is to push your boundaries a little bit more each day, so I'm looking for someone who can help me push the boundaries of my submission, and expand my horizons. Don't be afraid to push me, or to express disappointment if you feel I'm not living up to my full capabilities. I am about 5'9"" (6'2"" in the right heels!) and about 170 pounds, with brown hair I'm currently allowing to grow. My favorite features are my legs (which look DAMN good in the right stockings and heels) and my eyes. If you've read this massive lump of meanderings and qualities, Thank you! I look forward to hearing from you! "

I guess that's about it. Lastly, a little about me personally: My submission is driven by a powerful desire to serve. As such, I pride myself on being obedient, thoughtful, and performing my tasks to the best of my ability. I am not at all a brat, or a little. I try to serve with grace, dignity, passion, and above all, absolute obedience. In addition, i feel that the path to becoming a better person is to push your boundaries a little bit more each day, so I'm looking for someone who can help me push the boundaries of my submission, and expand my horizons. Don't be afraid to push me, or to express disappointment if you feel I'm not living up to my full capabilities. I am about 5'9"" (6'2"" in the right heels!) and about 170 pounds, with brown hair I'm currently allowing to grow. My favorite features are my legs (which look DAMN good in the right stockings and heels) and my eyes. If you've read this massive lump of meanderings and qualities, Thank you! I look forward to hearing from you! "

I'm 23, a bright-eyed newbie with only a bit of experience with this kinda thing, a recent college grad from the midwest, in the UK right now but moving to the west coast (Portland) at the end of the month (and fully committed to becoming an enormous cliche of the liberal girl sipping craft beer while riding a bike and listening to Vampire Weekend in the rain). **who I am, kink-wise:** * I've got a pretty intense praise kink, if that's a thing, and my desire to please is very, very high. * starting to think I may be a masochist, but enjoy pain only in context: when I am playing, it is fun, when I am being punished, it is not fun at all. * giving up control is the most liberating, heady feeling I've ever experienced; submission to someone else feels like my most authentic self, and it's a feeling that's almost addicting (my mind is always going a mile a minute and being in the submissive mindset just turns all that way down and gives me so much peace). * I've found that degradation or heavy humiliation or objectification doesn't appeal to me whatsoever, but since I'm very new at all this I am of course open to exploration if it is something you might find important in a dynamic and we are a good fit otherwise. * I like to have fun in the dynamic, be playful and teasing and that sort of thing, but I also absolutely respect the dynamic and your authority and will always (hopefully) behave appropriately for the situation. * I've got a background in psychology, and my scores on the [Big Five inventory](URL are super reflective of me: Openness 96, Conscientiousness 5, Extraversion 42, Agreeableness 97, Neuroticism 75. What that very, very low Conscientiousness score means is that I've got no self-discipline or self-control to speak of, so guidance, structure, and firm, strict discipline from a dynamic (so a disciplinarian aspect?) would be nice to have. * sexually, I'm admittedly very inexperienced, and so exploration of that would be fun; a training aspect of the dynamic would be great (from what I have explored, orgasm control/edging/denial is one of my very favorite things). **what I'm looking for:** * a D-type male, age preferably between around mine and mid thirties, who is intelligent, humorous, kind, stern, wickedly mischievous, very progressive ideologically (I lean way left politically and am immensely, uncompromisingly, fiercely passionate about my beliefs, so we must be on the same wave length, please). Appearance doesn't matter. * a multi-faceted, online dynamic that encompasses kink, discipline, sexuality, and companionship and is built on trust, vulnerability, communication, and a tangible connection. I'd like to stick to a text-based medium like Kik to start, but once a level of trust has been established other mediums (audio, visual) can get explored. A picture could definitely be shared off the bat to show that I'm not actually a green, lumpy, kinky, evil alien who somehow got access to wifi and a keyboard. okay, this is getting crazy long, I feel very strange making all these requests, and I'm sorry for all my dumb, probably incoherent rambling, so I'll stop here--if you think we'd be a good fit, I'd really love to hear from you and see if we click.

Making a submissive open up and reveal that sensitive, vulnerable underbelly. Making them reveal the deep and emotional triggers that they *want* me to touch and play with. Kinky people talk about humiliation or degradation or bondage etc, but those are really general terms. Each submissive thay enjoys humiliation has a specific type that they crave. Same for the rest. One of the best parts of a bdsm relationship is when, through hints (both conscious and unconscious) from the submissive, the dom begins to hone in on the exact flavour of dominance that the submissive needs. Some girls like humiliation with the 'little girl' twist. Some like to be bullied and mocked. Some prefer to be controlled. That can be asking permission to pee or being told what to wear or having food ordered for them etc. Some find their looks being denigrated in comparison to other women thrilling. Some find being pissed on as the ultimate form degradation - they only deserve their superiors waste. Others prefer the public show of surrender as the ultimate form of control. Some women like protocol - rigid rules and reinforcing rituals. Others want to be playfully subdued. Some like being immobile and helpless. Spanking (over the knee and otherwise), figging, being cheated on, petplay... And most times, two or more of these intersect in the same submissive. The point being that it's a thrill for me to discover which particular kinky nooks and crannies a submissive inhabits. Clearly you can tell i like talking about s and m. Personally, i am a sadist. I enjoy causing pain. I like seeing anguish - especially deep sexual humiliation. I like making a sub cry from a spanking or from an overwhelming humiliation session that touches something primal. I can be cruel. I like playing games that leave a submissive emotionally vulnerable (if they're that type of masochist that enjoys that). I want you love sick and devoted while i remain aloof. If any of this piques your interest, reply. Again, i really think that kink is especially effective if two people actually know each other a bit so feel no pressure to immediately jump to kinky things. I'm a great talker, i like architecture and design, literature, football (the Arsenal), cooking, music (i have been learning ro play the guitar for oh about a decade now haha) (currently really into Pulp)... and a lot more just ask."

I'd be willing to show Her my compliance over Skype if we've built up some trust as that would enhance the feeling of vulnerability for me. Now I do have limits...namely blood, scat, extreme pain (though honestly I don't know my limits), children, or anything that would get us in actual trouble. Beyond that I'm flexible.

Everything that occurs out of necessity, everything expected, repeated day in and day out, is mute. Only chance can speak to us.* I'm awful at starting things. I can never just say ""Hello"" or give a list of my personality traits and hobbies. I sometimes feel like I can't talk about myself without sounding like rsum. You probably have a better idea of who I am than I do. You get to look at me and see the real me. Anyway, I thought instead of telling you I'm a Sub looking for a Dom right off the bat, I'd share a quote from one of my favorite books which also happens to be relevant. I began exploring my submissive side three to four years ago, but I think I always knew deep down growing up it was supposed to be like this  whatever this is. I've only been in one purely D/s relationship; I have never been so affected by a relationship until I entered this kind. I finally felt like I fit somewhere, and I'm craving that feeling again. From this relationship, I learned what it truly means to be a Submissive. I'm not interested in just being spanked here and there and have you call me a slut when you fuck me  that isn't submission and I feel as though that is how it has been portrayed in these God awful literoticas. From my understanding, being a Submissive means to trust and give. You may be in control, but you're only in control because I have enough to allow you that. I'll give you the lead and you'll challenge me. My submission is not a gift  I'm not giving anything I won't get in return (be it equivalent or similar). There's more depth to this relationship. I'm looking for my Dom. I want a man who will challenge and fill me emotionally and sexually. I'm not looking for anything romantic, or I'm at least not mindfully looking for that. If this develops into a romantic relationship, I'm open to all odds. I want a man who is confident. Confidence doesn't eliminate vulnerability, at least not completely. I want to be vulnerable with you and I want you to be vulnerable with me. You may share as little to as much information as you want right now, but I believe vulnerability is inevitable. You're probably wondering more about me. Again, I can't just give you my personality traits and hobbies. I'll give you my interests, though: * Role-play (D/lg especially) * Age-play (DD/lg) * Abuse (physical and verbal) * Breath-play * Orgasm control and denial * Bondage * Deep-throating and forced fellatio * Vaginal penetration with foreign objects * Public-play * Humiliation * Consensual Non-con * Ass-play and butt plugs * Impact-play * Power Exchange * Sensory Deprivation ***I am interested in all of these things because I have tried all of them. I understand what I am getting into with each and every one of these.*** If your interests are comparable to mine, then perhaps we will have a connection. I have a list of requirements: 1. Descriptive grammar at least. This does not refer to being descriptive, but rather using grammar appropriately. I won't correct you prescriptively, but I expect you to have a simple understanding of the English language. I cannot take you seriously if you use the incorrect 'your' and 'there.' English isn't my first language, so if it is your first language and you don't even have a basic understanding of the language, then we won't connect. 2. Use emojis appropriately. I have no idea what :3 or xD are and I don't care to know what they are. A smiley-face is appropriate sometimes, but only if used respectfully. I'll let you figure out what I mean by that. 3. Please be willing to at least voice chat. Sounds are very important to me and I want to hear your voice. If you can't oblige to this, we won't connect. Those are my only requirements. I've been told I'm expecting too much, but these actually aren't too hard to fulfill. We all have our preferences and requirements  mine just aren't typical and related to appearances and your body fat percentage. I look forward to talking to you. *The Unbearable Lightness of Being* EDIT: I am in Florida. I apologize for not specifying my location. "
683,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,49 [M4F] A Maine Retreat of Lyrical Total Power Exchange,0,52f6y0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/52f6y0/49_m4f_a_maine_retreat_of_lyrical_total_power/,2016-09-13 02:26:39,"**Lyrical Captivity for the Fit, Strong, and Independent Woman** I offer open sessions of lyrical total power exchange: an experience of total captivity, total pleasure, and total safety. A journey where my partner is taken irresistibly into surrender. And then returns, safe and sound, carrying away nothing but memories. An offer which I make on the basis of friendship. Much as two friends who trust each other might go mountain climbing together. My partner doesnt need to make a deal with me to have a session: she doesnt need to become my girlfriend, to be exclusive, or to commit to wanting more than one session. We can choose to have a session together simply because it satisfies both of our desires. The kind of woman I like (my type) is a woman who is highly capable in her life. Assertive. Confident. Self motivated. ## Compatibility On a personal level and for someone to practice BDSM with, Im compatible with a woman who: * Is biologically female (that is, cis, not trans). * Has a body fat percentage between 12% and 24%. * Is intelligent, confident, self motivated, and has high self esteem. * Is independent. Who makes her own decisions for her own reasons. Who values the opinions of others but is not held back by them. * Isnt needy: shes already effectively taking care of her needs in life. * Has strong boundaries. Who neither allows other people to cross her boundaries, nor needs to resort to crossing the boundaries of others. * Takes care of her physical health. Who, for example, is not a smoker, and is physically fit. * And who takes care of her mental health. Whether she might have had a past experience of abuse or trauma, or had a mental health issue such as depression or anxiety, shes now gotten the therapeutic care she would have needed. * Is honest, and is able to be honest. Who, for example, is not looking to deceive a relationship partner. Ultimately, Id need to meet someone in person to tell if we click on a personal level. While these qualifications are strict, other things dont matter. My partner: * May be old or young (as long as shes an adult); * Can be plain or beautiful, short or tall, nerdy or elegant (as long as shes physically fit); * Can have any level of BDSM experience (as long as shes making an informed decision that she wants this kind of session); * May have any number of other relationship partners (as long as shes not asking me to participate in deceit); * Need not be physically attracted to me (if she doesnt mind); * May be more worldly successful or be more famous than I am (Im happy with my own life, and Im happy that shes successful with her own). * And, while general physical fitness is important, she doesnt need to be unusually flexible or to have unusually high endurance. ## Fetishes * Lyrical BDSM * Total power exchange * Consensual non-consent * Bondage (physical control) * Domination (mental control) * Sensory deprivation (sensory control) * Sensation play (sensation control) * Inducing subspace (emotional control) * Ravishment (sexual control) ## Limits Here are my own limits: * No smoking, drug use, or illegal activity. * No physical injury, unsafe sex, or body modification. * No recordings, public play, observers, or other participants not under my control. * No abandonment (my partner will not be left alone during her captivity). My partner can also have her own limits, of course. If I accept her limits, then Im responsible for maintaining both our limits in the session. If Im not entirely willing or able to accommodate her limits, we wont have a session together. Either way, her limits will be respected. ## Sanctuary Sanctuary is an experience of total captivity. Of full helplessness. Of complete vulnerability. Of total safety. Where my partner has *no power* in the session. No authority. *No escape* for the duration shes chosen for her captivity. *No choice* in what happens to her. An experience of lyrical total power exchange. Where its impossible for my partner to be wrong. Or to be right. Theres nothing she can do, or not do, which is right or wrong. There are no judgments. No should, no should not, no ought to. Nothing she can do or not do that later she should apologize for. She doesnt need to act in a submissive way; to cooperate or desire to be obedient; to avoid doing things that might hurt my feelings or break the mood, or might be topping from the bottom; she doesnt need to keep her emotions in check (she can hate me and hate being a captive if she wants to, she can sob uncontrollably or be incandescently angry); she can resist as much as she likes, if she wants to. Where no matter what my partner does, I take her into surrender. A surrender not only physical, but mental and emotional as well. While this is an experience of *total* power exchange, this isnt *dark* BDSM: theres no punishment, humiliation, denial, alienation, abandonment. I dont wear black, Im not loud and shouty, I dont decorate in a dungeon motif. Rather than creating conflict, I create *holistic* surrender, surrender on all levels. Emotional surrender, where my partner no longer *wants* to resist me; as well as mental and physical surrender. A *psychologically* intense experience of being taken irresistibly and involuntarily deep into surrender. Where I relieve my partners conscious mind from its usual place of authority and responsibility. Where, if she falls deep into subspace, her conscious mind may shut down entirely. And yet Im not in *opposition* to my partner, nor do I pretend to be. Im completely and totally on my partners side. On the side of her fetish, of her desire to have a vacation of surrender. ## About Me I believe that kink is natural and healthy. Which, of course, can be pursued in an unhealthy way, just as anything can. Yet when practiced well, kink is refreshing and revitalizing. Im strongly introverted. I enjoy having a deep, calm focus. One woman described me as a bodhisattva in disguise, another said I reminded her of Eckhart Tolle. Thats what my calm focus reminded them of. People often like me. Or else they find me too weird. (Which is to say, too different from them for their taste). I like people, but I find it wearying after a while to be responding, reacting, interrupted by the usual randomness of people. Even if people are being kind, courteous, polite. Its still a distraction. So I take people in small doses. And spend a lot of time alone, where I can *relax*. Where I can *focus* on what Im doing, where I can *enjoy* the kind of deep, calm focus that I like. Where I can act unimpeded. I have my particular fetishes, which, while some of them are rarer, are still not uncommon. The *way* in which I like to satisfy my fetishes is informed by my personality. In power exchange, when I have the permission, the consent where I may choose to do what I by my own judgment choose to do, I feel the same feeling of *relaxation* as I do when Im alone. Because then I can act unimpeded. Im free to focus on what I want to do. Im not the kind of dom common in BDSM fiction, running around being bossy to people. Instead, think of a musician. A musician who is completely devoted to playing music. With focus and attention. I desire to play a woman as a musician would play Stradivarius violin. And so I study the psychological, sensual, and sexual arts so that I might do so well. Physically, Im 5'5"", 140lbs, with a 20% body fat percentage. Im what some people call [solo poly](URL Im open to having multiple relationships based on honesty and consent. Unlike many poly people, Im not looking to live together with multiple partners in a poly family either. Being so introverted, for my own personal living situation I prefer to live alone. Yet, while I neither seek nor value exclusivity, Im not looking for a hookup or a casual encounter either. I seek to have a high quality friendship, a high quality relationship. My other personality strengths are strategy (I like finding a path to a goal); maximizing (I like creating excellence out of something that is already strong); relating (I like to develop and deepen relationships); intellect (I like to reason and think about things); and input (I like to read and absorb information). I like consent, as an intrinsic value. For example, I dislike the cultural tradition of being *expected* to shake hands. (Though I shake hands anyway, as it's not actually a big deal for me :) On the other hand, Ive given away thousands of hugs at art festivals, which I found delightful because no one was *expected* to hug me, I only gave a hug to someone who actually *wanted* a hug. Similarly, for a friend, for a partner who Im compatible with on a personal level and where we have complementary BDSM interests, Im happy to offer a session of lyrical total power exchange, if shed like one. ## Safety * Ill end a session immediately if, at any point, I no longer have full confidence that I can guarantee the safety of my partner. * Ill maintain my own emotional equilibrium in the session, regardless of what happens. Ill never act out of anger or frustration. My *partner* can become angry or upset or frustrated in a session, if she happens to want to. (She can do anything she wants in a session; shes not responsible for keeping her emotions in check). I wont *respond* by becoming upset myself. * I wont be drinking alcohol, or doing anything else that could impair my judgment. * Ill act as my *authentic self* during the session. (Roleplay is a fine fetish, but its not what this session is about). * Ill be paying attention to *my partner*, the actual person in the moment, not to a fantasy of what I imagined Id be doing. ## Location Im currently in Maine at the moment, but I live lightly. I work as a freelance programmer, so itd be easy for me to travel. I usually travel rather rarely, since Im not interested in travel for its own sake. But, if I have reason to go somewhere, it may often be easier for me to hop on a plane and go somewhere than it is for most people who have commitments in a particular location such as school or work. ## Contact Me Youre welcome to contact me whether you might interested in a session, or if youre just curious about something I wrote and would like to ask about it. For myself, I dont wish to be called by BDSM titles, nor am I looking for an online roleplay. I like ordinary, everyday politeness, mutual kindness, mutual consideration, and mutual respect. Thank you for reading! "

I dont even think she knows what the internet is. Let alone reddit or /r/BDSMpersonals. Or BDSM. *God I hope not.* *Now you're thinking about it.* *I just made this awkward, didnt I?* *Starting over...* --- Hi. Im /u/more_cookies and I like long post titles. Oh, you do too? Thats why you clicked it? Wanted to see whats inside? I should start making a point soon? Got it. Im gonna level with you, reddit. This whole idea of having a person is a little crazy. Like, out of the billions of people out there, there is *one* that you are truly meant for and supposed to find and spend the rest of your life with and who complements you perfectly and makes all the waiting and the wrongs so worth it and who lets you spank them and call them names and stuff. It doesnt make sense, but I still believe it. Maybe not in the star-crossed-lovers-at-first-sight sense, but certainly in the sense of having always greedily wanted it all and been patiently waiting for them to come along but holy shit when did you turn 30 youll probably start losing your hair soon the clock is ticking why are you spending Friday night at home writing a personals ad? Its certainly an interesting debacle to live through most of adulthood while all of your college friends are working on their 2nd and 3rd babies. And it certainly makes dating a lot less appealing than it might be to a doe-eyed 19 year old, ready to find themselves and explore the world around them for the first time ever. You may be wondering what any of this has to do with BDSM, intrepid reader. An excellent question, which Im not entirely sure I have the answer to. You see, thats just part of who I am. Its never been a list of kinks or a set of rules or titles or munches or playdates or scenes or rope pictures to me. I actually dont understand most of those. Im just a guy, who happens to be dominant, not the other way around. Thats proven much harder to explain than it has ever seemed in my head. Suffice it to say, in lieu of any actually pertinent information in this entire post, there is a great cavernous depth of beautiful filth to be explored when the right person comes along and hopefully brings a flashlight. The fun stuff can, and will, come later; Im far more interested in connecting on a normal human being level first. And as someone who just *is* dominant, I know that my complement just *is* submissive (and yes, Ive spent plenty of years questioning and challenging that with unsurprisingly little success and am not terribly interested in repeating those performances). Someone who simply breathes it, understands it so natively its sometimes hard to put into words, needs it so deeply she has likely gone without it for such a terribly long time just to be absolutely sure it will be right when she finds it. Someone who knows and needs the same terrifying depths of trust and vulnerability and love that I have always known Ive needed. Im stubborn. And not about to give up on her. On us. So I usually just tell grandma Im too busy. --- I wrote some [other](URL [things](URL that you guys seemed to like earlier (thank you!) that likely offer more insight into my mind and heart and how they work, as scary as that may sound, and may be worth a read since neither of us clearly have anything better to do. But, to reiterate, in case you only bought the **tl;dr** version, Im a guy, and a dom, and Im looking for my person. My submissive, my cuddle buddy, my fellow aficionado of all things oral, my huge nerd, my adventure companion, my complement, my best friend. I dont know if Ill find her here, but Im happy to send out these little notes in electronic bottles just in case. If youre reading this, wont you please say hi? My grandma would love to meet you. Down the road, of course, not like immediately or something, that would be awkward. "
685,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] NYC - 7 foot tall extremely hardcore sadistic bearded dungeon-owning dom seeks lazy weak-minded humorless sub with great tits and emotional baggage for a highly sporadic online poly relationship of a purely selfish sexual nature until she disappears without warning after a few days,42,4r3z58,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/4r3z58/30_m4f_nyc_7_foot_tall_extremely_hardcore/,2016-07-04 07:43:18,"*Am I doing this right?* Oh hi, didnt see you there, was busy entertaining myself seeing how many characters can fit in a post title. Its 300, if you were curious, too. Anyways So heres the thing, reddit. Dating sucks. Online dating sucks even more. Oh, yes, lets trade disembodied lists of our favorite movies and books, surely that will foster intimacy and promote longstanding compatibility! said nobody ever. Add any degree of proclivity to BDSM into the mix, and youre lucky to walk away with both kidneys. Its a miracle two people can learn to stand each other nowadays, let alone meet and not be complete assholes long enough to actually like each other, let alone find some sort of accord with their particular flavor of kink. *But wait, more_cookies, this is /r/BDSMpersonals, nobody cares about any of this, theyre just here for scenes and play and protocol and kinky sex and youve been writing for like half a page already and havent talked about your omnipotent experience as a dom and all of the torture devices you own and what self-imposed title you deserve to be addressed as!* See, that never sat right with me. In fact, I find most of the conventions that accompany all of this to be ridiculous and often laughable, if I can say so in a way that doesnt come off as judging the people for whom such protocol works and holds meaning. Hey, you do you, girl. Just please dont call me sir, unless Ive been knighted by the queen. Which would be pretty badass. This is just *me*. And I dont need titles or leather pants to back that up. But even with all of those impossible odds and insurmountable variables stacked against any chance of finding something substantial out there in the sea of delusionists, imitations, subtly masked abusers, and just plain idiots, some of us hold on to hope. Some of us trust that it will all be worth it in the end, that our *person* (singular) is out there, somewhere, and that all of those wrongs will make so much sense in their arms. And some of us are nave enough to think we can find that person here. --- Hi. Im a hope~~less~~fully romantic, not even close to 7 foot tall but most likely taller than you so dont worry its ok I get it, otherwise pretty normal guy who cant believe hes 30 already and who rarely lets his facial hair go past a few days stubble. I know, reddit loves their beards, Im sorry. I like wandering through the park, befriending strangers dogs, singing in the middle of large crowds, and hate writing about myself^kindof^like^this. I will take a quiet night in vs. a loud night out any day of the week, dont drink and have never touched a drug or been to a crazy party, go to church every Sunday, and am probably exactly as boring as Im making myself sound right now. I take excellent care of myself, can talk your ear off about diet and fitness and will probably ask you to come to the gym with me at some point, and think I look ok in a suit as well as out of one. Im also a dom, even though I dont like labels and am still not entirely sure what it means and have yet to explore much of what that even is as Ive been saving it for the right person who I have most likely yet to meet. I mention all of this because its important, much more important than a tedious list of kinks and limits, because Im a *person* with a life Im passionate about, complete with flaws and imperfections and surprises and depths you should want to learn and love before we discuss our favorite spanking implements (my hands). I never last long on the more blatantly BDSM related sites with their blatantly sexual agenda and blatantly displayed genitalia (SO many questions about that) where people seem to gather to find casual play partners and hairy old dudes to tie them up and take compromising pictures and jump right into things that would take me a really long time to open up to. Maybe Im too old fashioned for this, but Ive always seen sex and intimacy as beautiful, precious, and intensely private things that belong in the confines of a committed, loving relationship, not selfish pleasures to be sought out where, how, and whenever possible. As you might imagine, this has as difficult to live as it has been to find in another person. D/s is not a sexual dynamic to me; the intense and awesome depth of sexuality it can offer is, instead, an expression and reflection of the intense and awesome vulnerability and love that exist between a dom and his sub. The possession, hunger, electricity, utter filth, blissful peace, and terrifying beauty inherent in an ideal dynamic stem from the mind and the heart, over time and trust, not from hormones in a moment of physical weakness. If youre looking to check some kinky sex off your bucket list within the month, kindly look elsewhere, its very easy to find nowadays. I want, I *need* so much more. I need cuddles, patience, warmth, unconditional praise of my cooking, unabashed nerdiness, unwavering loyalty, unlimited kindness, and an embarrassing amount of kissing. But I also need to be able to stop you mid-sentence with a look, pull you to your knees by your hair, earn and exercise complete control over your orgasms, and call you a good girl knowing full well what that does to you. I need an easily excitable adventure buddy, a fellow connoisseur of terrible jokes, a compassionate old soul, an avid art appreciator, as well as an insatiable oral aficionado, a stalwart spankee (or is it spanko? you know what I mean), and an inexhaustible depth of filth. My best friend who also happens to be my slut. Ive spent too many years trying to sacrifice one for the other and refuse to waste anyones time with being less than completely honest about who I am and what I need. Maybe Im just greedy (spoiler alert: I am). Maybe I want too much and am projecting an impossible fantasy on a fellow imperfect human being. But maybe Im not alone in straddling this contradiction after all. Maybe someone is out there who might happen upon this novel of a post who also needs it all, the full breadth of both extremes; an endlessly rich vanilla relationship full of dates, laughs, memories, and adventures, coupled with an endlessly depraved d/s dynamic full of power exchange, exploration, openness, and earth shattering orgasms. Id much rather write some of my heart out into a text box than remain content in accepting it does not and cannot exist. --- *Time for some real talk; this was written over several days and started in a snarky place with the title but ended in a sincere place and is a fair bit more rambly than intended upon proofreading.* Im a dom, and Im looking for a sub. Not *a* sub, but rather **my** sub. Like a one and only forever sort of deal that starts in friendship and blossoms into a love that would make the rest of the world jealous if they could ever understand. I want to date like normal people, only knowing that the endgame includes and involves much more than 5 minutes of missionary once a week. Im not looking for my equal; Im looking for my complement. We will likely be very different in many ways, and I hope we can both learn so much from each other as we build a loving relationship alongside a beautiful d/s dynamic. Maybe weve shared the same dream our whole lives and, in some sense, already know each other better than anyone else. As profuse as this post is, Ive left much unsaid. There are, of course, many particulars to discuss and many things to share in time, which I very much look forward to. But well need to take things slowly. I trust too easily and love too quickly and as a result get hurt too often. Start with my mind, and the rest will follow when its ready. In the interests of not wasting anyones time (which you clearly have an abundance of if youre still reading this), Im not looking for anything long distance or online, though well start here (and tell our grandparents we met in the park). I have a pretty firm type if you buy into that (introverted, nerdy, petite, cute, unassuming girl-next-door, since I know Ill be asked) but know that beauty and attraction manifest themselves far deeper than the surface. Just please be healthy and happy with your body, especially if its going to be mine one day. I hope this was enough (and not too much) to ignite the spark we need to connect. I cant promise anything between us, but I can promise we will never know if you dont reach out. Im not going anywhere, dont bite (yet), and am clearly a fan of epically long letters, creativity, and originality. Just be *you*. Thats all I can ever ask of you, even without knowing you yet. Im ready. Are you? "

I am ok with a sub who may or may not have hers together. I have had successful relationships in both cases. It was rewarding to help someone I cared about put her life together. And it was fun to skip that part. A bit of elaboration on what ""shit together"" means: I own multiple homes. I have advanced degrees. As a professional, I am a creative person who manages other creative people. I work out 7 days a week, am fit and healthy (6'3"" 185 pounds). I set goals and follow through on them. I have high standards for the people in my life and even higher standards for myself. For fun, I spend a great deal of time outside running, skiing, climbing mountains. I love whiskey and beer. I can also easily spend an evening just watching Netflix. The last 4 TV shows I binged on were Better Call Saul, House of Cards, GOT, and the Office. I do not have an issue attracting and staying in a relationship with women. But finding a woman who was born with a need to be submissive to the right man is a roll of the dice in real life. I would rather start at that point with someone and see if we are compatible in other ways too. What I'm looking for: * A connection at every level (D/s, vanilla) * Mutual physical attraction * Someone who wants to live the D/s life 24/7 My single kink is power. I am not a micromanager but I am someone who is attracted to the vulnerability and trust that is implied by total submission. I believe in earning that trust from a sub. But if I prove worthy of it, it has to be total submission. I want the deep connection that comes from owning my subs body, mind, and soul. I believe most kinks derive from a power exchange. I have few hard limits except that I prefer a power exchange that follows D/s where I am the Dom (obviously). If this appeals to you, I'd love to hear from you and to see if there's something between us."
687,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,22 [M4F] -- Trying to find a friend for a 24/7 D/s relationship (online),0,4tufhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/4tufhs/22_m4f_trying_to_find_a_friend_for_a_247_ds/,2016-07-21 11:01:42,"Hi there! **First, let me introduce myself** I'm a young professional, an avid writer and reader, a breakfast addict, and am apt to take very long hikes. I'm regretfully a political junkie, I'm endlessly philosophical, and helplessly empathetic. I've done stand up comedy more than a few times, I try my best to be huge into running, and while I'm more introverted than extroverted, the friends I have are the best part of my life. I'm also pretty good at making toast. **About me as a Dom** I have been Domming on and off for three years now, some of it in person, most of it online. Why do I do it? Well, aside from the obvious reality of myself being endlessly kinky, I find that I am able to become profoundly close to the subs I do have, forming a relationship that is intimate and trusting, which is something that I treasure and wish to find again. Besides that, I do this simply because I love to help people make their fantasies become a reality and I believe I can provide a safe and discreet platform. I get my kicks from controlling and unlocking your desires and discovering new things together. I have had several short-time relationships, and a few longer relationships. During every relationship I have learned new things about myself. I have succeeded in new ways, and I have failed in others. I am still learning about myself as a dominant, and I think that's probably the most exciting thing about this. Will I always be perfect? No, absolutely not. Will I hold my position with integrity, and treat you with absolute respect? Absolutely. **What am I into?** *Ownership* Let me make this as clear as possible, I am looking to possess you. I want to slowly take over every part of you. I want to break you down, and build you up again as my own. I'm not a harsh Dom, I'm not seeking to tear down your self-worth or change you as a person, but I do want you to be fundamentally owned by me, and therefore I will seek to make it an un-ignorable fundamental fact that you are owned, that you serve my interests and my pleasure, and that you are loved because of it. *Training* Directly related to the last one, I am looking to make you my own, so this will be a commitment. I will train you, I will mold you, I will craft you. You will be trained in how to speak, in how to dress, in how to present yourself, in posture, in respect, how to be gracious, how to be repentant. You will be trained in orgasm control. More than anything, you will be training to put me above yourself in everything you do. *Pain* Yes, I am a bit of a sadist. I love hearing you in pain. I love seeing you in pain. I love glowing welts, and purple bruises. I love to push my subs, I want you to know that you are stronger than you give yourself credit for, and that you can be strong for me. I want you find value in that. I want you to enjoy that. There is nothing that gives me more pride than a sub who pushes herself for my sake. Some of what I'm into pain-wise: Spanking ,Whipping, Clips/clothespins, Wax, Chemical play (hot-sauce, icy hot, etc.), Predicament bondage/stress positions, Breast torture. *Humiliation* You will be expected to know your place, but sometimes I'm simply going to put you deeper into your place regardless. Embarrassing and difficult tasks, revealing positions, hidden public tasks, body-writing, name-calling. It will be established that I am above you, and it is my proper place, and that you are below me, and that this is your proper place. *Friendship* This doesn't get mentioned enough in advertisements I don't think. Yes, I want to control you, humiliate you, hurt you, expose you, train you, mold you, and dominate you. But more than that, I want a really good friend. Someone who I can chat with after a really long day. Someone who can cheer me up when I need it. I want to grow close to you, and be there for you, and help you through hard days, and harder nights. I want to share movies with you, and listen to music together, and share recipes of our favorite food. This is about so much more than kink, this is about two people coming together. **Who am I looking for?** *Someone compatible with myself* As I said, I want a friend, a partner, and confidante, someone to be there for, and who can be there for me. I can get a lot of people to strip on camera for me, all it takes is a few extra bucks in my pocket (and not even that). What makes this special is the relationship that we form with each other. I aim for this to be one of the best and most fulfilling relationships of your life. I want that, I'm committed to that, and you should be as well. *Someone who is confidently submissive* I want someone who submits because they are fulfilled in it. Because they find strength in it. Because they feel most themselves in it. You are expected to bring your weakness to it and your vulnerabilities, that is expected, that is part of what submission is. But you shouldn't submit out of that weakness, you should submit because it makes you happy. At the end of the day, my one goal as a Dom is to have a happy sub. Let's start on that road so we can reach the end of it together. *Someone willing to be vulnerable and honest* This is huge for me. You can not truly submit to me unless you bring your whole self to me. Eventually you will need to share with me your shortcomings, your fears, your aspirations, and your secrets. Can this be scary? Absolutely. Will it be? No. I am going to create a safe spot for you. A place where you are secure. Where you have nothing to hide. We spend so much of the day hiding ourselves from the people we meet. You deserve a place where you can remove that mask. I hope to be that place for you. *Someone not afraid to be physically intimate* This is a sexual relationship. Let's be sexual. Part of serving me is being my toy. Using your body and your mind for my pleasure. I want to see you. I want to rejoice in your body. I want to see you squirm. I want to see you mark. I want to dress you. I want you to be on your knees, waiting on me, fully exposed and vulnerable. I understand that there are a lot of people who think that this is the entire relationship, and I understand that pursuing this online, you have likely been taken advantage of in the past. You will not be here. I seek to use this vulnerability to create a more real, fun, and intimate submissive environment, where we can explore both of our fantasies in the most potent and fulfilling of settings. You should be willing to give a lot of yourself to me. **Just tying this all together** As I said before, this is a commitment. You should not do this if you are only looking to get off, if you are simply looking to dip your toes in and get out, or if you aren't willing to sacrifice and change yourself on my behalf. In return, I will give you the best D/s relationship I can possibly give you. That's going to be a lot of effort on both of our ends. It will be given on my end, I also need it to be given on yours. **A note for beginners** What I outlined above is a vision of a complete mature relationship. Some will be able to jump into that more quickly than others. Some will take more time. I am fine with that. If you need to take things a little slower, please know that I am going to work as hard as I can to make an environment that is right for you, and conducive to your growth as a submissive and a person. This is about you as much as it is about me, so we will work to create the right relationship for you. **Are you interested?** Great! Well, I don't want to make messaging me too complicated. So, if you're interested, send me the following. A bit about yourself: * doesn't need to be a novel, but give me a clear idea of who you are as a person. * Your experience as a sub, and what appealed to you about this ad. * Finally recommend me a novel or an album, and tell me your best joke. If you got through this awfully long ad, let me be the first and only to applause. On a serious note though, I spent some time on this ad, so I appreciate each and every person who took the time to absorb it and consider it from the bottom of my heart."

I am also a professional woman with ambitions and talents. I work full time, and Im married. I am polyamorous and queer, but I am currently looking for someone masculine of any gender identity. I function very well out in the real world, and I do it by compartmentalizing. My submissive Little self is very shy, and I dont let people see that side of me unless I deem its safeunless I feel someones natural dominance. So this may seem cold and impersonal, but look at it like I'm a neutral third party trying to arrange something enjoyable for my far too shy but very sweet submissive friend. ;) Primarily, Im interested in fulfilling, creative seduction and kink with no strings attached. I enjoy physical sex and kink as much as the next person, but I also love and crave the pure mental engagement of a good online partnership. I want someone with whom I can show my submissive and Little side in a roleplay type settingno plot needed (though you can look at my post history to see what Ive posted to DPP if you wish). I want to look forward to the time we spend writing together, because I know its going to be titillating. I am looking for an intelligent, sensual Daddy Dominant type with a sadistic streak. You dont need to make any commitment to me, but I do need you to be aware of and protective of my wellbeing as your partner, which means you must understand the importance of aftercare. I want someone who has a nurturing streak for Littles, but is an ethical sadist behind closed doorsand you can get pretty sadistic and dark. Im hoping for someone who exudes Dominance, the type with a presence that just drips confidence and control. I am bashful and will not initiate, so I need someone who is confident enough to do so, but also respects that I may not always be in the mood or there may be days I need it to go slower while I warm up. Some of my biggest kinks are ageplay, pain (particularly impact play and rough sex), corruption of innocence, verbal humiliation, physical or mental restraints, threats, and dirty talk (I love dirty talk possibly more than anything else). Assholes dont turn me on, but people who know how to engage the dark side of their imagination and hurt without harm, and understand the difference between hurt and harm definitely DO turn me on. Im looking build a shared creative spaceas such, I dont care what you look like or how old you areas long as you are legal, that is. I am a good writer, but Im not looking for multi-paragraph plot-heavy RP at this pointI can say that I rarely ever have erotic RP where we are initially compatible that doesnt lead to a very satisfied partner--I have a natural desire to please. I dont want boring predictable replies of a few words, but I dont expect more than perhaps a paragraph tops when you send me a message. Im looking for someone who has a night or two a week (or more, but I dont expect you to be around every night) to spend rapidly exchanging words. A few posts scattered out during the day or on evenings youre not able to chat are, of course, welcome. But Im hoping it wont just be that. We can do this over reddit, though Id prefer either Hangouts or Skype for convenience and speed. These are my limits: This is no strings attachedyou do not own me, outside of our chats. Im not looking to make a commitment to someone right now. I do not send pictures, voice chat, video, or anything of the sort, and Id rather you not send me those things either. I want to make a fantasy life together that we inhabit as avatars of our inner selves, and seeing pictures will take me out of that. Your words are what I find sexy. Im not hugely into scat, urine, vomit, or cutting. Although it isnt a limit, I find writing endless blowjobs really boringI love the dialogue and dirty talk and its sort of hard to talk with my mouth full. Ill write them, especially if I really enjoy chatting with you and it's something you'd really enjoy, but please dont make it the main event every time we chat. Just about anything else goes, and Im happy to discuss in PMs very specific examples of what I like, though I am hoping you are creative enough to hit on most of what I like on your own, and Id hate to prevent you from hitting on new things I dont even know Ill love by giving you a bunch of boxes to check off. I write my actions in third person present--I don't mind if you write in first person, just know that I personally will not, for some reason it just feels awkward to me. Also, please be understanding of the fact that I am a busy adult with a full time job and hobbies and obligationssometimes Ill be slow in responding. If were actually chatting back and forth quickly, Ill let you know when Im logging for the evening if at all possible. Im not interested in real life instructions and expectations right at firstif we really hit it off and I come to truly trust you, I may give you some real life controlfor example, if you choose to help me try and reach some goals I have or something. When we are chatting erotically, though, this is about my brain getting me wet, not my touch acting out the scene. I like to keep my hands free to type so I can really mentally and emotionally engage, please respect that. This is a search for which I plan to be patient--I hope you can be too. If you know you're awesome, and what Ive described sounds like the perfect fit, don't message me and then give up fifteen minutes later. I will be picky, however, because my time is limited, and I have a few story-based RP partners already that deserve my effort. Emotional vulnerability also does not come easy for me, if you couldnt tell from the businesslike tone of this post. Im not an easy nut to crack, but I am worth it and if we hit it off, well figure it out. I have to feel the right vibe from you that will tell me were compatible or this wont workits different than one of my character based stories, because were actually talking about me playing myself, so I cant be terribly flexible on what Im looking for or it wont be fair to either of us."

While I am looking for something serious I am still open to more casual, pure-kink focused relationships if the connection is there/right. **Who am I**? Well, I think of myself as an intelligent, considerate, lightly-eccentric-in-a-good-way gentleman. I'd say I have a silly/ridiculous sense of humor (I enjoy innuendo a lot (title of my sex tape), and also enjoy high-brow stuff too. I find myself attracted to movies and music more than books for me (I'm a big quoter), but I can and do read (from time to time). **I pride myself** on being considerate, perceptive, and observant; I'm very good at communication, and while I seem gifted in self-aware-ed-ness I can also go to obliviousness faster than Trmp can piss off someone. Physically speaking I hear that I'm handsome (if you're over 60) and cute (if you're not). I like shopping, and as such cultivating a sense of style. Oh, and I'm 5'10, 180 pounds, average build. My favorite things about me are my face and my cock (if I'm not dicking around). Kink wise **I am a total hedonist**. Choice is sexy to me, so I'm all about service-submission, zero disobedience, and a sub choosing out of a love to please, rather than a love to be 'forced'. I like being spoiled by my sub because I like to spoil her in return. **Kinks I must have** with my partner: * Cock worship * Free use * Anal * Cum play * Fashion play * Extreme dirty talk (this one is my favorite and most important) The list is a lot longer, those are my favorites. My **hard limits** are: * Permanent Marking * Scat * Blood * Needles * Intense pain * Extreme bondage * Brats/disobedience * Vomit * Illegal acts (children, animals, et cetera) **What I'm looking for** besides compatibility in kink, is similar qualities I embody. I'm more of a birds of a feather than opposites attract, though I don't close any doors. Be as emotionally intelligent and open, considerate and kind as you are sexual and kinky. Be able to **communicate** shamelessly, directly, probably with some amount of vulnerability too. Communication is one of the top reasons I got into D/s; communication is required for a strong, healthy D/s relationship, and I want someone who appreciates that neither of us will be a mind reader at the start. Communication is also my biggest kink, I'm all about it. When I picture my partner and I, (*not that I was a huge fan of this movie*) I picture the dynamic between Deadpool and Vanessa from the recent film (with my partner being only slightly more submissive/obedient); I like a sexually aggressive, dirty minded, pleasing partner. Someone who is passionate about exploration and their own sexuality. I want a girl who, while she is my submissive sub/slave can easily handle herself, and though I can (would, and may at times), can/likes to fight her own battles. Distance wise I'm looking for someone I can reach by car, if you aren't in the Chicago area, but not too far, don't let it stop you from messaging me.

I'd be willing to show Her my compliance over Skype if we've built up some trust as that would enhance the feeling of vulnerability for me. Now I do have limits...namely blood, scat, extreme pain (though honestly I don't know my limits), children, or anything that would get us in actual trouble. Beyond that I'm flexible. On the kink front, I find particular arousal in anal penetration, prostate play, mild cbt, edging, denial, ruined orgasms, that sort of thing. If this sounds like something that might appeal to you, then I look forward to hearing from you and chatting a bit more :)"

I am ok with a sub who may or may not have hers together. I have had successful relationships in both cases. It was rewarding to help someone I cared about put her life together. And it was fun to skip that part. A bit of elaboration on what ""shit together"" means: I own multiple homes. I have advanced degrees. As a professional, I am a creative person who manages other creative people. I work out 7 days a week, am fit and healthy (6'3"" 185 pounds). I set goals and follow through on them. I have high standards for the people in my life and even higher standards for myself. For fun, I spend a great deal of time outside running, skiing, climbing mountains. I love whiskey and beer. I can also easily spend an evening just watching Netflix. The last 4 TV shows I binged on were Better Call Saul, House of Cards, GOT, and the Office. I do not have an issue attracting and staying in a relationship with women. But finding a woman who was born with a need to be submissive to the right man is a roll of the dice in real life. I would rather start at that point with someone and see if we are compatible in other ways too. What I'm looking for: * A connection at every level (D/s, vanilla) * Mutual physical attraction * Someone who wants to live the D/s life 24/7 My single kink is power. I am not a micromanager but I am someone who is attracted to the vulnerability and trust that is implied by total submission. I believe in earning that trust from a sub. But if I prove worthy of it, it has to be total submission. I want the deep connection that comes from owning my subs body, mind, and soul. I believe most kinks derive from a power exchange. I have few hard limits except that I prefer a power exchange that follows D/s where I am the Dom (obviously). If this appeals to you, I'd love to hear from you and to see if there's something between us."

If you responded to an earlier ad, please read this one before responding.

I am a plus size, poly, dominant lady looking for adult, responsible connections with submissives or switches who know what they are looking for. I hate making a laundry list of kinks because I believe connections are more important than that but my main interests are teasing, edging, service topping, sadism, gender bending, service submission, etc. Hard limits are the obvious, blood, scat, adult babies, diapers, feederism, squashing, and a few others I'm sure. Outside of kink, I own a home, have two lovely dogs and enjoy a huge range of artistic hobbies. I write for a living, love to cook, and have an obsession with food history and anthropology, home brewing, wine making, weight lifting, and midcentury fashion and furniture. I really, truly enjoy meeting and getting to know people. I've always had a soft spot for finding the shyest person in a room and making them smile. Being a shy kid once myself I understand the value of vulnerability and take it to heart when someone shy or quiet opens up to me. I know shyness can also be gregarious and awkward and I enjoy that as well (within reason, of course). That's very likely why I developed an affinity for kink that involved turning usually composed or quiet types into a blush-y mess of overwhelmed sexual feelings. I really enjoy casually getting to know someone, figuring out all the little fantasies and desires they have and using it against them in the long run. Yes, I can be an insatiable tease and a bit sadistic, but I'm also intensely nurturing and responsible. Safe, sane, consensual exploration of kink is the highest priority to me. It's right up there with really getting to know the friends or partners I am intimate with. I am not interested in play partners or casual hookups. I cannot dominate someone I don't deeply admire and respect even if that domination includes degradation and sadism. Your gender does not matter to me. My age range is from 21-35. I have a nearly inflexible interest in thin and fit men and thin to slightly chubby girls. You will need to live in the area. Long distance/online is ABSOLUTELY NOT an option. I would like to text a bit and hopefully meet for coffee or dinner within a week or two. You will need to be drug and disease free (and provide papers if need be). Single or in an openly non-monogamous relationship. Experience doesn't matter. If you are a switch, feel free to message me as well. You need to be able to share hosting responsibilities (aka don't live at home), hold a job, and have your own transportation. When you message me: SEND MORE THAN A HI! I get more than a hundred messages from every post I post. It's not a humble or even regular brag. It's a simple fact that I cannot respond to everyone. If you tell me you're a sub and hi, I won't respond. Your best bet is to tell me about you as a person, ATTACH A PHOTO, and give me your KIK or PHONE NUMBER. "

I love to nerd out to anything fitness or nutrition. I'm tall, blonde, athletic, and confident. I'm tight with my friends and family, and they have always been very protective of me. While I'm seemingly happy and social, I'm secretively an introvert. I crave someone telling me that it's okay to 'shut it off' once in awhile. I spend my free time hiking, reading, playing with style/fashion, and volunteering. I like to sing, but I'm very shy about it. I'm educated, work full-time in healthcare, and am trying to learn how to cook outside of the microwave. I'm telling you all of this before I really dive into the d/s stuff because I want to appeal to more than just that part of you. The mental aspect of d/s is what I am attracted to most, and I think it's important that we know what the other is looking for. I want to be coveted and protected. In my very vanilla life, I am guarded and keep everyone at arms length with a smile. My friends and acquaintances see me as a beaming and confident girl. In d/s I seek the kind of bond that allows me to completely surrender. I want to be vulnerable to someone else in totality. I am not a service sub, but I want to be perfect to you. I have a head on my shoulders, but as our bond grows Id like to become more and more dependent on you. Take control over the parts of my life that you desire, and make the decisions that will mold me into your beautiful little sub. You know whats best for me. I need you to be steady, strong, and in control. If you ever need reassurance, I will remind you of how much you do for me. I crave your praise and am embarrassed to my core by compliments- but I need to hear them from you. When I'm blushing and want to look away, but you warn me not to- that's when you'll see utter and true vulnerability in my eyes. I am your precious, eager, and beautiful thing. You can do whatever you want to me, but only because our bond is so strong. Youre the only person I trust in this way. You get the parts of me that no one else gets to see, let alone touch. You get to make the decisions that guide me through life, as I am a living and breathing embodiment of your will. None of this happens overnight. I just want to be upfront and honest about what I'm looking for a friendship with you to evolve into. Dont message me because youre looking for just any sub. Dont message me if youre looking for quick nudes or a way to get off tonight. Message me if what Ive written strikes a chord with you, dominant parts and all."

I'm ~~Troy McClure~~ Sir Patiently, ~~you may remember me from~~ and I'm looking for a sub/partner. I'll go into what I look for when it comes to that in the *Australia* of this post, but I'll start with a bit about me. As mentioned in the title I'm one of *those* smart, creative types. I've a strong sense of humor, enjoy being fun/ridiculous, and love to quote shows/movies. I also greatly value emotional openness and intelligence, as well as vulnerability and introspection; know thyself (or at least endeavor to). I'm very perceptive when I want to be; I'm also spiritual (not in the *praise jaysus* way, more the love all things, be peace to make peace way). But when I hear the horn blow, and feel the full moon's light... I get *kinky.* Well... it might be more like when the wind blows, or a girl sneezes. Kink-wise I've got a good amount of experience under my belt. From online to off, communities to solo exploration, I've done my fair share. I like to approach kink academically almost as much as I do with the other more physical avenues. For me the ideal D/s dynamic is one of service/reward. Total obedience, and even initiative, to earn my reward along with my sub's own desire to please/serve. **My 'wow that got me hard' list includes:** (These are just my top ones, the list is much longer) service submission, cock-worship, anal, free use, and biggest of all: extreme dirty talk. **My: Nope get-to-da-choppa list:** cutting, scat, blood, needles, vomit, marking, brattiness, extreme bondage. Now that we're *down under* let's talk about what I look for in a sub. Basically... all the things I embody and value. Humor, consideration, emotional intelligence/openness, vulnerability, intelligence, creativity... I'm not looking for a clone of me, two people can have the same qualities but express them in totally different ways. Beyond this, someone whose kinks match my own and have a desire to start checking off fantasies. As far as physicality goes, I think all women are beautiful, but when it comes to Domming I do enjoy being bigger/heavier than my partner. (I'm 5'10, 180 pounds, average body, handsome face). I am primarily looking for a serious partner, that said, I've had plenty of fun casual relationships and would be open to them with the right person. If my post speaks to you that much, drop me a line. I do have two quick tests. [View this non-pornographic image](URL If you laughed, then *Reddit User* Come on dooooown! If you didn't, we wont' have fun, turn back! Turn Back! The second test is: when you message me, try and put in the same energy you think I put in here. It means a lot. Okay, that's a wrap. Cue outro music and I wish you love and kink regardless."
698,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] NYC - Dichotomy,6,4dyqz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/4dyqz4/30_m4f_nyc_dichotomy/,2016-04-09 08:24:54,"**Dichotomy** (noun): *a division or contrast between two things that are or are represented as being opposed or entirely different.* -a rose blooming in the midst of a barren desert. -a bite of pastry that is at once both sweet and savory. -a hand which is somehow both hard as steel and soft as silk. -a strong, brilliant woman who longs for nothing more than to submit completely  mind, body, and spirit - to a worthy man. Life itself is diametric, or at least our understanding and experience of it. Flowers are beautiful because weeds are ugly. Warm summer afternoons are pleasant because we have suffered through torturous winter nights. Beloved friends are held close and dear because weve all been hurt and used by others. Some of these are simple enough to explain through logic or even scientific/psychological retorts; others remain delightfully inexplicable mysteries throughout the very lives they permeate. Some we readily accept as truth; others we fight and deny with great vigor. Some are momentary, ephemeral; others last and grow into eternity. --- **The dichotomy of You**: Nobody would likely ever assume this of you. Youre the quintessential good girl your friends and family have lined up for a white picket fence and a quiet, happy life. You dont even *look* kinky; your girl-next-door appearance and your deliberately modest beauty suggest you have rarely strayed from the library and Sunday school. But like the tip of any great iceberg, there lies a vast, awesome depth below your surface. Maybe youre completely at home there. Maybe youve shut it away for years, locked and sealed for who knows how long. Maybe youve tried to explore the great cave, but have quickly turned back into the light as you found yourself easily lost and scared without a guide. You live a dichotomous life every day. Smiling and nodding and pleasantly contributing to your work and life and friendships, never quite able to completely shut out the image of being bound in a dark corner with a ripped stocking and a devilish grin as the door to the room creaks open. Enjoying a full life of adventure, food, nature, art, and intellectual stimulation, yet coming home and frantically finding the most degrading porn you can imagine to sate the hunger that has been building through it all. Taking great pride in your health, fitness, and appearance, yet wanting nothing more than to be made a mess of and used as an object. This life can grow heavy in time, and it is far too easy to dismiss it as misguided or pointing to some psychology textbook or just ignoring it because it can be too much to deal with. But you havent *quite* been able to shut it off, whether youve tried or not. And youre here now, browsing /r/BDSMpersonals, wondering if maybe, just *maybe* this one is the one youve been waiting for all along. --- **The dichotomy of Me**: I, too, live this diametric life every day. Not as a mask to hide a shameful secret, but rather a veil to protect and preserve a precious and priceless artifact. As submission is anything but weakness, the dominance I have come into after many years of soul-searching and self-discovery is anything but aggressive, arrogant, or assailing. It takes no pride in titles or protocol (you'll notice my ""d""s are lowercase). It is not the violent storm that crashes wildly through the countryside, but rather the grounded, ageless oak tree that endures it, offering protection and shelter from the rain as well as shade and solace in times of calm. The submissive energy, by nature, is volatile and capricious; the dominant complement must, therefore, be strong enough to provide grounding and constancy through any instability. And therein lies the effervescent beauty of the d/s dynamic; like the Taoist philosophy of the yin and yang, the two complement and complete each other while existing, individually, as contradictions. If a healthy, loving, stable vanilla relationship is like two puzzle pieces that snap snugly together at the seam, a d/s relationship is like a super-glued, electro-magnetized, hyper-dependent and symbiotic connection that few people have ever been capable of understanding, yet alone lucky enough to experience. More than most things in life, I know and believe that is out there. That *you* are out there. My puzzle piece is jagged at times, smooth and round at others, and incredibly complex and intricate. Ive given up on trying to force that into a vanilla relationship, trying to push this part of me aside in the name of love or happiness or companionship, trying to squish my edge into grooves it was never meant to fit into. But maybe youre the same. Maybe for every irregular, rough edge on me there is a perfect fit in you. Maybe it will take a while to uncover those depths and find out how deeply our roots have been reaching for each other for so many years; maybe it will be an instant magnetic attraction weve both been going without for far too long. Maybe we belong with, in, and for each other. --- **The dichotomy of Us**: This is **not** about sex. While sexuality and complete intimacy and vulnerability (emotionally, intellectually, spiritually, as well as physically) are core elements of this dynamic, this is an expression of these depths and the love and affection that blossoms naturally out of them, and never a means to an end or a disconnected, carnal act of in and of itself. Sex will be completely off the table for a very, very long time. If you have to ask ""how long"", you'd be better off finding it somewhere else. You're a girl on the internet in 2016, it's easy to find. This is a connection based on trust, respect, comfort, and self-control, not on blindly succumbing to lust or shallow desires. But like all good dichotomies, the potential that lies underneath that veil is absolutely endless. And it is so beautiful and so intense it is absolutely terrifying. Above all else, I am here seeking a **long term**, **monogamous**, **healthy**, **loving** **relationship** with a naturally submissive woman. An organic connection between two adult human beings based on mutual attraction and compatibility. D/s is not the centerpiece on the dining room table of this connection; it is the very wood that holds the entire foundation together. A dichotomous relationship that appears completely normal and cute and happy to the vanilla world but which descends to unspeakable depths behind closed doors. A relationship where the warmest, softest, sweetest cuddle can transform effortlessly into a scalding hot evening of orgasm control and desperate, wanton hunger. Where inspiringly beautiful purity and utter filth exist hand-in-hand with astonishing ease. Where the bond between us is so strong, so completely sacred and absolute that we cannot help but fall more hopelessly into each other every day and grow so close that it becomes hard to tell where one of us ends and the other begins. I refuse to settle for anything less. --- *This is an old post from almost a year ago.

I want to get to know you, inside out, I want to learn your ways and what makes you who you are. I want this because I want to serve you for the beautiful, wonderful woman you are. Initially I would like things to start off slow, I want to be your confidant, your friend, the person you share things with after an irritating day. I believe that only through getting to know you in a more natural setting (yes kinklists are helpful but life is so much more complex than four colors on a list of sexual acts), I would be better equipped to successfully serve and worship you. A little bit about me: I have been a Dom both online and in real life many times before, however over the past few months I have found myself longing for someone who will accept my vulnerability, my neediness and desire to please. My major kinks are humiliation, body worship, reward/obedience training. The training aspect is something I find massively appealing. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours."
700,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,27[M4f] Dominant-Hedonist for Submissive-Hedonist [Chicago],3,48ayiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/48ayiv/27m4f_dominanthedonist_for_submissivehedonist/,2016-03-01 03:19:06,"Hello, I'm looking for someone kinky that I can grow a relationship with. Kink, *my* kink, is valued (as you can probably imagine) and so I find myself posting here to be more upfront about one of the core elements I want in a relationship; not everyone is comfortable with talking about their sexual preferences out of the gate (which is fine/understandable). In the past I've been about more casual arrangements, and I wouldn't be opposed to one with the appropriate people, and while I'm open to a serious, committed relationship, whether it's going to be casual, serious, comical, or quizzical, it will be with a like-minded kinkster (and it'll probably be all of those things, cause that's life). As you'll see from my post history I've been searching (and waiting), but I haven't found a partner quite yet. In the interim I have gathered quite a bit of experience. I've had both online and offline subs, participated in Chicago's kink community, gone to munches, and checked off some fantasies. I want more though, I really want to find someone to grow my kink with, as well as grow as a person, as well as grow vertically. **Who am I?** That's a great question! I'm pretty happy with who I am (and what I'm growing into). Trust me (I double checked). I try to make life as much fun as I can, laughing at everything (even my kink). I like everything from having some sugary cocktails and playing video games with friends to going shopping and cooking, and I love taking walks. I'm all over with my tastes, I like variety. Physically speaking: I'm 5'10, 180 pounds, white, brown hair, green eyes. I'd say I have a handsome face, an average body, and a beautiful mind. **What are my kinks?** They are legion! Well, maybe not legion.... My biggest kinks revolve around a **service oriented D/s dynamic**. I'm big on a sub who likes to serve, and likes to earn rewards. I like taking care of my sub as much as I like being taken care of. Specifically speaking **I'm into:** cock-worship, free use, pet play, roughness, anal, role-play, fashion-play, rough sex, face fucking, and my biggest kink is **extreme dirty talk**. I have a serious interest in cuckqueening. Whether that's simply fantasy, or more, I don't know yet. There is quite a bit more, but those are the important ones. **I'm not into** resistance/brattiness, (beyond the playful feigning type), scat, blood, needles, cutting, vomit, marking, or heavy bondage. I really am a pure hedonist at heart. Not a sadist, nor a masochist. Ideally, first and foremost, we have chemistry. I'm looking for someone I can connect with, and I believe chemistry comes from similarities, shared desires and experiences. I'm much more of a birds of a feather, than opposites attracting (not that I want to close any doors). Communication (one of the reasons why I got into D/s in the first place) and sense of humor are super important to me. Emotional openness, introspection, and vulnerability are also paramount. I can be, and value, very blunt and straightforward communication - not to say tact or sensitivity isn't appreciated. Going back to the physical, I'll say that while I think all women are beautiful, in the context of D/s, I gravitate towards women I'm larger than (helps when I'm tossing you around). If you're for me, send me a message. Tell me what caught your eye, try and mirror the information I've given here. You'll get points more points for content and length. I'm a very open person, I trust my heart; if you like that maybe you want to be that way too: message me. Sadly, if I'm not for you, I wish you good kink and love. * SP"
701,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,30 [M4F] I'm still learning.,5,4a4gt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/4a4gt1/30_m4f_im_still_learning/,2016-03-13 03:46:39,"Its been a long, strange, beautiful journey. On that journey, Ive come to discover, affirm, edify, study, integrate many things about myself, about my place in the world of d/s, about who I am, who I want to be with. Im still learning. I always will be. But dont take that to mean I havent spent my entire adult life in study, in scrutiny, in search. At this point, I would humbly offer that *I know enough to know that I know very little*. Ive settled rather comfortably into myself and theres room for one more. ----- Over the years, Ive found I dont fit very well into BDSM circles. Im not a sadist. I dont own a riding crop. Ive never had the desire to run a harem, use a collar, read 50 Shades. But these things do not a dominant make. Ive also found my personal dynamic to be a conundrum. You see, reddit, I dont do this for *me*. I dont go around getting off on barking orders and spanking and controlling orgasms ~~I mean, I do, but Im trying to make a point here~~ of my own accord. No; I am the half of missing whole. These actions, behaviors, words, desires, expressions are nothing without *her*. This has proven difficult to explain. Ive found most submissives Ive come across to be selfish and shallow. I want *these* things from *this* type of person for *this* long because if I have those things I will be happy. This is not submission, in my book. Of course, there is nothing wrong with having desires and standards and lists and curiosities and limits and dreams, but I find it terribly telling *where* those incentives stem from. Do we want these things for ourselves, like a child wanting a new toy, or do we want these things for a greater purpose, a person, a trust, a love bigger and beyond ourselves? Cannot, should not, submission be inherently associated with dominance? I find these questions fascinating and vexing. ----- Perhaps I can only, should only, speak for myself. What Ive found. What Im still looking for. Where the dead ends and detours and pitfalls and doors cracked slightly ajar on the journey have been for me. I am a dominant. I belong with, near, inside, around, covering, penetrating, encompassing, embracing a submissive. I want love, vulnerability, honesty, trust, us-against-the-world, depth, intensity, passion. A girlfriend, a best friend, a life friend, a slut, a rag, a cunt, a thinker, a questioner, a feeler, a smiler, a laugher, a sympathizer, a huge nerd, a goofball, a connoisseur of dadjokes and dank memes and cat pictures. Unapologetically, unwaveringly, unrestrictedly *happy*. Hungrily, hopelessly, hilariously *curious*. Calmly, courageously, cerebrally *warm*. Willingly, wantonly, wholly *submissive*. Now look at that, Ive just contradicted myself in making a list of things I want, selfishly, for me. Havent I? Perhaps such things are ultimately unavoidable, perhaps what we want and what we are looking for is simply part of who we are. Certainly, not having such goals and wants is a recipe for disappointment, isnt it? But heres the catch; these things are a means to an end, not an end to a means. Its not a mouse trap, a trophy hunt, an achievement unlocking. Rather, it is a path, a journey, a foundation upon which to build a most beautiful monument. ----- Truth be told, Im still new to much of this. While it has indelibly and undoubtedly been a part of me since I was old enough to know what to call it, the practical experience section of my dom resume is sorely lacking. Why havent I explored, played, tried, done? Many reasons, the foremost being I would never share any of that with someone I did not know, trust, and love. Again, these are not self-seeking pleasures to me. Also, Ive been plagued most of my adult life with entirely vanilla relationships, constantly and consistently telling myself love will be enough and that I dont need this to be happy. I was wrong every time. So Ill need your help, your guidance, your nurturing, your patience. Think the dom is supposed to know all the answers, call all the shots, do all the work? Im not sure wed get along well. I seek a partner, an equal, an understanding confidante who can and will invest their time, heart, body into this, into us. Maybe youre experienced in the lifestyle; maybe youre brand new. Its what is in your heart, your mind that matter, not the notches on your bedpost. I will be slow. I will be cautious. I will think too much and censor what I should share and weigh us down with doubts and questions and insecurities. I will be scared the first time I spank you. Not because I dont want to, but because I dont know how to manage the balance between a gentleman and a not gentle man. I will be hesitant to reveal my deepest thoughts, desires, fantasies, hungers. Not because I dont think you want them, but because I dont understand how I can want to cuddle you softly through a movie and degrade you harshly to the point of tears in the same night. I will be terrified of letting you all the way in. Not because you dont belong there, not because I wont know fully and completely the first time I look into your eyes that its been you all along, not that theres anything down there I dont think you can handle, but because nobody has ever been there. Ive been saving a *lot* for her, for *you*. My purity in that sense is perhaps balanced by the filth that churns underneath it, waiting to be birthed into being. I dont yet know how to navigate that dichotomy. Maybe I shouldnt be able to alone, maybe youve been the key this whole time. ----- Ill leave this for now, a snapshot of a Saturday mornings thoughts and ramblings. Im not looking for help, advice, guidance, an education. I appreciate thoughtful messages, conversation, oxford commas, vulnerability. I hope to find, meet, laugh, explore, learn, try, talk, build, share, grow, wonder after years how we ever made it this long without each other. Im far from perfect. But maybe when I press every fiber of my imperfect against your imperfect, well, just maybe we might find something nice. "

It's written by a dominant female about submissive males and pegging: ""Men seem, I suppose the best word I can think of is, softer, when they're being penetrated and enjoying it. Their gaze seems to turn inward, on their own bodies and sensations, rather than the external focus of 'doing something to someone' that tends to characterize hetero vanilla sex. It's vulnerability, sure, but it's also connecting with their bodies in a way that society has trained them from a very young age not to. Have you ever heard a man moan during straight sex the way he moans when getting pegged? Or seen his eyes glaze over in a simple and unquestioning acceptance of the pleasure that's being visited upon him? My hetero vanilla sex has never involved me taking a 'submissive' role, so I can't say that I experience a real 'role reversal' by taking on the part of penetrator. There are certainly kinky and dominant themes that are fun and I enjoy, but even if I were to drop those aspects of pegging entirely, I would still want to peg, for the reasons I gave above. Whether I'm teasing with long slow strokes to get him used to my cock, or pounding his ass on the brink of orgasm, being able to see a man relax underneath me and completely accept the pleasure I'm giving him is my favourite thing about pegging."" The dream is to find my perfect match here in LA, someone who I can be WITH as well as be fucked BY. I'm a 27 year old guy, cute to handsome, fit, sane and stable. Not looking to be a piggybank or get completely humiliated. Looking for around my age. I'm happy to send you a picture :)"

And I like personal better than advertisement, because I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. Isn't that why we find a true smile such a beautiful thing, because we know the pain a person had to overcome to find it? And isn't that the most profound thing about having a partner in this life, about having a submissive under you, and a Dom/Master above you, that you have someone to go through this absurd, heavy, but incredible trip around the sun with? So it's evident by now that this whole personal is going to be some stream-of-conscious bullshit and you're all going to have to learn how to deal. I, myself, just graduated college last spring, and have a decent paying job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a prominent reader/writer, runner, hiker, and occasional drunk stand-up comedian. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and regimented. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. You will exercise for me, eat healthy for me, accomplish your ambitions for me, so that at the moment where it is your duty to serve me, you are in the proper place to do so. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. I'm looking for a girl between the ages of 18 to 25. Someone who is intelligent (even if she doubts herself), believes in her self worth, (even if she has difficulty feeling it), passionate (even if sometimes it runs dry), and beautiful (even if she doesn't always see it.) Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine. And I think that moment when our souls touch is a moment I have been yearning for for a long time."

I love to nerd out to anything fitness or nutrition. I'm tall, blonde, athletic, and confident. I'm tight with my friends and family, and they have always been very protective of me. While I'm seemingly happy and social, I'm secretively an introvert. I crave someone telling me that it's okay to 'shut it off' once in awhile. I spend my free time hiking, reading, playing with style/fashion, and volunteering. I like to sing, but I'm very shy about it.

You can do whatever you want to me, but only because our bond is so strong. Youre the only person I trust in this way. You get the parts of me that no one else gets to see, let alone touch. You get to make the decisions that guide me through life, as I am a living and breathing embodiment of your will. None of this happens overnight. I just want to be upfront and honest about what I'm looking for a friendship with you to evolve into. Dont message me because youre looking for just any sub.

Thanks for clicking on my post. Let me tell you what I am and what I am looking for. If you think you line up with my expectations, and I with yours, send me a message. If you dont please dont send me a message. It can get pretty crowded in these inboxes, lets not waste each others time. What I am an attractive, intelligent, whimsical, dynamic and insightful woman. I feel things intensely and I enjoy analyzing that intensity. Intuition and logic always at odds in the most beautiful way. I am also a cliche. The good, neglected, little housewife cheery and innocent and diligent in her duties. That, however, is just the surface. Beneath that veneer lies something vastly different from what the exterior would allude to. Inside I am a insatiable slut burning and aching for the pleasure of servicing someone elses desires. Finding awareness of this aspect of myself has made life bright and burning. Of course, without someone to make use of such a burning ache, I feel woefully unfulfilled. I would consider myself pretty fresh to the D/s dynamic, with experience in one online relationship, and one in the flesh. I am interested in experiencing more of both. I have innumerable kinks. Everything excites me, anything is on the table if it is something you desire. I am a sub, through and through, and so I lack any selfish impulses, only the impulse to do as I am told without hesitation. To be used in the purest sense of the word. That is where I feel it that burning on the skin. The fire and venom that courses through my veins and hums along my nerves. I have very few limits to what I am willing do to please within my situation, within the online framework and in person. I promise adoration, affection, and passion. I want to be someones most prized possession and I will absolutely do the work required of me to earn that privilege. For the right person. So who is the right person? To start, let me be clear that I am not interested in make believe or paper tigers. I hope to find someone who is a whole person, and within that person is a Dominant man who seeks a sub like me. You are looking for me not because you are insecure, bored, sexually unfulfilled, arrogant, brutish, or missing anything else in your life. Your life is whole, but I am the piece between whole and on fire that is missing. I seek someone who is as committed as I am to the elegance and intricacies of a D/s relationship. Someone who I am attracted to and can admire as a person outside of that dynamic as well. Intelligent, witty, self aware, handsome, and fun with hobbies and interests that we can both delight in. The connection has to be on every level for me. I hope that you are as willing to open up as I am so we can discover that connection sincerely. You have many layers and I wish to cherish them all, the light and dark. You ought to willing to do the same for me. I hope to find someone who can return my eagerness to please with creativity and nuance. And lastly, I am looking for someone who will take the weight of their responsibility to the dynamic very seriously. I promise devotion, commitment, and vulnerability if you can promise great care and responsibility for that offering. So that is the outline. If that sounds appealing to you, send me a message. Lets share some secrets, adventures, and above all else, lust. I am looking for something longterm with depth. I am going to be very picky as to who I respond to. Choosing the person to own me is the last choice I want in my own hands so of course there is great weight in that. "

I'm looking for a real relationship, long term, and most likely LDR. I realize that any relationship requires communication and an understanding of each others needs, especially so in a D/s relationship, where a lot of vulnerability comes out in the open. That being said, a little bit about me. I'm 26, active military, a dental hygienist, and living in Germany. My enlistment is done in 2 more years, after which I will be going to school to be... a dental hygienist. It's complicated. To me, vanilla attraction and compatibility is important first and foremost. I don't trust or love easily but when I do it's a very strong and hard bond that happens quickly and forcefully within me. I can't do that or give my vulnerability or submissiveness to a potential Dom without vanilla compatibility and genuinely enjoying my time with them. That being said, onto the good stuff! My hobbies are nerdy and what you might think of as ""typical redditor"" hobbies: gaming, netflix binges, and reading. I also love the outdoors, and love hiking trips, swimming trips, kayaking trips... hike/swim/kayaking trips... you know. I'm also a good cook and pretty well interested in the paranormal/occult and have been since I was 11 or 12. I've been told I have an eye for taking pictures, but I don't know, I haven't dabbled too much in photography. Once I can get a good camera I will most likely start taking pics. =D I'm pretty new to the BDSM community, but being a sub is something I'm 1000% sure about. I want what any sub wants... to serve my Dom and to develop better as a person because of it. I'm definitely more interested in the psychological aspect of serving, although the bedroom aspect certainly is appealing to most everyone I would think! Truth is, I'm not QUITE sure yet what ALL of my kinks are and I have yet to experiment. To start, my soft limits would be degradation and a lot of pain. Hard limits are piss, scat, feminization, ageplay, torture, and (unfortunately) really any kind of nipple play outside of some light biting. Mine are really really really really really really sensitive and not in the good way. &gt;_&lt; I do LOVE biting and scratching in other areas of the body, and I'd want to be tied up, teased, and I'm into sensory deprivation. I'm also a bit of an exhibitionist and have always fantasized about sex in public (obviously not out in the open... but just to where there's a bit of a risk of getting caught). Others, I'm sure we could talk about and I am really open minded about trying new things. I AM seeking a 24/7 thing eventually, with everything keeping its own context (bedroom play vs normal every day vs punishment &amp; reward, etc). Honestly, if we're in the bedroom and I'm being bound or in pain or whatever, I'd rather be told how good I'm being for being able to endure. All that being said, I'm not looking just to fulfill my fantasies with my domineering girlfriend or whatever. I DO understand that there are times my Dom won't be so into kink because she had a bad day... same with me (hell in the military I have plenty of those). So I want to be there for each other. I want to be able to talk when issues come up in our lives or between each other. That being said... I will speak my mind to my Dom (in the sweetest and most submissive way I can) because like anything, it's give and take on both sides and when issues come up I'd like to feel free to bring them up and seek out my Dom's guidance. As far as my physical appearance, I'm 5'10 190 and working on losing some weight. I'm a little chub and working on getting a more fit runner's body back. Bright blue eyes, white, and dark hair. So write to me on here and maybe we can hit it off! Hope to hear from you soon. :)"

I love being around my family and friends, and always want to make people feel happy and comfortable. That being said, I'm strong-willed and confident. I have a sense of who I am but am also a self-improvement junkie. I am fiercely independent and yet my family and friends have always been very protective over me. I'm tall, blonde, and athletic. I love to hike, cook, read, kayak, go to the gym, and spend time with my friends. I work with people who live with a lot of struggle and hardship, and I never grow tired of striving to help a difficult population. I'm an adrenaline junky, I'm not always organized, and I am not always honest with my feelings. While loyalty is extremely important to me, I struggle in vanilla relationships to be emotionally available. To me, the trust and vulnerability that is necessary to submit = freedom. Freedom to express myself, let go, and give myself to someone in totality. I'm telling you all of this before I really dive into the kinky stuff because I want to appeal to more than just that part of you. While my submissiveness is not isolated to the bedroom, it's important to me that we enjoy each other and connect with each other in a multitude of ways. I'm not sending nudes or calling you Sir tonight. I want to form a deep connection that grows over time. I'm new to kink and inexperienced (at least IRL), but have a solid idea of the experience I want to get. I want to be someone's. I want to be a physical, intellectual, and emotional possession of pleasure for my partner. While I am strong-willed in my day-to-day life, it's a major turn-on to imagine submitting myself to one strong man. I want to feel protected and, in turn, I want to be all yours. The perfect combination of intelligence and a sense of humor is the ultimate turn-on for me. That, followed by a steady and unwavering masculinity and strength that manifests itself in sensual but firm dominance. As far as kinks go, I have a lot that I'm curious about and want to explore. While I'm of course interested in the physicality of kink, the mental component of a D/s dynamic is what I'm attracted to most. What I am looking for, above all, is a patient man to chat with and get to know. If any of this piques your interest, let me know! "

I'm an avid writer and reader, and recently I've been getting heavy into H.P Lovecraft. I absolutely love the philosophical underpinnings of his work, and as a horror junkie, his genre hits the sweet spot as well. Besides that, I try my best to be huge into running, and while I'm more introverted than extroverted, the friends I have are the best part of my life. **About me as a dom** I have been domming on and off for two years now, some of it in person, most of it online. Why do I do it? Well, aside from the obvious reality of myself being endlessly kinky, I find that I am able to become profoundly close to the subs I do have, forming a relationship that is intimate and trusting, which is something that I treasure and wish to find again. Besides that, I do this simply because I love to help people make their fantasies become a reality and I believe I can provide a safe and discreet platform. I get my kicks from controlling and unlocking your desires and discovering new things together. I have had several short-time relationships, and a few longer relationships. During every relationship I have learned new things about myself. I have succeeded in new ways, and I have failed in others. I am still learning about myself as a dominant, and I think that's probably the most exciting thing about this. Will I always be perfect? No, absolutely not. Will I hold my position with integrity, and treat you with absolute respect? Absolutely. **What am I into?** *Ownership* Let me make this as clear as possible, I am looking to possess you. I want to slowly take over every part of you. I want to break you down, and build you up again as my own. I'm not a harsh dom, I'm not seeking to tear down your self-worth or change you as a person, but I do want you to be fundamentally owned by me, and therefore I will seek to make it an un-ignorable fundamental fact that you are owned, that you serve my interests and my pleasure, and that you are loved because of it. *Training* Directly related to the last category, I am looking to make you my own, so this will be a commitment. I will train you, I will mold you, I will craft you. You will be trained in how to speak, in how to dress, in how to present yourself, in posture, in respect, how to be gracious, how to be repentant. You will be trained in orgasm control. More than anything, you will be training to put me above yourself in everything you do. *Pain* Yes, I am a bit of a sadist. I love hearing you in pain. I love seeing you in pain. I love glowing welts, and purple bruises. I love to push my subs, I want you to know that you are stronger than you give yourself credit for, and that you can be strong for me. I want you find value in that. I want you to enjoy that. There is nothing that gives me more pride than a sub who pushes herself for my sake. *Some of what I'm into pain-wise:* Spanking ,Whipping, Clips/clothespins, Wax, Chemical play (hot-sauce, icy hot, etc.), Predicament bondage/stress positions, Breast torture. *Humiliation* You will be expected to know your place, but sometimes I'm simply going to put you deeper into your place regardless. Embarrassing and difficult tasks, revealing positions, hidden public tasks, body-writing, name-calling. It will be established that I am above you, and it is my proper place, and that you are below me, and that this is your proper place. *Friendship* This doesn't get mentioned enough in advertisements I don't think. Yes, I want to control you, humiliate you, hurt you, expose you, train you, mold you, and dominate you. But more than that, I want a really good friend. Someone who I can chat with after a really long day. Someone who can cheer me up when I need it. I want to grow close to you, and be there for you, and help you through hard days, and harder nights. I want to share movies with you, and listen to music together, and share recipes of our favorite food. This is about so much more than kink, this is about two people coming together. **Who am I looking for?** *Someone compatible with myself* As I said, I want a friend, a partner, and confidante, someone to be there for, and who can be there for me. I can get a lot of people to strip on camera for me, all it takes is a few extra bucks in my pocket (and not even that). What makes this special is the relationship that we form with each other. I aim for this to be one of the best and most fulfilling relationships of your life. I want that, I'm committed to that, and you should be as well. *Someone who is confidently submissive* I want someone who submits because they are fulfilled in it. Because they find strength in it. Because they feel most themselves in it. You are expected to bring your weakness to it and your vulnerabilities, that is expected, that is part of what submission is. But you shouldn't submit out of that weakness, you should submit because it makes you happy. At the end of the day, my one goal as a dom is to have a happy sub. Let's start on that road so we can reach the end of it together. *Someone willing to be vulnerable and honest.* This is huge for me. You can not truly submit to me unless you bring your whole self to me. Eventually you will need to share with me your shortcomings, your fears, your aspirations, and your secrets. Can this be scary? Absolutely. Will it be? No. I am going to create a safe spot for you. A place where you are secure. Where you have nothing to hide. We spend so much of the day hiding ourselves from the people we meet. You deserve a place where you can remove that mask. I hope to be that place for you. *Someone not afraid to be physically intimate* This is a sexual relationship. Let's be sexual. Part of serving me is being my toy. Using your body and your mind for my pleasure. I want to see you. I want to rejoice in your body. I want to see you squirm. I want to see you mark. I want to dress you. I want you to be on your knees, waiting on me, fully exposed and vulnerable. I understand that there are a lot of people who think that this is the entire relationship, and I understand that you have likely been taken advantage of in the past. You will not be here. I seek to use this vulnerability to create a more real, fun, and intimate submissive environment, where we can explore both of our fantasies in the most potent and fulfilling of settings. You should be willing to give a lot of yourself to me. **Just tying this all together.** As I said before, this is a commitment. You should not do this if you are only looking to get off, if you are simply looking to dip your toes in and get out, or if you aren't willing to sacrifice and change yourself on my behalf. In return, I will give you the best D/s relationship I can possibly give you. That's going to be a lot of effort on both of our ends. It will be given on my end, I also need it to be given on yours. **A note for beginners** What I outlined above is a vision of a complete mature relationship. Some will be able to jump into that more quickly than others. Some will take more time. I am fine with that. If you need to take things a little slower, please know that I am going to work as hard as I can to make an environment that is right for you, and conducive to your growth as a submissive and a person. This is about you as much as it is about me, so we will work to create the right relationship for you. **Are you interested?** Great! Well, I don't want to make messaging me too complicated. So, if you're interested, send me the following. *A bit about yourself: doesn't need to be a novel, but give me a clear idea of who you are as a person. *Your experience as a sub, and what appealed to you about this ad. *Finally recommend me a novel or an album, and tell me your best joke. If you got through this awfully long ad, let me be the first and only to applaud. On a serious note though, I spent some time on this ad, so I appreciate each and every person who took the time to absorb it and consider it from the bottom of my heart."
713,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,"26[M4F] Asheville, NC area - Dom seeking ongoing, serious, and meaningful d/s dynamic",3,3dbw70,http://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/3dbw70/26m4f_asheville_nc_area_dom_seeking_ongoing/,2015-07-15 11:50:09,"If what I wrote below resonates with you, please do get in touch :) I believe that power dynamics are at constant play in life. Down to our very identity; we are porous and constantly exchanging parts of ourselves with each other. Among other things, I think d/s, when done well, can help us to tap into, explore, heal, and learn from some of the more powerful emotions and experiences of life. Things that have broken parts of us in the past can be revisited, and ideally mended, at least in part. I see it like an aid, with different roles being different templates by which to look at ourselves and the world. And by creating a safe psychological (and physical) environment to tap into these roles, I've experienced and witnessed some great things at times. And I'd like that again, and even better. I'm 26 and naturally quite nurturing and affectionate, but also analytical, and perhaps a bit exacting. I lived for many years in a lifestyle that included immense personal submission (not sexually), despite that not being my nature. I learned a lot, and a lot of what I have learned in hindsight is thanks to exploring dominance. Given my background, I just can't not take it all seriously. The physical act of sex or kink is, to me, one facet among many of the psychological experience of intimate dominance and submission. So far I've found it hard to find someone who is on the same page and compatible in other ways. So, I'm looking for a sub, although that's just another limiting label, ultimately. I believe there is value in experiencing both roles of dominance and submission (and the distinctions really fade at a certain depth anyway), but it really just depends on the individuals and what dynamics arise naturally. My base view of my role as a Dom is to provide the affectionate but firm structure within which vulnerability can develop. Vulnerability is what opens those pores in our identity and allows us to take others in. And the delicate balance that must be maintained is the nurturing of ourselves without the subsuming of them. The thing is, the Dom is really the servant of the sub. In a loving d/s dynamic, the divisions give way to a more fluid, unified reality. I'm a chubby guy, but not unattractive. I believe I'm a fairly competent Dom (and could even get a few references of sorts) and lover. I'm fairly open to what I'm looking for, as personality and compatible desires factor heavily into this. I want someone with emotional and intellectual hunger and drive for self-growth. And in that we can help each other along our ways. Seeing as I am fairly daddydom-ish, I lean toward someone younger these days, but often connect best with people older than me. If you respond, a picture is great, but not at all necessary. I will probably like to move to kik or something similar sooner than later as I find instant exchange often a better way to get to know someone. Also, I'm not nearly as dry as this all sounds. :p"
714,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,[31F4R] Complex kinkster/sub/Little looking for online companionship,2,3dgder,http://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/3dgder/31f4r_complex_kinkstersublittle_looking_for/,2015-07-16 11:38:28,"I AM: Intelligent, kind, self-sufficient, thoughtful, affectionate and shy. I am not complicated, but I am complex. I will make you laugh, and I will do just about anything I can to never make you cry. I wont bring drama to your life. Not ever. I have layers, and youll only get under them as we get to know each other. At first meeting I am kind but reserved, self-sufficient, independent, fun to talk to, but very respectful of personal space and boundariesoften to a fault. I have a hard time making friends only because I dont want to impose on people and probably miss overtures of friendship from people in my desire to not make anyone uncomfortable. Underneath that are layers of vulnerability, a huge capacity to love, an adoration for simple things, a childlike wonder at the things of the world, and an inner child that is equal parts scared and desperate for attention. Im not going to pretend in this initial post that Im flawlessly put togetherIm not. I see myself sort of like a mosaic. Ive been shattered a few times, but the result of that is something beautiful even if it is made of broken pieces. I am married, but I am not one of those women secretly looking for threesomenot only is my spouse not going to be involved with you, but hes barely involved with me. He has been sleeping in a different bedroom for nearly a year and we rarely speak anymore. I have not yet left him, but that is a distinct possibility in the next few months. However, I am wary of monogamy with anyone right now (maybe ever), so it doesnt matter much for these purposes. I am fat, and I am not trying to change that. I AM physically active, and working on building strength and endurance. I believe in health at every size, and in body positivity. PLEASE don't contact me if you want to 'help me lose weight.' I am a masochist, and I enjoy physical pain in a sexual context. I am also sexually submissive, and not a bratty sub. I enjoy service submission as well as bondage. I believe my submission is a gift that I choose to give to people that I trust. I will play naughty for roleplay purposes, but if I choose to submit you get my complete trust and obedience. I am a Little, meaning that I have an inner child who I occasionally allow to be more outer child than most people do. I love coloring, eating goldfish crackers, watching cartoons, and I cant sleep without my stuffed animals, and I am happier with a new teddy bear than with a bouquet of roses (though I like both!) In Littlespace, I enjoy a companion who is nurturing and caretaking of that part of me. I would say that my Little self is pretty mature and very shy and because I am a successful educated adult with a full-time job, its not like youd ever know that I cant sleep without a stuffed animal and that I love watching cartoons and coloringunless I told you I am a scientist, and deeply logical. Things that dont make logical sense upset and confuse me. That said, I relish stories of the paranormal or mysticism even if I dont quite believe in them. Im somewhere between Mulder and Scully. A bit more Scully but with a true desire to believe. I love people, but I am an introvert and I get quickly tired and overwhelmed if I am forced to be social with a group of people for too long, too often in a short period of time. The people I have connected with best have been exempt to this socially induced exhaustion. I love to read, I love to write, and I love to play video games. Id love to talk with you about some or all of these things regularly. I have a shy, self-conscious, self-deprecating, insecure streak that I keep under tight control. Like many of the traits I have that may occasionally seem to be red flags warning that youre about to be saddled with a needy drama queen, you wont know its there unless I tell you its there. My problems are my own unless you want to know about them, and even then I have a hard time expressing my negative feelings sometimes, so no need to fear that Im going to be hard to deal with. I WANT: A friend, and someone to find sexual gratification withwhether through character based role-play or detailed cybersex. If you just want to be my friend after reading this, then thats fine too! But if you want to get it on, online, I am totally down. ;) I want someone I can be totally honest withCAN, but know that it will take me a while to get there. Ive had a rough year and I am pretty emotionally guardedboth for my own protection and because I dont want you to feel burdened by me. It isnt outside the realm of possibility that we might meet in person at some pointbut I dont expect that of you, so please dont expect it of me. Also, I dont expect photos, video or voice chat from youdont expect them from me. Im extremely self-conscious as well as security minded. Ive had some bad experiences in the past with meeting people in person that seemed fine on the internet. I can get over that fearsometimes rapidly--but I dont want to disappoint anyone, so its better if that is not the expectation going in. I dont care what you look like, what gender you are, what sex you were assigned at birth, what color your hair is (if you have any), or how old you are as long as youre over 18. However, in the interest of full disclosure, I identify as a Lesbian with a demisexual streak for Dominant men, particularly Daddy Doms. This means I am not attracted to men physically unless I am emotionally drawn to them first. If youre Daddy Dom and you meet my other criteria, then dont worry about it. But if its going to make you insecure that I am not going to immediately swoon over your manliness, you may not want to bother contacting me. On the other hand, if youre a woman, be aware that I am excessively bashful about women and it may take me a while to stop being so shy. I am ESPECIALLY interested in the responses of women to my ad, though. So far all the responses to this ad in the places I have cross-posted it have been men and I could really use some more amazing women in my life. Not that the men who responded aren't great, because some of them are, but I'd like to have some variety as well. :) It would make it easier, of course, if you were already into D/s or BDSM in some capacity (lifestyle or in the bedroom) as a Dominant, but it isnt necessary. If we get along, I will meet you where you are just as much as I want you to meet me where I am. Possibly the most important thing to me right now is that I do not want another relationship/friendship where I am the sole driving force and the responsible party for the relationship as well as everything around us. I dont want to be the one who has to pick the restaurant, I dont want to be the one who has to make and enforce chores, I dont want to forever be the one trying to keep the friendship healthy. I really want someone who is self-sufficient, independent, and confident. I want someone who wants to be the one in charge so I dont have to do it for oncenot because I cant, but because I want one place in my life where I am not solely responsible for everything. I want someone who wants to take care of menot because Im needybecause Im not--but because they ENJOY TAKING CARE OF ME. There are sides of me I dont currently allow anyone to see, and I want someone who wants to see those pieces. Someone who will find it endearing when I want to color in a coloring book, or clap my hands and giggle like a child. But also someone who will be able to keep up with me in a conversation about social justice, books or video games. Liking science, medicine or animals is also a bonus. There are a few things you should know about me before you contact me. Firstly, if you dont see yourself as a Feminist, were not going to get along. If you think being LBGT or Q (or some combination thereof) is gross, were definitely not going to get along. If you have a problem with me being not only fat, but striving to be comfortable with my body size and focusing on being healthy with no goal to lose weight, then were not going to get along. If you have a fat fetish, were probably not going to get alongI want you to like the fat because its attached to me, not like me because Im attached to the fat. If you think its fucked up that I am a masochist, and enjoy a variety of other kinks involving mutual consent between two adults (such as ageplay, BDSM, etc.) then were probably not going get along. If you are a man and it is going to bother you that I am not going to be physically attracted to you without working at it, youre probably better off not contacting me. If youre looking for monogamy only, I probably cant give it to youit isnt impossible, but I cant see myself making a one person commitment to anyone any time soon, especially given Im married and I am not certain I will be leaving him. If you are a Dominant, then this is a bit more negotiable--if I choose to submit to you, I don't think it's feasible for me at this point to 'belong' to more than one person. But I won't submit to you if you won't work within my boundaries as I see them at the time. Drop me an orange envelope if youve bothered to read this far and arent scared off. Id be interested in Skype (without voice/video) and possibly Kik at first."

To be birthed into the world with a rsum of experience and a storied past of play excursions, rope classes, and dabbles in every branch of the kink tree. That when we put ourselves out there seeking a partner for anything ranging from a casual fling to a life-long love, why on earth would anyone give us the time of day until we can provide reference letters and our dom club membership card to prove were not some phony kid just trying to get off to some rough sex? Wouldnt a real dom have all these qualifications tucked away behind his business suit and tie, waiting to express and unleash a fully-formed masterpiece on the world without hesitation or doubt? Well, reddit, Im not that guy. Truth is, while this has been a part of me for the better part of the past decade of my life, and while I am fully confident in the unique place I occupy in the world of BDSM, I have pathetically little practical experience. Most of my past relationships have been 120% vanilla, as younger me thought love and commitment could bridge the gap (it cannot) and push aside the need for something deeper. I have a *lot* of firsts to give away, and I know Ill make a *lot* of mistakes as I fumble my way through a *lot* of new territory. And I think thats awesome. I dont see any of this as a sign of weakness or insecurity. In fact, if anything, I take great pride in being able to offer so much of myself to someone still, not having thrown anything away just to get it over with in the name of fun or experience. My sense of loyalty and exclusivity have always trumped my thirst for adventure and exploration; as lame as it may sound, I would feel like even going to a local play party would be cheating on someone I havent met yet. You can imagine how wild my Friday nights are I have a lot to learn. And a lot to explore. While Im not specifically looking for a veteran teacher sub, I do look forward to learning many things from you. With you. Even if youre completely inexperienced! This is a relationship dynamic based completely on trust, communication, and vulnerability to me, and I take absolutely no shame in being shown the ropes. In a perfect world, youd be the only one Id ever use them on anyway, so why wouldnt I want my entire library of knowledge and experience to come from you in the first place? And what sub on this planet wouldnt want to receive the gift of her doms first *real* spanking? This may be a different angle than youre used to reading about. And Ill admit, I tend to see things differently than most. But maybe you do, too. Maybe the thought of being someones 23rd submissive rubs you the wrong way. Maybe the prospect of exploring new territory hand-in-hand with someone you can connect with completely on every level in love and trust is the only way you could even consider taking that first step into this world. I know I could never give any of myself to anything less than that. If this piqued your interest, you may want to stalk my older posts. They're still completely relevant. And, sorry, I'm really only interested in local to NYC as I have no interest in online/distance relationships. "

I'm an avid writer and reader, and recently I've been getting heavy into H.P Lovecraft. I absolutely love the philosophical underpinnings of his work, and as a horror junkie,his genre hits the sweet spot as well. Besides that, I try my best to be huge into running, and while I'm more introverted than extroverted, the friends I have are the best part of my life. **About me as a dom** I have been domming on and off for three years now, some of it in person, most of it online. Why do I do it? Well, aside from the obvious reality of myself being endlessly kinky, I find that I am able to become profoundly close to the subs I do have, forming a relationship that is intimate and trusting, which is something that I treasure and wish to find again. Besides that, I do this simply because I love to help people make their fantasies become a reality and I believe I can provide a safe and discreet platform. I get my kicks from controlling and unlocking your desires and discovering new things together. I have had several short-time relationships, and a few longer relationships. During every relationship I have learned new things about myself. I have succeeded in new ways, and I have failed in others. I am still learning about myself as a dominant, and I think that's probably the most exciting thing about this. Will I always be perfect? No, absolutely not. Will I hold my position with integrity, and treat you with absolute respect? Absolutely. **What am I into?** *Ownership* Let me make this as clear as possible, I am looking to possess you. I want to slowly take over every part of you. I want to break you down, and build you up again as my own. I'm not a harsh dom, I'm not seeking to tear down your self-worth or change you as a person, but I do want you to be fundamentally owned by me, and therefore I will seek to make it an un-ignorable fundamental fact that you are owned, that you serve my interests and my pleasure, and that you are loved because of it. *Training* Directly related to the last one, I am looking to make you my own, so this will be a commitment. I will train you, I will mold you, I will craft you. You will be trained in how to speak, in how to dress, in how to present yourself, in posture, in respect, how to be gracious, how to be repentant. You will be trained in orgasm control. More than anything, you will be training to put me above yourself in everything you do. *Pain* Yes, I am a bit of a sadist. I love hearing you in pain. I love seeing you in pain. I love glowing welts, and purple bruises. I love to push my subs, I want you to know that you are stronger than you give yourself credit for, and that you can be strong for me. I want you find value in that. I want you to enjoy that. There is nothing that gives me more pride than a sub who pushes herself for my sake. Some of what I'm into pain-wise: Spanking ,Whipping, Clips/clothespins, Wax, Chemical play (hot-sauce, icy hot, etc.), Predicament bondage/stress positions, Breast torture. *Humiliation* You will be expected to know your place, but sometimes I'm simply going to put you deeper into your place regardless. Embarrassing and difficult tasks, revealing positions, hidden public tasks, body-writing, name-calling. It will be established that I am above you, and it is my proper place, and that you are below me, and that this is your proper place. *Friendship* This doesn't get mentioned enough in advertisements I don't think. Yes, I want to control you, humiliate you, hurt you, expose you, train you, mold you, and dominate you. But more than that, I want a really good friend. Someone who I can chat with after a really long day. Someone who can cheer me up when I need it. I want to grow close to you, and be there for you, and help you through hard days, and harder nights. I want to share movies with you, and listen to music together, and share recipes of our favorite food.

718,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,29 [M4F] NYC - Dichotomy,10,34ong1,http://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/34ong1/29_m4f_nyc_dichotomy/,2015-05-03 12:50:37,"**Dichotomy** (noun): *a division or contrast between two things that are or are represented as being opposed or entirely different.* -a rose blooming in the midst of a barren desert. -a heaping forkful of steaming hot waffle topped with freezing cold ice cream. -a bite of pastry that is at once both sweet and savory. -a hand which is somehow both hard as steel and soft as silk. -a strong, brilliant woman who longs for nothing more than to submit completely  mind, body, and spirit - to a worthy man. Life itself is diametric, or at least our understanding and experience of it. Flowers are beautiful because weeds are ugly. Warm, breezy afternoons are pleasant because we have suffered through torturous winter nights. Beloved friends are held close and dear because weve all been hurt and used by others. Some of these are simple enough to explain through logic or even scientific/psychological retorts; others remain delightfully inexplicable mysteries throughout the very lives they permeate. Some we readily accept as truth; others we fight and deny with great vigor. Some are momentary, ephemeral; others last and grow into eternity. --- **The dichotomy of You**: Nobody would ever, ever assume this of you. If anything, they would even purposely avoid spelling B-D-S-M in front of you so as not to corrupt your obviously innocent mind. Youre the quintessential good girl your friends and family have lined up for a picket fence and a quiet, happy life. You dont even *look* kinky; your girl-next-door appearance and your deliberately modest beauty suggest you have rarely strayed from the library and Sunday school. But like the tip of any great iceberg, there lies a vast, awesome depth below your surface. Maybe youre completely at home there. Maybe youve shut it away for years, locked and sealed for who knows how long. Maybe youve tried to explore the great cave, but have quickly turned back into the light as you found yourself easily lost and scared without a guide. You live a dichotomous life every day. Smiling and nodding and pleasantly contributing to your work and life and friendships, never quite able to completely shut out the image of being bound in a dark corner with a ripped stocking and a devilish grin as the door to the room creaks open. Enjoying a full life of adventure, food, nature, art, and intellectual stimulation, yet coming home and frantically finding the most degrading porn you can imagine to sate the hunger that has been building through it all. Taking great pride in your health, fitness, and appearance, yet wanting nothing more than to be made a mess of and used as an object. This life can grow heavy in time, and it is far too easy to dismiss it as misguided or pointing to some psychology textbook or just ignoring it because it can be too much to deal with. But you havent *quite* been able to shut it off, whether youve tried or not. And youre here now, reading an M4F ad in your city, wondering if maybe, just *maybe* this one is the one youve been waiting for all along. **The dichotomy of Me**: I, too, live this diametric life every day. Not as a mask to hide a shameful secret, but rather a veil to protect and preserve a precious and priceless artifact. As submission is anything but weakness, the dominance I have come into after many years of soul-searching and self-discovery is anything but aggressive, arrogant, or assailing. It takes no pride in titles or protocol (you'll notice my ""d""s are lowercase). It is not the violent storm that crashes wildly through the countryside, but rather the grounded, ageless oak tree that endures it, offering protection and shelter from the rain as well as shade and solace in times of calm. The submissive energy, by nature, is volatile and capricious; the dominant complement must, therefore, be strong enough to provide grounding and constancy through any instability. And therein lies the effervescent beauty of the d/s dynamic; like the Taoist philosophy of the yin and yang, the two complement and complete each other while existing, individually, as contradictions. If a healthy, loving, stable vanilla relationship is like two puzzle pieces that snap snugly together at the seam, a d/s relationship is like a super-glued, electro-magnetized, hyper-dependent and symbiotic connection that few people have ever been capable of understanding, yet alone lucky enough to experience. More than most things in life, I know and believe that is out there. That *you* are out there. My puzzle piece is jagged at times, smooth and round at others, and incredibly complex and intricate. Ive given up on trying to force that into a vanilla relationship, trying to push this part of me aside in the name of love or happiness or companionship, trying to squish my edge into grooves it was never meant to fit into. But maybe youre the same. Maybe for every irregular, rough edge on me there is a perfect fit in you. Maybe it will take a while to uncover those depths and find out how deeply our roots have been reaching for each other for so many years; maybe it will be an instant magnetic attraction weve both been going without for so long. Maybe we belong with, in, and for each other. **The dichotomy of Us**: This is **not** about kinky sex. While sexuality and complete intimacy and vulnerability (emotionally, intellectually, spiritually, as well as physically) are core elements of this dynamic, this is an expression of these depths and the love and affection that blossoms naturally out of them, and never a means to an end or a disconnected, carnal act of in and of itself. Sex will be completely off the table for a very, very long time. Even smaller signs of affection and intimacy will come slowly; dont expect anything more than a hello/goodbye hug the first time we meet. This is a connection based on trust, respect, comfort, and self-control, not on blindly succumbing to lust or shallow desires. But like all good dichotomies, the potential that lies underneath that veil is absolutely endless. And it is so beautiful and so intense it is absolutely terrifying. Above all else, I am here seeking a *relationship*. An organic connection between two adult human beings based on mutual attraction and interest. D/s is not the centerpiece on the dining room table of this connection; it is the very wood that holds the entire foundation together. A dichotomous relationship that appears completely normal and cute and happy to the vanilla world but which descends to unspeakable depths behind closed doors. A relationship where the warmest, softest, sweetest cuddle can transform effortlessly into a scalding hot evening of orgasm control and desperate, wanton hunger. Where inspiringly beautiful purity and utter filth exist hand-in-hand with astonishing ease. Where the bond between us is so strong, so completely sacred and absolute that we cannot help but fall more hopelessly into each other every day and grow so close that it becomes hard to tell where one of us ends and the other begins. *That* is the relationship we were made for, and *that* is what has been missing in our lives this whole time. --- **The final dichotomy**: Youve read every word of this (admittedly long) post. At least once. Maybe youre the outwardly confident, extroverted type who can fluently jump into a dialogue and knows exactly what she wants and how to express that in writing. But maybe youre overwhelmed with its breadth or scope or language or the ideas and images it conveys. And there is a stir inside of you, maybe from deep within the dark, unexplored cavern, that is telling you to reach out towards this. But life has taught you how to effectively and efficiently push such feelings aside, and youve become quite expert at justifying against your heart and gut with your mind and chalking things up to missed connections and smiling as life passes by, yet waiting on the side watching it go. *You* are exactly who I want to hear from, *especially* if you have no idea what to say or how to initiate this. There are many questions and many practicalities to discuss; all in due time. Like all dichotomies, the essence of the conflict and contradiction within lies in the trust that a balance exists that you, perhaps, cannot see. Im asking you to trust in that maybe and take a risk. I promise, I ~~only sometimes~~ dont bite. And have a wickedly sarcastic sense of humor that you would never guess from the serious tone of this post. You know, kind of like a dichotomy or something. Note: I am *only* looking for local to NYC, preferably Manhattan. You'd need to have one *hell* of an ass to justify the hour long train ride to Brooklyn... "

If you are just looking for casual fun, you should move on. I know I am targeting a very small subset of people by looking for a monogamous sub-inclined man, but monogamy is important to me and I refuse to enter another vanilla relationship. So, my hope is that I can find that one in a million guy I guess  Please be educated and between 27 and 36. (24 and under boysyou are adorable, but I promise you we are at different places in our lives and no matter how mature you are, we arent going to click for relationship purposes.) **IN THE BEDROOM** I am an experienced Domme. I identify as a sensual Domme, not a sadist and do not enjoy anything that involves a lot of pain or will leave permanent marks (but I will slap you around a bit). Vulnerability and humiliation, and then aftercare, is more my style. You might be on your back and restrained as I milk you, but I'll be holding your hand while I do. I switch between gentle and rough, but I won't give you more than I know you can take. My main kinks include CFNM, restraints, ass play (finger fucking, milking, plugs, dildos, strapons), facesitting/forced rimming, medical play, foot worship, cross-dressing, light CBT, slapping, spanking, gagging. Almost all of these (except restraints and ass play) are negotiable. Femdom will, of course, make a regular appearance in our sex lives, but I also enjoy and will expect non-BDSM sex more often. I cannot stress enough that I am looking for a normal relationship that just involves femdom on a regular basis  not a 24/7 FLR. When we arent in kink mode, we are equal and you are my man. I would strongly prefer you be experienced with and know that you enjoy submission. **OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM** I thrive in loving relationships where both parties are equal. We would be a normal couple, would make important decisions jointly, and I would expect chivalry from you. I prefer you to be masculine and confident outside the bedroom. We will do awesome things like hiking, backpacking, watching football, buying a bunch of candy and spending Friday nights watching movies on the couch, etc. **ABOUT ME** Im a DC native itching to get out of here. You need to be local because I am not doing long distance. I went to a big college and work in a field that has nothing to do with my major. I am currently working on another degree (while working full time!) to move on to something more fulfilling. Once I have that degree (a couple of years), I would like to move somewhere in the Pacific Northwest or Colorado or AustinDC is sucking my soul away. I am an upbeat cynic full of sarcasm. Tough on the outside but a softie on the inside. Laidback about most things but a little bossy. Animal lover and rescue volunteer. Backpacker. Im curvy (and I seriously just mean curvy, not fat), but I am currently on a fitness mission. My body tends to change a lot, and you have to be into me in curvy times and fit times. I tend to like more rough around the edges/alternative type guys. Long hair, beards, tattoos. This is not a requirement, but if you are an ultra clean cut preppy guyI likely wont be attracted to you.

I'm an avid writer and reader, and recently I've been getting heavy into H.P Lovecraft. I absolutely love the philosophical underpinnings of his work, and as a horror junkie,his genre hits the sweet spot as well. Besides that, I try my best to be huge into running, and while I'm more introverted than extroverted, the friends I have are the best part of my life. **About me as a dom** I have been domming on and off for three years now, some of it in person, most of it online. Why do I do it? Well, aside from the obvious reality of myself being endlessly kinky, I find that I am able to become profoundly close to the subs I do have, forming a relationship that is intimate and trusting, which is something that I treasure and wish to find again. Besides that, I do this simply because I love to help people make their fantasies become a reality and I believe I can provide a safe and discreet platform. I get my kicks from controlling and unlocking your desires and discovering new things together. I have had several short-time relationships, and a few longer relationships. During every relationship I have learned new things about myself. I have succeeded in new ways, and I have failed in others. I am still learning about myself as a dominant, and I think that's probably the most exciting thing about this. Will I always be perfect? No, absolutely not. Will I hold my position with integrity, and treat you with absolute respect? Absolutely. **What am I into?** *Ownership* Let me make this as clear as possible, I am looking to possess you. I want to slowly take over every part of you. I want to break you down, and build you up again as my own. I'm not a harsh dom, I'm not seeking to tear down your self-worth or change you as a person, but I do want you to be fundamentally owned by me, and therefore I will seek to make it an un-ignorable fundamental fact that you are owned, that you serve my interests and my pleasure, and that you are loved because of it. *Training* Directly related to the last one, I am looking to make you my own, so this will be a commitment. I will train you, I will mold you, I will craft you. You will be trained in how to speak, in how to dress, in how to present yourself, in posture, in respect, how to be gracious, how to be repentant. You will be trained in orgasm control. More than anything, you will be training to put me above yourself in everything you do. *Pain* Yes, I am a bit of a sadist. I love hearing you in pain. I love seeing you in pain. I love glowing welts, and purple bruises. I love to push my subs, I want you to know that you are stronger than you give yourself credit for, and that you can be strong for me. I want you find value in that. I want you to enjoy that. There is nothing that gives me more pride than a sub who pushes herself for my sake. *Some of what I'm into pain-wise* Spanking ,Whipping, Clips/clothespins, Wax, Chemical play (hot-sauce, icy hot, etc.), Predicament bondage/stress positions, Breast torture. *Humiliation* You will be expected to know your place, but sometimes I'm simply going to put you deeper into your place regardless. Embarrassing and difficult tasks, revealing positions, hidden public tasks, body-writing, name-calling. It will be established that I am above you, and it is my proper place, and that you are below me, and that this is your proper place. *Friendship* This doesn't get mentioned enough in advertisements I don't think. Yes, I want to control you, humiliate you, hurt you, expose you, train you, mold you, and dominate you. But more than that, I want a really good friend. Someone who I can chat with after a really long day. Someone who can cheer me up when I need it. I want to grow close to you, and be there for you, and help you through hard days, and harder nights. I want to share movies with you, and listen to music together, and share recipes of our favorite food. This is about so much more than kink, this is about two people coming together. **Who am I looking for?** *Someone compatible with myself* As I said, I want a friend, a partner, and confidante, someone to be there for, and who can be there for me. I can get a lot of people to strip on camera for me, all it takes is a few extra bucks in my pocket (and not even that). What makes this special is the relationship that we form with each other. I aim for this to be one of the best and most fulfilling relationships of your life. I want that, I'm committed to that, and you should be as well. *Someone who is confidently submissive* I want someone who submits because they are fulfilled in it. Because they find strength in it. Because they feel most themselves in it. You are expected to bring your weakness to it and your vulnerabilities, that is expected, that is part of what submission is. But you shouldn't submit out of that weakness, you should submit because it makes you happy. At the end of the day, my one goal as a dom is to have a happy sub. Let's start on that road so we can reach the end of it together. *Someone willing to be vulnerable and honest.* This is huge for me. You can not truly submit to me unless you bring your whole self to me. Eventually you will need to share with me your shortcomings, your fears, your aspirations, and your secrets. Can this be scary? Absolutely. Will it be? No. I am going to create a safe spot for you. A place where you are secure. Where you have nothing to hide. We spend so much of the day hiding ourselves from the people we meet. You deserve a place where you can remove that mask. I hope to be that place for you. *Someone not afraid to be physically intimate* This is a sexual relationship. Let's be sexual. Part of serving me is being my toy. Using your body and your mind for my pleasure. I want to see you. I want to rejoice in your body. I want to see you squirm. I want to see you mark. I want to dress you. I want you to be on your knees, waiting on me, fully exposed and vulnerable. I understand that there are a lot of people who think that this is the entire relationship, and I understand that pursuing this online, you have likely been taken advantage of in the past. You will not be here. I seek to use this vulnerability to create a more real, fun, and intimate submissive environment, where we can explore both of our fantasies in the most potent and fulfilling of settings. You should be willing to give a lot of yourself to me. **Just tying this all together.** As I said before, this is a commitment. You should not do this if you are only looking to get off, if you are simply looking to dip your toes in and get out, or if you aren't willing to sacrifice and change yourself on my behalf. In return, I will give you the best D/s relationship I can possibly give you. That's going to be a lot of effort on both of our ends. It will be given on my end, I also need it to be given on yours. **A note for beginners** What I outlined above is a vision of a complete mature relationship. Some will be able to jump into that more quickly than others. Some will take more time. I am fine with that. If you need to take things a little slower, please know that I am going to work as hard as I can to make an environment that is right for you, and conducive to your growth as a submissive and a person. This is about you as much as it is about me, so we will work to create the right relationship for you. **Are you interested?** Great! Well, I don't want to make messaging me too complicated. So, if you're interested, send me the following. *A bit about yourself: doesn't need to be a novel, but give me a clear idea of who you are as a person. *Your experience as a sub, and what appealed to you about this ad. *Finally recommend me a novel or an album, and tell me your best joke. If you got through this awfully long ad, let me be the first and only to applause. On a serious note though, I spent some time on this ad, so I appreciate each and every person who took the time to absorb it and consider it from the bottom of my heart. "

724,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,(23 Sub for online Dom) sweet and spicy sub looking for a caring but firm dom hand ;),0,2staky,http://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/2staky/23_sub_for_online_dom_sweet_and_spicy_sub_looking/,2015-01-18 18:22:17,"Before you read anything you should understand that I am damaged. If that turns you on or gets you off at my vulnerability, you should fuck off right now. I would like to be crystal clear. I am not at all looking for someone that gets off on vulnerability or preying on weaknesses. My weaknesses are also some of my strengths. I will see threw you. I will call your ass out. I am 23, California born and raised but my heart (and self) currently lives in Borneo. If you dont know where Borneo is, please don't waste my time. I am sassy, sarcastic, blunt and intelligent. I have two degrees. I work my ass off. And selfless to the core. If reading this, I piss you off, then you can also fuck off. I dont want bullshit. I want confidence. I need a dominate that knows what he is doing and a person that is confident in who they are and where theyre going. Because as a submissive and human, I am confident, as should anyone I give myself to. I am seaching for an online relationship given locals and my deepest desires do not play hand and hand (keep in mind I am GMT+8). I dont have many hard limits, and still sorting out where they really start and end. 24/7 is a medium limit at this time. If you are in the ""area"" ( Southeast Asia, or Australia) I am also willing to travel for IRL... and welcome visitors to tie me up and torture me ;) I am looking for an older Dom, or someone who has experience (or enough confidence to ease me). Someone that sees me as an individual and willing to adapt and understand my needs. A dom that really wants a submissive in their heart. Although I sound picky, I am not. I might come off very cold in this but I am not. Im prescreening for all the fuck heads just looking to get off on here. I will try my best to answer everyone, but if you don't give me much to work with I apologize in advance. About me: I have reddish hair, light brown eyes, a few tattoos. I like a lot of things. I do like pain dancing with pleasure. I live a simple life, and mostly spend time with students or animals. I love the water (diving, swimming, fishes, etc.) I am a vegetarian, but not agressive about it. I curse a lot, but usually level headed. The past year living abroad has taught me to slow down, to breathe, to think before I speak. I enjoy traveling. I have been lucky to have free time to do such, and like to meet new places and see new things. I am kind of introvert. Too much people stimulation overwhelms me. I like reading a good book, the news, and relaxing. I like watching movies, or laying in the sun instead of going to a big party. I have a big heart that wants to care about someone. That is the only thing missing in my life right now. About you: You are confident. Reasonably attractive, or at least confident in yourself. You respect women and treat them well. You want to dominate me because you want all of me, not just my body but you also want my mind. You are flexible and patient. You are educated and intelligent, you at least know where Borneo is on a map. You are a kind person with a deeply kinky side. You walk with confidence, to your core you are dominate. You are looking for a friend, a companion and a lover, maybe you are lonely too... you need someone that will always be there for you - to push and challenge you outside of the bedroom. You also have a sense of humor. You make me laugh/smile. Kink and d/s stuff: [I know I am talking a lot. Mainly to filter out the pricks out there, and those that dont like to read very much (I promise I am sweet, I just have to show my tough side now!)] I am not looking for just a play thing. I dont want to be just a toy. I will be whatever you want me to be, your slut, whore, slave, etc. But as a submissive I will only willingly get on my knees for you if you actually take time to get to know me as a person. I believe a great deal in trust and respect. I will give myself with no restraints, allowing you to use me and take me how you please. As long as my dom will take care of me. To know me inside and out. If you are not a caring dom, we will not work. This is also fairly situational, so if youve made it this far reading, we can decide what works best for us... and where lines go and when the go. Submitting and pleasing is what gets me off. Your pleasure is what pleases me most. I need to be hurt, broken down, humiliated, teased, spanked, tortured, whatever gets you off... but build me back up. After care. If you've made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read and sorry if I offended anyone... I want to be used and abused by my dom, but I want you to give me care and attention. If you are interested, please PM me. I will do my best to respond. If you make me laugh or smile you have a good chance. I swear I am a catch. ;) To screen some more or shoe interest please at least answer the following: -why you think we would work well together, inside and outside a d/s relationship -anything I specifically said that you agree with/dont agree with? -a little about yourself... whatever you wish to share -anything else? I promise all interactions I will be nice."

Well, aside from the obvious reality of myself being endlessly kinky, I find that I am able to become profoundly close to the subs I do have, forming a relationship that is intimate and trusting, which is something that I treasure and wish to find again.

I am still learning about myself as a dominant, and I think that's probably the most exciting thing about this. Will I always be perfect? No, absolutely not. Will I hold my position with integrity, and treat you with absolute respect? Absolutely. **What am I into?** *Ownership* Let me make this as clear as possible, I am looking to possess you. I want to slowly take over every part of you. I want to break you down, and build you up again as my own. I'm not a harsh dom, I'm not seeking to tear down your self-worth or change you as a person, but I do want you to be fundamentally owned by me, and therefore I will seek to make it an un-ignorable fundamental fact that you are owned, that you serve my interests and my pleasure, and that you are loved because of it. *Training* Directly related to the last one, I am looking to make you my own, so this will be a commitment. I will train you, I will mold you, I will craft you. You will be trained in how to speak, in how to dress, in how to present yourself, in posture, in respect, how to be gracious, how to be repentant. You will be trained in orgasm control. More than anything, you will be training to put me above yourself in everything you do. *Pain* Yes, I am a bit of a sadist. I love hearing you in pain. I love seeing you in pain. I love glowing welts, and purple bruises. I love to push my subs, I want you to know that you are stronger than you give yourself credit for, and that you can be strong for me. I want you find value in that. I want you to enjoy that. There is nothing that gives me more pride than a sub who pushes herself for my sake. *Some of what I'm into pain-wise* Spanking ,Whipping, Clips/clothespins, Wax, Chemical play (hot-sauce, icy hot, etc.), Predicament bondage/stress positions, Breast torture. *Humiliation* You will be expected to know your place, but sometimes I'm simply going to put you deeper into your place regardless. Embarrassing and difficult tasks, revealing positions, hidden public tasks, body-writing, name-calling. It will be established that I am above you, and it is my proper place, and that you are below me, and that this is your proper place. *Friendship* This doesn't get mentioned enough in advertisements I don't think. Yes, I want to control you, humiliate you, hurt you, expose you, train you, mold you, and dominate you. But more than that, I want a really good friend. Someone who I can chat with after a really long day. Someone who can cheer me up when I need it. I want to grow close to you, and be there for you, and help you through hard days, and harder nights. I want to share movies with you, and listen to music together, and share recipes of our favorite food. This is about so much more than kink, this is about two people coming together. **Who am I looking for?** *Someone compatible with myself* As I said, I want a friend, a partner, and confidante, someone to be there for, and who can be there for me. I can get a lot of people to strip on camera for me, all it takes is a few extra bucks in my pocket (and not even that). What makes this special is the relationship that we form with each other. I aim for this to be one of the best and most fulfilling relationships of your life. I want that, I'm committed to that, and you should be as well. *Someone who is confidently submissive* I want someone who submits because they are fulfilled in it. Because they find strength in it. Because they feel most themselves in it. You are expected to bring your weakness to it and your vulnerabilities, that is expected, that is part of what submission is. But you shouldn't submit out of that weakness, you should submit because it makes you happy. At the end of the day, my one goal as a dom is to have a happy sub. Let's start on that road so we can reach the end of it together. *Someone willing to be vulnerable and honest.* This is huge for me. You can not truly submit to me unless you bring your whole self to me. Eventually you will need to share with me your shortcomings, your fears, your aspirations, and your secrets. Can this be scary? Absolutely. Will it be? No. I am going to create a safe spot for you. A place where you are secure. Where you have nothing to hide. We spend so much of the day hiding ourselves from the people we meet. You deserve a place where you can remove that mask. I hope to be that place for you. *Someone not afraid to be physically intimate* This is a sexual relationship. Let's be sexual. Part of serving me is being my toy. Using your body and your mind for my pleasure. I want to see you. I want to rejoice in your body. I want to see you squirm. I want to see you mark. I want to dress you. I want you to be on your knees, waiting on me, fully exposed and vulnerable. I understand that there are a lot of people who think that this is the entire relationship, and I understand that pursuing this online, you have likely been taken advantage of in the past. You will not be here. I seek to use this vulnerability to create a more real, fun, and intimate submissive environment, where we can explore both of our fantasies in the most potent and fulfilling of settings. *You should be willing to give a lot of yourself to me.* Just tying this all together. As I said before, this is a commitment. You should not do this if you are only looking to get off, if you are simply looking to dip your toes in and get out, or if you aren't willing to sacrifice and change yourself on my behalf. In return, I will give you the best D/s relationship I can possibly give you. That's going to be a lot of effort on both of our ends. It will be given on my end, I also need it to be given on yours. **A note for beginners** What I outlined above is a vision of a complete mature relationship. Some will be able to jump into that more quickly than others. Some will take more time. I am fine with that. If you need to take things a little slower, please know that I am going to work as hard as I can to make an environment that is right for you, and conducive to your growth as a submissive and a person. This is about you as much as it is about me, so we will work to create the right relationship for you. **Are you interested?** Great! Well, I don't want to make messaging me too complicated. So, if you're interested, send me the following. * A bit about yourself: doesn't need to be a novel, but give me a clear idea of who you are as a person. * Your experience as a sub, and what appealed to you about this ad. * Finally recommend me a novel or an album, and tell me your best joke. If you got through this awfully long ad, let me be the first and only to applause. On a serious note though, I spent some time on this ad, so I appreciate each and every person who took the time to absorb it and consider it from the bottom of my heart."

727,vulnerability,BDSMpersonals,23 f4M: Lifestyle slave seeking experienced Master,1,2u5o5h,http://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/2u5o5h/23_f4m_lifestyle_slave_seeking_experienced_master/,2015-01-30 14:04:29,"Hello r/bdsmpersonals! Im a curvy 23 year old traditionally feminine brunette who identifies as a **lifestyle slave, a masochist**, and a sometimes little. I have been involved in the BDSM scene in **Central PA and the MD/DC area** for approximately three years, and have had the luck to attend some of the larger kink conventions on the East Coast. I seek someone to master and conquer me. Someone worthy to hold the title of Master. Of himself, his emotions, and his world. He should have a sadistic streak, and strive to sharpen his mind through learning where and when he can. I am a strong woman in my day-to-day life. My job is demanding. It requires me to be in control, make decisions, and constantly be looking to the future. While I am very good at what I do, and very capable, I dont want to be that person in my relationship. I am looking for an M/s relationship, with the potential to evolve into a romantic relationship should things grow that way. I am fine with the relationship starting online, progressing to phone/Skype calls, but **there MUST be potential for it to move into real life.** I would like to find someone within a three hour drive to make frequent visits possible. **I am not looking for extreme long distance at this time.** Still with me? Great! If youd like to know more of the details, read on. **More about what Im looking for:** **Consistency ** I need someone who is committed to being in an M/s relationship on a lifestyle level. This should be something that comes naturally to you and is a deeply rooted part of your identity. You need to be willing to put the time and effort into making it work, as I am. Because it you make it clear to me that you dont care about rules/protocols/etc., then I wont either. I want someone who wont give me the option of walking all over them. **Authority ** You need to be comfortable making decisions in areas of life that I have given you control over. I need to know, in no uncertain terms, that you in are control of the relationship. That means that when I fall short of the standards we set together, I need you to hold me accountable to whatever consequences we agree on and you feel to be appropriate. **Confidence ** While loving and accepting ourselves as we are is a difficult task, it is one that I have put much work into nurturing. I wish to surround myself with others who are likeminded. Im not saying to have to think youre perfect, or the best at M/s there ever was, but you should be confident in yourself and your skills. You should feel comfortable in your role as a Master and Dominant. **Strength ** While physical strength is certainly nice, the strength of your fortitude and commitment to excellence is what means more to me. You need to be resilient, and not let circumstances beyond your control drag you down (too often, we all have bad days). I need to know that you will fight to protect and keep what is yours. **Open, honest communication ** I expect nothing less. The vulnerability required of both parties in the type of M/s relationship I seek is, in my opinion, one of the deepest and most beautiful things in this world. I live my life authentically and expect the same of my partners. Be who you are, own who you are. Be honest with me, even if you dont think I am going to like what I hear. Im single, and you should be too. **Someone who knows what they want ** Have some idea as to what you see this kind of relationship looking like. Know what you like. Know what you want to try, what youd like to learn. Know where your shortcomings lie. Know yourself and your desires, so that we can make them manifest together. **Someone willing to be part of the scene ** This is non-negotiable for me. I owe nearly all of my closest friends to the BDSM community. I attend munches, classes/demos, and larger conventions. I am looking for someone willing to be involved in this community with me, and preferably someone who is already involved and experience in the public scene. **Someone experienced ** I ask that you have had a relationship of this variety before or done extensive reading on the subject and made an effort to learn about this lifestyle (for example: Sacred Kink: The Eightfold Path of BDSM and Beyond, The New Topping Book, Screw the Roses: Send Me the Thorns, Real Service, The Loving Dominantthe list goes on, I can recommend others). Ideally youve attended classes/demos in the kink community on consent, negotiations, safety, M/s, or the kinks that interest you. **Someone willing to grow and learn together ** The previous paragraph aside, I dont expect you to know everything. I dont pretend to know everything myself. However, I am also not particularly interested in teaching and training someone who knows nothing about this lifestyle. Part of Mastery is knowing your craft. I desire to serve someone who knows and has experience in BDSM as a lifestyle both inside and outside the bedroom. **Someone with ambition ** Dont rest on your laurels. Always be someone striving to better himself, and bring out the best in others, pushing them to be their very best. I have high standards. I expect to be held to high standards in return. Have ambition, goals and dreams for your life. Believe that you are worthy of success. **A creative and devious mind.** **More about me:** I graduated from college last May, and I am out on my own, financially independent and working in my first real job. I work in the legal field, but if youd like more details than that, youll have to ask privately. I identify as pansexual, in that I experience attraction to people of all genders. However, I seek a romantic relationship with someone who identifies as male and is open to me and potentially us playing with other people of various genders, namely genderqueer/fluid and female individuals. As far as my personality goes, Im an MBTI ISFJ: Introverted, Sensing, Feeling, Judging. I love to laugh more than anything; lifes to short to be serious and intense all the time. That doesnt mean that I dont take the serious things in life seriously. I generally live a pretty carefree existence though. I seek harmony and serenity in my life; I dislike confrontation. Im a compassionate friend and a great listener. I am deeply in touch with my own feelings and the feelings of others. Im responsible and detail-oriented. Im punctual to a fault. I abide by the If youre 15 minutes early youre on time, if youre on time, youre late philosophy. However, I tend to be pretty laid back and rarely expect that of other people in my life. I tend to be pretty carefree most of the time. I try not to worry about things any more than I have to. I like to look on the bright side and am much more likely to see and emphasize why things will work out positively than I am to dwell on all the reasons something cant happen. I believe in honest, open communication. Im no liar. I live authentically, and I expect the same of my partner. I have no secrets with those I care about and trust with this part of me. Vulnerability is a huge part of the type of M/s dynamic I seek. Like any slave, Im a definite people pleaser. I enjoy and take great joy in making others happy. I love to talk to people, and I find them fascinating. I can find things in common to talk about with almost anyone. I like to think I give off a very friendly and welcoming vibe when I first meet people. I like to think Im somewhat adventurous and I love trying and learning new things. Im success driven and action oriented. I always strive to be my best and better myself whenever I can. Spiritually, I believe in woo and energy, and how these things manifest in my scenes. I have been practicing and studying Shamanism for two years now. My practice is very eclectic and heavily influenced by Northern-Tradition Shamansim, namely Raven Kaldera, Lee Harrington, and those who have mentored and facilitated the ordeal rituals I owe much of my growth to. Deer is my totem. Im also not particularly a morning person. Mornings are hard. Coffee is the only solution. I enjoy a wide variety of activities, including but not limited to the following: reading (Harry Potter, the Kushiels Legacy series, Lee Harringtons Sacred Kink, and the Black Jewels trilogy are some favorites, but there are really too many to list), cooking (Im skilled in the kitchen, cooking/baking, you name it), crocheting (mostly square things like scarves and blankets), video games (Dragon Age: Inquisition is my current obsession), board games (Cards Against Humanity, Carcasonne, and Small World are favorites), American football (go Cowboys!) and fantasy football (I won my league regular season and playoffs this year), riding rollercoasters (Hershey Park is close by, but Id love to see Cedar Point, and travelling and camping (especially at a particular kink-friendly campground in Eastern Maryland). Some favorite movies: * Harry Potter * Disney * Football related films * Leonardo DiCaprios bodyof work * Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Trilogy (both the Swedish and American versions) * Studio Ghibli * Up * How to Train Your Dragon * Despicable Me 1&amp;2 * Gone Girl * Dirty Dancing Some favorite TV shows: * Game of Thrones * Supernatural * Breaking Bad * Dexter * Archer * Bobs Burgers * Orange Is the New Black * Buffy the Vampire Slayer * American Horror Story * Downton Abbey * Shameless My eclectic musical tastes: * Blink 182 * Zac Brown Band * Tyler Hilton * Passion Pit * Broadway Soundtracks (rock musicals, in particular Rent and Spring Awakening) * Good Charlotte * Bowling for Soup * Lady Antebellum * Taking Back Sunday * Death Cab for Cutie * Mumford and Sons **More about my kinks:** I identify as a service oriented slave. This can be sexual service, domestic service, and personal service. I have a great set of skills and I like to be useful to my Master. I like things that reinforce my position as less than or beneath my Master. I gain great joy in relinquishing control to someone else, following orders, and being toyed with for amusement. I enjoy a variety of impact play, and often play hard to the point of bruises and welts (though I dont always need play to be this hard). I love the feel of rope and being in its embrace. I like sharp things: knifeplay and needles are both things I have a bit of experience with. I also enjoy leather, and have been bootblacking for two years. I enjoy boot worship and bootplay, as well as humiliation and degredation (in private, or involving fully consenting people and a kink-friendly audience). Consensual non-consent is fun as well. My limits are as follows: scat, vomit, anything involving non-consenting individuals, public humiliation, punching in the stomach/sternum/chest, organ laceration, amputation, insects/arachnids, anything in or around my eyes, and shaving my head. I prefer to negotiate on a we will do x, y, and z basis at the beginning of a relationship instead of a Everything but r is on the table. I find that communication is much less likely to break down in that regard. If youd like to know more, just ask, or I can point you to my Fetlife fetish list. **Contacting me:** Feel free to PM me. Im comfortable sharing my Skype name (for text chat only, initially) and my Fetlife username to facilitate communication between us. **I ask that you contact me as an equal. Until I choose to, I do not submit to you. Address me as a human being worthy of respect. Please refrain from sending fantasies, dick pics, and one line messages that merely ask me for pictures or usernames. Intelligence is a huge turn on. Use proper grammar and spelling, tell me a bit about yourself, ask me questions, point out what specifically caused you to reply to my ad (or merely demonstrate that you have read it), start a conversation that has the potential to go somewhere.** I will take the time to reply to those who invest the time and effort to message me in this way. I look forward to hearing from you! Woo, congrats for making it this far! "

I'm happy to give anything a go once to see if I like it, but definite hard limits are anything to do with blood/knife play and branding. Outside of kink I'm pretty easy going, love nothing more than going out for a meal (I'm a bit of a foodie) or to the cinema, but equally happy just cuddling on the sofa with a bowl of popcorn and a film, I work in live entertainment but also dabble in cybersecurity on the side, so you could say I'm a bit of a geek. So, if anything there has piqued your interest, drop me a message! I would ideally like to swap pics quite early on, just so we both know who we're talking to! :)"

I guess I should start by introducing myself. Online I go by Jim, though thats not my real name. Im 19, currently going to college for Cybersecurity, and my interests include Gaming, Music, Cute stuff, Anime/Manga, Comics, Reading, and Writing. I collect vinyl records and I run a pastel pink blog on tumblr. I enjoy gaming, and I own a PC, PS4, and Nintendo Switch! I live on the east coast of the United States, though Im open to someone from anywhere, so long as were compatible! Im a submissive person by nature, a very laid back, go-with-the-flow type. Though I can be dominant when asked or when its required, submissiveness feels more natural. In terms of kinks, Im into md/lb, gentle femdom, teasing, spanking, biting, cosplay/roleplay sex, and Im curious about pet play. I like to feel loved and treated like a special treasure, though sometimes I like it a little rough! My hard limits are no bodily fluids (scat, watersports, blood, etc.), no cutting, no sounding, and nothing that leaves permanent marks. Im looking for a domme/owner(?) that is gentle and caring. Someone that can pamper me with affection, but isnt afraid to get rough. I really enjoy cuddling and getting headpats, and affection in general. Its a turn on for me! So if you enjoy that type of thing, Im your boy! Id prefer someone within the age range of 18-29. I also have a preference for curvy, thick women. Though Im more flexible with body type! Im looking for something online, and if we like and trust each other enough, hopefully irl too! If youd like to exchange pictures, Im okay with that! Though people have told me I dont look like how I sound. If I sound like your type, shoot me a message! I prefer to use Discord as a primary means of communication, though Im open to kik, Skype, or reddit DMs!"
732,cybersecurity,BDSMpersonals,[23M4M] Poly Dom Looking For a Sub to Cherish and Control,5,7bpi7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/7bpi7a/23m4m_poly_dom_looking_for_a_sub_to_cherish_and/,2017-11-09 10:57:55,"Hello there! Thanks for checking in and checking out my post. I've had some luck on here finding a partner before, so I decided to try my luck again and see if I can find anyone. The short version is that I'm looking for a male sub to get to know, preferably something longer-term, but a shorter-term relationship is also acceptable. As for what I'm looking for specifically, well... Before I get too far into this post, I'll should mention that I am poly. I have another partner I've been with for over a year, and they and I live together. I don't expect my partner to be poly, but they need to be comfortable with me being poly and having another partner in my life. As for what I'm looking for specifically in a partner, well, I'm looking for something either short or long term. Long distance is fine with me, as is something local. I'd prefer local, but I'm not that picky about location. I wouldn't mind something online either. I'm fairly open about the nature and length of the relationship. One thing I will say is that I need a connection with my partner for even a short-term relationship to work. If the only thing we have is a sexual dynamic, eventually I'll lose interest and things will come apart. I'm not sexual all the time, and I need a partner I can talk to outside of sex. Playing a game of Overwatch before bed, talking about the latest book you've read, or just talking about your day at work, I need to get to know my sub outside the dynamic for things to last even just short-term. Mind you, I don't expect us to have everything in common, and I love learning about new hobbies and interests. But we would need at least a few things in common, and you'd need to be open to talking to me about your hobbies if I don't understand or know about them. I would prefer my sub to be around my age, but that's not a requirement. I tend to prefer more feminine men, but being pansexual, the more important thing is having an connection with my sub. I would like to be able to call or Skype with my sub every now and then, and I prefer to have a fairly active dialog with my sub. Especially if we're doing something long-distance, I need lots of communication, both for playing out scenes and helping stay close to my sub. I don't mind drinking and casual drug usage. Harder drugs make me nervous and excessive consumption of any substance is a turn off for me. I don't like the smell of cigarette smoke, so I'd prefer my sub to either not smoke, or not smoke around me. Now, as for a bit about me, well, my name is Robert. I'm 23 years old, and am currently living in West Virginia. I don't plan on moving too far from here in the near future, but am willing to travel and visit a partner if it is warranted. I'm about 5'9, average build, brown eyes and mid-length brown hair that I'm planning on growing out. I am a huge, massive nerd, and my geeky hobbies and interests define a large part of my personalty and interests. My main area of interest is tabletop gaming. I play in 3 games and run one, and have dozens of source books and completed character sheets on my computer. I also love to play video games and spend a fair amount of time gaming on my PC. Aside from gaming, I also love to read, and will read just about anything and everything, though I prefer to read Sci-Fi and horror. I also love music and going to live shows, and have fond memories of nearly every concert I've been to. I also like to learn and study for fun, with a penchant for history, religion and philosophy. My brain is like a very picky sponge, and while I struggle to keep track of birthdays and holidays, I can recall from memory much of what I read or study. I have been going to college off and on for a few years and eventually plan on getting some kind of degree, probably in cybersecurity. At the moment, I'm doing seasonal work while I look for a more permanent position that will let me go back to school. BDSM-wise, I am in many ways a typical Dom. I enjoy being in control and dictating as much of my subs lives as possible. I like to write rules and schedules, have commands and phrases that my sub learns, and control my sub as much as they want to be controlled. I am very much a big softie though, and while I control my sub, I also tend to cherish them. The relationships that are most fulfilling to me as a Dom are relationships where I can have a session or a scene with my sub, then fall into aftercare and lavish them with praises and affection, before curling up to talk about whatever catches our collective fancy. Kink-wise, I'm into near about everything on some level, and am willing to work with a sub on near about everything. I have some favorite kinks of mine though. Rough and aggressive sex, choking and slapping my partner, orgasm control and denial, spanking with various implements, rules and behavior control/modification, humiliation and degradation, chastity devices, and pet play all stand out as the main kinks that pop up in my kink-life. I also have been a Daddy Dom for several partners and if that's something you wish to explore, I'd be happy to indulge you in that regard. And I think that about covers everything really! Thanks for reading this far if you have, and thanks for checking out my post regardless. If this peeked your interest, I'd love to hear from you. Regardless, I hope everyone who visits this post has a good night and I hope to hear back from some of y'all soon."
