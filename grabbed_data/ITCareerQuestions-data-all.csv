0,vulnerability,ITCareerQuestions,A cautionary tale for those who are looking for new jobs right now.,1,ieufyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ieufyw/a_cautionary_tale_for_those_who_are_looking_for/,2020-08-23 11:14:46,"bit of a long post, but if I can help at least one person, it's worth it. Bit of background about my situation first. 7 years of IT experience, the last 3 have been working on lots of security and automation initiatives - vulnerability management, Identity and Access Management, some cloud app support, some migration work, lots of process automation (powershell and python), etc. I have an IT degree, am about to start on my Masters, and have a stack of certs. Overall, I have a great resume and can pretty much always guarantee myself interviews if I start applying. Been wanting to jump my way into an actual security position (rather than a non-security position where I get to work on some security projects). so I've been applying to security analyst and security engineer roles. In about 2 months of applying, I applied to about 80-100 jobs - willing to relocate, so they were all over the place. Of those 80-100, I ended up with 22 interviews. of the 22 interviews, I got 7 offers. One of these was local for me, and the other 6 were out of state and would have required relocation. So I spent a ton of time researching the areas, cost of living, and market value for the role in each specific state/city. I found that all 7 of them were offering me 10-15% less than what the average market value was for that job, along with not offering any relocation assistance... I was cool with that part because I was planning on not having to rely on help to relocate anyway, but in addition to them going cheap on the salary, they just didn't seem like good offers. So I countered every single one of them - letting them know the research that I did and what I felt the position was worth compared to the market rate in the area. I also let them know that I had multiple other offers, but didn't tell them where or what the offers were. EVERY SINGLE ONE adjusted my offer to exactly the market rate that I had researched, but not a single one offered me a dollar more than that ""average"". This told me that they're trying to get people as cheap as possible thinking that we're desperate during the pandemic. I ended up declining every one of the offers rather than try to negotiate again. They offered me the market rate, and I think my mistake was not asking for more, but I just didn't trust them to pay me what I was worth anymore. I'm not in a position where I need to get out of where I am - just looking for good opportunities to further my career, and I do have a good job at a good company already. I guess moral of the story is: &amp;#x200B; Know what you're worth, and don't be afraid to negotiate. It can be tempting to accept something when you get an offer, but I'm definitely getting the vibe that they're probably low-balling everybody right now. Do your research of the area and the job you're searching for. There's absolutely nothing wrong with asking for more than their offer. worst case scenario, they say no, but more than likely, it won't make them rescind their offer, unless you ask for some insane amounts. Careful out there my friends!"

I've been unemployed since December. I was a contractor who did too good of a job with a vulnerability project and what was an open ended project concluded early. No biggie, I had interviews lined up quickly and things were going well! Enter February. First two interviews went great. Was told I would hear back within days. I was then notified both positions were being closed (two separate companies) and unfilled. Then the pandemic hit. I have interviewed for 27 positions. I've had 6 final interviews. I've landed none of them. I've had my resume looked over by friends in HR, Tech, recruiting, etc. I've done interview prep, mock questions, etc. I've been doing this constantly since December in order to land a position. Hell, I interviewed for 2 positions a month ago, was told I would hear within a week, nothing so far. Today finally broke me and honestly, I just want to cry. I had a screen call. They asked the normal basic questions then a few tech questions. It went like this. ""How do you create a guest in VMWare?"" Been a while give me a sec to think. ""If you can't answer a basic question and you haven't worked in 7 months I don't think you'll be a fit."" Call was ended super fast and I just felt crushed. I worked in VMware for 5 years. I haven't touched it in over a year so I had to recall some information from the dredges of my brain. And that hesitation ended a potential fantastic job. I know this isn't an IT question. It's just a rant and complaining. I'm just so tired and feeling helpless. I just...I don't know. I feel like a failure. Thanks for reading this."

6,vulnerability,ITCareerQuestions,Communication with your managers,1,gzx80y,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/gzx80y/communication_with_your_managers/,2020-06-10 07:55:40,"Possibly long post, multiple questions-&gt; I have a couple of questions to help me understand how I can communicate better with my manager. This may be different for everyone but the usual suggestions from books and Google didn't work for me. I am curious about how I can communicate my pain points effectively to a manager that is always busy. 1.How often do you talk to your manager/supervisor? 2.Do your one-on-one meetings revolve around solving your doubts on tasks or do you also discuss anything else? (My manager just focuses on what blocks I have for my current tasks) 3.How do you tell your manager that you are interested in a particular type of work so you would be happy if majority of your tasks align with that type of work? I am working on development of security tools and also working on risk assessments, threat intelligence and vulnerability management. I dread working on development and love working on other security based tasks. How do I convey this to my manager? I am afraid this would make me come across as 'not a team player'. But the development of security tools just sucks out the energy from me, and it is also affecting my performance. 4.How do you deal with a somewhat new manager? All of my past managers had some experience with handling employees but this one is relatively new to the role of a manager and most of the times I have to take initiative to make sure that I am actively communicating with him and he is aware of the tasks I am working on. In a way I am lucky that he doesn't micromanage my tasks but on the other hand I would really like for some support and direction as I am relatively new to the corporate world and not exactly experienced at taking decisions. I almost feel guilty for asking him so many questions. 5.How do you talk to your manager about workload? I feel like I am being given a lot of tasks with clashing deadlines which is making me miss almost all deadlines. Plus since my manager is busy and my team is small, no one has time to help me with my questions. Also, my productivity is affected thanks to the never ending to-do list. I am confused if this is the job for me, it has been keeping me busy for long hours everyday (even on weekends) so I don't have time to worry about anything else going on in the outside world but it has also made me lose interest in my work which I was very passionate about a few months back. Thank you all for your help!"

I felt like I've been having some bad luck when it comes to jobs. I've applied to multiple retail places since high school when I graduated in 2015, I got my first official retail-tech job and an internship in 2019. I live in the D.C. area so I honestly don't get why it's been like this. Now I graduated with a Cybersecurity degree and have about 10 months exp in retail-tech, and 7 months exp from my data entry internship. I've listed my cybersecurity coursework and projects on my resume. I've had my SOC Lead classmate look at it and he gave me a mock interview and said I passed but would need to brush up on my ports and crypto. I honestly don't get it, it's frustrating to have applied to more than a 100 jobs and internships, and your peers around you are getting into places. i have one friend who's a Cyber Threat Analyst for Verizon, another one in Booz Allen, another one in General Dynamics. I've even modified my resume several times with the help of my SOC lead classmate. What I'm doing now is studying a little bit everyday to take the Security+, I bought my voucher and plan to take the exam soon, and then I'd like to pursue an AWS cert since most organizations and the government are migrating to the cloud. Ideally, I'd like to be an I.T. Auditor, Vulnerability Manager, or work in SOC like my classmate and stay part-time at my retail place since they're an environment that's hard to come by."
9,vulnerability,ITCareerQuestions,1st Contract Negotiations,1,hdhn01,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/hdhn01/1st_contract_negotiations/,2020-06-22 10:16:08,"Throwaway as my actual account contains some personal posts as well... Some back story is needed here. I was hired into my current company as a Tier I Security Analyst from my University's Co-Op program. (This is very important for later.) I have a year left in my BCS before I graduate. I'm a Tier I only by Title and Pay honestly. Tier I strictly handles tickets unless you're being consider for promotion; at which point you're moved to Tier II and given a Client to oversee as (acting) SME. Successful management of your client leads to being made Tier III, where you get more clients and (depending on your knowledge) special projects. Tier I is never consulted for special projects, VA Planning (or Pentests) or DFIR. I currently hold no formal certifications outside of CCNA but have my CISSP and OSCP in the works. I'm also looking to get certified in GREM and GCFE. The hope is by the time I graduate I'll have written my CISSP (pending the practical/experience portion) and completed by OSCP. &amp;#x200B; ======================= That brings me to my responsibilities as a 'Tier I'. Outside of normal Tier I duties (tickets), I'm currently deployed to one of our client sites to help manage their Security Infrastructure. I'm effectively their SME by the admission of my boss and their actual SME (who usually defers to my judgement). I decommission dated servers, manage security patches, suggest (and occasionally implement) firewall changes for improved detection. I do this in consultation with their IT Department. Of course I'm also involved in ensuring downtime is minimized, and if the decommission calls for spinning a new one up in it's place, also porting over updated software and data. If I'm not doing that I can be found sitting in my office attacking the network to patch more security holes. To date I've patched dozens of vulnerabilities (old &amp; recently disclosed ones) that would've caused millions (if not 10's of millions) in damage. All levels of this clients IT Structure are thoroughly impressed. Typically client's sign a contract that states they cannot poach personnel from my company. However, with my internship ending soon, they can offer me a job. Rumour from the Tier III's I work with at the client site is they want me full-time. The starting salary for them is nearly $80,000 with top end nearing $100,000, 6 weeks PTO and full health, dental etc. I've got three great references from their IT Team. I'll note that my director (boss) is more then aware of this and has openly admitted he's terrified of them offering me a job. I designed a small (but highly-scalable) project for our small clients. I oversee the management and patching of those systems in addition to the routine script patching needed for it's vendor-supplied software (those fixes are temporary until officially patched). I co-developed a new remote Vulnerability Assessment system that's actively deployed. I oversee the SOC side of that project, everything else is managed by one of our Company's Sr. Technical Architects. (We've cross trained each other though). The documentation for the first project was written and released by me. The documentation for the second project was mostly done by the Technical Architect with the SOC-Specific functionality written by me. I plan and execute most of our remote Vulnerability Assessments. I've led two adhoc DFIR cases, one was for a C-Level Executive of a multi-billion company. I've been recognized numerous times by my director for outstanding work. I was recognized by 'my client's' IT Director once for outstanding work. Most notably though, I was formally recognized by our COO in a client meeting (with all our clients management present). That recognition was also extended via email to our entire company. I've received two performance related bonuses in addition to the yearly bonus that I also qualified for. My sit down meetings with my University (and Director) were marked with high praise and highest possible score. I'm also being offered a chance to interview for a Fortune 50 company within their RED team through my Father. He works in the company's IT Team. I've been on my calls before talking about our stuff and his security team overhead some of the stuff I was talking about. My father isn't afraid of recognizing my work and has mentioned some of my accomplishments to them (notably in very vague details as not to compromise client's security). Starting salary for them is close to $80,000 (going into the 150,000+ at their top end), and that's before I get into stocks, yearly bonuses, PTO and their healthcare plans. My director is not aware of that. =================== This all being said, I know my company's HR department is not great. They're very likely going to offer me a Tier I position making $50,000 a year. Our department is still reasonably new, small, and can't really afford another Tier II or III salary. But it's a lot more complicated then that. One of my life long dreams is to move to a different country. I can't work for my client because the nature of their organization means they can't be a multi-national. The company I currently work for is North American based, but the parent company is world-wide with offices in every continent. The company my father works for is also multinational with an office in the specific city I want to live in. My concern at this point is I don't have anything concrete from our client nor the company my father works for. I can delay signing the upcoming contract until I've completed my degree, but I personally think that looks extraordinarily unprofessional. I'm leaning towards waiting on anything from either the client or the company my father works for. Thoughts &amp; Advice? Sorry for the scramble-brain post..."

Got into more user administration stuff - onboarding/offboarding, AD group access, some exchange mailbox access and setup. I eventually learned powershell on my own and started automating as much as I could - automated the entire onboard/termination process along with lots of other smaller tasks (AD group adds, creating groups, etc). this led to being the admin for a third-party IAM solution. I work a lot with the RBAC, configuring/troubleshooting the application connectors, etc. through this project, I've learned some basic SQL querying, basic JSON, learned how to use REST APIs, etc - all things I didn't normally get to touch. I also handle configuring user accounts on our Linux systems and help with vulnerability scanning (Nessus), but unfortunately don't get to do much more than that as far as servers go - engineers where I work are insanely protective and not willing to help anybody learn anything. As far as certs, i have a shitload of CompTIA certs (A+, Net+, Sec+, Cloud+, Linux+/LPIC-1, Project+), and then I have my AWS Sysops Administrator, a CIW Web Development cert, and my ITIL foundations cert. Every one of these has done nothing for me - I got them when I was newer in IT and didn't know what I wanted to do. I'm down to my final 3 courses for my Bachelor's degree in IT - my program was pretty cloud and sysadmin focused. will be finishing that up this spring. I'm familiar with agile setups, RSA Administration, documentation creation/updating, etc. I know python at a basic level as well but don't have much real-world experience there.

I work my ass off where I am, and it's become clear that they have no intentions of ever moving me up. they give me new projects here and there, only because I spend months begging for them. I'm more than qualified for the ""engineer"" positions that they have, but they have a history of losing their best people due to never giving anybody raises or promotions.

So there isn't a lot of manager presence and A LOT of cross-team collaboration required. * Provide audio/visual support for all rooms and organize vendors for repairs, replacements or requests. * Recommend hardware, and organize &amp; deploy hardware refreshes. * Support all board meetings and first triage for VIP staff (Director or higher) * Upgrade all workstations to Windows 10 (over 900 machines, with many unique departments and applications) * Troubleshoot initial implementation of the CIS security benchmark GPO for Windows 10 and report on issues. * Research, implement, deploy and maintain a new on-prem MDM solution for Windows-based PCs (Product owner), and maintain an additional on-prem MDM for OSX, iOS and Android. * Create and maintain 4 standard machine images with up-to-date Windows updates, and driver packages. * Create and maintain all deployable applications packages for the majority of the business. * Vulnerability remediation. We receive monthly reports of application vulnerabilities on workstations and need to evaluate their legitimacy. Afterwhich we decide to either delete it, package an update and process an exemption. * Maintain inventory management for all assets (user assignments, asset locations, asset tagging and tracking) with yearly manual audits. * Create shareable KCS-level knowledge articles for all new implementations, and process changes regarding workstations. * Rebuild department workstations after building changes or department moves. On top of these regular tasks there were also lengthy side projects such as creating custom restrictive profiles for mobile devices in multiple departments, and providing tech demos of these profiles to senior staff and team managers. This is the first time I've worked outside of the support desk/batch monitoring environment and in a more hands-on role, so I'm wondering if this is a realistic/normal workload expectation for a 'desktop support' position... I have a sneaking suspicion a lot of this falls under a much higher paid category. My salary is 59K Canadian, or 42K US. What do you think?"

I literally do all things security for this company. Manage our EDR solution, SIEM tool, vulnerability management, patch management, cybersecurity training, the list goes on....My boss is flexible when it comes to using PTO or not. If its just a couple hours for a doctors appt, no need to burn my PTO hours. Other employees at the company are great and easy to get along with. The benefits are top notch as the company pays for health insurance 100% for both me and my spouse. Commute is about 10 minutes one-way. &amp;#x200B; Current job cons: My boss is a jack-ass. No body gets along with him except for me, and I have to fake it most of the time. I have no room to move up unless my boss gets fired or finds another job. I'm not even sure what he does on a daily basis because I do everything. My only path to more money at the current company is a 3-5% COL raise that could occur yearly. &amp;#x200B; New job: All the reviews I read online about the company are great. I can accrue more PTO in the first year than at the current company. The cyber security department is more mature with a clear structure/path for growth within the department. The pay is a couple dollars more per hour than I am making now but their health insurance will cost me about $3,000 more. After benefits/healthcare are figured in, I will make $800 per year less than I currently do. Commute is about 25 minutes, one way. &amp;#x200B; Am I crazy for thinking about accepting the offer? If only to get a chance to land a better boss and a clear path for promotion? I keep thinking that I am only 4 months into the current position and maybe I should just milk it for all the experience I can get and then jump to another company for a pay increase. Thoughts?"

Can management Cybersecurity and technical Cybersecurity end up making the same kind of income in the long run? 2. If I dont hate the compliance side of things is it a good career? 3. Do Cybersecurity consultant companies offer RMF and compliance work as well? (Just curious) 4.

Days consist of picking up tickets via ManageEngine Service Desk Plus. Phone calls arent a big part of the day. Id say its 80/20 split between tickets/emails and phone calls. Usually its really old end users that call. Examples of tickets include: - Accessing clients domain controller to add/remove/edit users from their active directory. Very minor powershell use, mostly just delta sync on certain setups. - Adding/removing/editing licenses and permissions to users via O365 Admin page. Minor powershell use relevant to this, such as specific permissions (granting a user access to another users Outlook calendar but not their mailbox). - Remote screen share with users to troubleshoot random little things like printer or application specific issues. Network drive mappings. - Using admin tools in our Endpoint Protection software to analyze alerts or prompt scans on clients devices remotely. Due to COVID, I actually got my feet wet in the following: - VPN/RDP setups for users working from home. - Using Kaseya to remotely access user workstations at quarantined office buildings. So its been a wild couple months of having absolutely zero experience in IT to just diving in and getting competent at all these little aspects of IT. My thing is, I dont want to be stuck as IT Support for years on end. Ive read that it is difficult to get out of support, but I felt like I had to take this opportunity to get my foot in the door. Im being paid more than what I see on average for this type of tier 1 work (salaried in the 40s), so Im grateful to still have a job during this outbreak. Im 3 semesters away from wrapping up an MIS degree, and have zero certs, but Im trying to carve a roadmap to stay motivated here. I wont pretend I have a passion for IT. Im enjoying most of the work so far, but I wouldnt say Im passionate about it. With that said, the field that interests me the most would be Cybersecurity. Im interested in the idea of protecting clients networks/devices from threats someday and testing out their vulnerability if that makes sense. Whats the proper move/roadmap certs wise? How soon after attaining said certs should I leave this MSP? How will my MIS degree help career wise?

They needed bodies in jobs and there I was. What I noticed is we all lacked essential core fundamentals on how alot of this works. We used tools and software with very little understanding of what they were doing. So here I am.

My interests are in AWS, \*inux and I would eventually want to start a very small consulting business or work as a solutions specialist in some capacity. My gut feeling is to go CCNA, AWS CSA &gt; AWS SA as I really enjoyed using AWS when I did it for the mil. Also, AWS is making HUGE leaps into the gov sector (minus lost contract to MS Azure recently). I have tried the OSCP route and feel very overwhelmed with the sheer amount of general computing knowledge needed to really break into that field. These types of skills seem very popular, but I dont know of many actual businesses that would pay for this kind of work as many of them seem to only want security once they are already in trouble. Its a much harder sell as a service or as a skillset for that matter as there is little to no monetary ROI for companies that invest in security. \---------------------------------------------------------- Anyways, any suggestions would be greatly helpful.

I was recently told it may be extended as long as 3 months due to COVID-19. Going into this position, I knew there was a possibility of this 'probationary' period being open-ended; I specifically voiced this concern and was given the 3 week time frame. I may be jumping the gun a bit, but I want to update my resume, as I'm not convinced that there won't be another excuse at the end of the 3 month period.

I was hoping someone here could guide me in the right direction as to a proper job title (and hopefully one that doesn't conjure up a more extreme image than what is actually being achieved). My responsibilities are: * Routine patching/updating of everyday software (Chrome, Office, etc.) * Routine OS patching (W7, 8.1, 10) * Emergency security patching (0days, etc.) * Generate reports on efficacy of patching * Packaging new software for distribution * Building enterprise images to be deployed to client endpoints * Deploying image to on-prem servers for branches to perform local network re-imaging * Configuring on-prem servers to deploy image (via MDT) * Handling escalations from Help Desk / Desktop Support * Infrequent escalations from client's VIPs * Clean up and update client's self-service software distribution catalog I appreciate any help you might be able to provide. I understand that job titles can very from company to company and field to field, but I'm just trying to get a push in the right direction if possible.

Id like to get some thoughts on them. Background: I am an Emergency Manager in the Military. I have experience in Emergency Operations Center management, emergency operations planning, Command and Control, hazard/threat assessment, vulnerability assessment, (under a different framework). I have managed large training, exercise programs supervised up to 15 personnel and led teams of up to 40 in programs or events. I have managed several other large programs and many projects of various scales. I am later in my career and within 5 years till retirement eligibility. Education: I have a bachelor's in Emergency Management and have just started a masters program in Cyber Security with a concentration in operations. The degree has a bridge program for those with prior nontechnical degrees. IT experience: All hobby experience. I have a basic level of experience with windows, Linux, mac, basic Python and C+ skills. I have recently bought a bunch of used enterprise equipment for a home lab. Juniper gateway, switches, 2 HP gen 8 servers. I have been learning ESXi, Proxmox, XCP-ng, VLAN, and others as I go. I plan to set up a pen testing lab on one of the HPs to practice red and blue team skills. I'm also learning Kali and its tools.

Civilian job in IT or emergency management or whatever I can find. \- Pros: awesome opportunity, real word experience, free training, TS clearance. \- Cons: Part time (have to find another job), huge (not total) loss of retirement benefits (different system, I could possible make it up, but it's not guaranteed) (I'd be 4 years from a pretty good pension at the time I leave) Option 2: Stay active duty emergency management. Finish Masters in Cyber Security. Learn more as a hobby. Get certs. Retire. Try to get a job. \- Pros: Better retirement benefit. \- Cons: Missed training/hands on opportunity. No real word experience with IT. I'll have to move again could be a good place, could be bad. Delay start of IT career. Is the hands on and amazing training opportunity worth losing out an a whole lot of retirement pension? I'd need to get into a 6 figure position pretty early to make the math work. Could 5 years or cyber warfare experience, a Masters, and a TS get me there? If I go with option 2 for the stability, what can I do in the next 5 years outside of school to add to my resume if I don't go into an IT position? I'm thinking bug bounties, CTFs, or small scale freelance work... is that a thing?."

What I'm struggling with now is what to do instead. My biggest interest is in security - I'm very concerned about companies' (especially financial institutions) vulnerability to cyber-attacks and would like to contribute to defending against those threats. I'm just not sure about which role is best to get into this area, whether it be IT, sysadmin, Pen Tester, etc. Or even what certifications to get for a security job (I have a Bachelors in Computer Science). I have spoken to someone I know who works in the area of IT and he said that it's best to go with what is currently in demand in the industry (Cloud/DevOps according to him) rather than what I'm suggesting.

I was wondering if it would be useful to someone in my position. Currently I am a software developer working mostly on HR related software. I have read some material on cybersecurity mostly in terms of XSS, and SQL injection and know how to program. My goal with taking this course would be to: 1. Do a review of my knowledge. Perhaps there are things I have forgotten and could refresh. 2. Learn new techniques. Learning anything new is always good. 3. Have a certificate that I can put on my resume. I have worked with my employer's cybersecurity department and they do security reviews. They would run scan on software and then tell us what vulnerability are there, assign priority, and then tell us to fix it. Frankly, that scanning procedureal aspect of the cybersecurity job isn't that appealing to me. I would prefer to internalize that security knowledge so that when I can write code that isn't vulnerable, so cybersecurity to me is more of a means than an end. What do you think? Are there different types of cybersecurity certificates? Just want a way to analyze if the certificate will be useful. &amp;#x200B; Paul"
43,vulnerability,ITCareerQuestions,"4 months, 304 job applications, and 27 interviews later, I finally got a job. A retrospective, and some advice for job hunters:",1,e7ihlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/e7ihlq/4_months_304_job_applications_and_27_interviews/,2019-12-08 06:15:40,"I got let go from my previous position, and have been on the job hunt ever since. For context: * Been in IT for the better part of a decade * Background in information security, vulnerability management, previously built risk/vulnerability management program, incident response, application control and whitelisting, SOC work, and working on penetration testing skills * CISSP, CCSP, SSCP, Security+, CEH, working on OSCP * Bachelors in CyberSec Advice for job hunters (especially if you're new to all this): 1. Apply for *everything.* Especially nowadays, where the job market can be really shaky for a lot of people, apply to as many jobs as you can find. Linkedin, Ziprecruiter, Indeed, Dice, Google, your network contacts, shotgun your resume out there. Why? 1. Worst thing they can do is say ""no"". 2. If you end up with multiple interviews running concurrently, and one of them asks if you're actively interviewing or have offers coming, you can easily say ""Yes."" This will, in my experience, lead to much faster results, as you'll either get told ""no"" faster, or if they like you, give you an interview or a counter offer faster. 2. Tailor your resume and cover letter to each job and application. Yes, for as much as you may be shotgunning your resume out there, customize it to each job. Do your research, find out what the company is looking for, and highlight relevant experience you have in your resume. This includes: 1. How you found the job 2. What the company does 3. Any news ABOUT the company, such as if they've recently gone public, acquired/got acquired by another company, etc. 4. Any other IT/tech positions the company is hiring for. (This will especially give you a good understanding of their technical stack. Speaking of which...) 5. If there's any job requirements on the listing that you don't know, look it up! You don't have to be 100% fluent and proficient in everything listed in a job listing. Just to be able to make enough conversation in an interview and prove that you can be taught and learn. This will speak volumes in an interview. 3. Continually review and update your resume. I can't count how many versions of my resume I've made since I started job hunting, and how many more I'll continue to make. This also includes having other people review your resume! I had a countless amount of people help me out in infosec discords I'm apart of in reviewing my skills, my resume, my cover letter, etc, and I can't begin to express how invaluable that was. 4. List your name, email address, and phone number in both your cover letter and resume. If nothing else, this will help you stick out with consistency. That said, do NOT list your address. There is not only no reason for them to know this, but this can sometimes be used to discriminate against you, especially if the employer thinks that you live too far away. 5. In your cover letter: 1. If you do not know the name of the hiring manager, list ""Dear Hiring Manager"" at the top of the letter. Oftentimes, it will not be a whole panel of people reviewing your application, and ""Hiring Manager"" looks better than ""Team"". However, if you can get a name out of either the screening interview or Linkedin, always best to put that on. 2. Keep it simple. No need to go into massive stories about how you've saved companies from bankruptcy or when you were inspired to get into IT. Your cover letter acts as your resume's wingman, let it do its job. Brag for yourself, but know when to keep your bragging in check. 3. Outline the best times to get a hold of you at the end of the letter. ""Standard business hours"" is on mine, and always made it clear that I would be best reached during that time. I would always, without fail, get calls when I was available, which makes it easy to know when to step away from my phone. 6. So what if they don't respond? Not all hope is lost! Jump onto Linkedin (You have a Linkedin, right?) and look up the company. 99/100 times, they have a recruiter that has open messages on Linkedin. Reach out, introduce yourself, and say you're interested in applying for \[position title\]. Recruiters will jump on this like crazy, and will very quickly fast track your application to the hiring manager. 7. In the interview, be honest with the interviewer about your skills. This means making it clear when you are NOT skilled/proficient in something they're talking about. This looks much more impressive than someone who lies about being skilled in everything. 8. Stories are the best kinds of answers. If someone asks you ""Tell me how you resolved Problem A"" or ""Tell me about a time when you failed"", have a story to tell. It doesn't necessarily have to be from your work history, but stories will always be better than ""I found X and did Y"". The devil is in the details, and if they want to know more details that you haven't prepared, it'll make you look bad. Conversely, if you pre-emptively provide details they already wanted to ask about, that'll look much better on your behalf. 9. You can find tons of questions for tech interviews online. Have answers prepared for as many of them as you can. This will not only help you not get tripped up, but will help you figure out what *your* best answer will be. Keep in mind the questions don't necessarily have to be technical. 10. ALWAYS ask questions afterwards! Especially if you ask questions that prompt more details from questions previously asked in the interview, this looks really good. Ask questions like: 1. What does a regular workday look like for this position? 2. What problems are you or your department facing (or expect to face) that this position would be involved in fixing? 3. When was the last time you took a vacation? (This helps you figure out if work-life balance is a thing at where you're interviewing) 4. What training opportunities are available to me here? (A company who doesn't value your continued training doesn't value you.) 5. What kinds of promotion paths or upward trajectory is expected for this position? (This one is tricky, but more geared towards entry-level positions. Try to read the room before asking this one) 6. What kinds of day-to-day interactions are expected with this position with other positions or departments? (This will give you more of an understanding of how people will be working with the position.) 11. Get emails and send thank you letters within the next day. Don't care if it's ""too busy"" for you. If they're taking time out of their day to interview them, and if the interview went well, thank them. 12. If they don't get back to you in the timeframe they specify (which they likely won't), email them. Ask them for an update on what's going on, and that you're still looking forward to hearing from them. 13. So you got the job! Awesome! Your work isn't done yet though. Keep a work journal. Even if it's just a sentence or two, write down what happens. Not only will this help you have a fuller understanding of what you've accomplished when you want to update your resume (or when you're feeling that hardcore imposter syndrome), but it will also help you solidify everything you've learned across your employment. Of those 304 applications, I would say about 40-50 of them actually got back to me with a response. Not necessarily an interview. The rest of them straight up had no response whatsoever. This is, unfortunately, the state of the industry at the moment. It's not only common, but expected, that you will have no response to an application you put a lot of time and effort into making and submitting. Don't be discouraged. Best of luck to you all!"

I am currently T2 helpdesk and am being promoted to a Cybersecurity Analyst or Cybersecurity Engineer (or some other variation on that title) at the MSP that I work for, that services SMB/SME clients. This cybersec/infosec position was created for me, and the CISO and I will be the only two employees of this department. I have been here for a year and a half doing T1 work, and half T2 work, in a mostly windows environment. In the last few months, I've been doing some serious scripting, automation both in Powershell and Python, and have become the resident Linux expert thanks to my sprawling homelab. Credentials: I have a Bachelors in Computer Science from a 4-year state school. Certifications: I have the following certs, and earned all of them in the last year and a half I've been at this job: \- CompTIA A+ \- CompTIA Net+ \- CompTIA Sec+ \- CompTIA CySA+ \- Azure AZ-900 Experience: 1.5 years as a T1 / T2, with some T3 stuff thrown in there for good measure. I consider myself pretty well versed in Linux, Ppowershell, and Python, (I'm the only one who knows Python at all in my company, and only one of three people who knows Powershell, and one of two who know Linux). I spend free time automating stuff like full disk alerts in our RMM tool and account management in AD and Azure/O365 stuff, but my usual day to day the last few months, while this transition has been ramping up have been like incident response, vulnerability management, vulnerability scanning, My job duties after this promotion will be SIEM management, vulnerability scanning and management, Bitlocker/MFA deployments, policy writing, incident response, making sure our clients renew their SSL certs, etc. My annual review is coming up in a few weeks, and I want to go in there armed with some good stuff that will help me get a raise. I currently make 55k in Washington D.C. area, and the **average** for a Cybersecurity analyst in this area is making $84k, but I know that I technically have less than 3 months of cybersecurity experience, so the $84k figure is likely out of reach. What would be a fair wage for me? For reference, I have pretty great benefits/perks/insurance, but I still feel that $55k is pretty low for my area and my skills and my certs/degree. So what do you guys think? Am I just being greedy? I currently have no idea what they're going to offer but I would bet it would be more than the $55k I get currently, but I would be shocked it if would be the $84k average figure I found. Other than that, do you guys have any tips for salary negotiations? Or any insight into my situation? This is my first job that isn't physical labor, and I am 25 y. o., this was my first job out of college. Thanks"
47,vulnerability,ITCareerQuestions,Which Masters degree would be best for a CyberSec guy who wants to move into mgmt in his 40s?

I am still trying to keep it cheap though, and I am only applying to the local collection of satellite campuses for my state's State Schools. (I can explain this further if needed but it's not important). I am currently 25, working as a weird mix of Tier 2 support and Cyber-security - mostly vulnerability scans and policy writing, and have been doing this for 1 year, and have 2 years experience as generic helpdesk. In 3 years, when I am eligible for the CISSP, I intend to earn it, and already have 6 active certifications right now: * A+ * Net+ * Sec+ * CySA+ * AWS Practitioner * ITIL Foundation I have a 4 year degree in computer science, no tracks/focuses/minors. Just plain ol' comp sci. I want to move into management and even be CISO in my later years, but now I enjoy being \*very\* technical. I know it's hard to do in cyber-security, but I would like to stay very technical for as long as possible. Anyway, this campus offers 4 masters degrees that would apply to my career. * MBA (Business Administration) * M.S in IT * M.P.S in Technical Management * M.P.S. in Cyber-Security I know that classically, an MBA would help me most in my desire to be CISO or CTO of an average/normal company (I don't have any delusions about replacing Andy Jassy). It is generic business principles (which I am tangentially familiar with), and would probably be the best bet if I were to ever apply to a management job or C-level job, instead of being promoted to one. I can not predict what my job/company/tenure would look like in 15-ish years but I am not one to jump ship quickly. An MBA would also take the longest, between 2 and 3 years. I know that often a Masters in CyberSec can have detriments due to being very pointed in its material and also due to being seen (by the industry) as being more of a drawn-out certification than a ""real masters"". This is only 6 classes, 18 credits. Done in 2 semesters, realistically. I also know that M.S. in IT would be the most generic and maybe even the most useful and most redundant at the same time. However, it does offer ""specializations"", but none of these explicitly apply to security, except for one that is very deliberately about government security, which, while I can not rule it out of my career down the line, it is not what I am doing now or aim to be doing at this time in my life. This is 36 credit hours and will take between 1-2 years most likely. I am unfamiliar with Technical Management, but I understand it to be a possible good move. This is more like a technical blend of the management specialization of the MBA, with an added focus on tech, kind of. 30 credit hours, 1-2 years. Anyway, I am feeling a little in over my head here. Does anyone have any of these? Which one would best contribute to my career goals (technical blue-teaming &gt; policy writing/mgmt &gt; C-level)? And yes, I understand that certs are better, and I have a couple already - the issue is that there really isn't any between now and the CISSP (nor after the CISSP) that will help me besides just as a way of showing to my bosses that I still study."

Working on a new resume here. There seems to be some great minds and info on here so I figured I'd ask you all. I tried to focus on accomplishments, but I feel like I need more quantitative descriptions. I was thinking maybe instead of, ""Track and identify possible security issues with vulnerability scanners"" maybe put ""Lowered risk score 50% by tracking and identifying vulnerabilities."" For the departments bullet point should I put how many departments? Its about 5-6. I was told maybe just to state the different departments. Its a bit difficult for me to quantify my past experience as well. On critique from a free service was that my resume was visually uneven. That I should add more bullet points to some of the descriptions. They also said I need a career summary section and more keywords/skills. Do you agree? I appreciate any and all feedback. Thank you!

I'm 20, and i've been working one of those medium business jack-of-all trades IT jobs for about 2 and a half years now (i started as an intern in high school). Additionally, I've been attending a small junior college during that time as well, only taking a few classes a semester. I'm doing a mix of helpdesk/support type of work (probably 80% of the time), along with some network and desktop systems administration type of work (20% of the time). I wouldn't say i'm the only technical staff member here (we have developers who maintain the websites/cloud operations, but they all work from their homes and are like... 5 hours away from here) Now, i'm transferring into a big state university (luckily it's only a few minutes away from my house so I get to live at home), so I need to reduce my hours at work in order to attend university. Here's where the problem comes in... I want to have a social life, AND have a job where i enjoy the work (not be the phone/email support bitch). I feel like i've been doing helpdesk type of work for 2.5 years at this point, and i'm ready to get to a higher level, like systems or network administration. But, that would require a full time commitment that I am no longer willing to make (i am currently a full time employee but won't be starting in September since I did reach an agreement to reduce some days). But i don't feel excited about my job anymore.... Usually in this scenario, people on /r/sysadmin or /r/ITCareerQuestions would say ""just quit and find another job"", but from what I see, my only options for the time commitment are help desk jobs, and more than likely; my university's help desk. I'm not going to completely avoid any help desk job, but I know i wouldn't be happy in another one. Now my boss is on my tail about the Win10 CVE-2019-1181/1182 vulnerability. Because we don't have any fucking configuration management solutions (hell, we don't even have a domain), I have to jump in to all 190 of our Win10 machines and manually check/update their machines. Which also involves coordinating with all 190 of these users, something that i hate because I have social anxiety. I had an outburst (more like an anxiety attack) towards him about it this morning. I've had quite a few of these outbursts the past few months, and I know if I keep those up, i'll be fired. I've always had a passion for networks and systems, I had (what i would consider to be) my first homelab at 11 years old (just two older desktop PCs, one running Server 2003 and the other had XP with a few VMs on it that i played with Active Directory on). My current homelab consists of an HP DL380 G6 and a DL360 G7, one of those shitty Cisco small business switches, and a few laptops i've come across over the past few years,. I'm currently running two domain controllers, a Sophos XG home edition firewall, and some linux vm's i'm playing around with on it (currently getting the hang of Ansible). Additionally, I have a 3 public facing linux vps's for mail, web, and FreePBX (currently playing around with asterisk... it's quite interesting). I wanted to include my homelab in this to be clear that i'm not just saying I want to be a sysadmin just because I hate desktop support I will say, that the money at my current job is pretty good. I'm also going to be taking on student loans, and now a car payment as well (my trusty 03 Outback has finally bit the dust) TLDR: I hate my current job and desktop support in general, but because i'm starting school full-time, I can't get anything better than desktop support for at least 2 more years, and I honestly can't take it anymore."

I'd like to round out my knowledge and grow my depth of technical knowledge and skills. As I perceive it, networking is a fundamental. I also need to know about operating systems, application security, infrastructure security and security architecture, as well as a whole other set of areas. My ideas are to load up on some of the appropriate sounding courses on places like Udemy, and start building a home lab to put some of these techniques into practice. I learn best when I have a project or task that I need to achieve, so learning about a technique and then going off and doing it is a good approach for me. Can anyone suggest some ideas for me to tackle or perhaps offer some feedback on my approach? My current plan is to start by building and configuring my home network with ""proper"" networking gear and using DDWRT or PFSense, and setting up some basic monitoring with snort, as well as having a play around with Nessus. How does this sound? I don't harbour any illusions and I know I'm not going to an overnight red teamer, but I would like to increase my knowledge such that in a few years of perhaps be in a position to be the only security person in a smaller organisation, or at least able to take on more areas of responsibility such as more basic vulnerability assessment, or perhaps take on a contract as a security architect or something."

I report to the CTO who reports to the CEO. My peers are the Software Engineering Manager, Product Manager, and CRM Systems Manager. I've been here almost two years and have 15 years of experience in the IT industry with 5 years in management. &amp;#x200B; My team consists of all individual contributors: &amp;#x200B; A couple of folks who handle office IT (service desk, laptops, networking and wifi, Active Directory, etc) A couple of folks who handle the customer-facing SaaS application that we sell (cloud server operations, app architecture and engineering, maintaining uptime, tier 4 troubleshooting, etc) A couple of folks who handle information security (GRC/IRM, vulnerability management, etc) &amp;#x200B; The company has aggressive growth goals which include moving from 100 employees to 200 to 500. The skeptic in me has yet to see the revenue growth needed to be at these numbers, but this is the plan that the CEO and executive management team references. &amp;#x200B; I really enjoy the small company feel, wearing multiple hats, being a part of building something new, and working in multiple facets of technology with a diverse group of people. &amp;#x200B; My concern is that as the company grows, the org chart will change and my responsibilities will shrink, affecting my happiness and career arc. For example: if a CISO is brought in, then the security team would move to report to that person, and I wouldn't have that team / responsibility / title. Or since Office IT and SaaS Cloud Operations are so different from each other, as those teams grow and scale with the business, then there could be an open req for a manager of one of those teams who would report to my manager and be my peer. &amp;#x200B; Has anyone been through this before in a fast-growing company? Is this scenario common? How did you handle things being taken off your plate? &amp;#x200B; Honestly I don't think I would handle it that well - I have a hard time letting go and could see myself telling a new person how to do their job, or being defensive about how I did things if they wanted to make changes to make it their own. My manager has asked me to start thinking about which area I'd like to specialize in (office IT, cloud ops, security) but I like doing it all and historically I prefer being a generalist than a specialist. &amp;#x200B; I could see cloud ops being most valued by the company because that's closely tied to the product that brings in money, but I don't think I'm most passionate about that. I would rather stay a generalist than specialize anyway, but I also don't want to leave the company or feel forced out. I anticipate these changes could take place in the next 12-24 months, so I am trying to be proactive and mentally ready for that. &amp;#x200B; I'm not asking for advice on which area to specialize in, but rather whether I should work to keep the responsibilities I have and currently enjoy in this startup company, or if this scenario is common, then how I could gracefully hand these responsibilities off to new people.

62,vulnerability,ITCareerQuestions,What certification should I get after CySA+?,1,c98wlu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/c98wlu/what_certification_should_i_get_after_cysa/,2019-07-05 09:04:34,"Hello all, &amp;#x200B; I am taking the CySA+ this month and I'm feeling pretty good about. All these ""I passed"" threads are a big help. &amp;#x200B; I'm just wondering what people would suggest to get after the CySA+. I currently have the A+, Net+, and Sec+. I work for an MSP as a sysadmin but I will be moving into a very nebulous ""security role"" soon. I will be the first person to do this in our company and I'm wondering if there might be anything between the CySA+ and CISSP that might be worth getting. I definitely do not have the 5 years required for the CISSP (3 years, really since, I have Sec+ and a college degree), and I would be totally down to take the test and get the ""associate's"" version, or however they call it, but I think that there is a lot of middle ground between the CySA+ and the CISSP. So any suggestions would be appreciated. The role would likely be more managerial and way more blue-teaming than red-teaming. I am considering the following: &amp;#x200B; * RHCSA - I already have quite a bit of familiarity with Linux, and I administrate an Ubuntu home-server. I am pretty interested in Linux but my company does not have ANY Linux servers at all. * PenTest+ - My role would be very much more blue-teaming, and pretty much zero red-teaming. This would be a role that focuses more on vulnerability remediation in Domain Controllers and other servers, and probably a bit of corporate-style digital forensics. I think PenTest+ might be a quickie and pretty fun but I don't think it would apply too much * Project+ - This role would definitely be more managerial and I think this cert would look good for it, even if it isn't explicitly technical. I don't know much about this one and am especially interested in some anecdotes or experience anyone might have. * PMP - from PMI, the Project Management Professional exam. This one seems a bit more high-level than Project+ and I'm sure it probably looks better on a resume than Project+, I just don't know if its reasonable to assume I could grasp those concepts with no project management experience. Is it really high-level? Any experience with this would help a lot as well. * CCNA CyberOps - This exam sees to be a little more high-level than Sec+ but less than CySA+. Would getting this just be redundant with a CySA+? My company uses Cisco stuff but we are far from exclusively Cisco. * CASP+ - Every time I see this discussed, its because the poster wishes they got the CISSP instead of the CASP+. Does this ring true with anyone here? If it is a good stepping stone between CySA+ and CISSP, then I would like to go for it, but if its just a knock-off of CISSP, which it seems to be, then I'll pass. * CEH - This one is pretty much off the table. My job pays for certs and study materials but it will be hard to convince management to shell out $1300+, not including study materials, for a test that focuses exclusively on red-teaming. I do hear that it helps get past tons of HR filters if I ever decide to switch companies/jobs. I think this one is kind of just out of the running but I'd still love to hear opinions on it. * Microsoft Azure Security Engineer Associate - Our company uses a lot of Microsoft cloud products, and while only a few of our clients have Azure domains, pretty much everyone uses Office 365. This would be a more technical exam and might be a bit out of my league, although I am not too sure because this one is brand new. I do have some familiarity with """"""scripting"""""" (read: Powershell), but most of my knowledge is Python or Bash. I am totally willing to learn tho. Is this one out of my grasp? &amp;#x200B; Thanks for reading everyone. Please let me know your thoughts. &amp;#x200B; Thanks"

I was being trained on their network structure by the India help desk who was screensharing with me when I saw him login to a server with domain admin credentials. Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't this a huge vulnerability and violation of principle of least privilege? I don't think anyone except the network admin should have domain admin credentials, let alone the contracted out India-based help desk. Problem is I'm not sure if this was by design and everyone's okay with it, but won't like me stepping on their toes or making their life harder. Is this something I should call attention to and if so how should I do it in a way that doesn't make me any enemies?"

Before that I was in school for Computer Science, but it wasn't something I had thought of or was even aware of until College. I wasn't some prodigy kid who has been programming since he was 12 and all that. At the moment I've got a fairly diverse background, I've done a bit of Vulnerability Management, Incident Response, Networking, System Administration, Application Security, some basic scripting and Software Development, as well as some exposure as a Manager. The issue I'm having now is that since I've worked in positions where I am a generalist and I don't necessarily have a ton of background in any of these areas I've been feeling like I'm fairly incompetent in all of them. I study often outside of work, and I really do enjoy this type of work. I like the attacker side of things more than the defender side, and I am really fascinated by any of the advanced areas in Application Security or the low-level binary exploitation type of stuff. I feel a bit stuck at the moment and feel like I have to move into management because even though I have 5 years of experience I don't feel as if I'm anywhere near as technical as I should be. I am able to study on my own and figure things out, but I can't do a lot of tasks without doing additional research. I don't mind going into management at some point, but I would like to do a bit more technical work before that, but I feel that as I gain more experience it's just going to make my knowledge gaps more painfully obvious. Basically I don't know if I should try to dive really deep into one area (somehow, not sure other than outside work), if I should continue on this generalist route and just gradually build my skills in these different areas, or if I should stop focusing on my technical abilities and work on more of my soft skills and moving up the Management side of things. Thank you in advance for any help you can provide with this, I really appreciate anything I can get."

After 5 years I got out and shifted career paths to IT. I started out as a helpdesk technician ($17/hr) in February of 2014 working at an insurance administration company of \~300 employees. After a year on the helpdesk I passed my CCNA and became a Junior Network Engineer working with two other network engineers. I enjoyed my work but was at times frustrated with the amount of hats I was wearing and how often I was working after-hours at first. My main issue was that I had little more to show for it than I did as a helpdesk technician regarding compensation ($40k). In fact, I was probably making less due to not being hourly anymore and putting in extra hours. &amp;#x200B; After a year as a Junior Network engineer I got a decent salary bump ($50k). I also picked up various duties involving security including vulnerability management, NAC, and proxy/web filtering. This sparked my interest in security and I began trying to offload some of my more pure network responsibilities in favor of focusing on security. The next year I was able to drop the ""Junior"" from my title ($65k) and I also pursued and obtained my Sec+ and CEH certifications. &amp;#x200B; In July of 2017 I moved with my family (wife and two very young kids) to a new state in pursuit of better job prospects in the security field. I got a job as a ""Security Analyst"" ($77.5k) with a similarly sized pharmaceutical company. I was the only security focused role on the team and again found I was wearing many hats. I quickly became disenchanted for various reasons including but not limited to my expansive role. Within 6 months I found a job with a major contracting company in the area and was put to work on a long-term contract with a huge corporation as a Security Engineer ($85k). I was super excited to be able to focus my efforts on fewer technologies and really master a skill. I soon found myself feeling hamstrung and bored as I became accustomed with the pace of change at such a large corporation. &amp;#x200B; I found myself hating the fact that I hadn't taken advantage of my opportunities at either of my first two companies where I had the freedom to implement solutions from conception to the finished product and then continue to utilize them. I was now simply implementing one aspect of one technology that I would not even be able to put to use (my first experience with Engineering vs Ops). &amp;#x200B; At this point I'm also feeling the affects of bouncing around so much, so quickly. I feel like I have a little bit of knowledge about a lot of stuff. I often feel inadequate when talking to a SME of any particular area in IT. I don't have that level of knowledge on anything because I haven't dedicated myself for any decent period of time. I was ready to self-correct and get back on track. I was ready to accept a position at a local company that is a giant in the networking world. I was going to be exposed to a couple different technologies, be given a full workload working support cases that would ingrain the basics of networking into my head, and pick up some very valuable certs. Although it was a contract position, I was confident in my abilities to go permanent and move around in the company. &amp;#x200B; When I put in my notice, I was pounced on by a small consulting company who I had interacted with at the big corporation contract. The offered me a nice salary hike ($93k) to continue as a Security Engineer and the opportunity to work on a more exciting project at the same company as well as the potential to work with other clients. The consultant company is small but everyone I've met is wicked smart and would be valuable to learn from. It's been about exciting project at the same company 2 months since I took that position. I'm satisfied for the time being but still find myself a bit restless. &amp;#x200B; The problem is that I've gone from $17/hr to $93k/year in the span of 5 years. I know it sounds ridiculous but I feel trapped in my current career path. Especially at my age (31) with a wife and kids. I feel like it would benefit me to take a step back salary-wise to get back to a more inclusive role. I don't know that what I'm doing now is what I truly want to do. Should I embrace my current path and dive head-first back into network engineering with a focus on security? Am I ready to abandon my interest in security analyst work? What about something I haven't tried like pen-testing? If I do stick with my current path, what's the trajectory? Network Security Engineer, Security Architect, CISO, etc? &amp;#x200B; Honestly I'm not sure what I'm even looking for in this post This might be more of a therapeutic exercise than anything. I am just interested if anyone else has felt overwhelmed and inadequate in their technical expertise and what they did to course correct. My salary has increased almost x3 in a few years but I don't feel like I have much to show for it. "

79,vulnerability,ITCareerQuestions,Career path (Looking for advice),1,a4cjin,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/a4cjin/career_path_looking_for_advice/,2018-12-09 04:22:08,"Hello everyone, I usually browse threads and look at other poster's advice to see what I could do, but I feel I need to just go ahead and post. I've been working under a company that assists with PCI purposes. Been here for about to be 3 years (Jan 2019 marks my 3rd anniversary here). &amp;#x200B; However, I feel like I've been stagnating. When I first joined the company, I was gungho about wanting to climb the corporate ladder (still do to an extent). I have a degree in foreign language, and yes that is strange but I did a career path change after I graduated a year after... Certificate wise I managed to earn the Comptia Security + and pass the ISC2 CISSP (still an associate for the certificate though). To be quite honest, I went for those degrees because the company endorsed it and would reimburse it for candidates who passed the exams. Far as tools I used for the company (utilize a mac for work): \- Nmap \- Telnet use \- Openssl \- Curl (to an extent) With my experience mentioned, I am trying to figure out where to stem out to in the IT industry. The security field has always interested me ever since I had a network compromise at my home which led me down the path I am now. I am currently self-studying for the CCENT -&gt; CCNA, but I feel like I am lacking a lot for not having a program language learned or not knowing some of the background of networking. Python or C Sharp has me interested, and looking around the reddit forums I became interested in powershell after reading about someone using a book 'Learn Windows PowerShell in a Month of Lunches' since it can help with QoL. There is also Bash for terminal use since I work on a mac. Networking+ I considered to strengthen my backgrounds on networking, but I was told the CCNA should cover it? Since the cloud has been ever expanding, I have also taken some interest towards AWS of all things. I keep building a list that eventually led to the question, am I spreading too thin? I considered re-entering an online college (WGU) to seek for an IT based degree since other places I look at want 5+ years of IT experience or an IT degree. Currently I only have 3 years of IT starting Jan 2019. I will admit that I feel I am at a disadvantage for entering the IT field so late (about to be 28 starting Jan). &amp;#x200B; Ever since I made the career change and after earning the 2 certificates, I am not quite sure where to head. Whether it be certificate wise, or learning a skill, I know I want to move on but being in the same position I have been losing motivation. I don't want to be left behind since the IT field feels it has the vibe 'polish skills and gain new ones, or don't improve and just perish.' &amp;#x200B; As for being here at the company... I want to be loyal as I like the company and all for the colleagues, but at the cost of stagnation? I believe it would be best to leave for a new one. One of the things I have always kept to heart is that I want to keep improving and moving up in life, but I've been stuck in the same position for 3 years as a vulnerability scan support technician. Despite how fast I earned the certificates and pushed to improve myself for the company, there just seemed to be a huge lack of recognition as other coworkers who work the day-shift have been moving to newer positions... I would assume working grave-shift doesn't help for recognition as that means less exposure of my efforts to the supervisors. Being on this shift for so long I feel has hurt me health-wise to the point where its inhibiting my ability to study (I don't even know how I managed to study for the Sec+ and CISSP under this shift) since I have been having difficulty consistently studying for the CCENT. Whether it be the shift or the lack of opportunity to move up in the company, my motivation is shot. &amp;#x200B; Anyways with that said, I wish to know what you all think and where I should consider focusing to. I don't want to stay at this company as I feel I'm going to continue losing hope/motivation if I do. I plan to take the CCENT on Dec 20th and move for the CCNA exam around Feb 2019 (assuming I pass the CCENT on the first go since my study habits have been faltering lately). Is it a bad move to be pushing for the CCENT/CCNA without learning other skills prior such as a programming language? I would like to move to a new company that can pay more than working this grave-shift and maybe have a normal life again shift-wise. I am ready to take feedback as harsh as it needs to be, just not to the point of deriding since I am prone to negative feelings as much as I hate to say."
80,vulnerability,ITCareerQuestions,Seeking Advice For Security-Related Internship,1,9vctjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/9vctjx/seeking_advice_for_securityrelated_internship/,2018-11-09 06:00:47,"Hello all, I'm going to be coming up on the summer before my senior year, which is supposedly when I should be doing an internship (applications are to be sent in soon). I believe this would be the best route to take and I just had a few questions for anyone who's been in the info sec world or hired in the info sec world. My main issue is that I don't know anyone personally that works in the field and therefor I struggle to find a ""baseline"" against which to compare myself for readiness. That is, I don't really know where I stand, compared to other cyber sec students. I should say I'm an extremely anxious person when it comes to work (as in heavy shaking/vomit multiple times before interviews/shifts at my previous food-industry job) and the purpose of me asking is to set goals for myself which will A.) make me a more desirable candidate and B.) feel more comfortable about what is expected of me versus what I'm capable of. For a bit of background: I'm 25 (started college late due to some IRL limitations), a junior working on an IT degree at a large state school (with a focus on security). I've gotten good grades throughout college so far, but only recently has my coursework started being any real level of applicable to my chosen career. I would love to eventually be a penetration tester full time as I enjoy the challenge of the unknown, and the ""there isn't one set way into any machine"" sort of mentality. I made the decision around February this year to switch my in-school and out-of-school focus from general IT to security after reading about HackTheBox on a security blog and deciding to give it a go. I thoroughly enjoyed myself on the site and figured this might be a worthwhile career path. Since then, I've read ""The Basics of Hacking and Penetration Testing"" and the majority of ""The Web Application Hacker's Handbook"", begun practicing scripting in both Bash and Python (with Python being my stronger language), rooted 30-40 machines on HtB of various difficulties, bought a Pineapple and BashBunny to practice wireless/physical security, and most recently, took a month of Offensive Security's Pentesting With Kali course, and obtained my OSCP. After looking at the requirements for many penetration testing jobs, and broader net/info sec jobs, I see my weaknesses as the following: * I have the ""mile-wide, inch deep"" sort of knowledge outside of penetration testing. I've taken many one-off courses that are required for the degree including: SQL database design and management, web app design, network design, data analysis, programming in Java, cloud computing, encryption, etc. But, while I was exposed to many of these technologies, I wouldn't feel comfortable call myself proficient in any of them or listing them as particular strengths. * I don't have any real-world experience in info sec. * Almost all of my practice experience thus far has been offensive. I've done a lot of breaking in, but not much in the way of preventing break-ins. I often struggle when I consider how to even go about starting a process like hardening a network/host. I know basic stuff like authentication, assigning least privilege, firewalls and ingress/egress rules, malware/A.V. detection, but I have trouble actually doing any of it without Google. I also wouldn't feel confident that I had properly secured it without some form of test against it. * I can't program in C/C++, nor even advanced Python. Many companies ask for proficiency in one or both of these it seems. I can read/modify simple C code, especially if it's well commented. I can read/understand most Python but still refer to 3rd party resources for more advanced coding.(The same goes for PHP/JS -- I can read, but can't really code it. However, I rarely see these two as requirements outside of WebApp Security specifically). * I'm very new to the field. There are still very obvious things I feel like I should know, but don't (as an example, I recently learned about SMB Shares, and the serious vulnerability they can present a short while ago \[primarily a \*nix user btw\]. Most people I've talked to think it's a relatively elementary topic and one that should've been known.) I'm sure there are loads of people that have been fooling around with hacking and pen testing since they were teenagers; I'm not sure how I stack up against them or what I could offer as a benefit to hiring me over someone like that. Furthermore, I worry that this ignorance of some basic-level information or testing methods will lead me to miss a glaringly obvious solution to an issue in the field at some point or another. Not having the foundation fully covered seems like a bad idea, but I don't know how much I don't know. I understand penetration testing (and to an extent, all of Net/Info Sec) is sort of a graduate position that you usually switch to after gaining real-world sys or network admin work. I figured an internship would be less demanding of a large skillset, and more of a willingness to learn, so I'm hoping to get a glimpse of my future career. With all of that in mind I'd like to ask anyone who's made it this far the following: * Who is your ideal intern candidate, in terms of skill and experience? * What would you consider to be essential for someone in my position to know? If you were hiring a penetration tester or for another Info Sec job, what basics should they know how to do without assistance? * Of my weaknesses, which do you think are the most detrimental to my success? Are any of them weaknesses shared by the majority of college students looking for internships is similar roles? * Any general recommendations on becoming comfortable in this field? It feels like there's always something to learn, always something to improve on, so how do you become confident that you know enough for a position? * I've noticed many jobs that involve penetration testing are for large companies where this is just one of many duties I would have. Are these worthwhile long-term for a career in pen testing or should I look to start cold-calling more boutique firms that are strictly pen testing related? * Any other tips/recommendations/comments for a skiddie looking to make a career for himself? Thanks for taking the time to read this and answer my questions. I'm hoping to over prepare for every situation so I can do my absolute best (and not throw up before interviews quite so much). "

I currently work as an infosec analyst, specializing in risk and vulnerability management, and am looking at potentially transitioning to a project management role. I've been in my current role for just over a year and have learned a ton about infosec risk management. The most fun aspects of my job have been leading projects and working on process improvements to shore up my employer's security program. There is currently an opening a PM-role opening in our unit and I am thinking about applying for it. Ideally, I would like to take my career into a more strategy/leadership route given that I enjoy having responsibility for things (projects, people, etc.) and setting and executing a vision/strategy. I am also in the process of studying for the GSEC (already paid for the attempt) and am hoping to sit for the CISSP within the next 1.5 to 2 years. Understandably, infosec analyst and PM job duties and responsibilities are very different -- though there is currently some overlap for me -- and I am wondering whether that would give me a better shot at going to where I would like to go. In addition, would being a PM with an infosec background make me valuable on the job market? My colleague mentioned it might be great to have a Project Manager with both a GSEC and CISSP. If you were in my shoes, what would you do? Thanks in advance for any and all insights!"

My lease is up in May, and after living in the D.C. area for my entire life, I plan on moving elsewhere, most likely Colorado or Washington, but it will depend on where I can get a job. With that deadline in mind, I want to work on making my resume as good as I can in the mean time. My current position is the first and only IT security position for my company (~900 employees). I got this position because I was a SysAdmin for the company before I finished my master's degree in Information Security Operations and there was no one else dedicated to security. When I finished the degree, they changed my job. It's an uphill battle getting management behind the need for security but I'm making some headway. It does give me some decent resume items though, like how I wrote all of our security documentation and policies, or that I implemented things like actual vulnerability management and a better defined patching process. Basically, my question is what technologies and certifications should I train myself on in the 8 months that would increase the chances of me getting hired elsewhere? I'm thinking my main goals are currently to take the CISSP and possibly CEH exams. I'm hesitant about the CISSP because I don't have the years requirement yet and I'm not sure if having the ""Associate of (ISC)^2 - CISSP"" on my resume would be worthwhile. I might knock out the Sec+ again, because I let mine expire and it probably wouldn't hurt to have it on the resume. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! "

85,vulnerability,ITCareerQuestions,Going back to school for a CS degree at the age of 25 :(,13,8uv51w,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/8uv51w/going_back_to_school_for_a_cs_degree_at_the_age/,2018-06-30 03:49:11,"TL;DR: I went to a community college in computer networking, have a full time job now. Due to finances/immigration status, I can now finally go back to university for a Bachelor's degree in CS, but I'll be 30 by the time I graduate and it's so much investment(of time) and effort. Would it even be worth it for my career/life? Hi all, I'm in the middle making a very important life decision - going back to school at the age of 25, and looking for any advice/opinions/experiences. Short background: I moved to Canada at 19, graduated from a college(in Canada, colleges are like US's community colleges offering 2 or 3 year diplomas, and universities are like regular universities offering 4-year degrees and up), and got a full time job, now working as an networking specialist at a company. When I first came to Canada, I couldn't go to a university for various reasons(one of them was international tuition, which is $40K+ that my family couldn't afford). I elected to go to a college because it was cheaper, and if you have the tuition, anybody can get accepted. Now that I've become a permanent resident of Canada, I can now pay the much lower domestic tuition, opening up the door for me to go back to university. Now the question: at this point in my life/career, is it worth it to go back for a CS degree? Arguments for a CS degree: 1. Enterprise IT is about consuming things other people made - from Microsoft, Cisco, etc. IT is fun, but IT departments usually just get things done - we learn how to use existing technology. What I do is restricted by how Microsoft engineers built Windows, just learning commands, behaviours, and getting them to work for our company's needs. I feel like I'm smart enough to do something much higher level or more far-reaching work - whether it be machine learning, quantum algorithms, developing the next TCP/IP, information security researcher, etc. If I kept at my current career path, I'll make a decent salary, and eventually climb up to do more architectural things, but I'm not sure if I want to continue just getting things to work at the mercy of whoever wrote this piece of technology my company bought - whether it be VMWare, Windows servers, AWS, whatever. 2. It leads to a lot of opportunities. I learned computer networking at my college, but learning CS at a university will expose me to much deeper understanding of how computers work. It also leads to networking, professors, and big name companies, that would be harder to come by if I didn't go uni. Who knows what kind of opportunities I might come by? Maybe if I find something super interesting research-wise, I can continue with masters and try to get into research, etc. 3. It probably will boost my salary range a lot when I graduate. I'm making around $50K, I feel like I'm gonna hit a ceiling around 100K if I'm lucky. Unless I become a network architect at a huge company, I don't think networking specialists often make more than 100K. If I went into something like vulnerability research(this will take so much self-learning), that might be more lucrative tho, but probably the ceiling is lower than somebody with a degree. 4. I'm Korean and Korean people love degrees and fancy shit. If you're Asian, you understand the obsession with degrees and fancy jobs like lawyers, doctors, etc. If I still have decades to live, having a degree, not just a college diploma, might make me feel better about my education. Arguments against a CS degree: 1. It 's so much investment/effort just to even GET ADMITTED to a university. Because I dropped out of high school, I will have to take a bunch of grade 11/12 courses including Calculus and Vectors. Doing this in my spare time with a full time job will be immense time and effort, and there's no guarantee that I'll get accepted in the case of UofT unless I do VERY WELL in the courses. 2. I'll be at least 29 or 30 when I graduate. With all the preparation(namely the high school grades I have to get), I will have to start in 2019 if I'm lucky, and 2020 more feasibly. I'll be 25 years old then, and graduate when I'm about 30. I guess just being in university doesn't mean you can't live your life, tho. I can still travel, try to date, and if I do work experience during my degree, I can probably expect to get a good job upon graduation for $70-80K salary. But going into my 30s by just finishing university is a bit stressful to think about, mostly because you can't help but feel ""late""."

I've gotten my foot in the door working in a SOC doing some penetration testing and offensive stuff(vulnerability assessments, metasploit, scripting, etc.) and I'm looking at the future to see what kinds of higher level positions I might want to align myself with. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like there are a whole lot of things that utilize pentesting skills beyond being a pentester. I would really like to stay on the offensive side if possible because I enjoy it and am good at it, but as far as salary and growth is concerned, it looks like my options are limited. Surely there are some FBI or government positions where I can fight bad guys and be like a cyber super-hero, right? There's gotta be investigations, intelligence gathering, and social engineering against criminal organizations, human traffickers, domestic threats, etc. Would be very cool to use some of the skills I've learned and put them to good use in this way. I've looked on FBI, NSA, DHS, USAJobs websites, but they are annoyingly(understandably) vague about these kinds of positions. What job titles might I be looking for?

Pretty much trying to do everything possible to help people not get killed on a persons given mood that day, I guess. I have relatively no *actual* IT experience, so I started with CompTia. I took my IT Fundamentals test 2 weeks ago and passed it. I've been studying A+ now, that'll be next. After that I was going to do Network+ or Security+, should I do one then the other? Was also going to do the first Cisco cert, take the cyber path. And then work my way up the path from there, CySA+/PenTest+ or something. I did research to plan it out, I just don't have it in front of me. In time, and I'm not trying to rush it; aware I've got to work my way up like everyone else, there's the potential to be very high ranking in the company, so I kind of want to know a broad spectrum/I'll be in the sales aspect too at some point.

I believe that I'm currently underpaid where I work now, and I was hoping that someone may be able to give me an estimate of how much I could reasonably expect to make at a new position. I have been working in the Washington D.C. area as a Systems Administrator for about 3 years, where my primary duties originally involved maintaining and building CentOS hosts in vCenter for our web stack, managing the Windows and OS X enterprise user environment, including managing AD, GPOs, DNS, etc as well as other small tasks. Since I started my Master's program (and because my company doesn't have an official IT security position) I have shifted my job responsibilities to doing mainly security duties. Since this has started I have introduced official policies that has been approved by the IT director/Legal/HR/whoever depending on the policy, such as Acceptable Use policy, Incident Response plan, official password policy, and PII Sharing policy. I have started hardening our systems according to DoD STIGs. I have introduced OSSIM and Suricata for logging and detection. I have developed a phishing campaign to test employee failure rates and I am working with legal and HR to implement training for repeat offenders. I am currently developing a vulnerability analysis plan that I will use to find weaknesses in our infrastructure. Just to give a brief overview of what I learned in grad school, but may have not been able to use much in my current job. A decent amount of the program was dedicated to risk assessment and response. I learned malware analysis using programs such as IDA and debuggers; some digital forensics, developing security tools using Python, security testing tools (Nmap, password crackers, fuzzing tools, Metasploit), and ended the program with the class split into two teams and running wargames against each other. I also uploaded my resume here URL If there is any advice on revising it, that would be fantastic. Otherwise, if you have any idea of what someone with my work experience/education could make, I would appreciate it. Thank you! Edited per /u/GatoradeBottle4L 's suggestion to add what type of position I'm looking for. Long term, I'd like to get into penetration testing or digital forensics.

I'm a one man IT department for a company of ~50 employees and a mix of Windows (20%), MacOS X, and Linux (a lot of flavors). I've successfully met requirements to certify as a vendor for large corporations with the following: Identity management - FreeIPA Local virtualization hosts for file sharing, IPA hosts, CA, dev server, VM workstations - KVM + QEMU, Fedora, Ubuntu, Windows Vulnerability assessment - OpenVAS on Debian Linux (Kali) Asset management - SnipeIT, vendor hosted SIP service for VOIP - Twilio + Heroku Software deployment and device management - Simian + Munki + Google Cloud Platform Network Monitoring - OpenNMS + Google Cloud Network hardening - Cisco Appliances (Wireless Controller, Switches, and Firewall Device) I have no ticketing system, nor did I keep record of time spent on each. A general idea would be sufficient, I'll even take a qualitative assessment even if just for the motivation. "

I currently have two job offers right out of college: a Junior Network Engineer position and a Security Analyst role. I have interviewed with both companies and I have found myself being so torn as to which job to accept because I just love both. I was originally pursuing InfoSec because I knew the salary might have more potential for growth, but after getting to know the Networking team, I might see myself having more fun dealing with actual hardware rather than sitting around doing vulnerability scans. But I also love security and have always wanted to work my way up to a Security Engineer role. So my question is, Networking or Security for a career path? What has more growth potential? What has more opportunities? I'm really not hung up on salary all that much, I just want to enjoy what I do... but I enjoy both. I need someone with experience in these fields to help me out and tell me why you love Networking or Security and why."

108,vulnerability,ITCareerQuestions,Apprehension Surrounding Offer Terms.,2,5jb9ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/5jb9ek/apprehension_surrounding_offer_terms/,2016-12-20 15:26:47,"I got an offer recently and I have some apprehension about some of the terms. I'll list some background first, then list the parts of the offer that I'm a bit apprehensive about. I'm relatively new in IT security, but I've been job hunting for a few months now since my current job seems like it has bad career development opportunities for me. Specifically, I kind of want to work towards Penetration Testing, Vulnerability Assessment or Forensic Analysis, and my company doesn't do any of those in house, we just do network monitoring and engineering. After searching for a few months, I got an offer recently for position with a company focusing on Security, that does Vulnerability Assessment, Pen Testing, and Forensics in house for enterprise customers. They also boast of their willingness to pay for outside training such as bootcamps for certs. And evidently they prioritize hiring within for positions like Penetration Tester. This seems great for future development, but some of the terms being done are making the place look like a potential trap. ***NOW THE DETAILS*** For starters, during the recruitment process, I was asked to give a salary range I was looking for. I gave $Xk-$(X+5)K. Later in the process, the recruiter commented the range as $(X-5)k-$Xk, and I specifically mentioned $Xk was my minimum. This (X) was 15-20% more than my current salary, but as the job requires relocation with slightly higher rent costs I figured that was a fair price. The ending offer, after some discussion, was $(X-5)K. I will likely counter with $Xk, but I'm not sure how that will pan out. The offer, aside from the lower than expected salary, also comes with additional red flags. For starters, there is a clause that states if I leave within 24 months of start date, they can require a sizable reimbursement for training investment. This does not include outside training done on company time, its just for the on boarding training. Its roughly 1/3rd of the annual salary they offered. I don't really plan on leaving anywhere within 2 years, but the fact that it'd be required sets off warnings, and IDK how paranoid I should be. Additionally, there is no overtime approved. If people request off/call out, they either will switch someone in (so they get a different day off) or they will do with less people on shift. This wouldn't be an issue, but a lot of their reviews (many of which I think are fake from the company) state how ""fast paced"" the environment is, and how to succeed you need to push yourself. It seems like that equals a lot of days leaving an hour or two after shift ends, without any additional compensation. They have a number of reviews on Glassdoor, but some read like they are mission statements from employee stating they have been there less than a year, and some just read as ""everything is fantastic."" The 2 not 5 star reviews echo some of the 5 stars that the place is fast paced and the push you hard, but opportunities are available if you can cut it. I'm kind of not in the best place for growth, I'm just hoping I won't be leaving the devil I know for the devil I don't, and being stuck."

I guess I just needed to vent and hopefully get some advice. I hope this is the right place. Background: I've been working in my current position as ""Technical Services Analyst"" since the beginning of April. Prior to that I worked as Help Desk Analyst at a small bank for 2.25 years and learned back in October that there were plans for me to be promoted to System Administrator... until it was announced that my company was being sold and I learned that my position was not being retained. I saw the writing on the wall and interviewed for a position at a company that got glowing reviews by a friend whose fiancee previously worked there. I got the position very easily, most likely through the recommendation of my friend. During the breezy interviews I mentioned that personal growth and learning opportunities were the most important to me, and that I need to feel like I'm growing. I was told that the team of three (plus me) frequently worked on important projects but that other than that ""this is mostly a call center"". That should have set off some bells in my head, but I was blinded by the 25% increase in salary. So I left my old job, where I had grown from a greenhorn fresh out of school to a new, inexperienced sysadmin, for this new one full of promise and uncertainty. I arrived looking forward to the expected ""honeymoon"" phase, where I'd be exposed to new tech, new systems, new procedures. I instead found something very different. In the first week I learned that I was the third person to occupy my position in the past three years due to employee turnover. I had three teammates, plus the supervisor who interviewed and hired me. I won't get into deep detail with my teammates so as to not give too much info away, but I will say that one is actively looking to get out as they can no longer stand working here, one has ""highly reviewed"" people skills but is a terrible technician and teammate, often throwing others on the team under the bus, and the other has terrible people skills but is a very skilled tech. My supervisor worked for the company as a network technician, left the company for three months, tried coming back, found out his previous position had been filled, but was offered position as Help Desk manager instead. The first week was pure chaos for the team in general, mostly due to a lack of established procedures, little to no documentation, poor communication and poor leadership. However I found that I was actually doing less than I was at my previous job. I figured that after after the chaos died down I'd be given some tasks to complete or monitor. Nope. After a month I met with my manager to get a better understanding of what exactly it was I'd be doing here and what I'd have the opportunity to do. I mentioned that I have experience running, managing, and documenting vulnerability scans and penetration testing (I pentested and documented the findings for state and federal audits at my previous job), security log reviews, group policy refinement, patch management, etc. I mentioned that the workload here is actually very light and I'm looking to learn. I was told that *maybe* something might come later down the road and it was never spoken of again. I mentioned this to the one teammate trying to leave and they said that they were told the same thing after they first started years ago and that nothing ever came of it. It was one of the reasons why they'd given up hope. About three weeks in my supervisor told me that he pulls logs from my PC so he knows what time I sign in everyday after I came in late a few days due to unavoidable accidents on the highway I take to work. I feel the need to mention that I am on-call 24/7 for a full week every month, with no extra payment or bonus for the calls I take. He mentioned it like it was the most natural thing, and what do I know, maybe it is? My last supervisor said that they don't really care if people in the department come in late as we're frequently working late hours or on weekends (I was on-call every other weekend). I do know that I lost all trust and respect I had in my manager. My manager/supervisor doesn't really do much of either when it comes to my team. He sits in the same area as us but doesn't speak up when we crapped on or have unreasonable requests made by other departments. He's aware of various backstabbing and infighting within the team but doesn't intervene. He spends most of his days working on the projects I was expecting to be working on here. He's been working on a project for the past seven months that should only take two and has told upper management that he's not sure if it'll be done by the end of the year. My current manager/supervisor doesn't delegate any of this to us, unless it requires us to be a face/punching bag to the other departments (we are sent in to try and replace XP machines that still exist on the domain because we allow regional managers to decide upon and order specialized software and who then don't ever want to look into upgrading said systems). I once found a whole eight-person team using one user's credentials because they didn't feel like learning how to switch users and remember their own credentials. I immediately recognized what kind of security risk this posed and brought it up to one of my teammates. They said that we can either go in and try to fix it with little to no backing from our own management and get yelled at by everyone, or pretend that we saw nothing. That eight-person team is still on one account. We had a department meeting last month where it was said by the senior IT exec that it's more important that we make users feel good than it is to actually fix their problems. He realizes that there is a ""positivity issues"" specific to my team. His solution is to tell us to stay positive. I don't think I really need to elaborate on how I feel about this. In contrast to how it was when I first started, it's now dead. I'd say I spend about 45 minutes of my 9-hour day on actual real work and then spend the rest of it sitting at my desk. I'm at least allowed to look at reddit and other media websites when not working but I feel like I'm dying inside. I don't respect the work I'm doing, the company I work for, the people I work with, and these days not even myself. I sit in my small, confined box, every day the same. Some days I wish I had gone into firefighting or even the military, thinking I'd experience some form of satisfaction in what I was doing. Some days I feel really silly being so miserable - it seems like it would be ""the dream"" to sit around doing next to nothing for what is a very decent salary. Every day I come home exhausted with a numbed mind. I've been studying up for my CCNA, hoping that this will help elevate me to something more satisfying, but I just can't focus on it, or much of anything anymore. Some days I just cry after I come home. Is this what I have to look forward to? Small cubes, no respect, poor management, no teamwork, complete and utter boredom for &gt;45 hours a week? I'm not sure if it's that I'm no longer interested in technology or it's just the environment I'm in. I just don't know what to do. Is the money worth it? Is everyone this miserable and just in it for the money?"

My undergraduate program was Computer Information Technology, with a specialization in network security as opposed to the other path available, database administration. Most of my coursework involved Linux system administration and Cisco networking, branching off eventually into computer and network security. Focusing on CIA, AAA, etc. Up to this point I've dabbled in Kali Linux and metasploit, as well as Nessus scanning and writing up vulnerability reports based on those Nessus scans, cross-referencing CVEdetails. My coursework required also reading CCNA ICND and CCNA Security, but unfortunately obtaining the actual certificates wasn't part of the program, so I do not currently have any certs. My first course of action after obtaining a job is to get CCNA Routing/Switching, then CCNA Security, and hopefully get CISSP or CEH to move into management or penetration testing some day, dependent upon where I want to move after a few years. I also just completed a 1/2 year co-op with a large Cincinnati company as a network engineer. So with that giant block of text out of the way, where should I begin to get started? Should I begin with basic Linux administration, or start in a SOC analyzing IDS logs? While a lot of my coursework involved learning Cisco IOS/NX-OS/Linux and basic protocols, unfortunately nothing really prepared me for the job search."

I do enjoy IT security and want to continue on this path, but I don't feel that where I landed is going to provide much in that path. The job description doesn't exactly match up with my duties. I'm an event specialist, but really I just shuffle ticket's around with little real knowledge required. Sure, I manage the vulnerability scans, but I'm not responsible for anything beyond distributing the report. Hell, our team doesn't even have access to the domain controllers or any other servers for that matter. In the event of an incident, we can't do anything but look through log collectors and pass it along to the system admins. I'm new to this field so I don't know if it's like this everywhere. I know every job has some mundane tasks involved, but this is a little to mundane! I'm thinking of starting a new job search and looking for something more involved such as working for a consulting company. I'm very hands on when it comes to technology and in this position I feel very hands off. The problem...I've only been here for two months. I feel it's going to look bad so I'm looking for your opinions. "

Over these years, though, I've grown significantly in terms of my understanding and responsibilities to the point where even my employer conceded that I was doing much more than a ""Helpdesk Analyst"" generally does, which was why they started moving on creating a new position/title for me which would basically be my current role with my current responsibilities, but with a SysAdmin title and a better salary. Sounds great, right!? Well unfortunately right as my boss's boss got the ball rolling on change, we received notice that my company is being acquired by another regional company. At this point everything stopped and any paperwork or moves for promotions that hadn't already been submitted to HR prior to the announcement were denied. I currently handle everything from Helpdesk to quarterly vulnerability scans and remediations for federal security audits to patch management and MDM. I currently have a Network+ cert from CompTIA and am taking night classes for CCNA, with a hopeful target date of June 2016. Unfortunately all recruiters apparently see is ""Helpdesk Analyst"" on my resume and LinkedIn, so I'm still only really ever hit up for various call center positions and other positions which offer fewer responsibilities and less pay. I spoke with my supervisor about this and he spoke to his boss (CIO), who came back and said that while it's too late to make anything official, I could basically make my title something like System Administrator and to just put my Supervisor and the CIO down as references. At first I was ecstatic, as this was what I was waiting for. But then I started to wonder: If my title change is unofficial, but I mark it down on my resume and LinkedIn as if it were, what if I interview for a position and they contact my company's HR department to verify? There would be no record my ""unofficial promotion"" and that would reflect poorly on me. If I now have the (unofficial) title of System Administrator but don't make the salary to match, how will that affect my salary at a future job? Would this be viewed as deceitful by potential employers even if there is no intention of deceit and I have my supervisor and CIO back me up? Any other suggestions?"

I have 2.5 years of professional IT experience, having started on the help desk at one company and now as a junior sysadmin at a second company. I started looking around because I'm not being challenged or learning anything new at my current job. After a lengthy interview process I have two offers to choose from. **Company A - Associate Security Analyst** Seems like I'd be doing a whole lot of different things related to security, from incident response to vulnerability scanning to access control etc. Salary: $45,000 firm - have already tried negotiating and they won't budge. PTO: 12 vacation days earned over time and 5 sick days after 90 days. 5 more sick days every year thereafter, max 25. Insurance: $200/mo for self + spouse on a high-deductible plan ($2,500 single, $5,000 family). Covers 80% of costs after deductible. 401k: 50% match up to 6%, vested after 5 years. Large IT department with room to move upwards or sideways into other areas. The manager is willing (and wants to) invest in me when it comes to pursuing certifications and ongoing training. I'd double my commute at 50 minutes to work one-way, which would result in an additional $1,000/year in gas. Stress level: Probably 6 or 7 out of 10. Little on-call time, if any. NO USER SUPPORT. My gut says that I'd probably enjoy the day-to-day tasks of this job more, all other things aside. **Company B - Desktop Support** Your typical desktop-level support job - receiving escalated tickets from the help desk and fixing problems in-person. Salary: $45,000 - have not tried negotiating, but they had a lot of applicants so I don't see them moving much. PTO: 24 days (vacation + sick combined into one pool) earned over time, plus more after a few years. Insurance: Same as above. 401k: If the company does well at the end of the year, it *may* contribute a 100% match up to 2% but it's not guaranteed, and this would be vested after 5 years. The only clear advancement path is into a system administrator position, or eventually a network architect. I'm sure I could get them to invest in certs/personal development but that would probably be less of a concern than other department needs. A 5-minute drive from home that would practically eliminate gas costs. I might even bike to work in good weather. Gas savings: $1,000/year. Stress level: 4-6 out of 10. Regular on-call rotation, taking one week every month and a half or so. Weird department issues - new IT director has taken the department in a completely different direction than it was before, and at least three people have left (which created the job openings). This could simply be people resisting change, or could point to an actual problem. I want to get started in Information Security as a career so job A definitely interests me, as I'll be getting a lot of experience in many different areas. The semi-higher stress would probably not be a huge deal. The biggest drawback is doubling my commute, and I honestly thought the salary would be higher. Job B being so close to home is very appealing, plus more vacation time. But it's not related to security at all and I don't think I'd have the opportunity to work much in that area, as it's reserved for the higher-level admins. Your thoughts? I think I've already made my decision but wanted to get feedback before making a move."

The company I work for has about 150 employees spread across 10 locations over two states. It's my first real job after college, though I did have a few internships while in school. Despite my internships I was still very green when I first started, having little experience beyond resetting passwords and working within our ticketing application. But since starting I've been very eager to learn how to do more and progress, asking for and doing more. I've gone from barely knowing how to navigate through AD to running vulnerability scans in Nessus, documenting our findings for auditors, and patching our environment through a combination of group policy updates, workstation/server patching, firmware updates, and written powershell and batch scripts. I harden our networked UPSs, copiers, and printers. I alternate with my supervisor in patching our servers every month and I am on call every other Friday night and Saturday morning. I've even implemented Microsoft's new Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS). We outsource the majority of our network to an MSP but I have become responsible for managing our firewall's web content filter, whitelisting various websites and upgrading and downgrading user permissions as requested. I've updated firmware on our switches. At first I barely understood server virtualization and only knew the basics of networking but I now respond to SolarWinds alerts regarding utilization or storage capacity. While I haven't gotten imaging down just yet I am responsible for the building and deploying of all workstations, and have even built a VM to be used in production. A few weeks back I earned my Network+ certification and am looking into working toward an MS cert. I've started taking on some of the tasks of my supervisor. The vast majority of my end users love me and have written letters of gratitude and praise to my boss and my boss's boss. But I've noticed that as my workload gets heavier and heavier, the tasks more complex, the deadlines more demanding, and my skills sharper than ever before, there are no talks of me seeing an increase in salary or title. In fact I presented these facts to my supervisor a few months ago and was told that there was just nothing available in the budget, despite the fact that a person in the department was replaced by someone making 20k more than the previous guy (and myself) who does not work hours nearly as long as mine, and does not participate in the on-call rotation (like the person he replaced). My boss received a promotion earlier in the year. I know one of the first mistakes to be made is to compare yourself to others but I cannot help but feel that these discrepancies highlight a lack of appreciation. My boss even asked me that if I didn't think the salary was decent, why did I take the job? I need to ""pay my dues"". He has a point but the worker who first walked through those doors is not the same as the one typing this up. He also said that he doesn't want my rejection to discourage me from continuing to take on more work. I've begun to grow bitter and resentful, and I have a hard time getting to work in the morning. I don't feel respected by others in the department. My boss says that he PROMISES if I stick around until after this big, summer-long project that ""great things will come to (me)"". My boss's boss took me aside and said what a great job I'm doing, that he appreciates the work I do, and that he ""hires people who want to take on more and do more, not those who just want to be told what to do"" and that I just need to patient. I don't know what to think. This company is so small that there is no room to advance unless they make room. There is no talk of spreading the shit I have to deal with to other members of the department. I've begun looking at other companies. I'm interested in security and feel that I have enough experience for an entry-level security position. I was contacted by a contractor who said he was fairly confident he could get me hired for a 6 to 12 month contract in a basic security-type role at a rate that would come out to be 10k - 15k more than what I'm currently making. Something about contracting is off-putting and I didn't respond but I'm starting to wish I had. Sorry to ramble, but I was wondering if anyone had any advice. Has anyone been in any similar positions? If so, how did they react and how did things end up?"

I'm going to try and ask my questions as barebones as possible, without all the details, and just try to fill in what is absolutely necessary only if it comes up. : Owner of company got worried about all the leaks/hacks the last two years and has a bit of a knee-jerk reaction and throws money at IT to quickly form a security team and purchase hardware/software to make company more ""secure"". IT department has never had a team or even person who is solely focused on security. An outside person is hired. A bunch of stuff is bought. : I'm just a lowly network support tech (a small step up from desktop tech here) but I got asked if I want to be the second person on the team (of a team of two). I say to my manager that I have no formal training on this and it would seem like someone on network engineering or network administration would be better certified. Discussion goes on for a while and I accept anyways. : 1) I'm thinking there may be more reasons than just qualifications for the reason they want a second person on the team . Any thoughts on this? If this is for liability reasons, did I sign up as an easy target to be thrown under the bus if something bad happens? : 2) In terms of certification, to better justify my position on the team, I'm assuming in the near-term, CompTIA Security+ is probably not a bad start? I would like to keep it broad for now. : 3) Any websites that are good resources for me to try and stay on top of market wide security alerts/concerns? I came across this URL but I'm not sure if that is too granular or not. I did some reading on there recently with the FREAK vulnerability. : 4) With everything happening so fast, I'm not sure anyone is even entirely sure of what will all fall under the security team's responsabilities and what will not. If you have a team like this at your company, what do they all handle? Active monitoring of the company-wide AV dashboard? Threat scans? Pen-testing? Malware removal (currently handled by desktop team)? Email spam filter? Auditing? Firewall? : 5) Any general advice about my situation (thrown on to a brand new team with a vague sense of responsabilities, feeling underqualified, and under the gaze of management)? : I'm planning to have some 1-on-1 meetings with the other guy that got hired after he starts (he has not started yet) and discuss some of this with him too but I want some outside opinions too. I would think the very first thing we need to do is try to consolidate all the current security resources under our team and at least ensure they are being monitored to some degree acted upon."

I am a cyber instructor with 8 certifications and a masters who has provided a number of people with good career advice and tips on exams and kind of money out there. For a long time I was a network engineer who was at one point a CCNP and a CCDP (no longer have them) but got bored with it after close to 20 years. One day I decided to tackle the CISSP after a manager I worked with got it right as many of us were getting handed pink slips from Raytheon. Shortly after leaving, I studied hard off for 20 straight days (average of 5 hours a day) and passed the exam the first time around near the end of 2017 (I was formally approved as a member late February of 2018) when the test was still 250 questions. I used the gold book and cccure at that time. I did not go to a class. I do not know what my score was but even with 2 hours of test time still left I was too fried to even review any questions and clicked finished praying to god I would not have to retake. I was moderately surprised I got a pass and took a well deserved study break. A few months later while bored on a work trip to WV, I decided to tackle the CEH and in 14 days of moderate study I barely passed (72%). I wanted to have a management cert and a semi tech cert to complement it. For both exams I used the most popular books for each (gold book for CISSP and sybex for CEH) and cccure for both. When I got my second job after Raytheon my company sent me to a 4 day training session for CCISO. The class was great as well as some website that had a bank of 348 study questions. The day after the the last class I took the exam and did well on that test (87%) which was 150 questions in just over 100 minutes. The test felt like what getting a CRISC would be if it had sex with a CISM test and then had a baby. Feeling a little motivated I pursued ITIL foundations to get a process cert. It was easy. I went through the Axelos book and studied a sample bank of study questions for 40 bucks and passed 3 days later. A month later the ECC offered me the opportunity to be grandfathered into CNDA since I was an active CEH with a government consulting background. I submitted documents and paid the 200 dollar fee and that was it. Perhaps the easiest one out of the bunch. Since I was in auditing and conducting assessments/GRC activities I decided to do the CISA but a friend of mine just got the CISM. He told me to study the ""ISACA Real Exams"" videos presented by Cisco. After 5 days of intense study going over 5 or 6 different 90 to 110 minute videos with 100 questions each, I passed with a 504/850 (450 is passing). 2 week later I decided ""what the hell, why not take the same approach for the CISA."" I studied 7 days at 4 hours a day to pass the CISA. I did not exactly crush it getting a 468/850 (450 is passing), but I passed in a week. Both ISACA exams were the first I took at home. Having a proctor watch you that you cannot see yourself is rather strange but not having to go to a test center was nice. From July 13 to August 5, 2020 I studied for the PMP 2 to 3 hours every day. I used half of the PMBOK guide (I tapped out after 300 pages) and then focused on pm exams questions I got for 149 (mostly focused on their 5 200 question exams) and cccure (did about a 1000 questions total (580 Unique) as well. The questions did not look anything like the exam but they prepared me well. After my CISSP was approved, I started my masters program in Cybersecurity Management and Policy at University Maryland Global Campus while attaining the rest of my certifications which made everything a little more challenging. If you are attached, it helps to have a partner that is willing and understanding to give you space and time to focus on your goals when its time to get serious. The great thing about doing a masters course or any program while getting certs or shortly getting them is it will quickly fill up all your CPE requirements. Getting other certs is also a great way to get CPEs btw! Right now I am studying for PMP. I went through the app process and have been studying for 16 days thus far and plan to take the 5th of August. If I can get that then I will be in a select category that has an advanced degree in tech or management, a CISSP, and a PMP. The cool thing about CEH is that under DoD initiatives 8570 and newer 8140 is that it is the only CSSP (Certified Security Service Provider) cert that fills 4 of the 5 categories (CSSP Analyst, CSSP Infrastructure Support, CSSP Incident Responder, CSSP Auditor). CISM and CCISO each give me an IAM 3 level cert and they are also a CSSP manager cert (only CSSP category that CEH is not). A CISA is a CSSP Auditor cert and its one of 2 IAT level 3 certs. Of course CISSP covers both IAT and IAM level 3 but none of the CSSP categories. Recently I was aggressively pursued for a job with a high rate because it required a BS degree, a CISSP, a CISA, and a CEH. I did not take it but it it shows you how having multiple certs in a broader spectrum of areas can make you very marketable or eligible for tough to fill positions. Overall, I completed a masters degree in cyber management and 8 certifications in 28 months. Its definitely not impossible for someone motivated. I would say 8 certs is not necessary though I recommend having 3 or 4 that complement your background and predilections. I am now going for CCSP and a basic AWS cert to cover cloud and then its a wrap. That will give me 3 tech management certs to go with a tech management degree, 2 tech certs, 2 cloud certs, 1 project management cert, 1 auditing cert, and 1 tech process cert. Part of that is job security but a lot of it is setting an example to my students and younger family members as well. I also want to represent myself as well as possible when I get my business off the ground. I don't see a lot of education and certifications as being a genius as much as I see it as someone dedicated to continual learning and improving. For those of you interested in monetary reward for such endeavors I can say where I was capping out in the 135 to 150k salary/75 to 90/hr on W2 range as a network or network security engineer with a Secret or TS clearance I went to 180 to 205k salary/95 to 125 an hour on W2 range without a clearance. One job offered well into the triple digits per hour because they required the unusual combo of BS degree, a CISSP, a CISA, and a CEH. Most with the first three do not bother with CEH so you never know which cert may put you in that small group of eligible employees. If I still had a TS I am sure it would be a little higher on the range. Keep in mind this is the DC metro area so its higher than most places but less than what you would see in parts of CA or NYC. This is just to show where I was to where I went so your situation maybe different when it comes to what you expect and/or get."

My goal has always been cybersecurity, particularly ethical hacking, and I feel like I'm close if not there in terms of skill. Nonetheless, would it be worth it to spend the time and money on some new credentials (certification, boot camp, etc.) before trying to find my first cyber security-specialized job? I've honestly never bothered with certifications unless they were required for a particular job. My portfolio and references have always served me well enough not to need certifications (or the bachelor's degree I was three classes shy of finishing when my financial resources dried up) and I've never had a problem landing contracts and jobs for admin and dev work. And I do have some cyber security-specific projects in there but they're minimal, and few and far between. I'm just not sure if that's going to be enough. I'm trying, anyway, but I'm just curious how much of a difference having, say Security+ or Azure Security Engineer, on my resume will make. I've never actually tried for a cyber security role.

Is a Cyber Analyst a good foot-in-the-door job for an ultimate goal of being a pentester? Is there something better as a gateway position? 2. If anyone has worked with eMASS, STIGS, SCAP and ACAS scans do you enjoy your job? Was/is it a good learning experience for cyber? 3. Is now a ""smart"" time to be making a career move given the state of the world? 4. Is saying ""you will start off drinking from a fire hydrant"" a red flag in transitioning to a job like this or is that an appropriate comparison? I think this is a good job with a good company and maybe I am overthinking things but I like my job and I am just worried it could end up being something I hate since it sounds like mostly being a ""paper pusher"", but it almost seems like that is THE starting point for most cyber careers from what I have heard."

I had a job that I thought would be a career, but it closed in nov of 2018 and now Im looking for work which me brings me to a little background on me. So, I didnt think I would be alive because I have battled some serious depression and anxiety which ill admit has stalled my job search at times. However, since March of this year my medication has turned my life around again.

I also purchased a subscription to pentesterlab pro as well as thecybermentors class on udemy. I want to learn python as well to give my profile more substance.

I look forward to help desk all the same as it is a natural first step for someone like me with no experience. The end game I'm undecided on, but love the idea of sysadmin, network engineer or possibly cybersecurity - something like pentester perhaps. Another option would be cloud architecture maybe. The way I currently see it though, I have a long way to go on the constant path to learning, and you can never really be sure where life actually takes you. What I have found is that I love the learning aspect, and since I've always been a total geek with computers, the subdivisions almost don't really matter for me a lot - it's all something I look forward to researching and labbing more and more every night. So as far as the certifications go, I would say I think in an ideal world CCNA would be an easy call. It's more technical and it gets much further in depth than CompTIA does. However, in my case, I will need a job soon as my current non-IT position will end in two days. I feel Network+ will be easier and faster to obtain. Possibly to pass as well.

I never enjoyed my studies, to be honest. I found the material quite boring and difficult too but I persisted with it because I had no idea what else to study. I ended up getting a 3.33 GPA, but it was a real struggle. With several more exams needed after college to become a fully qualified actuary, I never really had the motivation to continue. After working for 12 months as a trainee actuary in 2014, I veered way off course and became a freelance writer. I've been focusing a lot on information security topics in my writing. I find the field of information security more interesting to learn about, but that doesn't mean it's interesting to work in. Anyway, I am tired of being a freelance writer and I'm looking for a more traditional office job. I've decided the best way to go about this is to get a postgrad diploma. There are places available on either a cybersecurity diploma or a data analytics one. I am finding it difficult to choose the right path between these options. I prefer working independently over being heavily involved in team meetings and stuff like that. I have quite an analytical mind. Good at spotting details others might miss. I enjoy writing about complex ideas and communicating these ideas to a non-technical audience. I want to work in a career with good stability, relatively high demand, and wages that make it worth it to work full-time in an office. It's probably worth noting that I have zero coding experience. I've heard that a cybersecurity career warrants some good coding knowledge. Data analysts might get away with just knowing SQL and a small bit of Python?

When I took the position as an intern I worked with an application developer, while also doing minor database tasks. Now I currently am filling a role as a System Administrator, working with access control lists for a nation wide database.

I was also told I would be moved into a different position (Information Technology Management INFOSEC). I took and passed the exam last year, and am currently being told I don't actually need a Security clearance to perform the role, and my boss keeps telling me he is working on moving me over into the new position title. I have had multiple conversations with him talking about how not only is the security clearance needed, but the position title will help me in the future since it fits what I want to do. It has been almost a year and a half since I met the requirements they asked, and havent even started either process, while they just recently hired a recent graduate and started his process for a security clearance (computer engineer).

My main motivator for leaving is money as I feel I'm underpaid (in general and because of COVID). I have seven years of experience in networking and systems, a bachelor's in IT management, and held senior titles before in my field. I was hired as a systems engineer at a healthcare provider 5 months ago at 85K + full benefits (weak 401k match, health &amp; dental is good) + pension and 25 days of PTO (PTO = sick + holiday + accrued) and mainly took it because I figured hospitals weren't going to be financially impacted by COVID. Unfortunately, I was wrong and I made about 25%-30% less this year due to furloughs and reduced pay because of COVID. I feel resentful because I left a contract role ($68/hr) which was unaffected by COVID and ended up with reduced pay starting day 1. I would have stayed in my previous role if I had known. Anyways, without any COVID reductions, my usual hourly rate is around $46/hr. This position has top-notch job security but I don't really enjoy it. My initial plan going in was to put up with it until I could get into their cybersecurity or infrastructure security department but I don't know how long that'll take and money is my #1 motivator now. On the other hand, the contract role is a 1-year plus possible extension, contract-to-hire, $55/hr + health/dental role with a bigger company (manufacturing, more revenue) as Senior Network Analyst working on IPS. The hourly rate is less than I'd like and there isn't any PTO but I'm okay with both. Their FT benefits would be on par with my current company if I was able to convert over to FT. Leaving a FT position for a contract role is a risk I'm willing to take. If you were in my shoes, would you do? Stay safe out there!"

Last week I got into my final year and my college gave me a list of electives to choose from, from which I chose Network Information Security and Ethical Hacking ( I chose a few other electives too but since it wont be relevant here I wont mention them ) I also read an article today which described how to get into cybersec and reach the top, and in that it was mentioned in that I had 3 ways to get into this field, One by becoming a system admin, second by getting into networking and final one was being good in programming. Now when it comes to programming Im not an expert but Im not a total noob either, but networking and system administration is something I have no idea about So with keeping all that in mind I was thinking to go for a CCNA and Security+ certification, but since I have chosen electives related to network security and hacking, is it a good idea for me to do these ? I dont know if what I learn from my college would be enough Any other certifications you would recommend looking into ? And also what kind of job role should I apply for as a complete beginner, I have 1 year left to complete my undergrad and I want to learn as much as possible in this year Thank you for reading !"

I'm a current junior pursuing a Bachelors degree in Cybersecurity. My background: My school requires me to complete at least 6 weeks of professional IT experience (240 hours to be exact). Since I'm a junior, next summer is the only chance I got. I'm stressing over it quite a bit since the anxiety is getting to me. If I don't land an internship, then I can't technically graduate. Currently, I have a CompTIA Network+ cert and I'm planning on getting the Security+ by the end of this month. If that goes well, I will try and go for CySA+ before the 001 retires. I decided to get these to help my chances of getting an internship. My school, for some reason, doesn't emphasize certifications... How are we, students, supposed to get an internship without some actual knowledge that is only taught after the 2nd year? (this is a whole different rant.. i won't continue) I also applied to many companies last year for this summer(2020) but I never heard back from any of them. My question: I applied to all different kinds of IT intern positions last year but didn't get accepted. If I get the Security+ alone, or even CySA+, will it significantly impact my chances of getting an internship? I've been seeing many posts on this sub regarding help desk jobs and such, but I seriously don't know what I'm capable of. Also, if I were to get an internship and graduate with a good GPA, do I still start out at helpdesk? Would the value of my degree help me start at a better spot?"

I've never used it before and have a year left before I graduate. So obviously now I'm looking at using it so I don't get caught off guard in the future. How do you come up with projects for it while you're in school? Do you use school assignments or is this purely your own creations?

I always wanted to get into the CyberSecurity but wasted my time learning the System Admin world. For my questions: 1. Is Networking a highly recommend part for CyberSecurity? Would it be easier for me to chase Network+ vs. CCNA just to show that I know about Networking? 2. My weakness in IT is coding and having intermediate use of Linux. Is this a game over weakness in the CyberSecurity field? 3. Should I just go straight for CySA+ instead of Networking?"

For example, many job listings (I'm looking for a security analyst position) will state wanting a candidate with experience in IDS/IPS, VPN, Firewall, DLP, SIEM, Python, Bash, Powershell, LAN/WAN/WLAN, etc. Now, I could discuss those things from an academic standpoint more or less but I have no hands on skills with them outside of labs.

I've been a member of this forums for the last 3 years or so across a few reddit accounts and I just wanted to kind of share my story from zero experience to $45/HR. I don't really have that magical of a success story. I got out of the Navy back in 2016 after a few years of doing mechanical &amp; electrical work. I popped my GI bill cherry and headed off to college for a BA in cybersecurity. Around 2018 this school imploded and I was forced to find a job as I was living off the money that the GI bill was providing. Job 1: Technical Support Rep I working at a kiosk company paying $17.50 an hour. This job sucked ass. It was not really related to IT and main job duties included helping techs at the kiosk in person all over the country fix the pieces of shit. Lots of little moving parts, lots of downtime, and very long service calls as the machines are extremely complicated and the problems are generally unique as each kiosk is different. They gave me a raise to $17.94 6 months later and at the same time I got a cold call about a position as a service desk analyst at a health care company. Fast forward 2 weeks, I quit this job and move on. Job 2: Service Desk Analyst, $20/HR, Healthcare CO. This job taught me a lot, especially how to deal with problems that I have never faced before. I absorbed as much as I could over the next 6 months, updated my resume and just put it out on all the websites and just waited to see if I'd get any bites. Few weeks go by and I've fielded a few calls but one comes through offering a position in Identity &amp; Access Management with another Healthcare Company. I have absolutely none of the professional experience they're looking for, but I had a quick phone interview with them and convinced them to bring me in for an interview. During the interview they mentioned the Security+ certification and such, said it went well, and sent me on my way. Turns out that their hiring manager took LOA for 5 weeks and I was going to have to wait to hear back. I decide to get Sec+ ceritifcation, notify their team, and wait. Job 3: Identity &amp; Access Management Analyst, $25/HR, Healthcare CO, 1.5 years exp. Learning absolute shit loads of information. Doing great at my job. Picked up another certification, albeit rather lacking in terms of actual worth, I got the Identity Management Institutes ""Certified Identity Access Manager"" certification. Re-did my resume. Uploaded to every job board and applied literally all over the country for positions. Heard back from another Healthcare CO regarding another IAM opportunity that would be Full Time (I""ve been contracted at every position up until now). 35$ an hour. I accept and start the paperwork, and then another company calls me. They've got $85k/HR &amp; FTE to offer as well. I accept and back out of the other position. Fast forward a week, COVID cancels the FTE position I've just been offered and I'm left with a pile of shit in my hands. No job, nothing. Two weeks later, they call me back and offer me a contracted position making $45 an hour. Job 4: Identity &amp; Access Management Analyst, $45/HR, Healthcare CO, 2 years exp. Start date to be determined. I'm obviously very excited about the opportunity, the massive increase in wage, and the technology I'll be exposed to at the new organization. My advice to ya'll is to never stop learning, updating your resume, and being on the hunt. People are looking. They need smart guys. Learn your shit and market yourself. Thank you all for the advice you all have given to me as well, as my decisions up until this point have been heavily influenced off of this subreddit. Good luck everyone."

My original plan was to go back to my old school that is well respected for engineering and science but while looking into the cybersecurity degree I noticed that there are no certifications included at all in the 4 year program. But the local community College near me has an associates degree with 6 certs included into a 2 year program. I like the idea of an accelerated degree with a bunch of certs but all the jobs I see posted in my area ask for a bachelor's so I'm concerned no one will take an AAS seriously. The state will pay for up to 4 years at any college for my degree so it's all or nothing, which do you think would be better in the long run? Thanks"

Look at /r/techsupport. Random people, akin to every-day users in a corporate environment, will post questions to this sub which range from trivial to highly difficult problems, that *you* can help them through. I promise you these questions will exercise your ability to communicate with non-technical people, and provide an excellent strain on your general knowledge of common windows issues. This is an almost perfect way to get basic IT experience with **zero** cost, or risk of failure. If you're just starting to dive into the IT world, I suggest reading through the /r/techsupport/hot section, and read through the already answered and upvoted posts. In my experience, MUCH of IT knowledge is gained through constant exposure to the field, and simply viewing and understanding posts about technical issues will help build an understanding of 'everyday issues' If you're ready to challenge yourself, read and respond to /r/techsupport/new inquiries. I've been in the game for almost a decade and still get questions I don't know the answer to! Take an issue and work through the problem with the user until you get it resolved. If you do, congratulations, do it 10 more times to solidify it. If you don't, find the solution, remember the problem, and make it a goal to learn more about the situation the next time you're faced the the same thing! On a side note, I've been volunteering to mentor people who are interested in IT, and want to know more about specifics regarding the field. If you have questions, or want to know about general IT, or Cybersecurity, send me a PM and I'll be happy to guide you through my experiences!"

I would like to work in the red team, but I realized quickly that every companies that hire cybersecurity experts expect from them to build a strong defense (naturally), which is the blue team. I wanted to know if there are cybersecurity companies full of cybersecurity experts that are hired by other companies (like multinationals) to test their defenses and tell them where are the flaws? I would really like such a thing because it would mean working on the red team, but it would still be ethical hacking. I live near Montreal, so companies in the area would be really nice, but I would still like to know if such companies exist somewhere else."

I'm 38 this year, and I have a mostly useless BA in Art Studio (photography and graphic design), so I decided to switch to IT. I have my AAS in Network Systems Management plus my A+ and CCNA, but in the 2 years since I graduated I have only gotten one in-person interview. I cannot even get an entry-level help desk or customer support position in my area. Moving is not really an option, my wife works and our house is paid off. It's been 2 years and I now a newborn, so I am getting desperate. I am currently learning more about Linux to strengthen my work skills. Now here's the dilemma I am facing, decided to get back for a BS, but I am at my limit for undergraduate student loans, and my sister recommended a Master's (she has one). She said there's no point in getting yet another undergraduate degree, and at this point I might as well get the graduate degree. I have considered just getting more certifications, but so far I haven't gotten any benefit from the ones I already have. I think I should be specific about my certs and keep them career-oriented instead of just grabbing as many as possible. I've been looking at a MBA IT degree, or Cybersecurity, or even other IT degrees. But it seems that the most reasonable for this level of education would be the business-focused one. Would it benefit me more at this point (sunken costs, lack of a experience, future growth potential) to take the business route? While I am not opposed to CS, I just don't have the desire or experience to go the development side of things. ."

I have 2 current nontech jobs as a firefighter and EMT for a private ambulance company. With intern experience for about a month during my senior year of high school. I will be attending the rest of my classes online until I graduate. When I started applying to positions, Covid-19 happened and like many, I lost a lot of positions due to the inability to work on-site or just company cutbacks in general. Fortunately, I have kept in contact with a tech recruiter who has been trying to get me into an entry-level position within help desk or as an IT tech. I had a couple of interviews and jobs that fell through. Finally, I got some luck and had four interviews this past week. 1st internship: I had a successful first round for an internship at a small startup location, about 25 minutes away. Sounds like a really good experience, a small team, a slight increase in pay, help desk setting with a lot of hands-on hardware repair. Waiting for a second onsite interview with a technical challenge. 2nd Full-time job with a 5-month contract: Larger company, solely helpdesk for internal clients, a lot of push to move up the chain by providing training, certifications paid in full, Gyms on campus that are free for employees, tuition assistance, a big increase in pay. Longer commute through city traffic. Tuesday  Saturday schedule 8-5 Waiting on the second interview. 3rd Fall Internship: Larger company, Helpdesk focus with a lot of communication with other parts of the team, cybersecurity based, longer commute, bigger pay increase. Waiting on the second interview. 4th and final: Larger area based company, IT tech role with various tasks of dealing with software, hardware, and other technical troubleshooting, 2-minute commute to the main office but slight commute to other area offices for IT projects, Slight pay decrease by 85 cents. 9-5 Monday-Friday. The company changed the role from a 3-week project to a 5-month contract with possibility of staying fulltime, I was the only candidate to have the role changed to a long position, they liked what I had to offer. I just need to sign the papers and I can start by Monday. The 4th and final company was sent over by the recruiter, besides the slight pay decrease, I think the role could be a good fit. I like the 1st internship with the size of the team. I like the products they make. I told the final company that I would like to hold off until I get my other options back but with the second interviews, I dont want to risk my chance especially when they extended the role. I am just wondering what to do, I told the last company I would like to move forward. I am hoping that the other roles will get back to me before I start just to see my other offers to I dont kick myself by choosing this role. What would you recommend? I have no workplace history of IT-related experience so having an offer got me excited to gain some more experience. Am I moving too quickly or should I wait and see what my other offers are before I move forward?"

I work for this mid to large organization, fast pace, lots of changes, and exposure to lots of technologies. I hold a position as a System Admin (but really doing Senior to Engineering level work). In general, a great company to work for, great people, but not perfect of course. I have been doing systems work for about four years now but always wanting to transition to a cyber security role, which has always been my long-term goal. I have a BA focused on security and security certs such as Security+ and PCNSA. Even though I am not part of the security team, I do maintain our endpoint protection solution which also includes monitoring and sometimes some simple IR. I manage SSO and now working on deploying MS Office 365 EOP and ATP. The Cybersecurity team has grown substantially these past years. Before COVID, there was a position for a Cyber Security Engineer, which I applied for, but soon after the position was put on hold and disappeared. Yesterday, I was told that there is this new position for a SOC Analyst. This seems like a good way into a Security role but my concerns are (assuming I get this role after applying): 1. Would it be considered a lateral move? 2. Would it be worth moving from my position which exposes me to some extend to security technologies? 3. In regards of responsibilities, how would these positions differ? 4. Is a SOC analyst considered an entry level position? Thanks"

I'm currently working on a 6-class networking certificate designed to prepare you for the networking certificates, after which I want to pursue a bachelors degree in networking/cybersecurity. Right now I'm in my 3rd class, Cisco Devices, which will end mid July giving me a month off before fall semester starts. I'll have about 25 hours per week to dedicate towards something after completing my current class. The other day I had a conversation with my neighbor who just learned I'm going to school and was telling me how great it is that I'm taking this path. He is an IT manager for a large company and we live in the Baltimore/DC metro area. I asked and he told me I should easily be able to get some interviews for entry-level jobs (most likely help-desk) after completing one of the networking certificates. I know a month probably isn't enough time to prepare for one of the exams, but I'm also considering taking half of fall off from school to prepare if that's not a bad idea. I take 8 week classes, so that is something I could do. I had an email conversation with my professor asking him for his advice about this matter and he had some good advice and told me he has a study program if I wanted to take the CCNA, but I could ask and see if he has material for the other exams. My questions are, do you think this is too early for me to be trying to study for and attempt taking one of these exams considering what I said above and the fact that I'm only 3 classes deep, or should I wait until I complete my university certificate program? The reason I seem like I'm rushing this is because I can't stand my current job and I'm pretty desperate to get out and I'm not even sure how secure it is considering this pandemic. Also, which certificate's would be good for trying to land an interview for help desk jobs or something equally entry level. By the way, don't have former IT experience."

I've been a little lost as to where I'm headed with my career in IT. First some backstory: I got my first help desk job fresh out of high school, in 2006 (I'm currently 32). I knew a guy and he just brought me on board. They taught me a lot of what I know about workstation hardware and software. I went to a few semesters of classes at a local college but dropped out. After some other similar jobs, I found it hard to continue getting work without credentials, so I started looking. In 2014 I took courses for and passed my cert exams for A+, Network+, and Security+. The thing is that I don't feel like I absorbed most of the material and mainly used this to get shiny papers to wave at potential employers. It worked. In 2015, I managed to land a job as a Network Admin. I managed 100 users around 15 different sites. I had big shoes to fill, but I was really good at ""fake it til you make it."" Plus I outsourced most server/network maintenance to a third party. I mainly took care of the workstation stuff, while learning how to work with the servers as I went. We had a few file/print/SQL/Remote access servers at different sites, but nothing fancy. It was going well and I really learned a lot, especially since I could just call for backup from the outsourced IT team when I got stuck. That job went South mid last year, around the time that I took a hard look at myself and realized I was treading water, and I wanted to beef up my experience. I also let my certs expire, which I'm kicking myself for. I've been working in a non-tech related field since then. I've decided I want to use the Network Admin experience that I've gained and dive into the world of Cybersecurity. I'm currently taking courses at the same local college to get my Associates but I've got no direction beyond that. I know the job market sucks due to the current state of the world, but I'm trying to stay optimistic. Here's where I'm stuck: I've let complacency get the better of me over the last four years and I feel like I'm out of the loop. I'm about to take my Security+ exam again (one of the college courses doubled as a prep course), but which skills should I work on after that? Which certs should I get to build off of the experience that I already have? If I'm only learning new skills part time, am I years from even finding another job in IT? Any input would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for the help! **TL;DR: Worked in IT 2006-2014. Was a Network Administrator 2015-2019. Lost job and got lazy so certs expired. I want to pick up my feet and work in Cybersecurity, but I'm lost. I'm 32. What skills and credentials would I want to work on to get into the field?**"

Graduate in May 2021, go part-time into a Bachelor's degree, work full-time in the field (obv if I can get a job) 1. I work full-time now so I can handle it 2.

I have my CCNA R&amp;S under my belt (got it in February), and I work with a lot of really lazy people who have been there for 10 years. People say you are the average of the 10 people you spend the most time around, and I already am starting to feel my environment start to wear on me. I have tried reaching out to the networking team in my company but they aren't really looking to expand at all. It might just be me, but I feel as if there are a LOT of people trying to get into networking jobs, and yet a lot of things are becoming automated in lieu of employing more network engineers. Judging from what I've seen using linkedin premium there are like 100 applicants for each job posting, and something like 40-60% have a masters degree, the rest have bachelors degrees. In the couple of months I have been looking, I have really only seen 1 or 2 job postings that are actually looking for newly graduated CCNA's / entry level networking gigs. Most want 5 years of experience! Recently I have been trying to learn more about linux system administration (going for my RHCSA and RHCE) along with some very light attemps to pick up some python. I also have a homelab I tinker around with. My main goal right now is to get a job either in system administration or networking making 60kish a year, but I am wondering how to get there efficiently. I have been toying around with the idea of getting a bachelors degree at WGU, either in Network Sec or Cybersecurity. I could get some more certifications along the way, but I already have my CCNA and thats kind of the highest level certification included in the degree. I might be expecting too much with the experience/schooling I have, but how can I get a better job? What would you do if you were me?"

As a bit of background, I'm a 20-year old in central **TX** who's had some experience in IT, but no degree. Due to financial limitations, I'm looking at getting an Associate's degree, but am questioning where to proceed from here. During high school, I also attended an early college academy which earned me credit with that Community College, high-placement in collegiate-level cybersecurity competitions, two internships with fairly major companies that gave me approximately 1.5 years of entry-level Security, Technical Documentation, and DevOps experience, and some low-tier online certs. I dropped out of a 4-year degree due to financial constraints, but even so I realize I'm probably ahead of the curve in terms of experience, and am questioning where to proceed from here. My current goal is a entry/junior-level position in a sysadmin, networking, infrastructure, or developer role. I have no interest in management long-term and don't currently have the funds to pursue a pure-certs route. My main options (as I see them) are as follows, but I'm open to any other suggestions. - My college academy was working towards an Associate's with a help-desk concentration. This is a tempting offer since I'm only a semester's worth of credits from completion, but I also really wouldn't want to be in a help-desk role. - I'm significantly further away from an Associate's in Information Security, but still have some overlapping credits towards it. This is much more suited to my future career goals, but I'm unsure if the concentration would benefit me in the job market. - Enter the job market as is, with an eye towards finding a job that offers assistance towards a degree and certs. This is my preferred option if I can find a job in my chosen field that offers those benefits, but I'm unsure if I would qualify for those. Main questions: - Is there a major difference between an Associate's in Help Desk vs Info Security in terms of job prospects? - Would I be able to enter the job market in my chosen fields (or along the path to my chosen fields) with any of the above plans? Any and all guidance would be vastly appreciated, thank you!"

And vice versa, I scrolled through people who work as a security engineer at Google and many of them tote degrees from Carnegie Mellon and Georgia Tech. With these goals in mind (working at a top tech company) would it be worth it to leave my current Masters Program that I am almost finished with to pursue the OMSCS at Georgia Tech (starting this Fall of 2020)?

Im seeking advice on 2 things: 1. How to gain more skills in my IT career so that I can transition to a more technical role. 2. If I decide not to delve into something too technical, what type of roles will be the best fit with my work experience? Background: About 15+ years of work experience in financial auditing before I switched to an IT audit role about 3 years ago. I am relatively well paid and my job isnt stressful per se. I also have a CISA certification. My dilemma is that I switched to IT Audit to gain better exit opportunities in the IT/Cyber field and I am now ready for change. However every time I look at job postings I feel intimidated because I none of the skillsets mentioned align with what I think I want to do - which is delving into something more technical just to get a better understanding of IT/Cyber. I know that its a broad field and Im still trying to hone in on what could be a good fit but job titles/descriptions like Cybersecurity Analyst, Security Operations Center, Incident response, Cyber Engineer, ISSO etc have piqued my interest because they seem to cover a lot of skillsets but my qualifications arent a match. I have spoken to some people who think that theres no point trying to go back and learn the technical angle when i can leverage my current experience. So thats an option as well but ideally I would lean towards picking up more tech skills to get a better understanding of this field. I would appreciate any insight on courses, certifications, and ways to expand my skillset so that I can break out of my current mold. I could stay in my current role and coast but I really want to break out of my comfort zone. Thanks in advance."

I work in a configuration lab where I install hardware and software, OS images, etc. for hundreds of our customers. I started at the lowest level technician position and have been promoted three times and am now a Senior Technician. I started with A+ and have added Network+, Security+, Server+, CySA+, and Linux+. I'm currently studying for Pentest+ and learning python. I want to move on soon into an entry level security position, but I struggle with the confidence to apply to many jobs, mostly for two reasons. For one I fear that much of my knowledge is largely theoretical, having attained certifications like CySA+ but not really had an opportunity to be hands on with much of the material. I know I learned a lot when I got my current job and would do the same in a new security job, but its hard to know what employers are actually expecting in terms of experience. Which leads to the second reason which is most job postings seem to want people with much experience in a broad range of skill sets. It seems everyone wants someone with years of experience already and I don't know how that translates to me and my position right now.

I know very little about this, except that you need to earn a minimum of a Masters in Bioinformatics and a PhD is preferred. I know plans can change along the way. We've been looking at different State universities with online Bachelors in IT. Several offer IT degrees. One looked interesting in that it offers several choices of concentrations once you do the core courses. They offer concentrations in Critical Infrastructure Management, Cyber Forensics, Cybersecurity, Integrated Digital Media And Game Design, Networking Technologies And Administration, Software Engineering, Web Applications Development and Informatics. The other online State University we were looking at offers a Healthcare Services &amp; Informatics Administration degree. This offers more healthcare related courses, but seems lighter in computer science courses. I'm kind of thinking the first university might be a better choice as my son expressed interest in cyber security, computer forensics and bioinformatics. So if he took a few introductory courses, he could then pick a concentration. And I would think his degree would be more marketable. I think the second choice would be good if he were to look for a career in healthcare administration, but might not give as much flexibility. What's the general thought if any of you have pursued a career in bioinformatics or IT in a healthcare environment? I don't want to steer my son in the wrong direction. I have a CompSci degree but have been in networking forever, and don't know much about Healthcare or Bioinformatics or even what it takes to land a job in today's working environment."

Last month I received my degree in Operations Management and Information Systems. Primarily did a mix of business administration and data science/analysis. I started school leaning on the business side but quickly discovered the info systems side interested me much more. Anyways, Im a month into a job working mainly in finance and I absolutely fucking hate it. I would love to continue going down this info systems track and theres a top school nearby who has a one year masters program in Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity. Based on the course list, it sounds like a natural continuation of the things I was learning about in IS. The only issue is that I fear my lack of a computer science/engineering background leaves me largely unprepared (despite assurances from the school that my background is fine). Im kind of lost right now and feeling a lot of regret for not pursuing something more IT focused in my undergrad, but is this something that you guys think would be a good idea? Just looking for some advice on where to move forward."

So I've been working for in Cybersecurity for almost a decade now. Thinking of going back to school to learn what I may have missed out in the working world that may help me grow in my career My options at this time are: UTDallas - MSITM URL UTAustin- MSISP URL Both programs are online and meant for working professionals. The MSITM at UTD touches a lot of ground in technology management and offers lots of electives. The MSISP at UTAustin appears to be a relatively new program and is offered by their ""iSchool"" or school of information that traditionally appears to offer programs in information management, library and record keeping type of stuff. From what I understand, it has 10 fixed courses without any electives. I'm torn on which school to go for. UTAustin ranks higher as an institution but the courses offered seem to be very theoretical and abstract, compared to UTDallas which has very pragmatic courses and the program itself is offered by their business school. Please help me decide."

Just looking for a bit of career advice, as Im a bit uncertain of the path I should take. Background: Just graduated with a BA in Math and CS and a BS in Data Science. Worked a contact-to-hire role starting in software testing for a year, networked my way into information security somehow and have been working here for 3 months or so. Still a contractor technically, but being converted to FTE soon. I absolutely love the culture of my team, but outside of that... not so much. I work in healthcare so technology is a bit outdated. On top of that, my role is primarily the governance side of things so less technical than I wouldve liked. Dealing with policies and at times I feel like my job is an overglorified version of help desk. Not as challenging as I wouldve liked, leaving me unfulfilled. Before I got my current job, I was looking into software engineering roles, did not even consider going into cybersecurity but I really like it. Our cybersecurity dept as a whole is great since they encourage everyone to keep learning. But I feel like my decision to settle into this role was a bit hasty, as I didnt really apply to other jobs and it might be tough to do so now with the current job market. Feeling a bit of FOMO and wondering if I should have went the developer route, but I dont think its for me. I enjoy coding as a hobby and I think Ill leave it at that. I think a nice middle ground would be AppSec, maybe focused on cloud computing. I recently passed the AWS Developer exam and I do a bunch of self-learning, but with COVID and my own concerns about my career, Ive been feeling a bit burnt out by the end of the workday to do anything. I am afraid that Ill become complacent in my current role and lose my skill for technical work. From what Ive read, it seems that most people start from more operational roles before pivoting. I can keep upskilling in my own time but experience and mentorship would be nice so that I dont feel too unfocused. I was a bit proactive and sought out a mentor of sorts at my company on my own (meetings 2x/month), but we dont collaborate in our day-to-day and I still have work to handle for my current role anyway. What would be the best way to make this move myself given my experience? Any recommended certs (with company paying for course + exam)? Would it be worth staying at my company even if theyre a bit old-fashioned?"

However, in the last 5 years, Ive shifted my focus to the technical and have spent a TON of time, energy, and money honing my technical skills: Obtained a B.S. in IT Obtained Network+, Security+, CySA+ Learned python, power shell Created a VMware home lab Taught myself Nessus, Splunk, nmap, Wireshark Researched Security Analyst/Engineer jobs Spent time in Windows CLI and Linux bash Learned about Linux, Windows administration The list goes on........ Im finally getting traction with my efforts and actually have 5 job opportunities lined up for SysAdmin and Security Engineer positions. Nothing is promised, but Ive been offered interviews. Now that dreams might actually become reality, as always, Im questioning myself. Heres why: Security Engineering is high stress Professional Development is a constant Ill have to be on call outside of working hours Im concerned that this type of work will have a profound effect on my personal/family life As I consider the options laid out in front of me, I connected with a mentor of mine that Ive known for the past 7 years. He has been down the same path Im on right now. He was a SysAdmin, Security Engineer for Splunk, LogRhythm, Elastic, and now....hes moving away from the hyper technical and into Sales Engineering for Elastic. He learn the ins and outs of the software functionality and then demos the software/fields questions with organizations that are set to purchase Elastic software. In never though Id want to be in sales, but Im starting to think that Im focusing on my weaknesses (technology) and not leveraging my strengths (soft skills/sales). Here are the pros to this path: You have base salary + commission You dont have to keep up with certs, security You dont work 8-5...instead its demo centric Youre not on call You dont have to do a MASSIVE amount of professional development outside of working hours You get to travel Youre providing demos for clients that already want to purchase the software, not cold sales Pay is ~40% higher to start Considering the information above, I feel like I could leverage soft skills/sales experience, apply my technical knowledge and be very successful in this arena. My questions to Security Engineers in the community are: Are you happy working as a Security Engineer? Are you seeing the pay you expected? Do you love, breath, eat cybersecurity? Are you extremely stressed about work? Do you enjoy working with your team members? Would you befriend them? Is your personal life consumed by your professional development? Training, certs, etc. Are seeing substantial advancement opportunities? Does anybody in this community work as a Sales Engineer for a tech organization? If so, did you ever have the same internal conversation that Im having with myself right now? Im feeling I might be able to get further much faster by leveraging skills Ive already proven I have."

Is it worth spending an additional 10k in fees for a masters degree in the field? What IT roles can you think of for someone with a background in Accounting and Finance + Computer Science? \*// I was dead set on accounting when applying to university, but now Im considering a career in IT. I started from watching various YouTube channels focused on tech and IT as something merely interesting between studying for the exams in my first year, to attending some workshops in London and teaching myself fundamentals from Coursera, Udemy etc. Now Im here considering trying a career in IT after I graduate. Im genuinely amazed by the work culture, opportunities down the line, entrepreneurial spirit and more. It just sounds more fun. Here is some information about me:  22-year-old male  currently studying BSc Accounting and Finance at a Russel Group university in London  Ill be starting my final year this autumn (graduating in 2021) and should either enter the workforce or pursue a masters degree  school has strong links with Big4 and LOTS OF alumni employed in the regional offices  degree has accreditation from both ACCA and CIMA (an equivalent of CPA here in England), and Ill be part-qualified when I finish the course. Im exempted from a large part of the exams, and I only need to pass 3 or 4 more and prove three years of work experience to become fully chartered (to cut a long story short: you need 12 or 13 exams passed in total depending on the qualification and have documented experience to apply for membership)  I didnt grow up in the UK but can stay here and enjoy the opportunities thanks to my passport.  I took higher-level Geography, Social Sciences (a combination of econ, international relations, law, sociology) and English for my high school leaving qualifications.  Maths at standard level, more than GSCE but a bit more narrow curriculum than A-Levels Maths, Id say. Additionally, I completed a class in maths for accountants which covered calculus, statistics, linear functions, quadratic functions etc. in my first year.  I took out a loan from student finance here in the UK which covers 9250 yearly fees and the repayment threshold is 26,575 a year. Basically, 9% from anything I make above 26,575 goes towards the loan, but If I make less I dont start repaying, and after 30 years the debt is written off. It does not affect your credit rating as well.  I come from rather an average household (medical background but not doctors) and money is important, and Id like to feel comfortable. However, I believe that happiness rises only until some earnings level. The earning potential is there in accounting for anyone wondering. A graduate makes around 30k in London and pay for newly qualified is between 50-55k. With two years of PQE, you can total in 60-65k a year, and six figures are possible before turning 30 if you are willing to climb up the corporate ladder. I definitely consider it a comfortable salary. However, the chances I can break into banking are very, very slim (Big 4 is very competitive, and it is a massive privilege to qualify with them but still nowhere near as competitive). Ive read through a couple of threads and surprisingly saw people switching from strictly finance jobs to technology and it got me very interested. I came across thought masters degrees in Computer Science (a standard full-time masters degree is one year in England opposite to, e.g. two years in the US) and it is treated either as a conversion course or supplement to your degree. An example: [URL I think similar courses are offered by Imperial College London, Manchester, Birmingham and a few more institutions. Ive heard amazing stories about:  a Biology grad completing such course and working in Bioinformatics  or a Psychology grad taking classes in Human-Computer Interaction and later working as a UX Designer. I guess I would focus on modules useful for accountancy and finance and base my dissertation around them. I was looking at positions in Business Intelligence, a technology consultancy, financial software, business and systems analysts, and especially IT audit and cybersecurity. Ive done my research, and the last option seems particularly appealing to me. Its a growing field with international work opportunities, challenging, lots of space to grow and acquire new skills, incredible salaries and plenty of contracting opportunities. Employers are willing to pay for your professional qualifications as well, such as CISSP. Salaries in excess of 80k+ and day rates for contractors at 800 are not unheard of, and I would like to maximize my earnings, stop renting and buy a house at some point. I will be 23 when I finish my bachelor with my mummy and daddy still paying a large fraction of my London rent at least until I finish my studies. I'm grateful for it, but I hope you understand where I'm coming from. Yet, over some level, money stops being the most important factor for me, and I would like to genuinely enjoy what I do. Working in banking in the technology department in cybersecurity sounds both exciting and stimulating. And now Im here wondering and looking for insight from someone working in IT if my skillset would be sufficient? Would be the MSc in Computer Science paired with professional certificates enough to break into the field? Or is it just crying for the moon and somewhat reserved for grads with advanced degrees in the area? Due to the fees and lost earnings potential, I would instead not go back to school for another degree (e.g. BSc Information Technology). Masters degree is already costly, and I would cover the cost partially by the loan and savings. Would you just stick to the accounting path in that case or take the risk and try the IT path? Is it worth combining in the long run? Or just keep it as a hobby which one should pursue next to a full-time accounting job? What are maybe some other IT fields/jobs that you could recommend for one with such a background?"

I recon the main question is how valuable is the degree? Would it increase the pay rate drastically or would certification and go ahead and get experience and get started be better?"

More recently though I have decided that I can not go through life without knowing I did not try to follow my dream and try to become a SEAL. Even if I dont become a SEAL the Navy will help pay off my student loans, which I took out around 70k. I understand that there are tech jobs in the military but my dream is to go for special warfare. I plan to continue/start my IT career after I serve (if I serve). I am just worried about such a long gap between graduating and then coming out of the military (likely 4-7 years), I understand it will be hard to bounce back but its a risk Im willing to take. Any thoughts/advice on how I can bounce back quickly or what I can do to prepare myself on holding off my IT career?"

I also heard (from many YouTube videos) that I would need to have some good IT experience before diving into cybersecurity to begin with, especially because I don't plan on going to college in the long run, which also means I need to become certified. Im currently studying CompTIA's IT fundamentals so I definitely have a lonng way to go from here but im not sure what certificate I would need exactly.

The fitness industry has fallen apart due to COVID, and now I'm wanting to go into IT as well, especially because IT has the flexibility to work from home when things like this happen. I have ZERO experience with IT work, though. I started studying A+ about 3 weeks ago using Professor Messer, and it is so new to me. I got a study guide from amazon and took the chapter 1 quiz to see how my studying is going. Apparently, it's going crappy, because I failed the exam miserably! My friend keeps telling me to take A+, then Network+ and then Security+. I'm going very slowly- I like the visual learning, but I need the book for the theory, and I could use a buddy (I guess) so I know I can keep myself on track and have someone to which I can ask questions. Before I go any further, what do people think of this track? I was thinking about going into security, but then should I just do some cybersecurity courses? Or is there something online that allows for visual learning and human interaction that isn't gonna put me in the poorhouse (I'm on unemployment making a third of what I used to make). Or is A+ the first step no matter what? Does anyone have advice or suggestions? Is there anyone like me in this boat that maybe wants to pair up? Thanks."

I thought i'd share my story of not figuring out my career path until later in life. TLDR * Born in Toronto Ontario Canada * Attended highschool, was fascinated with computers, building them, troubleshooting etc. * Attended College, jumped 3 majors * Graduated University * IT rotational program * Cloud / DevOps Role **College:** I never really knew what I wanted to in Community College. I was told from a young age that I had ADD, to which my immigrant parents did not believe and pulled me out of my elementary school. I have a feeling a lot of 90s kids were mis-diagnosed, but that's another conversation. In College, i accepted a marketing program. I then dropped out and transferred to supply chain after a month. I ended up taking Supply Chain Management, as end-to-end production of finished goods and products was fascinating to me, however as the program become technically more complex, I lost interest. There's only so many bill of materials, ERP systems, queue optimization I can handle. I was at a pivotal point in my life: accepting a co-op at a distinguished electrical firm as a Junior Buyer and graduate in 6 months or transferring the program into something general, piggy-backing into university. I chose the later. I transferred into Business Administration, added 1 extra year, and graduated with a fairly useless diploma. It did, all things considered, provide me with a strong business background which proved useful later on. I was able to use the grades and transfer into a Business Technology Management (similar to a MIS program). **University:** I had finally made it to university which was a life-long dream, and re-started my education at 24. I was able to write-off a majority of my electives through the transfer and adhered to the core courses such as software development, database management, systems design etc. Being mature and older in University was definitely a drag down for me, a lot of my friends were starting their professional lives, getting jobs, or settling down. I had not figured out my life yet, but I knew, my career was tech and this time, i wouldn't alter from my passion as a high school kid. I did fairly decent in University, however, a lot of my pressure was internal competing with my past self, I had a deep feeling that I was losing time and I needed to try harder, work harder and get the BETTER internships then my peers. This led me down to mild depression, playing catch up with my younger self who failed and did not understand his life's purpose or direction, a bit existentialist. I lucked out and got 2 fantastic internships. One internship was working for a Government Crown Hydro corporation and the other was a top 5 finance company in Canada. **1st internship:** Once again, the slow depressing feeling of not being adequate crept in. I WAS HIRED, so i have to know everything right?! They hired me for a reason, so as soon as i started, I become annoyed with my lack of competency and not understanding technical systems fully such as MS Access, Excel, SQL. The frustration showcased on my boss who had hired me and I'll always recall a conversation I was not meant to here: ""I need someone more CompSci, he's not CompSci, what can we do about this?."" Moving 1.5hrs away from home to a new city where i knew no one and now the constant pressure of my boss weighed me down. In retrospect, it was a fuel to do the best I can at this job, get the experience, and get out. A lot my exposure was first to Excel / PowerPoint where I prepared 100 slides a week about Excel graphs, tables, PivotTables etc. This led my hunger to improve and be the best by learning VB Coding. I was able to automate a lot of the menial boring tasks and conduct different analytics on business processes for teams. Albeit, understanding supply chain processes was extremely confusing and still is. This led me down to managing my first senior management level meeting where we tracked workgroups, teams, production issues and I prepared a deck for each week. My business acumen was developed through a lot of these interactions. The real stickler was coding and automation which lit a giant fire for having a passion to develop effective, seamless workflows. **2nd internship:** I had regained a lot of confidence after going back to university, being in the workplace and developing automated solutions. This led me to my 2nd internship and also current employer. I worked as a business systems analyst who reported on various IT project metrics + excel guinea pig. Once again, i supported a company-wide Windows10 migration with a lot of senior management exposure. I also brought my love for VB/Macro scripting to this role and found different ways to automate a lot of the in-efficient Excel oriented tasks that teams do. There is a lot of technical debt in large Corporations even at a basic level of really understanding how to effectively use and build Excel. Let's just say there are tons of bad business practices and one of them is tracking hundreds of projects in Excel Workbooks. This internship was short - 4 months, but the big takeaway from here is networking. Networking with your managers, directors, and senior level staff helps build paths into opportunities. I heavily networked with my Director who had suggested I sign-up for a ""IT rotational management program."" I decided to throw my hat in the ring and apply. I eventually went through 3 interviews, Director level, then VP level for the final round. I met with the previous Director for a coffee chat and advised her I was in final rounds and would truly appreciate a recommendation. She provided the recommendation and I can say without a doubt, she is probably what led me down the path to pursuing my IT career further, albeit, with a lot of mixed feelings. **IT Rotational Program:** **Salary**: $60k + 8% salary increase (every 6 months for 2 years) + 5% annual bonus I was provided a offer letter 1 year ahead of graduation which was pretty amazing. If you've made it this far, you're thinking that's a golden ticket and he's set? Nope, once again a bit of anxiety and 2nd guessing comes into play. Rotational programs are awesome, you can land good programs and get 6-10% increases every 6 months or when a rotation ends. In my case, it was like this, however a large majority of programs are not structured this way. The real downside for me personally was I was trading of ""hard"" experience for a ""soft"" rotational exposure into many different IT related roles. My roles were broken down into Solution Architect, CyberSecurity, and Big Data. Looking back, it seemed like this type of exposure is a jack of all trades, but master in none. The exposure across the organization into different faucets is something that proved highly valuable for me as i ended the program. I learned a lot of python, VBA, SQL, Hadoop domain knowledge, AWS, and general/ Cloud IT architecture. A lot of these roles had straight lines of sight in Directors, AVPs, and VP level meetings that I was apart of. Once again, I was able to build credibility and network through this exposure into my future roles. I knew I wanted to be involved in either Data Analytics or AWS Cloud. I setup my LinkedIn with job posting notifications daily for my current company, and hounded internal job postings every.single.day. Any job posting I saw, I had a DIRECT line of sight into the org structure, teams, and management. A lot of postings I saw, i researched the team. Looked up team members LinkedIn Profiles, gauged there experiences, to understand what I was getting into and how I can develop professionally alongside my peers. The finance company I am in had a mature crowd, being strategic and finding a good team with a good fit is important. As job postings came, I coffee chatted with managers and directors for best-fits. I got turned down from a few internal jobs. Hell, I interviewed externally as well! Biggest disappointment -- interviewed at a finance company competitor for a data position, i bombed the interview and received a rejection notice as i stepped foot into my car. That one stung. Perseverance is critical, I have been through disappointment, depression, and anxiety before. This is not stopping me this time! I eventually found a AWS Cloud Administrator position. Cloud Administrator position was a bit of a stretch given my domain knowledge is beginner/mid level around networking, databases, and security. However, after multiple coffee chats with the Director (5 in total), he had finally extended a offer. I had finally landed my dream job at 29. **Current Role - Cloud Infrastructure / DevOps** **Salary: 96k** Through a long path, I finally had gotten my dream career. In my current role, we're a liason between development teams, business, and infrastructure. We manage, deploy, configure our data/analytics AWS Services (EMR, Glue, SageMaker, EC2s, Lambdas, ETL, etc.). The beginning of the role was tough as my AWS knowledge was very limited, but I had a hunger to learn about architecture and automation which married my 2 passions from earlier experiences. I studied for the SAA cert, failed by 5 questions, planning to re-write again. I now am a Solution Architect on the business side and DevOps engineer on the Infra side. We are Canada's largest institutions leveraging the AWS SageMaker ML/AI platform. I get to steer executive meetings and automate using tools such as Jenkins, Ansible, Artifactory, Boto3, Python, Linux, Bash etc. Prior to this, i barely knew any Linux or Bash. It's been a long path, but I finally feel comfortable in my own skin. Cloud is a interesting space, as innovations happen monthly, and what's new today, is outdated within months. There's rapid advancements in the technological innovation and companies are adapting as fast as they can. Enterprise work has been fun, albeit, i do hate the red-tape. Organizational Silos, processes management, sign-offs etc. it can be very annoying. Although, being a publicly traded company, i digress. I did attempt to escape Enterprise culture and red-tape by interviewing at Amazon and another Series C startup. I made it to final rounds for both companies and received a Amazon offer for a Solution Architect, but ended up turning it down. **After-thoughts:** You'll notice that I did not focus a lot on what Certs do I have (because i have none) or my technical skills acquired over my short professional tenure. There's a reason for that and it was alluded to in a another post. Soft skills, networking, business management, and understanding how to combine all of this with your technical knowledge is what makes a great candidate. Going the extra mile to network is a truly dying skill imho. Being a millennial (hate this term, born in 90), I see a lot of my generation forgetting the soft aspect that comes to business, the soft skills that close the deals, create change, push management in certain directions. That is something that is needed more in IT. Understanding that we only make it as far as our comfort zone allows. Pushing outside of the bubble and doing new things such as networking, coffee chats, and learning a new skill you might not need now, but in the future will pay off. As someone who still tends to think about all the time I feel like i've wasted closing my 30s, remember, it's about the experience and what you build out of it. A lot of the wasted time, no sense of direction are all seeds being planted to build out success later on in life. I hope this post helps those find solace during these difficult times and helps others with providing a sense of direction."

TL;DR at the bottom. The Coronavirus has finally hit home. I was unexpectedly let go from my job as a network admin on Friday last week and Im hoping to use this unemployment opportunity to switch gears in my career. But first, a little back story: my career started over 10 years ago in tier 1 helpdesk, then moved into operations/monitoring, then back to tier 2 desktop support and finally into network/telecom for the last 5 years or so. I dont hate networking, but it doesnt blow my proverbial skirt up and I admittedly applied for the internal job posting to get away from my tier 2 desktop support manager more than anything else. Ive always been interested in server and virtualization-type stuff and have had several home servers running various Linux-based OSes with web GUI front ends. Im constantly tinkering with them and trying out new applications in Docker. Ive built out Windows domain environments at home in virtual machines running on ESXi complete with AD controllers, DHCP, DNS, etc. and then thought OK cool, now what do I do with this setup? and scrapped it but valued the learning experience. I also run Linux on my laptops so I am forcing myself to become more comfortable with it. My question is: if I want to switch gears into systems administration so that Im able to get into a field that is more personally rewarding and interesting to me, what is the cert I should look into getting now that is: 1. going to get me a job quickest once companies start hiring again 2. not going to cost a fortune since I no longer have a steady income 3. that Im able to study for and take the test at home online since I have no interest in going to a testing center to get the virus? Im thinking that the RHCSA is going to be too advanced to get without formal classroom study sessions, so maybe the Linux+ would be good to get (although I havent seen many/any jobs that are specifically Linux admins  just a preferred/nice to have skillset in the description). I think I could probably handle getting the MCSA on my own and lab via VMs again to practice, although it looks like Id have to pick a more specific discipline and then pursue the MCSE. Im also open to/interested in DevOps/cloud stuff too in AWS/Azure/Google Cloud Platform and have taken the AWS free cert on their products but Im not sure if getting another more OS-specific cert would be more beneficial prior to one of those. Im also absolutely terrible at coding/scripting and dont really have much interest in trying to teach myself after I couldnt pick it up in college. I can look at code and tell you whats going on but couldnt code from scratch. Im also not opposed to Security+ because I know cybersecurity is very hot right now. Network+/CCNA is a last resort, as its what my most recent experience is in, but Im trying to transition out of the field if possible. Basically, I want to get whatever cert will make me most marketable now and in the future, and will demand a higher salary in the long haul, although at this point being more happy with my job will suffice. TL;DR - I lost my job and am looking into getting a certification to accelerate new job placement but not sure what discipline/niche will look best on my resume/LinkedIn profile to get me back into the workforce ASAP. Server admin type jobs are what Im looking for but considering the following certs: Linux+/RHCSA, MCSA/MCSE, DevOps type certs, and Security+. Network+/CCNA is also an option but Id like to transition more into server admin roles."

That's the kind of position I would like to have in the next 5 years or so, not still just a really overpaid Jira admin. At my current company we are growing and should be hiring some other application support engineers onto a team that I would theoretically lead, so that will help. My main concern is that B.A. in Video Game Design is going to hold me back eventually. Before I kind of landed in/settled on this Atlassian stuff I was, like many tech-minded people who need a job, trying to do the self-taught developer thing. I audited some classes from my Alma Mater combined with some stuff on Coursera, etc. I think for the trajectory I want my career to go to will benefit from having a postgraduate degree, especially now that I make enough that I can pay for it out of pocket. So I have two kind of rough plans I am considering: 1 - Get a B.S. in Computer Science (online) from WGU. For those of you that are unfamiliar, they have a kind of competency-based program. Talking to the enrollment advisor there it seems reasonable that with my transfer credits and pre-existing knowledge I could complete the program in a year. This would be entirely as a stepping stone to then go get my M.S.. in Comp Sci from somewhere since pretty much all of those programs require a B.S. in Comp Sci, or closely related degree. After that I might then also go get an MBA at some point, possibly also from WGU (they have an IT Management focused MBA program). 2 - Skip the B.S. altogether and go into one of WGU's IT Masters programs. Their M.S. in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance sounds very interesting. Then again followed by an MBA somewhere. Option 1 seems like the safer path, as developers always have pretty solid job security, especially with a Masters, so I could always have that to fall back on. Option 2 is quicker and cheaper and might make more sense given that, while I do do some scripting and some light-ish Java development around Jira Add-Ons and things, my planned career trajectory probably doesn't include me ever working as a dedicated software engineer. One the DevOps scale, I am definitely more on the Ops end of things. Either way I plan to continue to do hobbyist development stuff to keep my GitHub relatively interesting, and looking into going down the AWS certification route next. Any thoughts or suggestions would be much appreciated."

I've only got just under a year of job experience working in a school IT office, pretty much a level1/2 helpdesk/technician job. I also have a Cert III in Information, Digital Media and Technology which covered a lot of the basics like some fundamental python, hardware, OS's, HTML+CSS, WHS, networking etc which I believe is quite comparable to the CompTIA A+ cert. I know that the areas in the title are quite broad, but those are the potential areas I have been thinking of getting into as I've been looking into some cyber/forensic jobs in law enforcement. Problem is I have no where near enough experience and qualifications, so I was wondering how did any of you get your foot in the door for the areas of IT in the title? Eg certification, qualifications, companies and businesses that would require these kind of workers. Also any kind of online resources to getting me started and learning the fundamentals of these areas. Would also appreciate any stories and/or experiences working in the cybersecurity/pen testing/forensics fields so I can get more of a feel on what each job incorporates. Cheers in advance!"

I apologize in advance for the long post but I need to provide context, and I'm working on a long-term plan for the future. For background I'm an Airmen halfway through my first enlistment currently working in cybersecurity, but I'm thinking about leaving afterwards for a career in IT. My tech training and the first few months of my Active Duty career was in IT but the Air Force had decided to transfer me to cybersecurity. So I don't actually have as much hands-on experience with troubleshooting, configuring, etc, as I'd like. IT is where my real interest is and I don't think I'd wanna continue with purely security if/when I get out. I already have Sec+ as a requirement in my tech training which I'm in progress of renewing. However, meeting the one month requirement meant I had to study to simply pass the test, as opposed to studying to actually understand the content and pass. Unfortunately I cannot use my TA to continue my education for a Bachelor's in IT until Feb 2021 because of administrative restrictions, but I already have a plan for that. I also plan on learning Linux and Python for general computer science knowledge too. Until then I've decided to study and maybe even test for a certification so I can make use of this delay. Sec+ is of course useful to have already, but I thought it would be a fair approach to go back and obtain the A+ and Net+ certifications to solidify that base knowledge. At the same time, others have suggested the CCNA and CCNP (Enterprise) certifications as they are reliable, consistent credentials to obtain. Personally I don't see an issue with pursuing both. Finally, my questions: * Is there any merit to choosing one path over the other? Is backtracking for A+ and Net+ a good idea, or does CCNA provide a more comprehensive foundation to start from instead? * Assuming I plan to pursue all of these certifications, in what order should I obtain them? I was thinking A+, Net+, CCNA, CCNP. * I have ITIL and CISSP listed as future certifications to obtain further down the road, are there any other nationally recognized certifications to keep in mind that might bolster a resume?

I recognize I'm not ready for that right now but in the meantime I want to at least get paid appropriately for my work and get the opportunity to work towards that goal. As a little background, I have a bit over 5 years of professional experience. I moved from a cloud admin role from a small business (do everything type role, had a lot of exposure to things and got interested in security) to a cloud security engineer a bit over a year ago. I feel that I'm fairly talented and have quickly become a go to guy in my org for security automation, ""DevSecOps"", and general cloud security problem solving. I have a relatively short resume and I'm still working on my 4 year degree. I am certed to the moon (various cloud certs, basic comptia, and CISSP) which has helped a lot. Long story short I've kind of reached a point where I realize I want to be more involved in solutioning/architecture. I do like the exposure I get at my current job but it doesn't feel like I'm rewarded (I recently received a review where my boss stated I was ready for a mid-senior engineer type position yet was awkwardly ghosted on a internal job app). I'm basically left feeling kind of burnt out applying to jobs, and building up certs + skills. I don't put a lot of faith in internal advancement but I feel like I'm going to be treated the same anywhere else. Perhaps I'm just stuck in an in-between period where I'm not getting my foot in the door anymore but too green to earn that ""market"" pay. I have put more effort into building a portfolio of sorts showing for example how I've designed and implemented various systems. A lot of my mindset has moved from break/fix to implementing frameworks/architecture that meets our client's requirements. I've also put more effort into networking and going to industry events. I was hoping to hear what worked out for you on your journey. Was in the people and networking that made all the difference? Did you just grind until you made it etc? I'm currently afraid of truely burning out just grinding as an engineer. Thanks for any insight, perhaps I'm just being more discouraged than usual."

The issue is I was never able to get an internship or job which would give me work experience in IT or cyber. Not for a lack of trying I should say. Most common reason I got for rejection was a lack of experience when trying to obtain a internship/job. Due to this I have a lack of confidence in even trying to even obtain an entry level position in IT. What should my next step be? Should I try for the A+ and try for a help desk job to get experience and boost my confidence in the field? Should I be trying to obtain a little more difficult cirt since I have my bachelors such as network+ or security+? I know there isnt one right answer but any advice would be very much appreciated.

Currently I'm working with the VA, I want to stay in the company for a while longer until I get offered a position with a title that I want. I'm going to be doing the CND for that extra edge in cyber security related jobs. Another possibile job title that I would love is software engineer (Java is the language I know best). Any paths I should take certification-wise? Side note: I'm happy with the pay I currently have, just would rather be somewhere other than help desk as cyber security/encryption is my passion. I currently make around 54k USD a year, possibly more as the company is going to promote a ton of people in the next few weeks.

I am a Finance major working in financial planning so I have zero IT background. I am studying for the Security+ and should be able to take the test in the next two weeks and don't see any reason why I shouldn't be able to pass. I found the material fascinating unlike what I am doing for a living now. Like most, I know I am going to run into the obstacle of not being able to get an entry level job due to lack of experience but I can't get experience without an entry level job. That being said I have gotten conflicting answers from people in the industry in regards to there not being a such thing as an entry level cybersecurity job. I impulsively decided to try out a cybersecurity bootcamp offered through Quickstart/Texas A&amp;M University but after getting a preview look I am thinking of backing out because it seems to be a certificate mill (no vouchers) and the fact that there is an absurd amount of grammar errors in their brochure and welcome emails I am quite concerned. They do offer labs as hands on experience but didn't elaborate on them. The program costs $6900 [URL I decided to try it to at least get some hands on training before I try getting an entry level job. They have a job guarantee but I can't find a single person on LinkedIn that has gone through this process to see how it turned out for them. Due to the economic condition, I can't afford to take a internship or even a lower paying help desk job (I make $45K) to try to get experience and then transition to a security role a few years later. I've reached out to a recruiter at SecureWorks and was advised all I need is a Security+, Network+ and CySa+ in order to be able to qualify for a SOC Analyst position. Based on glassdoor, I would be looking at $65K a year so a bump in earning and I would get experience doing something I am intrigued in. Any thoughts? Should I stay the course and continue the bootcamp (first day is the 26th of May) or should I just get my certifications, do Cybrary and Udemy courses as supplements and take a shot in the dark to try to get an entry level job? Or should I just back out of security as a possible career entirely?"

I have a question that I haven't really been able to find a compelling answer to and I'm hoping this community can help me out. My question is kinda two-parts and is stated thusly: How much time do I need to **reasonably** commit in order to become an INFOSEC professional? Also, is there any consensus definition of ""professional"" or ""base-line knowledge""? For the context: I've read the stickies and the wiki and many other ""where to start"" posts and frankly the level of information and detail that is seemingly ""required"" for this field is absurd. I'm transitioning from the military and everyone keeps talking about all the possibilities in Cybersecurity. Then I start digging and turns out, ""this isn't an entry-level field"" or ""you have to know everything and the kitchen sink"" in order to get your foot in the door. I read about Kevin Mitnick or Marcus Hutchins or SANS instructors or DEFCON and blackhat presenters and it seems like this is their entire life. Marcus Hitchens had like 2 hours of sleep a night for months on end to gain the level of knowledge he now possesses. Is this really the level of commitment it takes to become a professional in this field? Also, there seems to be no industry definition of professional. Everyone has their own opinion about what you need to know. So what the heck am I supposed to learn if every employer wants something different? I'm a 31 y/o with a family and I frankly am not going to sacrifice the precious time I have with them just so I can spend all night coding for 6 months in order to get a job. Am I out of touch here? Are there any professionals who had families and somehow made it all work? What did your day-to-day look like? How much time did you dedicate to your studies vs. family? Also, why do so many companies require 10 years of experience for an entry level role? That's the entire point of entry level; to get the experience. I know this is kinda rambly but I'm just completely overwhelmed and I honestly have no idea how we have so many qualified professionals in this field. If this field requires a certain lifestyle or a complete time commitment, it's no surprise we have such a shortage of ""qualified"" cybersecurity professionals (to the tune of \~ 4 million apparently). How many people are willing to dedicate so much of their lives (because apparently you can't succeed in this field if you don't dream in computer code) to something so fleeting? I guess to basically to sum everything up, I would love to work in this field but there's no way I can dedicate the amount of time it's going to take to learn everything. Last thing, I'm studying for my Security+. I've read about ""hackers"". I get the concepts. I don't want to be a script kiddie. It just seems like there's an insurmountable bar to employment in this arena. TLDR: I really want to work in Cybersecurity but I'm overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information Feel free to put me on blast.

Sure, if you are a pen tester you will be hands on with exploits and actively ""hacking"" an environment but what isn't talked about is that you will be in documentation hell for a huge portion of the day. For most other security roles, you will be doing a lot of general administration of an environment such as upgrading servers, responding to tickets, writing documentation, dealing with change management, etc. I overall enjoy the field and I am not writing this to discourage anyone from moving into security. I simply wanted to warn those that are expecting to be on the front lines of cyber warfare actively defending and attacking against Russian cyber terrorists.

Do I pursue manager roles and continue towards my CISO end-goal? Or do I build expertise in one domain and work my way up from there? **Background info:** I'm a Cloud/Security Solutions Manager at a small MSP supporting a hundred or so SMB's (3-3000 employees). I manage our Azure and M365 subscriptions, evaluate new security tools and services for our clients, and set up phishing simulations and cybersecurity training for our client's users. I am a manager in title alone, however. I don't have anyone underneath me - I determine the scope of the projects **and** implement the service/migration/tool/etc. Sometimes I can get help from the helpdesk team, but it's usually a solo show. Although I've only been with the company for a few years, I managed to go from a helpdesk tech I -&gt; II -&gt; Cloud Service Manager -&gt; Cloud/Security Solutions Manager (they added security to my title because I showed an interest in infosec and they had not put any investment into security before now). As my first ""real"" IT job, I learned a lot and picked up the CompTIA trifecta and a couple of cloud certs along the way. But the ""best-practice"" skills were mostly learned in my homelab. I realize now that it's time for me to move on. My career goal is to become the **Chief Information Security Officer** (CISO) of an enterprise organization. This will require years of effort and experience, but I enjoy having an endgame to work towards. **My concerns**: 1) I don't have the credentials necessary to land a job managing a security team 2) There's a loosely-defined roadmap to reach the upper echelons of infosec, and I skipped over the tech/analyst work. I love security architecture ( and would have no problem moving to a technical role). Building myself up to management from a technical role seems like the ""proper"" choice, but our MSP has so little structure; Everything I learned in production is poorly configured, poorly documented, and not even remotely enterprise quality. **Conclusion (TL;DR):** Big fish in a small MSP pond. I'm a manager of one, with intermediate technical skills, but very little production practice. Career goal is CISO. Do I focus on my management credentials, or drop down to a more technical role, improve my skillset, and move up from there? Thanks in advance, and a huge thanks to anyone that read the entire post!"

So here's your answer. CCNA has little to do with Security and Security related beginner certifications like the Security+ and the CEH are better for Security related roles. But, to understand a lot of stuff in security you need a thorough understanding of networking concepts. You could just learn all of it for free on the internet, but certifications show a recruiter that you understand it and have been tested. Also, it looks really good on your resume. You will learn networking concepts that will help you when you start concentrating on Security. Topics like OSI layers and protocols, TCP/IP Model, TCP, UDP, IPv4, IPv6, ARP, DHCP, DNS, MAC, Encryption, SSH, Telnet, FTP, NAT, SNMP, Routing and Switching protocols(OSPF, RIP, BGP etc). You will also learn key concepts in network security and general security like WiFi security protocols, ARP and DHCP attacks, threats, vulnerabilities, port security, firewalls, ACLs, Cloud Security and VPNs. This information and knowledge is vital in your security career. Now, the main criticism I have about the CCNA is that it is really focused on Cisco products, you will have to learn the Cisco IOS, how their routers and switches work etc. This might not help you that much in Security but it is still extra knowledge that is good to know and maybe you will use it in certain positions. Similar certifications like Comptia A+, Network+ and Security+ are also great and may be better for knowledge in networking but this completely depends on your location and what companies value more where you live. I live in India and the Cisco certifications hold a higher value compared to the Comptia certs. The Network+ is more general networking and the CCNA is general networking plus Cisco specific networking. As to final thoughts, the CCNA is absolutely not necessary for a career in Security but the knowledge you gain from it is. It also proves to the people looking at your resume that you have an understanding about these concepts. The CCNA will also give you opportunities to start working in IT and you can improve your skills and move ahead in your security career while you work. Don't forget that the CCNA is only a beginner networking certification. To move into and improve your skills in Security you will have to look at other certifications like the OSCP, Security+, eLearn certs, SANS certs, Pentest+, CEH, CISSP, CISM etc. You will also need to start doing CTF's, start using Linux, be updated on Security trends and news and keep learning.

My other plans are to focus on Networking for a couple years, but all the while study for Security+ and then move on to other Security certs (C|EH) and try to find entry level CyberSec jobs and move my way up. **Is that at all possible, and does anybody else out there have a similar story (entry level help desk to cyber security) ?** From what I gather, a lot of CyberSecurity jobs/employers prefer you to have years of IT experience beforehand, so it makes sense to me to at least work Help Desk for a year or two, maybe even try to become a SysAdmin, and then start going for Security certs and jobs. I have a mentor (kind of) that also went to my community college about a decade back, and he's done very well for himself in the security field - Pen Tester now. But, he's been telling me moving from Networking to CyberSec is like starting over and to just focus on Security now and pursue it from the get go... but I wonder how I am suppose to get a job it in, or if there are any entry level security jobs I could qualify for. *- any advice is welcome, of course*"

Id like to say Im excited for this position, but Im curious in regards of being able to ask for certain things to be in my finalized offer. Im prior Air Force got out and finished my degree in Information Technology with a Cybersecurity focus. The VA also funded GCIH, GPEN and GWAPT SANS courses right before graduation. Im just wrapping up GCIH right before my official start date. My question is can I have review for pay raises upon completing my SANS certifications? I think Ive heard something like this before for federal employees but every time I research for it on OPM I cant seem to find anything that provides clarity. Ive found things that reference certain laws, but they dont really expand. Next is the agency recruiter that came to our school said we get reviewed at our progress at our 6 month mark and it could be a jump to GS-12. Should I make sure this is on the offer as well? Honestly Im not sure what to expect because the offer that came originally was completely reworked and Ive been asking for months to get a new tentative offer emailed to me after the first one was reworked from GS-7 up to GS-9. Tentative offer was received last week with the updated pay grade and HR told me yesterday it is at the CO to sign off. Not sure what she meant to be honest. The agency tends to promote fast another alumni that works there achieves GS 13 in 3 years. More background HR put me in as GS-9-2210 step 6 I feel this is pretty good for being prior service and only having my bachelors. Yes, I do plan on getting my Masters Ill be sitting down with my VA counsler to discuss that a bit more tomorrow, due to me having educational benefits left. Any insight would be wonderful the GS systems seems to be a whole new beast then AD, honestly I probably underestimated it thinking I could understand it cause I was on AD and worked with GS employees. That doesnt seem to be the case and I was very wrong to think that way. Thank you!"

I currently have an internship (since October 2019) at a regional accounting firm doing helpdesk IT, some automation projects, some security, and just learning a lot overall. (It's actually a really nice internship as the IT department is becoming more and more important, and I am learning a whole bunch about enterprise IT) Since it is summer break now, I thought I would start looking into getting a cert this summer? I am interested in cybersecurity and have been eyeing the OSCP for a couple months. I have been doing rooms and what not on TryHackMe and vulnhub and having a great time with it. However, the OSCP seems to be a major money commitment and being only a college kid I would probably have to ask my parents for the money. Given current situations, I kinda just feel bad about asking for money for a $1200 cert/course. So I guess my question I guess is: is there any other certifications that I should look into? Another intern I work with has his Sec+ and his going for a CISSP but I think he has specific goals in mind with those. My end goal is not necessarily being a cybersecurity legend, rather just find a nice niche somewhere in an IT infrastructure and work my way up to CIO/CTO (lol big dreams I know but gotta shoot for the stars). I know that a Masters is definitely in my future, but I am just thinking about all the time I have this summer and figured a cert would be beneficial."

I got my BS in Accounting, worked in the industry and even got my CPA before realizing this isn't the career path I had hoped for. I jumped around different jobs hoping to find my passion and ultimately went back to school for MS in CS. Then had another self-discovery and found cybersecurity/infosec once I realized coding wasn't for me. I worked part-time as retail tech support while in school until I had a year left till graduation last May. I decided to get my A+ cert and look for jobs that would provide more enterprise/corporate-level IT experience and a foundation to security from what I've learned in these subs. I lost count on how many applications I've sent out; I applied to anything from Helpdesk, Jr SysAdmin, Jr NetAdmin, to InfoSec roles. I heard back from 2 places and luckily landed an InfoSec summer internship. I worked primarily in the 'people' domain of InfoSec during this internship, so things like security awareness and phishing campaigns; plus some MFA and compliance side things. While this did not provide as much technical hands-on experience as I had hoped, I asked to be a fly on the wall any chance I get and this had provided invaluable insights into what real-world InfoSec is like. I was also incredibly fortunate to have met my mentors. With their help and encouragement, I kept up with current security trends, participated in a couple of CTFs when I can, and also managed to pass Sec+ during this time. My internship was extended through Fall then Spring; and I had hopes that I would be converted into a FTE. However, the company wasn't sure if they'd have budget to hire me as a FTE so as a precaution, I updated my resume and started slowly applying around end of February. The fact that job posting qualifications are more of a ""wishlist,"" coupled with the following stats, pushed me to apply for any and all security positions that are not management-level, even if I didn't check all the boxes: * Women feel the need to meet 100% of the criteria while men usually apply after meeting about 60% * 84% of companies are willing to hire and train a candidate who lacks required skills * 62% of employees have been offered a position when they are underqualified Then COVID-19 hit. I continued applying to new postings each day but it definitely got discouraging; I've had interviews cancelled due to corona, recruiters ghosted me after one call, and jobs where I was sure I was more than qualified for but got no response. Then the cherry on top was when the company I was interning with confirmed that they wouldn't have the budget to hire me, again thanks to corona. I felt my depression crept back. I cried, and continued pushing forward. Then later that week, I got an email from a recruiter requesting a phone screen for a Senior InfoSec Analyst position I had applied for! I second guessed myself and was sure that they would realize my lack of experience, if they didn't already, and move on to more experienced folks. But the hiring manager was very transparent and let me know that they're considering either hiring someone experienced, or someone green with a security mindset to train, as long as there is eagerness and drive to learn. Long story short, I was offered and accepted the position! I even timidly negotiated successfully for the first time in my career, thanks to my mentors. I just wanted to share my journey since I've read a lot about the common path to security through either Helpdesk or SOC, which I was prepared to do, but I wasn't ready to settle just yet. I realize that my journey is an uncommon one and I am incredibly lucky to have someone willing to take a chance on me, especially during this pandemic. But it CAN happen. Don't give up and keep pushing forward!"

I have some experience with SOCs, assessing their detection efficacy through technical testing and reviewing their processes or use cases, improving them.

A little background about me first. Like many, I'm trying to break into the Information Security field. I have a degree in Information Systems and I work in technology as a Business Analyst (not security related at all). I also recently completed the CSX Cybersecurity Fundamentals Cert from ISACA to learn about some of the basics and get my feet wet. I would like to move onto the next step, especially considering I'm going to have some down time these next few months. I have been eyeing the WGU Cybersecurity and Information Assurance Master's program. I know Master's degrees in Cybersecurity have a mixed/negative reputation, but what I like about this program is they offer two certs as classes (CEH and CHFI) and also my company will provide tuition reimbursement cutting the costs significantly. My other option is going for the OSCP. I know this is a rigorous test, especially for newcomers, but I'm willing to put forward the commitment. From what I've been reading, completing this cert should qualify someone for a Junior PenTest role. A con for me is my company wouldn't provide any reimbursement and I would have to pay completely out of pocket. Which of these two options do you think would be beneficial for me?

377,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,Career change Success Story - Starting my First role in IT as an Information Security Analyst,2,fw44sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/fw44sg/career_change_success_story_starting_my_first/,2020-04-07 04:31:35,"Just wanted to share my story with everyone here since it is probably going to differ from a lot of the experiences of other IT people, and a lot of the expectations that people in this sub like to present when it comes to entry level roles. For the past 10 years I had been working at a company in a non-IT field doing admin work at first, then shipping/logistics, then Digital Marketing. In December 2018 I decided to try to make a career change and go into IT with the hopes of one day getting in to a cybersecurity role. I wanted to see if I even had the aptitude for this kind of work, so I started with the CompTIA IT Fundamentals+ exam. I knew that the exam itself was going to be fairly useless on a resume but I figured it was a good place to start. I passed that exam in January 2019, but then had to take a break for a few months due to work reasons. Long story short, I worked hard and studied hard and was able to pass the A+, Net+, and Sec+ exams all in about a 6 month period, from July 2019 - December 2019. Ever since I passed my Sec+ in early December, I've been applying for any job I thought might be interesting. At first, I tried to focus mostly on Network Admin roles because I thought that would be my best bet, but eventually I just started applying to any kind of role I thought would be interesting that I could have realistically had a chance at (by that I mean I applied to everything but management-level roles). After lots and lots of applications getting no responses, getting ghosted by recruiters after one phone call, getting ghosted by companies after in-person interviews, I was finally able to accept an offer given to me last month for an Information Security Analyst position with a large company near a major east coast city. In my old position I made about 72k a year and was prepared to have to take about a 10-15k drop in salary to get my foot in the door in this field, but I'm actually now making a few thousand more in this new role (in reality, its a bit of a wash since the commute time is much greater than my old job and the cost in gas/tolls will basically make this more of a lateral salary move than anything). I just wanted to share this story so that people out there can know that its not impossible. This CAN happen, even if it is rare and that I'm incredibly lucky that this place is taking a chance on me in a role like this. If you work hard, grind it out, and refuse to undervalue yourself, its not always necessary to start your career in a help desk position. Some things that I did on my journey that MAY help you - College degree - I do have a bachelor's degree but its in something non-IT/Computer related. Unless you have some way to prove you're an absolute rockstart, it will probably be difficult to get past HR filters without a degree of some sort Certs - the CompTIA certs definitely helped me get this job but what I think is the most important aspect of the certs is how quickly I was able to attain them. Getting the A+, Net+, and Sec+ within 6 months demonstrated, I believe, that I was able to learn this material quickly and competently, and more importantly, it demonstrated that I had a passion for learning. Not settling for less - I was in kind of a weird situation - trying to change careers at the age of 37, with a mortgage and day care expenses, I simply was not in a position to bite the bullet and drop all the way down to a 40k Help Desk role to get my start in IT. I wouldn't have been able to keep my house, and I wasnt willing to lose 30k in salary. So while I knew I would be aiming for a higher paying role, I also realized that it might take me a lot longer to get hired than if I'd just applied to every low level help desk role I came across. I ended up applying for probably 130-150 positions. The vast majority of which I never heard anything back from. Sometimes I'd get a call from a technical recruiter who would then say they'd pass my info along to a hiring manager, and then I'd never hear anything from them again. I interviewed for a Network Admin role at an MSP where I got through the HR screen, a phone interview, an in-person interview, and then an online personality assessment before they decided to go with someone with more experience. Of the 130-150 positions I applied for, I only got about 5 in-person interviews. It was disheartening and I felt dejected at times but in the end it was worth it. Being active with online communities and local chapters of IT organizations - If you can find any kind of online community that is active, like Operation Code, TraceLabs, etc, get involved. There's usually a good amount of information you can gain from the people in these groups. Also, if you have chapters of IT groups in your area (like ISSA - Information Systems Security Association), join them and attend meetings. Network as much as humanly possible. Resume - This may not be an option for everyone but I paid to have mind professionally done and I think it was worth every penny. I found the resume writers through LinkedIn and what I got in return was a resume that stood out in all the right ways. You CAN do it yourself and can probably make it look just as good, but these people know how to get you through HR filters without gaming the system in a bad way, so if you can afford it, I highly recommend having it professionally done. Know that its going to be difficult - If you haven't interviewed in a long time or never really have interviewed before in your life, its gonna suck. You'll probably bomb a few (I'm thinking specifically of an interview I had for a SOC analyst role that's making me cringe when I think of how I did....). Think of each interview as practice for the next. Try not to go in there too nervous or desperate. Just relax and be yourself, as much as you can. Dont fall in love with a job before you get an offer - this is the one I struggled with the most and it really, really sucked to deal with. Early on in my search, every time I had an HR screen I would start imagining myself in that role with that company and really, really want to work there. Then when I would end up getting ghosted, it fucking HURT. I mean really just plain hurt. It really screwed with me until I finally realized I needed to stop getting my hopes up with every phone call or interview. **Things that might NOT help you** In the interest of fairness, I may as well explain some advantages I might have had that may not help you at all - My military service - I spent 4 years in the military back in the mid-2000's and while it had nothing to do with IT, from what I could tell during the interviews, it seemed like that part of my resume was something that they all liked about me for whatever reason - Just plain luck - when I try to think of why exactly they chose me, someone with zero IT experience, over all the other candidates who applied for that role I just kinda.....draw a blank. I know that they must have seen something in me that they like, but not only do I feel incredibly lucky to be starting a job with this pandemic running rampant in the world right now and all the companies instituting hiring freezes, but I feel incredibly lucky that they picked someone with no IT experience over candidates who have established IT work histories. I'm well aware that situations like this are damn near unheard of, but I just wanted to share with everyone that its not impossible to start a career in IT with your dream job. If anyone has any questions, I'll happily do my best to answer them. Until then, keep working towards your goals and don't give up. You can make this happen."

I know ultimately making choices of dollar amounts is frowned upon, but is there any value in waiting the X amount of years in management to reach that higher salary? Management will have less available positions vs tech positions and as you climb higher up it becomes more competitive (Not everyone can become a director/C level etc).

Lol so Im in a position where I do info sec analyst work doing vulnerability scans and prepping for quarterly audits. Now Im at a crossroads because my career can go one of two ways, I can move to a management like position (basically putting me on the path to ISSM) making awesome money, or try to find a more technical position somewhere making less probably. Id be getting into RMF and more paperwork and compliance type roles if I go down the management path. I dont actually hate this idea (seems like reddit just shits on these non tech roles lol). At the same time I dont want to limit my future earning potential. So my questions... 1. Can management Cybersecurity and technical Cybersecurity end up making the same kind of income in the long run? 2. If I dont hate the compliance side of things is it a good career? 3. Do Cybersecurity consultant companies offer RMF and compliance work as well? (Just curious) 4. How easy would it be to go from management to technical and back again if I keep my skills sharp in both? Like just be good at both sides of the house. (I do technical Cybersecurity in the Air National guard too so Im never truly out of the technical side of learning)"

Days consist of picking up tickets via ManageEngine Service Desk Plus. Phone calls arent a big part of the day. Id say its 80/20 split between tickets/emails and phone calls. Usually its really old end users that call. Examples of tickets include: - Accessing clients domain controller to add/remove/edit users from their active directory. Very minor powershell use, mostly just delta sync on certain setups. - Adding/removing/editing licenses and permissions to users via O365 Admin page. Minor powershell use relevant to this, such as specific permissions (granting a user access to another users Outlook calendar but not their mailbox). - Remote screen share with users to troubleshoot random little things like printer or application specific issues. Network drive mappings. - Using admin tools in our Endpoint Protection software to analyze alerts or prompt scans on clients devices remotely. Due to COVID, I actually got my feet wet in the following: - VPN/RDP setups for users working from home. - Using Kaseya to remotely access user workstations at quarantined office buildings. So its been a wild couple months of having absolutely zero experience in IT to just diving in and getting competent at all these little aspects of IT. My thing is, I dont want to be stuck as IT Support for years on end. Ive read that it is difficult to get out of support, but I felt like I had to take this opportunity to get my foot in the door. Im being paid more than what I see on average for this type of tier 1 work (salaried in the 40s), so Im grateful to still have a job during this outbreak. Im 3 semesters away from wrapping up an MIS degree, and have zero certs, but Im trying to carve a roadmap to stay motivated here. I wont pretend I have a passion for IT. Im enjoying most of the work so far, but I wouldnt say Im passionate about it. With that said, the field that interests me the most would be Cybersecurity. Im interested in the idea of protecting clients networks/devices from threats someday and testing out their vulnerability if that makes sense. Whats the proper move/roadmap certs wise? How soon after attaining said certs should I leave this MSP? How will my MIS degree help career wise? (I didnt expect to get a job in IT without experience or this degree, so now I question if its worth finishing). Any guidance would be appreciated, thanks!"

Boring background commencing: I had a unique opportunity at my high school to help install its first full scale LAN in 2001 with a group of students under the tutelage of our school's one and only computer teacher (town of &lt;1k people). The same program got us the first 2 parts of (i think?) 4 part CCNA program. The program rolled students into the community college for the last 2 parts. I really enjoyed designing networks, mock ups for homework, programming routers. And then we all designed the HS network for real and it was awesome. However, I went into unrelated fields and didn't attend community college until recently. I'm ready to transfer and get my bachelors, and I think I narrowed it down to tech. I forgot about PCs for much more than chores, but 6 months ago I got a remote job and my PS4 burned out. The timing was interesting, because it inspired me to build my first PC and improve our home network for my job (totally not gaming). Now I'm bit by the bug and want to work on networking again, and I'm somewhat adrift in my current career. Now being laid off, I want to get started on some classes while I have the free time."

I have been doing a lot of research the past few months on reddit and other sites and decided that I want to explore a career within the Cybersecurity realm. I am also applying to Master programs in either Cybersecurity, IT, or InfoSec. I know that experience is more important, but having a masters is a personal goal of mine anyways. I also know that I need to start working on my certifications in the mean time, I am reading that it is is best to start with Sec+ and Net+ for good foundation and then work my way up, eventually getting the CISSP and then beyond. I also understand that networking is typically the stepping stone field before security, which I don't mind doing if I need to. A little about me, my bachelor was in Communications, so not a technical degree, however I have been working technical jobs for the past 3-4 years. I am good with html/css, but don't really know other languages and woudn't say I'm the most technical person, although I can usually get by and haven't had much super technical experience to really be able to tell. My current 2 jobs are all about web development, doing help desk type support for ATS' and SaaS', and manual QA testing work. I am honestly currently happy with my 2 jobs as I am able to double up on 2 salaries and not much work, so I am not too worried about rushing to leave.

My question for you guys, I am thinking more big picture and down the line, but I want to have a clear rough draft of my path and future for now. 1) Should I focus hard on getting in to Network stuff first? I am having trouble finding out exactly what kind of Network type jobs are out there. Or can I try to skip it and go straight to security, with my Net+ and Sec+? 2) Within security, what path is better for me in terms of Blue vs Red? Two things really important to me are work/life balance (I don't want to have to worry about checking my phone or being relied on when I am off work) and the ability to work remotely. Which path will give me better options for that? 3) Down the line I know I will have to decide between staying technical or going the management route and getting an MBA, which I don't mind. However I would love to learn more about the pros and cons of each as well as which route would help me meet my criteria above about having a good work life balance as well as being able to stay working remote.

I just turned 22 and accepted a new job offer at the end of February, right before the whole COVID situation hit. The Role is a NOC technician for a multi-million dollar company (without revealing too much) supporting some government systems for a few entire states, alongside some small-business clients. It's my very first IT job ever, and my first IT job out of community college, before this I was a lifeguard. &amp;#x200B; Due to the situation of the world right now, I was trained completely remotely, no shadow-time in the office or anything. I've barely even seen the room of the actual office more than a few times. I've started my shift and I've been doing it for about 3 weeks now, on the apparently ""classic"" 3-4 back-to-back 12-hour shifts rotation, nightshifts. &amp;#x200B; Only thing is, I've come to the realization that I dread this job, to the point of feeling physically sick when coming ever closer to starting my next set of shifts of the week. The people here and on my team are very helpful, and it seems that combined with company culture its a place that has a large potential for growth. But the pressure of it all is so insurmountably heavy for me. SLA timers are veeeerry tight, with certain issues that do regularly come up every week requiring immediate action, sometimes within 5 minutes or less. The aspect of having to get on the phone, with a random person that may or may not even be the right person to call, in the middle of the night, perhaps not even knowing the correct information to say or retrieve from them, within seconds of something popping up on-screen, knowing a single fuck-up could be you written-up or going on your company record, sends my stomach through the floor with anxiety. Or having someone call in, not knowing what in the actual hell they're asking about, writing down all their info and trying to relay that info through MS Teams that someone may-or-may not be even available to help at that moment. &amp;#x200B; I understand pressure is a part of daily life, IT is a demanding field, and its particularly challenging for me right now not only due to my general lack of experience in any workforce, but also due to the current global situation at-hand. I get that, but the thought of having to do this for the rest of my life makes me actually depressed. I don't get paid very well for my position (at least from what the internet tells me), and I still live with my parents, but I've been spending large amounts of my paychecks every week on cryptocurrency and hodling it, less these-days because I believe in the tech, but un-healthily thinking its a financial means of escape. &amp;#x200B; I acquired my CCNA right before the test version changed over, and it was one of the things in my life I've been the most proud of, and I do enjoy the networking side of things, despite also having a degree in cybersecurity. But everywhere I look for growth, it seems there's no escape from the extreme pressure, like every advanced role from here is just the same ticket-system way-of-life but more in-depth, or more specific. It seems kind of like a stupid question. as if i'm an idiot for asking, but are there any related fields that are less pressure-based in-the-here-and-now type of work environment? Again, I understand that SLAs and such are necessary parts of infrastructure and SOPs are necessary for standardizing ways to be done and for contracts, but it feels so incredibly on-demand that it feels like i'm going to crash and burn before even my contract-to-hire is up and I actually even officially join the company. &amp;#x200B; I have been thinking of trying to start at Sec+ and get a security role which is also interesting to me, but it just seems to me like a SOC is no less balls-to-the-wall than a NOC is. Are NOCs and SOCs all there is this side of IT? Then all there is left is programming? I'm sorry, just looking for a little direction and advice."

I still plan on going, but Im waiting to see what businesses plan on doing. That being said, my resume is tailored specifically for Front-End web development roles, but DAILY recruiters call me for Help Desk roles. Even though my most recent job is Help Desk, its put in place to show that I dont have a hiring gap. Nothing on my resume indicates that I am even slightly interested in Help Desk. I am not entirely sure if it has something to do with COVID-19 and the fact that so many developer roles are closed because they require entry level employees to be on-site, but it has been extremely discouraging. Part of my reason for transitioning to Web Dev was for this reason as well. I have 11 IT certs, a Bachelors, and 4 yrs of experience, but for some reason I could never pivot into Cybersecurity or Networking even though I had certifications in both. I feel so pinned down to Help Desk."

Is this person right, and the program is not worth doing?

433,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,Full-stack developer for a Cyber security company. I was asked to switch to frontend development only. What should I do?,1,gcbkcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/gcbkcl/fullstack_developer_for_a_cyber_security_company/,2020-05-03 04:45:19,"Hi, **TL;DR**: spent almost 3 years as full stack developer; was recently asked to switch to frontend development only. Should I do it? (note: I think context is important here so If you decide to read all my post, well thank you!). There is a list of what I see as Pros and Cons and the end of this post. I'm a 27 years old software engineer (CS bachelor degree + close to get my CS master degree too) and I live in south Europe. I work for a cyber security company that provides a SOC service (major service) and several others, like penetration tests, all related to the cyber security field. When I started as a developer 3 years ago the developers team was composed just by my supervisor and I. One important note is that the SOC service we provide is all throw internal software (network sonde, PC clients, cloud, and web application) developed by us, mainly by my supervisor (dev team leader), and yes it is a really skilled software engineer. Later another person joined our team and he works mostly on our sandbox (hes kinda responsible for it). So we are in 3, my supervisor and I who work mainly on everything except the sandbox and the sandbox guy who works on the sandbox and recently started doing some little work on the network sonde and he cloud app too. One important note before I go ahead with my story: our work is NOT organized as micro tasks we are not given classes or functions to implement, we are given a problem and we have to come up with a solution for that problem. So we start with problem analyses and all kind of stuff software engineers do. Anyway, I started the first 7-8 months by developing the frontend (angular + redux), it can be considered as a complex web application and pretty data intensive, then I started working on the backend parts too, the cloud and our network sonde, after this period. Tasks on the backend vary a lot, it can be implement some new API to serve some data, implement new feature on the cloud, write some integration for some 3party security appliance (our sonde collected data by analysing traffic and collecting events/logs from many other 3p sources or work on new born project like a windows client endpoints (installed directly into PCs). On the other hand, working on the frontend is, let's say, more basic (at least by now). Often new features mean new api that needs to be supported by the frontend, find a fancy and usable way to serve the data, build new forms etc. I have to say that the frontend is always seen as the last part/less important to be implemented, something like: you implemented this then the frontend must support this. But I also think that in terms of web development there is a lot that can be done especially in terms of user experience and performance, and here comes my question. I have been offered to switch from full-stack developer to frontend development only. I will be the person responsible for it and I was also offered a structured UX/UI course to fulfill that part that was always missing in our team, a person dedicated to that with an eye for cybersecurity and that know how cybersecurity analyst interact with the web app (they use the UI differently, i mean from normal users). The options are: If I decide to stay Ill start to work more frequently on the backend and they will find someone else later to be dedicated to the frontend only. Here is my question, **Is it a good idea to switch from full-stack to frontend development?** Note, once I decide what career path to follow that will be definitive it will be irreversible. I see some pro, cons and some fears I have about these two options: * **Pros** * I can specialize in this field, at least more than if I stay full-stack * I can learn UI and UX skills that very few people in this field have * I will be (in a near feature, I hope) my project, I will be responsible for the frontend and every aspect related to it. * If I choose to stay backend I fear I'll never have a project I'll be responsible for and I'll bounce around doing some tasks (backend only) where needed. * I can spend the learned (more likely than backend ones) skills elsewhere even outside the cybersecurity field * **Cons** * By looking at the [Stackoverflow 2019 survey](URL frontend developers are paid significantly LESS than their counterparts fullstack and backend developers. * I will work gradually less often on (backend) security related stuff (what i like, or at least i think it's more valuable) like the one described above. * What if the value brought in by UI/UX enhancements will NOT be considered/perceived as much valuable in this field. What I mean that in this field users are mainly technicians who care less (at least I think they do) about UI and UX. My fear here is that I'll end up doing the frontend as we did before with a few enhancements plus doing some boring backend stuff like implementing API routes. * I fear to learn less, especially in security related stuff and backend / devops ones. By looking at other frontends of other competitors like Googles [Backstory](URL or [Reaqta](URL it looks like they care about UI/UX but I know basically nothing about this field, I need advice here, is it an essential thing in every field or is frontend/web development + UX generally considered less valuable then backend one?

This job pays \~60k a year, and it turns out this job involves working with security software (access control and video software with panels and video recorders). Now this isn't a situation where I'm stuck as if they expect me to know everything. It's actually the opposite. They recruited me and a few others who knew almost nothing about physical security, and they're giving us thousands of dollars worth of training.

I also currently hold a CCNA R&amp;S and CCNA Security as well. I work as a switch engineer but I have had to take over a lot of desktop support duties which I have automated with PowerShell to save myself time. &amp;#x200B; I'm looking to relocate from a rural area to a more urban area (probably the greater Louisville area in Kentucky) as the jobs here are few and far between. I'm only making $16.50 per hour in my current role which leaves very little money left for study materials, life, and to build true assets. I'm hoping to find a role making around $65k annually when I relocate but I'm not sure if I'm wishing for more than I can get. &amp;#x200B; I have a four-month internship for a county government that I did a lot of firewall troubleshooting in along with a lot of desktop support. Following that, I began working full time for an MSP that was a four hour round trip commute from my house for eight months where I got to work heavily with ASAs, Sophos UTMs, and basically anything else I could dream of. I actually wanted to move to that area but with what little they paid me, $0.25 an hour less than my current role my wife and I could not afford to move. I then got told about this switch engineer role that's in my hometown and I got it after three interviews. &amp;#x200B; I've been in this role since July of last year and I have been shut down when asking about promotions, raises, or even just assistance for study materials for further certifications. I have also had a lot of duties pushed onto me such as maintaining a log of all onsite inventory and swapping all workstations while everyone else is working on phone projects. I'm also babysitting a daily meeting with department managers where I'm tasked with resolving critical issues or chasing down higher-tiered engineers to rush them to a solution on tasks. &amp;#x200B; I'm wanting to work into a more focused network engineer role because I've been troubleshooting our local network is having speed issues due to routing tables flooding routes constantly tanking performance and loop guard not being active as well. I do not have access to the configs and the person who manages it won't allow me to help or anything so I have to field complaints about network performance constantly. I also want a true network engineer role because I want to pursue a CCNP but a home lab just doesn't cut it for studying for it. &amp;#x200B; So am I being unreasonable wanting to earn $65k or more a year in an area like Louisville, KY or Charlotte, NC? I just want my wife and I to be taken care of and be able to afford decent housing wherever we go."

I'll try to keep it concise as I have a tendency to ramble. I'm coming here hoping to get some good feedback as I try to figure out a basic roadmap for my career in IT. I'll start with some background: I graduated from a 2-year Associate's program in May of 2017, your basic IT 2-year with a focus on Networking. If I'm being honest, I didn't gain much from the program besides the degree. I did not put in the work that I should and my professors were very lenient so while I graduated with honors, it didn't do much for my actual knowledge. Anyways, after graduating I held a couple of unsatisfactory IT jobs where I learned very little until I landed my current job. I am currently working as T1/T2 help desk (yes, I take calls/process tickets but we strive for first-call resolution so I do a LOT of running to do fixes as well as remoting machines) at a family-owned food processing company with about 2000 employees and just hit my one-year anniversary. I have learned so, so much in the past year; my troubleshooting skills have grown by leaps and bounds and I feel so much more like an IT guy than I did before. I recognize that I'm still a total dunce when it comes to a lot of stuff but I feel like I have a good start now, and I'm not suffering from imposter syndrome as much. My company places a great deal of stress on self-improvement. We make two ""Personal Development Commitments"" quarterly, one company-related and one personal. It is an expectation that I will do things like pursue certifications, attend trainings and conferences, and continually strive to add value to myself and the company. I very much like this aspect of the company I work for. They will pay for any certification I pursue, any conference I attend; they'll put a significant amount of money towards any further education I pursue. They are a fantastic company to work for so far. So I finished my first year at my company, made a great impression and things are going great. Now I'm at the point where I've really got to start putting some thought into where I want to go from here, not only what sector of IT I ultimately want to focus on but just what certs I might want to pursue, what conferences would be most valuable to me at this point, etc. I've started to get a bit of an idea about what interests me, and I'm thinking of either focusing on server administration or cybersecurity. However, I've also thought about job-shadowing the applications development team to see if I would enjoy coding and the like. In addition, I think there's room at the company for a virtualization expert and I think it could be cool to carve a niche there, but I do know of one other person with more seniority than myself who is interested in that as well. I think I've come to the conclusion I don't want to do networking- of all the teams, by far they are the ones who work the most off-shift, and get the most calls about business critical issues that they have to fix ASAP so that production keeps running smoothly at the plants and offices- and I have an 18-month old at home with another on the way so right now, work/life balance is a top priority. But these are just my basic impressions and probably can't be trusted. For a start, I've started looking into maybe some basic Microsoft certifications I can get that will be basic, all-round certs that will help my knowledge no matter which way I go. I was thinking something like the MTA IT Infrastructure cert? (Microsoft Technology Associate). I'm still going to be a generalist for a while because the next step after Service Desk where I work is the Deskside team, which is firmly T2 and basically takes the ticket overflow that Service Desk doesn't have the knowledge or access to fix, as well as works on more project stuff like keeping our images up-to-date, making changes to Active Directory, and other basic back-end systems. I've worked a lot with this team, and have gotten a ton of positive feedback and suggestions that I am next in line for a promotion to this team when it becomes available- hopefully this year! So I'm thinking a more general training/cert is going to be the way to go at this point, but I could be wrong. Although I feel like I know much more than I did a year ago, I know there are still gaps in my knowledge and thinking I might want to go for one of the more general certs (maybe even like a Windows or Office cert?) to try and shore those up before continuing on and specializing. Well, I told you I have a tendency to ramble. I'll stop here and if you've stuck with me this far, I would be so appreciative if anyone could give me some feedback on my next steps. Thanks in advance to anyone who contributes."

Only thing is how do I get experience especially when companies want like 2+ years experience for an entry level role. I have 3 different interviews right now hoping one will work out. I graduated a semester early to start my career early and now because of the virus I probably won't even find a job by May when everyone else graduates.

I didn't have any prior IT experience, although I had always been pretty tech savvy. I excelled in school and graduated with my AAS at 28 with a full-time job resulting from my internship program. I am still with the company today as an IT Specialist. We're a three person team supporting about 130 local and remote users, and the position is unique in that I get to wear many hats including tech support, server admin, networking, phones, active directory and hardware maintenance. A year after graduating with my AAS, I decided that I was ready to go further with my education and enrolled in a Bachelors program in Cybersecurity/Networking which I'm about halfway through now. Throughout my learning and career experience, I've learned that I particularly love anything involving Linux, Javascript, any kind of database, embedded systems/electronics, and web development. On to my question... I have no idea where to go with these interests. I'm grateful for my job but it is not mentally stimulating and I don't think it's going anywhere. I really think getting into web dev would be fun, but I also think being a database engineer or designer would to really fun and challenging as well. I do plan on continuing with my Bachelors degree, but what else can I do to get into my fields of interest? Is it even a realistic goal for a 30 year old with minimal coding experience? Any insight is super appreciated. Also, sorry for bombarding you all with a wall of text, I just wanted to give some background info."

The first thing I did was get my A.S. in Networking Technology at a local community college. The curriculum was part of the Cisco academy so I also got my CCNA, A+, and Sec+ during my time there. I really wanted to get a job working in networking where I could start from the bottom and work up. The week after graduating, I felt so lucky to get contacted by a local MSP to work on the help desk as Tier 1 for a string of car dealerships in the state. I would have taken anything to leave the supermarket at that point. It wasn't what I wanted but I was learning so much about AD, managing windows domain, o365, firewalls, and some networking I couldn't complain. After a year I realized I was the one of two employees on the help desk staff with any related IT degrees or certifications. I asked for a way to grow in the company and was quickly shut down because of ""budgets"", no problem keep going. Things got bad after Christchurch shooting, being an Arab-American in a completely white (southern) workforce. Racist, insensitive comments became the norm, over hearing my boss talk to other managers about Arabs being the scum of the earth and ""our body count still being less than whites so who cares?"". For the next 7 months I applied for any networking job I would qualify for, but I got nothing not even an email back. During my time at this help desk job, I continued to educate myself and got a B.S. in cybersecurity and information assurance and ISC2 SSCP certification which was part of my program. Finally a job responds to me and its IT Technician role at an insurance company at 40k before taxes (a $4,000 raise). Again, this is not what I want but life at my job became so unbearable that waking up in the morning was becoming an impossible thought so I resigned. Fast forward 5 months at my new job and I'm absolutely miserable. I am one of two IT employees, there is no challenge, all their technology is SaaS, I get 3 tickets a week and 2 are password resets. I live in Tampa, Florida which is a challenge in itself with all the jobs that require security clearances ( MacDill Air Force Base). I truly hope I don't come off ass arrogant or ungrateful, but after two years of working, two degrees and 4 certifications I didn't think I would still feel this way. I've committed a lot of time and energy to changing my circumstances but it hasn't clicked yet. I'm not afraid to do more I just really want it to payoff. Does anyone have any advice for me on how I can break this cycle? Do you think I have to move from here? What networking jobs would I qualify for?

I graduated high school back in 2018. In high school I participated in speech and debate, an activity that I enjoyed. I liked researching current events, accumulating evidence, and generating arguments. After hearing an alumni talk about his experience in the Intelligence Studies program at Mercyhurst, I thought that was what I wanted to do; intelligence gathering and counterterrorism. For a number of reasons, not the least of which were financial, I enrolled at the local community college. Full ride, everything paid for. I haven't spend a dime out of my own pocket for school these last two years which is pretty great. I will graduate in May, and I should end with an overall GPA of 3.9 and a major GPA of 4.0. I'm majoring in cybersecurity, as it was a brand new program for the school at the time and was the closest thing to what I wanted to do; credits would transfer and some of the skills and information I was learning would translate. I had just built my own computer and had a blast doing it. I love to repair electronics. I had no issue going into IT to start. As long as I wasn't stuck doing help desk and basic tech support in 10 years. The problem is I don't want to do IS anymore. I don't want to work in government. I don't want that kind of responsibility, and although it may be an irrational fear, I don't want to endanger my future family in any way and I feel like working in that area could place a target on my back. Whatever the case, IS no longer interests me. But it's not like I'm in love with cyber either. I'm not too great a programmer and I don't like doing it. I can tolerate it but I do not want to sit in a cubicle all day typing away at a keyboard. I gravitate more toward the physical side of the field; social engineering, hardware, policy, that kind of stuff. I've befriended a few professors and people working in the field. They're more on the business side of things, and one runs his own consulting firm (not a consistent enough position for my liking). He got his Master's degree from Western Governor's and gave it a good recommendation so that definitely put WGU on my radar. I'm working on lining up an internship this summer which will finally give me some field experience. I don't have any certs but I plan on starting some relatively soon; the entry-level ones shouldn't be too difficult to knock out. I still don't know exactly what I want to do in cyber. But that's the path I'm on and I don't see any other options for me. The only thing I've ever been passionate about is football and my dream job is to work in an NFL front office, but I obviously can't really go to school for that. I've been a sports writer for 4+ years now and worked for Pro Football Focus, an analytics firm, this past season so I am chasing my dream on the side. WGU was my plan heading into my last semester; it's online (I place very little value on the whole ""campus experience"" - the degree is what matters to me), very affordable, and has the potential to be extremely quick. It would allow me to earn a bachelor's - the degree is Cybersecurity and Information Assurance - while interning and gaining experience, earning certs, and continuing my football stuff on the side. But my parents don't love the idea. They seem to want me to to go to a university. They think I should be ""setting my sights higher"" than WGU. I don't necessarily disagree, but I also feel like WGU is the most efficient option for me. Not to mention it's actually affordable. I had a 33 ACT in high school along with a 3.92 GPA but that's pretty much worthless now, and as far as I'm aware scholarships for transfer students are basically nonexistent. So basically I don't really know what to do right now. You might say it's my life and I shouldn't let my parents make this choice for me, which is true, but I value their opinion highly and I would like this to be a collaborative decisions, especially since they're the ones that will be footing most of the bill. I'm also interesting in getting a bachelor's in data analytics - I don't like math but I know how useful that degree could potentially be, in many different fields including sports. I don't enjoy school at all, whether it's in person or online, but I do anticipate eventually getting my master's degree. I know I'm smart enough and I can handle the workload. I'm just in a tough spot right now and honestly I'm feeling pretty discouraged. I would really appreciate some guidance and I will do my best to answer any questions. Any university and/or program suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks in advance."

My initial plan was to get a degree in cybersecurity, but I often see people on this subreddit and others say that it's best to pursue a degree in CS/CIS, instead of a security specific degree, even when pursuing a career in cybersecurity. It seems that people usually say this because cybersecurity specific programs often don't provide as much of an in depth/well rounded education as CS/CIS degrees do. So the reason I'm still here asking this question is because the only differences between the CIS and cybersecurity programs is that the cybersecurity program takes out one class(Computer Applications  Database Software) from the CIS program, and adds four more classes, that aren't in the CIS degree program. Those being: Computer Forensics for Ethical Hackers Ethical Hacking Cloud Services Technologies Virtualization Technologies So, the cybersecurity degree would give me a better, and more specified education than the CIS degree would, but would it still be more beneficial for me to have ""Associates degree in Computer Information Systems"" on my resume instead of ""Associates degree in Computer Information Systems: Cybersecurity""?"

I have applied and interviewed for many positions but I have been cut down in my stride as the company hits me with the usual things like, we are looking for someone who is able to work full-time or you don't have enough commercial experience for the position, or they ghost me. basically what i am asking for is advice for interviews, applications and or how to contact companies about positions. Further information about myself is that, I live in the UK, have retail experience and my studies aren't university level they are Level 5 qualifications.

Long story short, I got into this field a little bit older and I'm now in my late 30s. My first position after graduating with an associates in IT Systems Management was a desktop support position, doing mostly password resets, imaging and deploying computers, printer calls and support of that nature. I left because I didn't like the environment and it was stressful as I worked for engineers. I'm now in my second it support position. I make more money and I now have more responsibilities including setting up new users, network permissions, doing more projects, some sharepoint administration, 0365 administration, some network administration but I'm also still stuck doing all the menial tasks too like password resets, replacing mice and lower level helpdesk stuff as we are a small business. I've been doing some online courses learning about azure and some basic cybersecurity but my title is still basically support technician. I want to get away from this lower level stuff and do more higher level things and really grow more but I'm not sure of a clear way to do this. I've told my employer I'm doing some online courses wihh Lydia. Com and udemy and Microsoft but what esle do I need to do? Shoild I get an mcse or somethjng? Should. I focus on the cloud only and keep learning? I' most likely will need to leave this employer for a new one but without having a better title I fear I'll always be stuck with these lower level menial jobs and I fear I'm also getting older and older. Should I go back to. School and try for a degree? I have no children so I have more free time then others my age but feel I could really use some mentoring or suggestions. Thank you"

Want to advance, but don't want to switch companies/jobs if it's just going to be the same situation somewhere else with the same lack of experience. Don't know where to go from here, or how to advance. I know it doesn't help that I know almost nothing in the field(school =/= real world experience), and what you learn online/on your own really doesn't help or apply to the job market. I feel stuck in this position. I don't entirely hate technical support, but I hate being in this position where it feels like I'm the team secretary and not actually technical support.

I'm a veteran and have access to a couple years left of free education benefits (disclaimer, I wasted half my time getting a bachelors in criminal justice). I'm security cleared and currently living in NYC, Should I pursue a second bachelor's degree or go to grad school instead? Specifically for Cybersecurity. I know the IT field stresses the importance of certifications, experience, and proper networking. However, because I am a veteran and have a few years of free education benefits remaining, I really think going back to school and obtaining a degree will help to provide the foundation through which I can actually start working towards certifications, experience, and a professional network. The only question I have now is, which school is right for me? Because I already graduated and obtained a bachelors in criminal justice, I think I would be better off pursuing graduate level education. But I also think it's kind of silly, trying to pursue even higher leveled education in a field that is completely irrelevant from what I studied for four years. At the same time, should I really invest another four years of my life into obtaining a second bachelor's degree? TLDR: I want to get into IT but have no relevant experience or knowledge. Should I pursue undergraduate or graduate level education?"

Lastly, Cybersecurity seems all the rage and my family suggested to major in this. However, the certs seem whack, and most the job requirements I looked up in this field require crazy amounts of experience like 3 to 5 years or sometimes 10+. However, with the way things are looking politically it does look like this field is on the rise the most, but the degree seems too niche and doesn't leave you with much of a back up plan to do something else if you lose interest in security, or am I wrong about all that?"

564,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,(PSA) Interested in public-sector Cybersecurity? Consider Scholarship for Service!,1,eppcet,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/eppcet/psa_interested_in_publicsector_cybersecurity/,2020-01-17 07:48:27,"Hello, all. I have provided an answer on several entry-level related Cyber Security questions. It was requested that I make a post for reference purposes! If you are interested in joining Cybersecurity in the public sector, there exists an NSF-Funded program called Cybercorps Scholarship for Service. This program is aimed at college students, and primarily students who are pursuing a graduate degree. The Scholarship for Service program consists of the federal government paying for any and all tuition (including out-of-state), fees, books, health insurance, certifications, *and pays the student a salary on top of that* to pursue a degree and perform research in Cybersecurity. In return, upon graduation the student must commit to working a Cybersecurity-related position in a federal, state, local, or tribal government organization for an equal amount of funded years. For a Master's you would be required to work for two years. This program is excellent, and I know for a fact that the majority of three-letter federal organizations (CIA, FBI, NSA, DOD, etc.) are jumping at the bit to hire these graduates. Every student of this program that I knew of at my alma mater had full time offers before they even finished their first years. Overall, this program is a no-brainer consideration for anyone that wants to break into public Cybersecurity that doesn't mind going back to school for another degree. This program *does* fund Bachelor's students as well, but at a lower rate and with higher competition. You can read more about this program on the official government website here: [URL The website contains more information regarding the program, as well as a list of participating colleges and universities. I hope this resource helps!"

So I've been looking at a local private career college for some extra schooling. they will help me get certs, and some have built in internship programs. \- Network systems admin gets me A+, Net+, CCNA, MCSA and other relevant courses, no internship. aimed at smaller enterprise systems. \- Network system management gets me A+, Net+, Sec+, CCNA, MCSE and other courses, no internship. aimed at medium to larger enterprises. \- Cybersecurity Specialist gets me A+, Net+, Sec+, Cysa+, Pentest+, CCNA, MCSE and other courses with a 5 week internship. All three are interesting to me. All three give me a diploma to add to my bachelor degree. Should I start off with one of the network systems courses since even though i have a 4 year CS degree, i have no experience? is it possible to get hired with the Cybersecurity diploma + certs + degree + 5 week internship? really looking for some advice. I have a fallback career in trucking that I had before school and am back in right now to keep my bills paid. what would you guys do/suggest? maybe I'm looking at the wrong path to IT. let me know please. ask me anything you need clarified."

I had originally planned on using this exam as a primer for the SSCP as most everyone does. I was just wondering if I even need to pay the exam fee for this or not. I kind of want to do it as a personal goal. No one has ever asked me about the time I got it (2013). I let it lapse as this was when the Continuing Education program started. I hated the concept of having to pay to keep it valid. I did not pursue any more security certifications in its time. Thinking of dropping the A+ off the resume too. I also graduate with a BS in Cybersecurity in May. I am positive I will pass my CCNA Security on 2/1. I have been studying for the last 9 months. \---------------------------------- About me: I am a 30 year old Network Engineer 3 for a Fortune 50 ISP making around 89k. I am in their Managed Services Department handling Enterprise Firewalls, Networking, and Wireless for Fortune 500 companies and their hub locations across the nation. On a day to day basis, I manage tons of things such as VPNs and Firewall policies, Routing, Switching, even things such as traffic shaping Guest Wifi. SD-WAN and Metro-E too. \--------------------------------- *My current certifications are as followed.* Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA): Routing and Switching (2015, 2018) Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA): Windows Server 2012 R2 (2017) Microsoft Specialist: Server Virtualization with Windows Server Hyper-V and System Center (2017) Ciena Carrier Ethernet Associate (2018) Microsoft Certified Desktop Support Technician (MCDST) (2011) CompTIA Security+ (2013) CompTIA Network+ (2010) CompTIA A+ (2010) I have goals of CCNP Enterprise and Service Provider before going to CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure.

My parents are successful, but my mom is self employed with no formal education, and my dad didnt get his degree until he was already in a senior position. They are very adamant that the only way I can progress long term is if I have a computer engineering degree and nothing else. If I dont have something with ""engineering"" I will hit a pay cap. The logic made more sense when I had no experience and was originally planning to get a degree then a job. The thing is when you look at job postings they mostly say ""an IT related degree"", a clearance, cert X,Y,Z along with experience with specific systems. I currently have an AA and certifications in business and am two tests away from an AA in I.T. systems. I have over 90 college credits and 6 months of formal network training. I also have A+, Sec+, and work is about to send me out of state to do a CCNA bootcamp. I am in the service and my contract ends in two years and I plan to get my bachelors, CCNP, and a few more certs before I get out. Right now I am looking at going to WGU for a bachelor's in network operations and security. The program allows me to go at a faster pace with my experience along with giving me 12 different certs. This should give me flexibility to continue networking, or move to a different role such as sysadmin or cybersecurity. For my work experience I'm part of the network management team managing over $100 million in equipment on several networks. I primarily work on long terms projects and higher level troubleshooting when our technician team hits a wall. At my last location I ran a two man team in charge of a network with 500 wireless endpoints and over 10k users. Over several months the two of us rebuilt the entire boundary with brand new equipment, moved to a 10 gigabit backbone, reduced 350 vlans to 40, built two dhcp/dns servers from scratch (our server team wasn't able to support is cuz reasons), and a esxi host with monitoring. We also fixed SSH on 50 switches while documenting the entire physical and logical layout. I believe I have more experience than most people my age. With my experience and plan I think going for a computer engineering degree instead of WGU with certs would actually hurt me ove help me. Is there anyone way I can prove to them with evidence or good logic that in this day in age I dont need a specific degree to get far, just a degree? I'm going to go the route I want no matter what, but just want them off my back."

My first goal is to land a first IT job. My degree was in IT, but had some focus in CyberSecurity. I am not sure I really want to pursue a career in Cybersecurity, but I know it will benefit me no matter what I end up doing. The degree was a B.S. in IT management and Cybersecurity I'll be moving Raleigh-Durham soon and will be trying to figure out what is ""hot"" there. My personal study tends to be all over the place, because I dont have a focus. I feel like I need to learn more about Linux, SQL, Active Directory, html and CSS, troubleshooting, security, etc. I think maybe I need to narrow down things and figure out what I want to focus on. If anything I would say I'm interesting in DBA and other data jobs, like analyst, scientist, engineer... Other things would be Linux admin or maybe something Cloud or in security. Data Science/Admin/Anaylst might be what interest me most, but how does it compare career wise to other IT fields? It feels like its own thing, like if I focused on it and didnt like it, my experience wouldnt help me if I wanted to switch to something in security or networking? If I want to focus on data, what does that all incorporate? Should I try to learn cloud along with that? Or maybe Linux Admin? I'm not so interested in making security or networking a career focus tbh, but I wouldnt know until I tried I guess. But I tend want to focus on something in Data. If I want to focus on data should I start making that my main focus? Or should I continue to try to get a good broad knowledge of IT like get a CCNA and the Comptia Certs? Is data a good career focus in IT?"

What is a better move for me between these two acceptances and potential paths? I need to make the right decision here. Im a total n00b, i.e. I do not have any professional IT experience. I am well aware how little formal education is valued in the field compared to experience, but I wanted to go back to school anyway for a few reasons, and I see it as an opportunity to actually change fields in a way that could have a practical outcome, rather than a pipe dream. So I do appreciate any concern to the contrary, but I am going to pursue a masters degree right now. However maybe you could incorporate some doubts there to any advice as to which program to choose, if warranted. I understand masters degrees are cash cows, however I am quitting my current field and thus not pursuing a phd there. I am coming from a different field, one that requires a heavy amount of (scientific) computing, hence my eventual interest in computer systems, cybersecurity, and stuff. I want/wanted to go to graduate school now (I am 25), and I want to work in computer networking or something similar. I am studying for some certs, and since I want to go to grad school anyway, I am looking to get a degree. I am open to compsci as I have enjoyed my experiences with C, C++, however I think my true passion and potential future competitive advantage is something systems and security related. I know big ambitions but I am going to try because I really want it. **Temple University:** This is a PSM degree. This means Professional Science Masters, a new sort of degree program (from NSF funding?) meant to prepare people for professional (applied/real world emphasis over the theoretic) roles in scientific fields. Is this good or bad? I dont know, but I do know that when I go back to school, I dont want to get back into academia. I want to get into applied things related to my interest above, gain practical (work) experience, etc. The PSM is in in ""Computer and Systems Security"" within the engineering school. It has a focus on cyber-physical systems. This is of interest to me, some students matriculate to the EE masters. I do not care much for theory at this point in my life. My undergrad is not in compsci, this is not my competitive advantage. However, this program was only founded in 2014/5, professional networking and recognition/reputation of the degree may be an issue. Not good (I want a cool job, eventually.) I can only find a couple alumni on LinkedIn. So I do not necessarily mind. However, what does the industry think? I know experience is valued over education. This masters program is certification and internship intensive. Temple, however, is much lower ranked in compsci &amp; engineering, than my other acceptance. Temple is in Philly, my home town, and I would love to work here after graduating. **NC State (North Carolina State University - NCSU):** This is where I currently live, i.e. this would be a less expensive option. I do not plan on staying here after graduating (despite the relevant local industries). So, I guess this is objectively better. Better compsci and engineering rank, reputation, whatever (does this matter? I tried to apply to only NSA-CAE schools, Temples application there is pending). Probably better alumni network in the field from NC State? However, I am not sure if it is better. My friend told me of someone who \*literally\* had a bachelors degree in Jazz Music Theory and got in while around my age. Maybe because everyone matriculates to the non-thesis option for the degree. However, doesnt sound particularly competitive and I am unsure how to take that."

I have a bachelor's in chemistry with about 4 years of law enforcement experience with a local department. I currently work in insurance investigating claims while attending school online. I have a family that is also dependent upon my income, so, unfortunately, I can't really take an internship. I was hoping to start getting some IT experience while in school so, once my degree is finished, I can have a better chance of transitioning into a DF/incident response/cybersecurity role. I have been teaching myself python in the meantime with Automate the Boring Stuff and have started getting fairly comfortable with X-Ways Winhex and Wireshark. What jobs should I be looking into that are entry level and would possibly give me a shot (I live in the Denver area). If there aren't any jobs that would likely accept me as I am currently, how should I go about improving my chances? Also, should I be looking into getting certifications now or wait until I actually have a position. Thanks!"

(I'm in NYC),1,ew1slf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ew1slf/advice_for_pursuing_a_career_in_cyber_security_im/,2020-01-30 18:36:44," So some background info: I recently graduated from Stony Brook University with a BS in Computer Information Systems and a specialization in Systems and network administration. I'm also enrolling in a certification program that trains you for 17 weeks in order to attain your Cisco CCNA Cyber Ops Certification. The institution is called Per Scholas and I've heard there a other programs like this where they'll invest in people who prove they are qualified to be accepted and trained and that the the program is free for those with low income. This training program also helps the accepted individuals professionally (resume, elevator pitches) and to network with IT professionals and to also help you land decent entry level positions like a cyber security analyst etc. It feels like this could help me transition into a full time position. There's also a chance for the students who complete the program could get a paid internship with Barclays after the program since they're one of the sponsors for the program. reference: [URL  I've also been accepted into a cyber security Grad program at SUNY Polytechnic Institute (18 month program in Utica) but the real issue lies here. Because I come from a low income background I was able to get financial aid to help with the undergrad, but I know grad school doesn't. And the costs go even further if you have to move out closer to this distant school. But it's been recommended to me and I've personally read about this grad program and it seems quite reputable. But there's a diversity scholarship that will cover the costs of tuition and offer a stipend to live near and further grants awarded if you dedicate yourself to additional responsibilities if you get it (of course it's extremely competitive) and prior to getting into grad school there are 2 courses they've required me to take at a local college before they fully allow me to enroll but at this time no further financial aid will be given unless its loans so there are further costs to consider. So this path while seems to have a lot to gain has a lot of financial risks. I don't think there are any CUNY grad programs that offer a cyber security program unless I missed them (correct me if I've missed any). The plan was that if I get the scholarship I would decide to pursue this MS program. Otherwise I would try to make the best of the certification program One last part to the grad program is that the school offers the entire program online. But I don't know how effective it is to take a grad course online or if that it's worth considering. reference : [URL Last questions: So how necessary is grad school for a career in Cyber security? Although my major leans in the field of network administration, there are many concepts I've learned that are also needed in this career. So the practical knowledge is what I value. And both the certification course and grad program emphasize on physical/practical knowledge and testing that will help make me qualified for a solid career. Is it fine to build a career in NY, what are some other states you would recommend looking into building a career whats a good salary to aim for? I'm more interested in a technical career, I don't have an interest in managerial positions. Last thoughts, I'm 22 so I'm trying to weigh my options so I can properly plan my future so any thoughts, concerns, and recommendations are appreciated. Thanks for reading."

I missed my exam date for my A+ (Jiu Jitsu injury) and Im about to reschedule but something interesting developed that I wanted to share with you and get your thoughts on. I recently received an invitation to sign up for IT classes at a job placement agency in NYC. They offer the A+ and Network + under the IT Support Career Track and CyberSecurity under the CyberSecurity Career Track. I meet with the counselor on Tuesday of next week to decide which one to choose. This is difficult for me as I have no experience at all in IT. Im a stay at home Dad who lost his job during the banking crisis. Was driving Uber but thats not cutting it. My wife does well but we decided it would save us more if I just stay at home and develop skills/certifications vs me driving and us hiring a care taker for our boys. So....Im wondering what the demand is for both paths. I know CyberSecurity is and will be a huge area in technology but should I go into the IT Path and snatch up both Certs????

I joined the Army when I was 17 years old and worked there for 3 years in a job unrelated to IT. Last year I left the military to be a full time student and my veteran benefits completely pay for tuition and living expenses. I'm currently in a phase where everything about IT interests me, and I'm not sure what specific field I want to pursue. I code in my free time, I'm in the Cybersecurity club at my school, and last semester I got my A+ and CCENT. I had a lot of free time last semester so I thought finding a help desk job would be a fun way to get IT experience and make some extra coin while I'm still a student. I accepted a full time Help Desk position with a small MSP (M-F 8 hours per day with a 1 hour unpaid lunch $15 per hour) and opted to take all my classes in the evening and online this semester. I've been working this job for a month now and my commute is about an hour per day. Although I'm learning so much everyday, the atmosphere at this place is miserable. The owner is not very pleasant, all of the techs verbally express their distaste for our clients and their job, and documentation for anything is non-existent. This week the owner fired an employee, who seemed like a critical part of the team to me, for something minor. I can tell the turn over at this place is very high. The quality of my school work is dropping due to waking up for work at 6am and not getting home from class until 7-9pm throughout the week. I also don't have much time for my hobbies (exercising, coding, fishing, reading, socializing with other human beings). I am very grateful for the opportunity to work on the help desk, but I think I might have jumped into the deep end of the pool without realizing it. **What I'm asking for:** I got this job purely out of personal interest and to get my feet wet with some real work experience in IT. I don't need this job to pay my bills and put food on the table. I don't even know if I want to get an IT/Networking/Cybersecurity job in the future or if I want to become a software developer. Is this opportunity to get experience on the help desk valuable enough to just buckle down and find a way to manage the other problems its causing in my life (not very happy, lower grades, little free time)? I'm not a quitter and I think my pride might prevent me from quitting this job until its too late. Any suggestions from anybody that has seen a few more moons than me?"
595,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,Bitten off more than I can chew? [First job],1,exs7b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/exs7b4/bitten_off_more_than_i_can_chew_first_job/,2020-02-03 04:57:27,"Hello all, As the title states, I'm apprehensive (but also a little excited) after having recently received tentative confirmation about a job offer. Quick background: Not based in or from the U.S, mid 20s, completed my bachelors in PoliSci and was offered a post-grad scholarship shortly before graduation to do a Masters in a related field, so I took it up out of some interest and focused on cyber/information warfare + counter terrorism. Still finishing up on the one year post-grad, will graduate in summer. \[The job\] I recently applied for the equivalent of a federal position (pretty much working for the local gov) on something related to cyber thinking that I wouldn't get it, but it wouldn't hurt to apply anyway. Quite to my surprise, I did get called for the interview and did the necessary preparation. I was similarly surprised when informed the next day that they were interested in bringing me on board and that I could expect a formal offer in a few weeks. The position in question seems to be related to the preparation of red-teaming exercises (based on the NICE framework the closest seems to be Cyber Instructional Curriculum Developer), but they made it clear during the interview that I would be expected to acquire technical skills if I joined them (they would send me for courses/certifications, it seems) and that I also would have opportunities to rotate to different departments after staying with them for a few years. \[Background experience or lack thereof\] The problem is that I have precious little actual experience and/or knowledge relating to anything cyber. I was interested in this for a few years in my youth - read Mitnick's books on social engineering/lurked on Packetstorm, some basic means of compromising a system (XSS, SQL injections etc) and fooled around with Nmap/Metaspl0it/some RATs/Wireshark/Snort - but didn't actually have any tangible successes to show for my interest. Between my twin interests of current affairs/politics and cyber, I chose the former and followed that pretty much till present. During my course of studies in college, I did pick up some basic scripting experience in R and found it quite enjoyable, but it wasn't to a very high level (i.e I wasn't creating packages, just knowing how to use them to wrangle data). As R is also a statistical language/glorified Excel rather than a general programming language like C or Python, it's probably not very useful for cyber, I'd imagine. I did take an exploratory module to learn basic programming methodology (inheritance, mutability etc) in Python towards the end of my Bachelors but did extremely poorly in it - partly due to having other modules to focus on and partly realizing that others could code much better than I - i.e. they could work through problem sets in a few hours and get the right answer while I struggled to debug my code and solve the problem set even after a few days). I performed particularly poorly when asked to code to solve mathematical/algorithmic problems (anonymous functions were horrible) but did decently during the portion teaching us OOP (which I quite enjoyed since I found it very similar to how most games worked) and even considered learning JS or trying to learn C++ now that I had a basic grasp of what an OOP language was. \[Problem\] Hence why I'm fairly apprehensive about this first job - I feel like I'm woefully under-prepared and in over my head. To be fair, I did make it clear during the interview that I didn't have the CS undergrad or Computing Msc. which they would probably benefit more from and even brought up my horrible grade for that Python/programming methodology module in the interest of full disclosure, but they looked favourably upon my self-directed interest to learn R beyond what was required for my college modules, my past youthful flirtation with cyber-related things and my general geopolitical knowlege/research skills/some domain specific knowledge on APTs etc which I brought to the table. When asked if I was averse to learning about cyber things and going for certification courses in this field, I replied that I wasn't (since I still do have that youthful interest) and would probably look towards it eagerly, just that I wasn't confident in my aptitude or abilities per se. In the end, I suspect they find it easier to train an Arts student in (basic?) technical skills for whatever their purposes are rather than train a CS student to appreciate geopolitics/international politics (which I thought would be easier), and that's why they're willing to take a risk on me. I do plan on accepting the job offer if/when it comes since it seems like a fantastic opportunity to learn and see how far I can go in this domain, but I'm aware of the huge risk the hiring manager is probably taking on me and I don't want to let him/them down. I do have some interest from my youth as mentioned earlier and I've read what I could from this and related subreddits to get a general idea (it seems to be A+, Network+ and Sec+, then see which area one wishes to specialize in?) of this fresh hell (or new opportunity) I've found myself in. Having read, I have a few specific questions for those well versed in this field: 1. For this specific position (the equivalent of a Cyber Instructional Curriculum Developer), would the usual route of A+-&gt;Network+-&gt;Sec+ still be relevant or would I be looking at a different path certifications to study and acquire? 2. Would it be wiser to wait for on job training (since some of what I've read emphasize how these certifications are more for knowledge/as a HR formality) and for them to send me for courses or should I try to hunker down and study for these things in between completing my post-grad and starting the job? 3. If it's the former for the above question, what else can/should I do now to better prepare for the position? I've read [the Miessler guide](URL as helpfully suggested and will probably start building a VM lab, but I'm not sure whether idly tinkering around would be productive or if I should direct my endeavours in a more focused manner towards...something? 4. Are there different positions within the NICE framework which emphasize programming more or less than others? Some of what I've read from this/other subs seem to suggest that actually being able to code is peripherally useful at best for data wrangling but not critical to one's job in network security or something similar, while others seem adamant that programming is the bread and butter of cybersecurity. Is it a case of 'in general you should understand if/else loops and hopefully a bit more than that but you probably won't be expected to get your hands dirty' or 'some positions like Digital Forensics would need you to understand coding on a fundamental level but not so much others'? 5. Given the huge breadth of positions within the cybersecurity domain, I realize that the specific position mentioned above seems to be among the least technically intensive as compared to others like Incident Response, for example. What might be some related positions that I should consider rotating towards if I somehow flourish in this role after a few years? I'm incredibly thankful that such an opportunity presented itself and I do hope to do my best, but at the same time (given my background described above) I think my apprehension could be forgiven.

In the last couple of months, I passed Comptia A+ and Comptia Network+. Now I am studying for Security+ and plan to take the exam in around 3 months. After that, my goal is to get Linux+. I already have tons of experience in Linux and with various UNIX systems, but not of professional type, but I've always used Linux and BSDs as my OSes of choice so I want to kind of validate the skills I posses and eventually upgrade some theoretical knowledge about it. I don't have a degree, but a couple of months ago I enrolled in Associate Degree in an affordable online university. I also don't have any prior professional IT experience, except having worked as a computer graphic designer a couple of years ago. So I am basically looking for a entry in the IT. I recently started learning Python as well. I am wondering, what can I do with those 4 certifications, and having in mind the fact that I never worked in the IT before, and have no degree in it ( at least not yet ). What kind of job should I look for after I get these certs and what do you think are my best options/possibilities - what would you do in my place? I really enjoy cybersecurity topics and especially UNIX-related stuff. I love working with these kinds of systems. I also want to learn more and become better skilled in each new day. And BTW I am 34, and live in Ireland. Thanks for any hints, opinions, ideas, or critics."

Perhaps there are things I have forgotten and could refresh. 2. Learn new techniques. Learning anything new is always good. 3. Have a certificate that I can put on my resume. I have worked with my employer's cybersecurity department and they do security reviews. They would run scan on software and then tell us what vulnerability are there, assign priority, and then tell us to fix it. Frankly, that scanning procedureal aspect of the cybersecurity job isn't that appealing to me. I would prefer to internalize that security knowledge so that when I can write code that isn't vulnerable, so cybersecurity to me is more of a means than an end. What do you think?

I did the normal helpdesk thing handling calls and tickets, pushing tickets up to those who were T2's, but I did lots of computer re-imaging and some really light network stuff like resetting a router or creating and running network cables. I worked there for 15 months before eventually going to college. I was recently hired for my colleges IT department as a T1 help desk handling walk-ins, phone calls, and tickets, as well as really general things like laptop/media device checkouts, printer/copier issues, and troubleshooting professors computer/projector/sound system problems. I feel that I have a big head start on most people in IT with almost 2 years of job experience in Helpdesk along with 3 decent certs. I was checking out this reddit a fair amount getting an idea of what employers look for in candidates and where I wanna work in IT. My major is IT but I am going to have an emphasis in Networking and Security but I think Cybersecurity Is looking to be more my thing. My questions are: 1. Am I being naive or cocky wanting more out of an IT job only being 19 since I already have almost 2 years of job experience and certs 2. I am interested in the A+ cert, but should I wait til my junior/senior year of college slightly before I graduate?

My current plan is to, after graduation, jump straight into a dual Master's program with the two focuses being MS MIS and MS Cybersecurity.

My trajectory at MSPs was the following: * 1st job: Helpdesk, 3 years * 2nd job: Helpdesk II, 1 year * Promotion: Systems Engineer, 2 years * Promotion: Technical Account Manager, 1 year * 3rd job: Technical Account Manager, 3 years * 4th job: Internal Sales Engineer, 1 year * Current job: Systems Administrator The ""Technical Account Manager"" title was about being an escalation point for assigned clients, essentially being the ""sysadmin"" for those clients, and also working as sort of a ""vCIO"" to roadmap/plan for future expenses/projects. I have real sales chops from this (and as Internal Sales Engineer), which go virtually unused now (which is fine). When I started at this new Sysadmin role, it was part of a team with 2 helpdesk support, another sysadmin, the director, and another small team handling the ERP development/support. I instinctively approached my onboarding as doing the same thing I did as a Technical Account Manager, being a full examination of the entire network to turn up security flaws, infrastructure needs, and whatever else could use improvement. 8 months later, things are going well, and I've found a niche. I take very, very few tickets, and no one seems to mind this. I almost completely concentrate on mini-to-large projects aimed at improving data integrity, security, and stability. I've worked to install a new backup system, an email security filter, I've taken over administration of the Meraki network (and am halfway through a planned overhaul), and I've added dozens and dozens of new security features, mainly targeting ransomware hardening. I'd have put the security at this company as a D+ when I started, we're definitely at a B+ now, and trending upward. I'm finding that my instinct was to obsess about security, and it bleeds into every single conversation and thought at work. I've also helped tighten up our payment staff, which wasn't even an IT function, just reworking their process to eliminate the retention of CC numbers. Security appears to be my career direction. I know where this leads, and I've already downloaded and began studying CISSP materials. My overall knowledge is more broad than deep (though certainly deep in certain areas, such as email and endpoints, among others), but I feel I have a very good approach to all this philosophically. I guess my question is: what are the job titles for this kind of career path? What should I be looking for? IT Security Analyst? Consultant? Cybersecurity whatever? Additionally (and only partially related): if I were to entertain jumping back to the MSP world, the only thing I'd want to be doing there is either management-level stuff, or as ""the guy who goes into prospective clients cold and does on-the-spot assessments."" What would that title be to look for? I've heard ""pre-sales consultant,"" and I'm sure ""Sales Engineer"" is in there too. Just looking for what my next step will be.

I have questions regarding how to start a career in IT. I did my freshmen year on campus majoring in biomedical engineering. The curriculum consisted of a few coding classes, and I started to take interest in the IT field. I looked up some fields in IT and ran across cybersecurity... and fell in love. With that being said, I switched my major to cybersecurity. I decided to transfer to online schooling so I could work full time. I thought to myself I might as well get relative job experience in IT, so I looked how I could do so. I just bought the Mike Meyer's Comptia A+ book, and I'm looking to take the test within the next 3 months. Am I currently on the right path to a successful IT career? And is there a certain roadmap to follow to a cybersecurity career? Thanks."

I started at a community college around 2016 after getting out of the military. Ive had this passion for computers since I was young and decided to pursue Cybersecurity as a career. I started college and had a rough first semester, I wasnt ready for it and I didnt take it seriously and dropped out. Picked it up again a year later (2017) and struggled due to some learning difficulties I have but managed for the most part to pull it together. Life happened and I stopped going to school and moved to California for a year and just returned to my home state after a divorce. I didnt go to school there but I attempted to register so now I have to wait 6 months before I am a Texas resident again and I can take classes here in Texas without paying out of state tuition fees. In the meantime I was hired by a government agency and Im waiting for my security clearance to process before I start a year long commitment with them. Its a part time position which works out perfectly for me to focus on college. I attempted the Security+ exam about 2 months ago and failed it with 661/750. I absolutely have to have this for government work so I know sooner rather than later I need to tackle it and knock it out. But I dont want to let it go to waste during this year long contract job so I would think its best to put it off for now? My question I guess is what should I be focused on now if I want a successful career in the DoD IT world? Down the road I wouldnt mind working overseas for 2-8 month stints, I dont know if Id want to live overseas though. Im just brainstorming for the time being. Im open to suggestions."

Transitioned to IT from an accounts payable job, I wanted a change of career and job, so I got an internship an a small company. The small company did some IT contracting work, and I started in helpdesk, then promoted to sysadmin/engineering, working with mostly windows, but other linux/unix OS and appliances as needed, LAN switches/routers/FWs, VPNs, etc. Then transitioned to a VoIP gig that leveraged a lot of my networking experience for things like traffic shaping, QoS, and other unified communications oriented technologies like softphones and call center scripting, But really increased my softskills gained originally in helpdesk, but also working with executives, engaging with new clients, building business relationships and transitioning organizations from POTS or digital PBXs to VoIP. I recently transitioned to a security consulting gig that was basically an advisor role(was advertised as an security engineer), and through a weird turn of events, had me managing a SOC team while working with things such as the RMF/CSF and other related frameworks, while also working on cloud architecture and building transition roadmaps from on-premise to cloud. There has been a lot in a short time, invaluable experience, good money, but I find myself interested in pentesting/security research. Aforementioned experience has taken place over a 10 year period. I have been practicing security on and off the books, reading actual books for fun, but this has mostly been as a hobby for the past few years. As such, I have been unsure how to break into the pentesting space without a severe paycut. I am supporting more than myself, so there are income levels that are essential to maintain. I have interviewed at several places for SOC analyst jobs to get my feet wet, and while the feedback I received was positive, the pay ceiling was for the roles were pretty low. I feel like it would be a dream job, to understand and subvert the inner-workings of technology, legally breaking in, and all the while, satisfying the semmaritian complex by helping to empower those with lessons on how I did so. I feel that my experience has been pulling me more into consulting/management, so part of me wonders if I should stick to that trajectory, since that is where the money is, or invest into going back down the technical route, enduring a paycut, and potentially building my skills to be competitive. I recognize the industrys attempt to flood the market with cybersecurity professionals to drive wages down, so a part of me wonders how lucrative working in the exciting pentesting/reversing/exploit development space will be in the next few years. Though because of how hard the field is, that is likely going to keep it lucrative. A tentative game plan is to start with automating a security lab, using it as a portfolio, write ups and blogs on research, and maybe focus my efforts on replicating research, and eventually building a portfolio of bug bounties and CVEs if I get to that level of skill. THEN/OR Look at joining a firm in a junior pentesting role, and growing within that or branching off as an independent researcher. I feel like joining a firm in junior role will bootstrap my experience faster, but will be financially impactful for a longer term, where as taking the lab/security research/portfolio/write ups and blogs might be safer, but take a longer time. Thoughts? Best path, alternatives, not enough info? Any feedback would be helpful, thanks!"

I just dont know where to start without undercutting myself (I have the sec+ and Project+ respectively) . I also have some interest in the Cloud, but I feel like its too far out of reach at this moment. Maybe thats because the Cloud Essentials is the only cert I havent obtained at this current moment. One more thing to note is that internships do not seem like it will be an option for me. I am moving and will definitely need decent money to survive and a lot of them are seasonal anyways. (This means I will have to wait until the beginning of a next opportunity rather than joining something ongoing). Im really looking for some guidance and I do hope that I have some sort of wiggle room. If anyone can point me to some job roles that you think would fit me, I would really appreciate it.

I just want advice on what steps should I take to advance professionally and intellectually. Thanks a lot in advance if someone reads this and comments! # My Situation I'm a **23 years old** Spanish guy, from **Barcelona**. I **dropped out of University** some years ago. I was studying something science-related but not computer science. I did a simple programming course and I got hooked. That's why started studying a CFGS. I think that in English it's called **Certificate of Higher Education** (**HNC**). Basically two year education, professionally oriented. The certificate is called: **Higher Technician in Multi-platform Applications Development**. I will finish it in June 2020. Now I'm ending the lessons of the course and I have to choose a company to serve as an intern in. # My Interests I like programming and tinkering with my computer. I really enjoy configuring and messing with **GNU/Linux** distributions and **GNU Emacs**. I know a bit of **Lisp and bash** and I really like writing small scripts and functions. I'm **not too keen on OOP** or Front-end languages: Java, Cpp, etc. What I like about scripting is that I get to know how the systems work, each time going a bit lower in level, understanding how everything is connected. I prefer this over programming some big commercial application, or ERP, or database, etc. Another thing I really **want to get into is Networks**. At the moment my knowledge about them is extremely shallow but I have plans to learn much more. Besides that course, I love spending around 1.5-2 hours a day **learning autodidactically**. I've read a couple of books on GNU/Linux and bash. Now I'm learning general programming and Lisp with [SICP](URL I'm really liking this book and I feel like I'm learning a lot doing the exercises. I also like learning languages. I have a **C1** certificate in **English**. I've been consistently studying **German** for 4 years. I have more or less a **B2** level, but I have no certificates yet. Lately **I've been reading about Cybersecurity**. One of the most thorough introductions I've found is this post: [How to Build a Cybersecurity Career \[ 2019 Update \]](URL One of the things I like more about it is its **multi-disciplinary nature**: how it interconnects systems administration, programming and networks (and maybe, also hardware). I love the feeling of knowing how the different parts of a system work, in different levels. I also enjoy its political aspect: I like reading about these cyber-activists (e.g. Assange, Snowden), about how our technological rights are being endangered and about how our society and the way our communication networks work. # My Future I feel like **I've lost a lot of years** going to the University... to ending up dropping out of it. The only job I've had has been for just a month (July), on a small company from a friend of my family, as an IT technician (I just put together a couple of computers, installed Windows 10 on them and some other programs, answered phone calls, etc...). This **makes me quite anxious** and, If I'm being honest, scared. On the other hand, these last couple of years and months I've felt much more **disciplined and purposeful**. I feel like my willingness to learn new things and my ambition is only increasing. I see myself building a career in this industry. I have a plan more or less modeled in my brain. Now I'm finishing my course and I will begin an internship somewhere. As soon as I start having a salary, I want to start **studying remotely** (at an online University) to get a **Computer Science degree**, even If I just do one subject at a time, steadily. I **may go to another country** (maybe for just a couple of years) to do this (e.g. Great Britain or Germany), since school prices and overall living conditions in Spain are kind of rough, compared to the wages. I also want to master my German and/or English skills and live new experiences now that I'm still young. At this moment, the career that interests me the most is Cybersecurity, so when I finish with university, I may want to pursue a Masters Degree in it. Besides the certifications, about which I will ask you some things in a moment. # My Questions Here are the most important questions that I'm thinking right now: \- **What should I look for in an internship**, If in the long term, I want to pursue a Cybersec career? **My course is mostly focused in the development** of Apps, using OOP, languages like Java, C++, Python, implementing ERP, administrating DB, etc. So I think these would be the easiest things to find for me. But I've also done a bit system administration. Also, since I use GNU/Linux and have tinkered and read quite a bit about it, the command line, bash etc. I think I could maybe land also an internship as a (Linux) system administrator. What should I search for? \- As I've said, lately I've been determined to invest a couple of hours per day into **learning auto-didactically**, besides the course. I've been using books, but maybe studying for certifications is a better idea (I learn but I also end up with a certification if I do and pass the exam). I've read in some places (e.g. the cybersec career guide I've linked above) that **certifications can be very important**. That guide mentions that a beginner should get these: **A+**, **Network+**, **Linux+**, **Security+**, and then, he can get the more advanced ones like CISSP, CISA, etc. Is this so? Are these certifications the ones that employers look out for the most (also, in Europe, not just the USA)? Should I first get these 4 first? What would be the preferred order? Do you recommend some specific books/guides/programs to get them? Should I get the Security certificates first, so I can land a job in the field, and then begin studying at the University remotely? \- **Do you think my plans for the future are realistic**? First getting an internship, while studying for certificates. Then getting a job with a real salary while studying for the University and/or studying for certificates. Then getting a cibersecurity job while still learning on the side, to advance. Thanks a lot if you read this. I would appreciate it immensely if I could get some quick counseling from some of you, who are much more knowledgeable about the industry and experienced in life in general. I'm sorry for the lengthy post. If you know another Reddit or web page or forum in which this post would make more sense to be, please tell me. Have a great day!!"

The IT internship will only be hosted at another campus, a campus where my current means of transportation wont allow me to make it there on time on a consistent basis. The software development internship is being hosted at the campus where Im attending and I can get there relatively quick. During the internship, Ill be getting an intro to python programming (which I hear is really hot right now) and Ill be taking courses in A+ operating systems and A+ computer essentials and support. Im gonna be studying for certs to take down the road additionally. The ones I have on my checklist at the moment are the A+, Security+, and CCNA CyberOps (looking into CySA+ also).

The internship in software development looks like my only viable option at the moment and Im trying to gain some sort of experience. Im trying to get into the cybersecurity.

I think I may have made a huge mistake and am wondering if I should cut my losses now and quit. Alberta law protects me up to 75% minimum refund of my tuition in best case scenario which is I quit now before I've completed more than ten percent of the course. Sadly this does not cover books, for which I have already paid a staggering amount. Over three thousand up front for limited access to online books, and that's just this semester. The entire course is reading from textbook and using an online program called TestOut. This program will also be giving me my COMPTIAA certs. I was doing really well the first part of the class where I was learning about hardware and how to actually build a computer, but now we have moved on to networking and some of the more esoteric stuff and this is not stuff I personally can just read about to learn it properly. I've passed most of my quizzes on TestOut by redoing them multiple times. I have no idea what port 80 is or does.

It's just this in depth stuff is beyond my understanding alone, I need help and none is forthcoming. The answers are all in the book my teacher says, and every module is described as self directed.

At my internship this summer, I had a brief opportunity to work with some professional red-teamers from a small cybersecurity consulting firm. After picking the brains of the consultants and doing some research on the side, I realized that this company would be a great match for my skills and interests. I knew that they didn't have an official internship program, but I knew they'd had at least one intern in the past. So, I messaged one of the consultants I talked to and asked if there was any such opportunity. He messaged me back fairly quickly -- he told me that he asked around, and that the Chief of Staff said I could email her my resume and would be handling any potential internships. After touching up my resume and bolstering it with a project, I sent it in with a message that served as a cover letter. It's been three weeks, and I haven't heard anything back. If I was applying to a position with a formal application, I would understand a long delay, but because this is more of an informal thing (with a direct email to an employee), I would assume that there's less of a line in front of me. My worry is that my email got buried, and it would be a shame to let my #1 opportunity slip away just because I was afraid of being persistent. Do you think a second email would be a good idea? Nothing passive-aggressive -- just a ""Hey, just letting you know I'm still interested in any potential opportunities, etc. etc.""? Thank you! **TL;DR** Thanks to knowing a contact at a really awesome company, I was put in touch with the Chief of Staff to inquire about potential internships (since they don't have official internship openings).

The most basic thing you need to understand about cybersecurity: It revolves around stuff communicating with other stuff. Anything from side-channel attacks to large-scale DDoS - stuff is insecure because stuff communicates with other stuff. Communication can be hard understand and even harder to define (let alone secure). I know this is a very vague statement, but its one of the core, fundamental concepts of cybersecurity. The second most basic thing about cybersecurity you need to understand - hacking (I hate that word) as its known is not some bond-villain type activity. Its intentionally mis-using something that already exists in a way that introduces a security flaw into the environment. Sometimes the right circumstances line up and this flaw can be leveraged into something, but sometimes it cant. I split up my resources into offensive-based and defensive-based because its important for you to understand that while each of these groups are individually important, each knowledge area is not as effective without the an understanding of the other one. One other thing to note - Certifications are great, but you need to de-couple the idea that certifications=knowledge/skills in this field. There are certainly certifications that break out of that mold, but for the most part, this holds true. Ive ordered them in the order in which I used/learned with these resources, so you can follow-along directly in order (if you want to). I learned offense first, so thats the way Im laying it out here. Offensive-Based: I started my career in InfoSec by studying for the most basic, foundational certification: The Security+. This is the best beginner-level cert that says I know something about security. I learned by going through Professor Messers entire course, and I felt pretty ready after I went through it all. Heres the [link to his Sec+ course](URL Now, lets get into some practical stuff. OverTheWire. These are war-games, or CTFs - challenges designed to test your practical ability in security, but also designed to help you learn new things. CTFs are the *absolute best* way Ive found to learn security. Heres the [link to OverTheWire](URL in case Google is down. If you get stuck, here are some [helpful write-ups](URL Do them in this order: * Bandit * Leviathan * Natas * Narnia. At this point, you should be set to start with the books and Hacking Labs. * [Penetration Testing](URL (Book, Follow-along labs) * [Hacking, the Art of Exploitation](URL (2nd Edition, Book, follow-along labs) At this point, Id recommend going for another certification - CEH. Once you have the CEH, youre ready to move into more practical-based certifications. [Here's what I used to learn and practice the CEH:](URL Now, lets get into some more practical exploitation. PentesterLabs focuses a bit more on WebApp stuff, but Ive found its the best intro-environment (as it is relatively scripted scenarios, and you dont have to do as much recon). They're fairly explanatory, and will walk you through the solution if you get stuck. * [PentesterLabs](URL Next, lets get into HackTheBox (Exploitable virtual machines, ranging in difficulty. Youre going in mostly blind here, so you have to do your own recon and enumeration): [HackTheBox](URL Here are some helpful write-ups (Written Explanations): * [GitHub](URL * [0xRick Webiste](URL Also, theres some super awesome [video explanations by IppSec](URL After you get through most of these, you should be set to start on your OSCP. The OSCP contains a course (Penetration Testing with Kali), a lab environment (~50-60 vulnerable boxes), and a practical lab test at the end. [OSCP](URL After youve completed the OSCP, then you have enough knowledge to continue directly down the cert path, and the courses (in combination with the certs) put out by Offensive Security contain enough good content to where you dont have to study other resources. The certification path from here on out splits into two different areas: Technical, and management. * Technical: * OSCE (OSCP 2, basically) * OSWE (OSCP but for web exploitation) * OSEE (OSCP 3, really fucking hard). If youre at this point, getting past the OSEE, you can pretty much walk into any offensive-based job, slap youre cert on the table, and theyll hire you. You dont need my help anymore here. Now, here's the management path: * Management: * CISSP * PMP * MBA Having the technical background of the OSCP, plus a CISSP, PMP, and MBA would create an extremely potent executive - one who can understand the technical details and risk, and who then could translate that into verbiage that other executives could understand. So, youre overall standard security offensive certification path should look something like: * Security+ * CEH * OSCP * OSCE * OSWE * OSEE OR * Security+ * CEH * OSCP * CISSP * PMP * MBA Now, for the Defensive-based side. There are a ton of different things you can do on the defensive side. The path here is a bit less defined because you can specialize in each of these areas with out ever really touching the other ones. But I think these are the most important skills as a defender, so Ill break it up into three smaller chunks. For the most part, defender/Blue-team concepts draw from these skills, Ive setup the courses in order, as some of these skills may feed into other areas.

Recently, the organization has gone through some restructuring due to a massive acquisition that is occurring as I type this, and as part of that restructuring, my manager, who oversees two applications, is now going to solely oversee one application and that application is being placed under a different department. Currently, she manages an API manager as well as the public key infrastructure. I was hired to work on both. On any given day I would estimate that 90% of my time is spent with the API manager and 10% on the PKI stuff. I am the only person on the team and the sole point of contact in the company for PKI responsibilities. Additionally, I am in a critical role with the API manager for devops and migration tasks that are occurring. I am the only person from my team that my manager involves in meetings dealing with system design and coordination with other departments. I have been overseeing a vast number of tasks related to CICD pipeline development and future AWS Lambda integrations. Early last week my manager got our team together to announce that the API manager was shifting to a different department due to organization restructuring. From an architectural stand point, the shift makes sense as this particular application really has no business being under the cybersecurity umbrella. She made no mention of the idea that I would not be going with the team, rather, she just indicated that nothing decisive had occurred yet and that for the mean time, business remains the same. Today before work I noticed a potentially critical situation with one of our nodes. My manager had left for the day already but the director was still around so I felt it best to bring it to her attention. In doing so, we got to chatting and she informed me that the plan was for me to remain with the cybersecurity team maintaining the PKI stuff. This came as a shock to me because of how critical my responsibilities are with the API manager. She asked me what I would prefer and I instantly said the API manager. I explained that it more appropriately aligns with my background and my skill set. I have a formal computer science degree from a target school and I am a very strong software development engineer. We continued discussing what kind of roles I could move in to if I stayed with the cybersecurity team but the reality is that I firmly believe if I stay in cybersecurity doing PKI stuff then my job will hit a dead end and I will be pidgeonholed into strict IT responsibilities which is not what I want. I asked the director whether my direct manager wanted to keep me and she said unequivocally yes. The problem is that the department she is moving under would have to make room for me in the budget and it isnt as cut and dry as me going with them since I was originally hired under the premise of the PKI budget. There would have to be some extra accounting done by the finance department for me to stay with my manager. The director did make it sound like discussions were still under way about where I would end up but it didnt sound promising. Ultimately I know that if I stay with the cybersecurity, I will be looking for a new job, but I dont want to jump the gun if theres a chance that I could stay in a real development role with my current manager. I plan on speaking to her about this immediately but I dont want to make her uncomfortable because by bringing this topic up I am essentially calling her out for not informing me of this. I feel like decisions are being made about where I should go without anyone asking me where I want to be until I was voluntold where I was going to end up at which point they briefly asked for my input. I would really appreciate any recommendations on how to broach this with my current manager without causing an uncomfortable situation."

I want to start off by thanking all of you that take the time to candidly share your stories, and respond to our questions. Your feedback has been incredibly helpful &amp; insightful. I am completing my Bachelors in Information Technology, Cybersecurity concentration. Some succinct bullet points about my background: - My professional experience comes from 3+ years of working as a digital marketer. - I do not have any hands on IT experience - I aim to get CompTIA certs in Linux+, Security+, &amp; Networking+ Ive been approached for in internship position as Field Services, IT Support. What are your thoughts? Is this an internship worth taking? Or, am I better off continuing to build my portfolio with my own side projects (pen testing, learning Python), then only considering Cybersecurity specific internships/entry level jobs? After all, I chose the Cyber concentration for a reason. I am usually the person that has a lot of humility &amp; very little ego, which is part of the reason why I was considering the internship. But, on the flip side, a healthy ego can help us have a sense of self worth. Though humility and modesty have their place, I do not want to fall into a trap of taking a lower level opportunity, when there are potentially much, much smarter ways to go about this. May I also be candid in saying that an entry level job as say, a junior Cybersecurity analyst is vastly different in compensation in comparison to an entry level IT field technician (by no means am I degrading those types of jobs, as again, the humility part of me was very onboard for the internship). And, I have student loans to consider. Thank you!"

664,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,Which Masters degree would be best for a CyberSec guy who wants to move into mgmt in his 40s? (MBA vs M.S. in IT vs M.P.S in Technical Management vs M.P.S. in Cybersecurity),1,dz600n,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/dz600n/which_masters_degree_would_be_best_for_a_cybersec/,2019-11-21 05:23:00,"Hello all, I know that this sub is largely against getting a master's degree but I recently learned that I will be able to pay a LOT less for one that I initially thought. I am still trying to keep it cheap though, and I am only applying to the local collection of satellite campuses for my state's State Schools. (I can explain this further if needed but it's not important). I am currently 25, working as a weird mix of Tier 2 support and Cyber-security - mostly vulnerability scans and policy writing, and have been doing this for 1 year, and have 2 years experience as generic helpdesk. In 3 years, when I am eligible for the CISSP, I intend to earn it, and already have 6 active certifications right now: * A+ * Net+ * Sec+ * CySA+ * AWS Practitioner * ITIL Foundation I have a 4 year degree in computer science, no tracks/focuses/minors. Just plain ol' comp sci. I want to move into management and even be CISO in my later years, but now I enjoy being \*very\* technical. I know it's hard to do in cyber-security, but I would like to stay very technical for as long as possible. Anyway, this campus offers 4 masters degrees that would apply to my career. * MBA (Business Administration) * M.S in IT * M.P.S in Technical Management * M.P.S. in Cyber-Security I know that classically, an MBA would help me most in my desire to be CISO or CTO of an average/normal company (I don't have any delusions about replacing Andy Jassy). It is generic business principles (which I am tangentially familiar with), and would probably be the best bet if I were to ever apply to a management job or C-level job, instead of being promoted to one. I can not predict what my job/company/tenure would look like in 15-ish years but I am not one to jump ship quickly. An MBA would also take the longest, between 2 and 3 years. I know that often a Masters in CyberSec can have detriments due to being very pointed in its material and also due to being seen (by the industry) as being more of a drawn-out certification than a ""real masters"". This is only 6 classes, 18 credits. Done in 2 semesters, realistically. I also know that M.S. in IT would be the most generic and maybe even the most useful and most redundant at the same time. However, it does offer ""specializations"", but none of these explicitly apply to security, except for one that is very deliberately about government security, which, while I can not rule it out of my career down the line, it is not what I am doing now or aim to be doing at this time in my life. This is 36 credit hours and will take between 1-2 years most likely. I am unfamiliar with Technical Management, but I understand it to be a possible good move. This is more like a technical blend of the management specialization of the MBA, with an added focus on tech, kind of. 30 credit hours, 1-2 years. Anyway, I am feeling a little in over my head here. Does anyone have any of these? Which one would best contribute to my career goals (technical blue-teaming &gt; policy writing/mgmt &gt; C-level)? And yes, I understand that certs are better, and I have a couple already - the issue is that there really isn't any between now and the CISSP (nor after the CISSP) that will help me besides just as a way of showing to my bosses that I still study."

Quick background: - Drop out Civil Engineering student (25) - Some experience in retail, store managing, acting, customer service in a huge fashion company - Endless enthusiasm to Cybersecurity It was last year that I decided to move to a country that I dont know the native language (Poland) to make a fresh start and have a stable life with my Polish fiance. I was trying to find a way into the IT researching and learning non-stop ever since. I had a lot of free time since I was waiting for my paper after the wedding but not much money to sustain in the long run. So I decided to get Networking Certs (CCNA) cus it was popular in market also the more I got in Networking the more I realized how fun it is. In the meantime I was taking Python classes (Youtube and Code-academy) learned C# good enough to write my own tic-tac-toe but programming was not so interesting for me as Networking and Security was. I was into hacking and breaking stuff since I know myself. I was Jailbreaking, rooting relatives devices when I was kid who had no idea about stuff. Just with Google I was doing stuff that others wont even bother. So I leaned on Bash and Python (Scripting) more than trying to develop my own program. Before passing my CCNA (there is a long and painful story behind where I had to study while waiting for delivery requests on UberEats, learning Polish and trying to maintain a healthy relationship with the wife) I realized I had to start sending applications. I was following closely this Sub and CV reviews to edit my CV according to your suggestions. God knows I applied to how many jobs and I got rejected all of them except 1... All you need is this 1. Without any experience I filled my resume with my non-tech job experience schools and CCNA on the top. Rest was the home lab I created and all the protocols I used when I was labbing. Nothing glamorous just protocols and how did I used them and some other pen-testing stuff I played around in my home. I got only 3 serious interviews with technical tests in 150 applications. 2 of them was Networking and other was Security operations analyst. Even though I was applying to help desk jobs I was not lucky (or very lucky in this case) cus I didnt know the native language. Thanks to all of you and all the interviewing techniques on Youtube I knew how to talk with HR and get interest of Hiring Manager. I studied how to talk salary and how to make other person see that I know what I know and explain it in a simple way. For me tech interviews was harder even though I passed CCNA with good score I wasnt so geek. However I focused on my soft skills and steering the direction in the interviews. I was making other person talk more to get more information and create a connection so that they cant say no so easily. Being in sales and acting for sometime, those things was not so hard for me. So I finally got the Security analyst job and I cant be thankful enough. I was thinking it was a really long shot until they called and let me know I got the job. I do promise to give as much as I can to the community so that people can see no matter what are the odds it is possible. Advices that I embraced along the way was; -Make learning a life long habit -Dont follow the money follow your interest (I was making much more money in California but I was so alone and depressed) -Be curious, there is no unnecessary information -There are a lot of distractions but its for everyone so find your ways to stay focused. Its not just about motivation its about being disciplined. One chapter a day of a book can get you places faster than you think. -Share your fears, emotions, happiness, achievements with people who care so that you feel like a person. After all what are we living for! TL;DR I got my first IT job in a really good position (Security Analyst) with no IT professional background and I am really grateful for what I learned from you guys.

I feel like I could probably pass all of those exams right now. Well....I may study a bit more for the CCNA than the other because that one just seems harder, idk. Anyway, I'm in a privileged position to have my entire college education paid for and I even get paid a housing allowance to be a full time student so I'm definitely not going to wast that. With that said, I'm planning on enrolling in a bachalors program immedatly following my associates. I'm a bit confused as to the practical difference between a cybersecurity degree vs network security. Generally it seems like network security is just a more specialized area of cybersecurity; but what does that mean in the real world? &amp;#x200B; For context I'm looking at WGU specifically mainly because of the included certifications but also due to my lifestyle and the nature of the benefits I have at my disposal. I feel like certifications add a little more value than the degree anyway but again, I could be wrong. Here are the two specific programs. [URL and [URL For a little more context, I'd really like to start out as a net or sys admin just to get a sense of daily operations then perhaps step into a net engineer role or any kind of engineering role to be honest and eventually I'd like to get into pen testing and red team operations. I've got an entrepreneurial spirit so all of this is intended to give me real world expertise so I can step out and become a consultant or start my own business in the area of cybersecurity. I don't know what I don't know yet so who knows what exactly I will be drawn too but this is my general outline. I guess my questions are, does it really matter which degree program I chose? Will one land me a job faster than the other? Will one give more of an edge or advantage over the other or does the real education start when I get my first job?"

I work from home 4 days a week and go into the office only once. I make 103K CAD/year. My title is webmaster but I'm more like a web developer. I do content management, project management, C#, PHP, HTML/CSS/JavaScript development. This arrangement has been great for work-life balance and family (I have two young children). The problem? Work's boring, but also, I've grown increasingly insecure about my career in IT. I'm 43, I've been with my employer for 15 years. Being here for so long, you could condense my IT skill-set to 5 years. I feel that if I continue in this position I'm committing career suicide. 2-3 years of React? Don't have it, I only use it sporadically. In-depth knowledge of C#? Don't have it, I only use when I need it, sporadically. Get my drift? I'm not complaining, but I am concerned. If I apply for other jobs I will take a 20-30% wage cut. I've been thinking about retraining and going into cybersecurity (through Bootcamp or certificate program), which I will also have a wage cut if I work in the field, but perhaps a better-paying salary and more job security over the long run.

I am about to finish my degree from WGU and will (hopefully) be attending Kansas State University in the fall to start a M.S. in data analytics. I have been looking for ways to get as much hands on experience, and training as I can - experience is kind of tough right now because I am in the middle of a cross country move, still trying to work full time, and finish my B.S. I was recently made aware of a ""Boot Camp"" that is offered by the University of Kansas. They have coding, data analytics, and cybersecurity paths. They are 24 weeks, part time and claim to give ALL the training in the world, plus a slew of other career assistance benefits. It got my attention. Did some research, and it looks like it is a pretty in depth program. I talked with a admissions rep, and she really made it sound like it was the BEST way for to transition to the IT field. She said the admission is competitive, but that ""I would be a good fit"". After a few minutes on the phone, I started to almost feel like it was a sales pitch. I understand they need to ""sell"" this program to an extent, but at the same time, if it is as great as they made it seem, they wouldn't need to sell it at all - especially if admissions is so competitive. The cost of the program is almost $11k I really think this would be a good program to get in to. KU is a very good school, and this would be perfect for me while I am in between my bachelors and masters (I am also hoping to find an internship over the summer too). I like the thought of this, but I am slightly concerned. I almost felt like I was talking with an admissions councilor from ITT Tech or something. Does anybody have any experience with these IT Boot Camps or specifically the one at KU? Do they really offer what they say they do, and are the career placement opportunities as good as they claim? Or does anyone have better or different advice? Thanks"

My classes include Cisco NetAcad for the CCNA R&amp;S, CCNA Security, and CCNA Cyber Ops. I'm going to take the R&amp;S and Security exams I'm not decided on doubling down the network engineering path or the sysadmin path, but I know I like scripting and I can see myself going to the automation or developer side of things. \*To the question\* If I want to ever get a masters (most likely through employer tuition reimbursement) I will need a 4 year degree plus it might make the difference on some jobs. I could return to Oswego to complete the cognitive science major in 1 year and disregard finishing psychology but I probably can't get the cumulative GPA any higher than 2.7 there with the amount of classes I need to finish, although my cog-sci GPA would be above 3.0 . This would be the quickest path to a 4 year degree and the cognitive science major could be marketable for automation, machine learning, and human computer interaction. Alternatively I could transfer to either Farmingdale or Empire State College which accept the most transfer credits out of any other SUNY near me, and unlike Oswego I won't have to relocate and sabotage my work. At Farmingdale the relevant majors which would require the least amount of credits to complete based on what I've already taken would be [Computer Programming &amp; Information Systems](URL or [Security Systems](URL At Empire State College I can either take Computer Science, IT, or Information Systems. There's no curriculum listed for any of these as it would seem that students and faculty come to an agreement for a custom curriculum, so the high transfer credit acceptance might not match for all I know. Last option is just enrolling in Utica College for their online Cyber security bachelors which is too expensive and going to take longer than all my other options, so this isn't happening unless I get a job with tuition reimbursement, . What direction should I go in? Are there online cybersecurity masters programs that don't have a cumulative 3.0 admissions barrier I don't know about. Does cognitive science seem like it can be marketable in cybersecurity? I need to decide quick so next semester I can take extra classes towards one of those tracks"

I'm considering the AF Reserves as a means to enter cybersecurity for a few reasons: 1. The AF can guarantee you your job (as long as you qualify for it) meaning that if I chose a cybersecurity-related job, it could at least somewhat count as job experience to start my career. 2. After graduating from tech school (where you learn your job), you earn your sec+ certification and a Top Secret Clearance which I heard from this community is worth gold in the field. 3. The reserves can also help pay for college with Tuition Assistance so I plan on getting a computer science degree online. Additionally, the AF also pays up to 4500 per year for certifications related to my job ( CISSP, CEH, Etc.) 4. Finally, the AF reserves would also provide a good source of connections. So if I do go through this route, my main focus would be to first gain a plethora of exp and certifications. Exp meaning internships, jobs, and etc. The reason why I would do college online is bc of the flexibility for more hours. I would probably, however, have to start out with IT while teaching myself cybersecurity on the side. I also have some connections who could possibly hook me up with these jobs as well. Once I gain enough exp in probably 4 or 5 yrs after college, I want to get a full-fledged job in the field (my main interests are pen testing and cloud/security engineering). Now there is one thing that I'm afraid of which are deployments. Ofc as an airman I would be fine deploying but I'm more concerned about what employers would think when hiring me. Ik it's illegal to even ask about your reservist status/military exp since it has the potential to be discriminatory but I also heard that employers could just find another reason not to hire you. But all in all, does this sound like a feasible/good plan to enter cybersecurity? I did hear of others who did this but ofc I don't know where they are now. People say that I should at least be able to get an entry-level IT job after tech school since the field is growing fast and bc I'll have a TS clearance (which will help me a long way, especially with government jobs) and a sec+ cert to start out. If anyone could give insight on whether or not my expectations are realistic, that would be awesome. Thanks y'all."

I wanted to get a diploma in cyber security but most of the private school were too expensive and cuz of that i have been putting it off for many years. Thankfully, i was lucky enough to get into ""a fully paid"" cyber security diploma in a government school- night classes. &amp;#x200B; And then it made me realize, i need some experience in the cyber security field and since i am already in the IT industry it would be good to make a jump.

713,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,"Recently started as Business Consultant Security, but expectations are not meeting reality by a mile. Nearing the end of my probation. What do I do?",2,dl3kmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/dl3kmm/recently_started_as_business_consultant_security/,2019-10-22 04:07:57,"I recently graduated with a Master Degree in Computer Science (specialization Cybersecurity) at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. I went looking for a job, and was offered a position of Business Consultant Security at a company that mainly focuses on testing. I looked elsewhere and had 3 or 4 other offers, but decided to take this one because I believe it allowed me to grow in the direction that I wanted, which is security testing, the fastest. To make it clear: They did mention that I might not immediately be assigned to a security testing job, and that the security testing within the company was not that mature yet, but said that I would be able to help to grow it. I was okay with this, since I really liked the place and the people, and wouldn't mind doing some other types of testing for a short while. In the first week, I was told that I could help with a security test, together with a couple of other colleagues, and so I did. I created a template for the report that would be sent to the customer, I found some vulnerabilities in the system and everything was awesome. Now I'm 1,5 months into the job, and I was told that I would be introduced to a company for an assignment. They told me I would do a combination of functional and technical testing, and that there might be some security involved. With this in mind, I had an intake meeting with a couple of people of this company. Long story short, the meeting went well, I was looking forward to have an assignment and was able to start the next working day. The first two days were mainly introduction, but on the third day, I was introduced to the actual job I would be doing: purely functional testing. The job would include copying and pasting descriptions of features, editing a couple of words to make them test cases, and then clicking through the application, taking screenshots and putting them in Excel. If any problems arise, I'd have to report it. With all respect to the people who do this for a living, I find it boring. The assignment completely mismatched my expectations, does not align with my ambitions and is taking a toll on me. If it was a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10, sure, I would have done it as an assignment, but this feels more like a -3. I called my supervisor from the consulting company, and he understood and said that it would be discussed internally, and that they would get back to me in two days. I think I slept for around 2 hours the night after. I just couldn't wrap my head around how I got there and what I was doing with my life. I dreaded getting out of bed that morning, something which I haven't done in years. I made my 8 hours that day, I delivered my work, but dreaded doing it. The next night I barely slept too. It was a little bit better, but I think 4 hours or something. I skipped my morning run as well, which I hadn't done in 6 weeks. I got the promised phone call. My supervisor from the consulting company said that I should confirm that the job would stay this way and to discuss the problems with the external company's supervisor. I did, and that supervisor confirmed there would be no change in what I would do for the duration of the assignment. I relayed this info back to my consulting company supervisor and they would come to the external company's office the next business day. This happened, and we discussed everything that was said previously. The consulting company's supervisor talked to the external company's supervisor and said that he would discuss it further with other people from the consulting company. That brings us to about an hour in the past. I got a phone call that the deal they are proposing me is to do the assignment for 32 hours instead of 40 and to spend 8 hours on my OSCP (security testing certificate) training. I have 10 days left in my probation and I'm considering all the options that I have. I'm at a point at which I'm not sure what to do. If I take this deal, I will dread going into work for 4 days a week, but I will make it through my probation and I will maybe get a better assignment in the future, with no guarantee. If I don't take the deal, I will most likely be fired. If I resign, I have to pay $800 back for the OSCP training and find another job. Could you please give me some advice on what to do here, Reddit?"

I am looking to pursue a career in cybersecurity, and in the past few months obtained my Network+ and Security+ certifications. I am now looking for my first job in IT/cyber, and am at a point where I need to make a decision about whether I want to suck it up and work a help desk job at a MSP with mediocre pay that is a lengthy commute from where I live, or pursue customer success roles at companies that may not be as directly related to IT/cyber but fit in more with my previous experience, pay better, and could hopefully lead to a customer advisor or customer success role with a cyber company in a year or two as I continue to gain knowledge through certifications and self study. The salaries are probably about $50k vs $70k (in the DC metro area), but the MSP would pay for further certifications and would increase my salary upon completing each cert. As far as my ultimate goal (which could very well change as I begin to gain experience), I would like to be working directly for a cybersecurity vendor in a customer facing role within the next couple of years, and am trying to decide which path to take to build the right foundation of experience. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Note: after a few years of inside sales, I'm trying to get away from that type of role because it's too stressful and doesn't necessarily take advantage of my professional strengths, so I'm not actively looking at Account Executive roles with cyber or software companies."

I then, however, started reading about such positions and how I might work my way up into a more cybersecurity-relevant position, and got a pretty mixed bag.

Computers and protecting people( my dream area would be working in security for a banking company ) and at my school I was working towards my B.S in Information Technology with a concentration in Information Secuirty when I noticed there is an actual B.S in Cybersecurity at my school. I am already 3 years in and am almost done with my degree but most of the classes would transfer to the other degree if I decided to change. My one fear about changing to that degree however is that I am required to take Calculus 2 with that degree while my current one only had me take Calc 1 ( which I barely passed in ). My question is... would the specifics of the degree really matter in the long run if it says Information Technology with a concentration in Information Security rather than Cybersecurity ? I of course plan to get certifications for cybersecurity as well ( not sure if I need that before my first job or not ) but I just wanna know if I get a IT degree if employers arent going to think I would be qualified for a Cybersecurity role based on what kind of education I got.

I have no experience in IT yet. Currently, I am taking the Cisco networking academy for both the ICND 1 and ICND 2. My initial plan was to take the full CCNA by February 2020 before the current certification expires. However, I was doing some research and it said that the CCNA is NOT an entry-level position, rather it is an intermediate certification, so it would be excessive to get a CCNA you are trying to get an entry-level position. I heard that having an A+ is suffice if you are trying to get into IT. I agreed with that statement because I am reading materials for the ICND 2 and we are learning about WAN technologies, which I do not think I will be needing to learn how to configure PPP unless I work for a company a long time. It is also taking a lot of my time, and I want to fully understand the materials of ICND 1 before I move on to ICND 2. So, I plan on just fully focusing on not getting the full CCNA (ICDN 1+2), but just the CCENT (ICDN 1), and finish getting an A+ to apply for my first networking entry-position. I thought that the CCENT and the A+ would suffice, and the rest I can learn on-the-job. I will then pursue a full CCNA after getting a job. Do you think that it would be a wise idea? What is your opinion on employers looking to hire someone with no experience and just a CCENT and an A+? Is this possible?

At current pace it seems either my next interview later this week might be my last before an offer is given. In particular, I was hoping to figure out whether I should negotiate for a higher wage, considering the location. My qualifications: - 2 years in-office IT for a small department in a sizable state government agency as an application/database administrator along with some very basic networking and troubleshooting work. - CCNA as of 2-3 months ago. - Administration of an HCI cluster in development for VDI for a security-sensitive project (all admin privileges). - 30 college credits - Administration of a very small VMware-Intel dual-NUC cluster for working with / learning MCSA material. Tasks for this job would include: - Onboarding, user support, network support, application support, and datacenter/colocation planning/assistance with physically setting up equipment Applicants are expected to know to administrate/setup/troubleshoot/etc most of the following, to some degree: - Applications: Atlassian JIRA, G-suite - Hardware: laptops, desktops, servers - Networking: DNS, firewalls, routers, VOIP, VPNs, Wifi - Operating systems: Windows Desktop, Linux Desktop / Server - Security-related services: AD, IPA, LDAP They should also know how to code in C/C++ and Python. They also state that people with as /deep/ knowledge as possible in the domains of networking, programming, Linux, and security are highly preferred. I put in for the position and was contacted back within a day. Supposedly (according to their HR personnel) just under 60k was ""typical"" for an applicant for this position, usually with an up-to 20% bonus dependent on the company's performance, though they expressed that I would likely ""bring more to the table"" and were willing to offer more to ""make this work out"" if they could give them a number. I got a bit confused working out the numbers in my head because of the bonus and its variability so I asked for 60k-65k at the time. Now think I should have asked for 70k-75k like I was originally planning or even 75k-80k due to about 5k in new transportation costs I didn't initially factor in. The job does offer 401k, health, dental, vision plan benefits and /might/ also offer commuter benefits. I only make about 60k now (no bonuses) and only have health benefits. Even more confusing: a relative of mine holds a management position in an cybersecurity department at a large financial institution and states I should say I have an offer elsewhere for 80k and see what they say and that I likely won't get that number but they can get me a position elsewhere later on at around that pricepoint even if this doesn't work out. Problem is that their idea of a good job is at a very large, very corporatized firm which is a bit of a turn-off to me, while the firm I'm talking to has somewhere between 100-200 employees and only 3 offices in 3 cities. Seems to have room for growth and poking into how a full stack optimized for low latency and high performance is set up which is really interesting to me. But anyway uhmm... so what's a good asking price for this kind of job? Any thoughts? I can answer any questions too."

Last summer, I was an intern at my university's IT Architecture &amp; Security department and got to work with cybersecurity analysts and solution architects. After this internship, I found a passion for cybersecurity. I'm a technology-focused business student entering my last year of school. Although I'm not a coder by any means, I got to learn a little bit of SQL and worked on school projects like creating a small database in Microsoft SQL Server and connecting it to Excel using VBA. I've also learned about project management through a group consulting project for a class in which we helped a not-for profit organization with a technology solution to address their business problem (did not actually create the solution, but everything up to it). So back to this summer. Prior to this SAP internship, I didn't know a damn thing about it, only that it was a bigass ERP. Only time I've encountered an ERP is my university's Oracle PeopleSoft. As part of the company's SAP security team, I got to work with Basis, Security, and Functional consultants during the company's 1809 upgrade. I learned to create, terminate, transport, and reconfigure user profiles and security roles (single/composite roles, master/derived roles, authorization value objects) in S4 and ECC. Also got to work on some SAP GRC, Microsoft Identity Manager, and SAP BOBJ Central Management Console stuff as well. The company offered me a part-time job when the internship ended so now I'm working there while I finish my degree. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my SAP experience. Although it's not the most exciting job in the world, I can see myself doing it as a career since I think the career is lucrative...? (correct me if I'm wrong! I want to get to 100k a year salary fast), But I wonder if a SAP career is too specialized... or it's too big of an ERP. Do you think a SAP job will still be high-paying &amp; relevant 10-15 years from now? What's the current job market like for SAP consultants in Canada and US? SAP implementation and licensing costs are HUGE and only big companies can afford it. This makes me think the job market for SAP consultants aren't very big. Also if I was to stay in SAP, I'm thinking of becoming a MM functional consultant. I'm still in my last year of school, so I'm keeping my options open but I'm currently considering a career in SAP, or cybersecurity, or as a IT business analyst of some sort. Any insightful / honest thoughts would be much appreciated. THANK YOU!"

I then came into the big 4 firm straight away as an analyst, where I have so far done my CISSP and am now an Associate of ISC2 (Need 2 more years to be full qualified) and also have completed my Comptia Network+. By all accounts, I am doing very well and am hopefully due for promotion by summer 2020. However, I want to know what I should do going forward, I definitely feel like I have impostor syndrome as I have no real technical skills (I did do technical things during my Masters and also did my eLearningSecurity Junior Pen testing Cert during university) - but due to not utilizing them, I wouldn't consider myself as having those skills on hand. Do you guys think it's worth doing a technical cert like CCNA or CEH in order to gain some practical on hand knowledge or stick with the strategy/management path? Currently i'm on a project where it's more of a business analyst/project management type of role and it would be hard for me to move to a more technical project without the necessary skills. I really want to do well and go far, but I have this nagging feeling that if I don't have the technical know how or hands on experience, I'm missing out and won't be credible and won't be able to look at the whole holistic security picture."

For my optional module in final year I chose to study Information and Network Security, along with a security focused dissertation/thesis. It was at this point I'd finally found my passion and decided that I wanted to pursue a career in cybersecurity. Scoring 89% overall in this module and also very highly in my other modules such as programming and my dissertation, I thought my academic profile was looking good. However, I have no relevant industry certifications or experience on the job, but have plenty of practical experience from labs and doing a 6 month project for a software company during my second year. In my spare time I'm currently doing the following: * Attend local and relevant industry meetups/networking events when possible, made a few contacts from doing this and had my CV/resume reviewed by multiple professionals - they say I should get a job no problem with what I've done/doing * Complete Capture The Flag challenges and appropriate online courses in my free time, such as The Complete Penetration Testing Course: Beginner To Expert and Linux Security and Hardening, The Practical Security Guide on Udemy * Try and keep up to date with news in the Information and Network security field via numerous sources * Constantly applying for entry level jobs such as SOC analyst on numerous job sites, messaging recruiters on LinkedIn etc. Admittedly I've only been seeking work for a month but I'm not getting much back from companies or being invited to interviews, and when companies/recruiters do get back to me, I've been told I don't have enough experience or a masters which is quite frustrating if I'm honest. I've been told by many people that a masters is a waste of time and I'm starting to get the feeling some recruiters don't exactly know their stuff when it comes down to the technical details. From all of this, I have a few questions: * Is my degree 'useless'? * What more can I be doing in my spare time to increase my chances of landing a job? * Is it worth spending this year working part-time and completing relevant certifications to tick those HR filters? * I was told not to take an entry level IT support role by my teachers unless I was desperate, is this starting to look more likely? If you got this far, thank you for taking the time to read this and I'd appreciate any advice you can offer."

I was also looking at other certs that might help me along early in my career. Since I am majoring in cybersecurity, and a lot of security has to do with educating your users/employees (and to give my at best average communication skills a boost), I looked to see if there was a teaching or educating cert. I found the CTT+, but I'm wondering if it's a better investment to just focus on getting a cybersecurity specific cert instead. Does anyone have experience with the test? How much time did it take to earn? Is there a significant difference in the materials covered by the virtual/in-person tracks? Do you have study material recommendations? Is there another teaching cert (or some other course of action entirely) that could serve me better? Thank you!"

775,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,1) Cybersecurity and Network Technician 2) Computer Programmer 3) Self study,1,dabj8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/dabj8y/1_cybersecurity_and_network_technician_2_computer/,2019-09-28 14:38:32,"I may have found a way to have a local community college waive my tuition and other costs for attending school to get an Associate's degree in the IT field. The options I've narrowed this down to are in the title. The school still uses the term ""Computer Programmer"" but it is definitely along the lines of web developer, with HTML/CSS/JS/C#/SQL and the like. Network Technician would be along the lines of the A+ certification I've been studying for as a potential advantage there. Of course I don't have the certification yet since I don't have the money for it. I've got a bit of a list of pros and cons I personally see; each have their own opportunities for growth, Computer Programmer seems to start off with a better salary, but the downside I see to that is all the bootcamps and everything out there when EVERYONE wants to jump on the web developer/programmer/software engineer bandwagon, but I might be overthinking this. At the same time job security is paramount for me, and I don't really see a lot of people going for Network Technician, which ultimately would develop to something like Cyber Security Admin. The reason I fear the potential that too many people will eventually compete with me is because this is to some degree what already happened to me in the past, as I made the mistake of studying liberal arts and getting a BA already when I was younger. I always loved computers, but my complacency and overconfident mind figured I could just leverage that to any career anyway and figured I would broaden my horizons with new ideas, especially since I loved some of the classes I took, but this definitely proved to be a bad idea. It definitely didn't help that I graduated into the Great Recession; the whole time I was in school originally, a college degree was largely not even questioned as a great way to get an employer to invest in you, train you etc. and when I graduated it suddenly became a scam overnight. The self study option is very difficult for me to be honest, although I know it does work. I'm not sure what I see as the safest option. It might be that the self study option is all I have in case somehow something with this workers retraining and transitioning program falls through, or I don't have a way to make enough money while I do it, so all in all it's a tough call. Thanks for any insight or tips anyone has. Thanks for reading."

Essentially, I'm at a little bit of a crossroads career-wise at the moment. I fell into IT a few years ago after picking up a Bachelor's in Economics - really didn't like the look of working in finance so ended up following another goal of mine (joining the Army(UK)). Joined as a Communications Systems Engineer and progressed pretty quickly - going from field tech to help desk to system administrator over 3 years. Unfortunately, I ended up leaving after a pretty nasty back injury and got a job working for a consultancy company doing sysadmin work on classified systems for a little while. I 100% own up to drinking the IT Security Kool-Aid and spending much of my study time over the last 4 years aiming towards that track - going for the Holy Grail of a job as a penetration tester.

I'm from KY and moved to FL for school and I'm about to graduate come March of 2020 with my Bachelor's. As I've lived here for the past ~3 years and I haven't found much in terms of work in the technology field. I mean the states cool I guess but it's just not our cup of tea in general. She works in the medical field and can get a job literally anywhere so we're trying to move somewhere that would be better in terms of work opportunities for me. I've been eyeing the triangle (North Carolina), but like I said, when people talk tech cities it's usually software engineering. I currently don't have a defined field of work because my degree is just more general but I mostly study CyberSecurity and Data Analytics. We're planning trips to go visit some cities and I wanted to know what some of the bigger tech cities are that have many different opportunities."

To help solve my dilemma, I have a couple of questions. And Even if you can only answer one questions, I'll still appreciate any input. 1. Is cybersecurity stressful? From an outsider looking in, it would seem that cybersecurity jobs may be stressful due to the responsibility of keeping data safe and secure. However, I've also heard the sysadmin jobs can be stressful as well. 2. Can I enter either field with only a bachelor's? I do not want to continue going to school for my master after I graduate. 3. Is cybersecurity enjoyable? I know that I find troubleshooting and fixing problems enjoyable, so I will most likely enjoy being a sysadmin, but I don't know if I could find the same level of enjoyment in cybersecurity. 4. Is systems administration a declining field? I've heard that many people believe that the need for sysadmins will be declining in the future. 5. What would be your personal choice between systems administration or cybersecurity and why? As of right now, I'm more leaning towards system administration, but not enough to fully remove the possibility of going down cybersecurity. I also have members of my family that have connections in the cybersecurity field, so they think I should go down that path. Anyways, thanks for the help!"

798,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,Need Advice!,2,cqdgty,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/cqdgty/need_advice/,2019-08-15 04:10:13,"Hi Everyone! This is my first post here and I have learned a tremendous amount of information from everyone helping each other out on all of the posts. I am in a situation that I want to get some advice from some of the senior members in the field. I am going to give a background first so that we can all have a clear understanding of my situation and lead into the actual dilemma. First and foremost, I am only 24 years old. No degree but will be graduating with an IT/Cybersecurity degree in June of 2020. I do not possess any certifications at the moment but cross my fingers because I have my CompTIA Network+ exam scheduled for next Friday and already have purchased the Security+ and A+ vouchers and plan to have the whole trifecta by the end of October (at the latest). I have been building computers, repairing them and such as a passion of mine since high school and have spent upwards to $1,000 on Udemy and other online courses that go over various programming languages, network security techniques, ethical hacking and pen-testing (but these udemy certs for completing the class seem laughable to put on a resume). I am very confident in my abilities. The reason I am reaching out is because everything I do moving forward will obviously have a huge impact on my family (I am engaged and just had my first child whom is about to be 1 years old). I work for a construction company that only employees about 100 people (including laborers). I was hired with only management experience in retail because I formed a big relationship with the owner and general manager, so they brought me on to be their sole estimator (performing takeoffs, looking over specifications, the whole shebang). It has been about 3 years now since day 1 and I am no longer the estimator. I have been named Office Manager (the previous one was fired) and IT Administrator. As the Office Manager, I do everything from AP/AR, Employee training/on-boarding, assisting in interviews, verifying purchases and up-keeping our books/licenses/certifications/taxes ect. I have to plan and coordinate all company events and travel for the owner and GM and any service we use I have to deal with. As the IT Admin, I do somewhat basic things compared to what another IT personnel would do. I upgrade and repair computers, setup and purchase new devices and software. I coordinated and executed a full migration from the companys paper files onto a cloud database because for some reason they believed analog was better. I have established the company on social media and help develop a website for them. I have saved our GM and other office personnel so much time by creating spreadsheets for their work and calculations. In general, anything that has a power button or is on the computers I am in charge of. When I got these promotions so to speak I wasnt given a raise. I was told that maybe when I graduate, we can bring the topic of a raise up again or if I get an offer for another job that they can try to match. When I explained to them everything, I was doing on top of my original work duties they again told me they will revisit the topic next year. I feel at fault because none of them requested I set up firewalls on the network or secure everyones devices, no one asked me to review our ISP contract and get faster internet to save them money and no one requested I develop a website and create an image for us online and no one asked me to go out of my way to develop better and more efficient ways for them to do their work. NOW! I can get into the kicker of it all. My owner owns 3 other companies in different states. I know spend 50% of my workday on the phone with them or handing their IT issues. I was just told this morning to get in touch with the GM of his Dallas branch that he bought to setup new emails for everyone, create a new website and create a PowerPoint for them so they can understand the procedures on adding/deleting users and how to use the company cloud. He expects me to do this all on top of assisting his other companies and STILL finishing everything I need to do here at my actual office. I feel stuck because I have a 1 year old and fianc that depend on me. Granted I make upwards to $45-50k/year and that is sufficient here in Arizona but how do I stand up for myself at this point? I have shown and explained what it is I do for the company. The GM and other office staff see it and agree but the owner is the one who keeps shoving me back down. My GM does everything in his power to keep me happy (bringing me coffee, working with me if I need to go grab my kid, buying me lunch) but at what point do I give them an ultimatum? If I left, they have no one who can accurately read plans, contracts or handle the bidding process. No one to handle his companys IT issues. No one to review contracts and do their bookkeeping, AP/AR. and I really feel like if I quit they would either go out of business because of a lack of understanding of how everything works or they would have to employ 3-4 people to cover everything it is I am doing (WHICH MAKES NO SENSE TO ME WHEN THEY CAN JUST GIVE ME A RAISE). I am not asking for $70k+ but I am asking for something reasonable so that when I get home and have a boat load of homework and a 1 year old to take care of I have more help because my job doesnt offer health benefits so my fianc works 32+ hours a week so my child can be covered. SORRY for the venting, I 100% have been keeping things bottled up because I do not want my family to see my stress or my work to see/think I am leaving but WHAT really can I do but suck it up and be in this state of feeling disrespected and unappreciated for the next year? Can I tell my owner that I cant help his other companies because they dont pay me, or I dont work for them? Can I tell him that if he wants me to take my time to ensure THEIR emails get created and transfer/forward emails from the old ones are working correctly that they need to pay me? Or give me another check because I have to sit there and spend hours on the phone with the other companies GM and him so that I can make sure their new website is to their liking? Just what do you believe I should do or be doing? PS: I have submitted applications, am currently networking and throwing my resume places but again the whole No degree yet or Certs is hindering my callbacks and I cant take a low paying internship with my family factored in."

I have a mentor here (super smart guy) that trained me well for the position, I was able to learn about all what I do here partially because of him, even though the first 3 months I was on my own. I received an offer from our IT director to either go to Sharepoint or Financial Management (budget) for OPEX, etc. I am definitely not a financial management guy, I would rather go to sharepoint, which seems to be more fun. My real questions are: In how long can I learn Sharepoint? Is it worth it (is it going to open future opportunities or is it a dying market)? &amp;#x200B; Before receiving this opportunity, I was leaning towards either Data Science or Cybersecurity, because I don't see myself staying on IT forever (it can be a pain in the ass some days/weeks). For both DS and Cybersecurity, I have been doing studies on my own, but trying to see if I like either one of them. Now with this third option, which seems to be a fun, and maybe profitable field, I might consider giving it a shot. Anyone in Sharepoint? Sorry for the English, just ate, and I am kind of sleepy."

I've wanted to work in IT for a few years, and had been working slowly towards that goal. I spent 18 months working on a degree in cybersecurity. I passed the A+ 901-902 exams earlier this year, and got my first helpdesk job between taking the 2 exams. My prior professional experience consisted of mostly customer service, and about a year of PC refurbishing. I was really excited about this helpdesk job, but I quickly discovered that helping someone troubleshoot over the phone was not my particular skill set. Granted, training was blown through in half the time it was supposed to have, so maybe I just wasn't prepared. I only lasted about 6 weeks before I quit. The anxiety of not being able to help people quickly left me hanging up on calls and just walking out for the day. The whole ordeal killed my confidence, and I've now changed my major in school and have gone back to working retail. Has anyone ever experienced anything even kind of similar in the start of their IT careers? Or does anyone have advice on a different type of position that doesn't involve sitting on the phone all day? Maybe I just picked a field in not suited for, but I really don't want to give up on it."

As the title suggests, I'm looking for advice from industry professionals, and specifically people with experience in cyber risk with large consulting companies (Big 4, major consulting firms, etc) who may have gone through similar recruitment processes (or are themselves in charge of hiring). This would be for entry level consulting positions. My background is not super technical. I have a Master's in MIS and some previous experience in information security through internships, but this is a field I'm really interested in and I would like to hopefully build a career in it. I'm a few steps into the application process with a couple of companies, meaning I've done assessments and a first round of interviews, and the general consensus is that I'd be a good fit for the cyber strategy teams. My previous experience revolved around maturity assessments and such things. So I think they're right and that's where I'd feel most at ease. I am not being as specific as I could for privacy reasons but also because this involves two or three different companies, and they have different names for their teams and departments, but this is basically the long and short of it. I have a couple interviews lined up in the next few weeks and I would like tips on how to prepare. I am mainly worried about a case interview with managers at one or two of the firms. It appears as though I will have to make a short presentation. There aren't many resources online that offer case studies for cybersecurity consulting, it's mainly generic management consulting cases, and I'm not sure how much they could help with this, except for maybe the methodology, but even that seems centered around profit and such things. Should I maybe check out general risk management cases? I've never done case interviews before, and since this is for an entry-level position, I don't know how much of an official consulting methodology I'll be expected to follow, how technical their questions will be and what kind of recommendations I will be asked to make. Does anyone here have any tips or resources to which you could point me? The recruiter said there wasn't really anything I should do to prepare, but I would like to do what I can. Also, do let me know if this isn't the right sub, and I'll post wherever you think is a better fit."

I'm in need of some guidance on my current career plan for the next couple of years. Some background information: I earned a Master's in Psychology (School Psychology), but grew to absolutely hate the field and wasn't willing to put up with it for a paycheck. I've been a Linux user since 2007 and, as a hobbyist, know my way around scripting, virtualization, networking, building and maintaining firewalls, containers, and web hosting (sites with applications). Basically, anything I thought was interesting, I learned as well I could with the resources I had. Fast forward to now, and I've spent the last 6 months changing careers. I enrolled in a technical college and am working on getting certifications. Currently have an A+, Network+ exam is next week, and I'd like to have a Security+ and LPIC-1 by the time I'm out of there. I also have a chance to take the CEH after an accredited class. I've been in an internship for the last two months with a local internet provider, doing almost exclusively helpdesk and Cisco networking. While this is a great opportunity to build up some skills and demonstrable experience, this isn't a company with a lot of room to grow. They've filled the jobs they think are worth more pay and won't let anyone else climb the ladder until they're gone (CEO's words, not mine). They're also pretty resistant to change and improvement. &amp;#x200B; Now for the important part. Thinking ahead, I'm kind of conflicted. There's huge potential in cybersecurity, but before reading up about the need for cybersecurity skills, I was planning to pursue becoming a sysadmin. I still kind of lean in that direction, but want to be flexible. I know that transitions between the system administration and cybersecurity are possible and happen all the time. Is there even such a thing as a ""pure cybersecurity"" career path? It seems like all the cybersecurity jobs I can find anywhere near me want a longer IT background (3-7 years usually). It's likely far too early for me to apply for Jr. Sysadmin jobs at this point, however much I might want to. What would be the best way to prepare for that position in the future? Should I seek a different job than at the company where I'm interning, if I get a job offer from them? Last of all, what's the best way to market myself when my degree is unrelated? What I've opted to do so far is leave my education as a smaller section, list my Bachelor's, list the technical college, leave out my Master's degree, since that could spell instant rejection."

Do you think its too early or the timing is correct (based on your personal experience)? The reasons i want to ask for a raise is because: 1) When they hired me i was just a 4 years net. engineer,well now i am 4 years net. engineeer + 1 year cybersec engineer,so increased value,right ? 2)In this 1 year i managed to obtain 5 certs ,more specifically: SEC+,CYSA+ ,SSCP, CCNP SECURITY,CEH. The interesting fact is that i paid for all the training materials,exams fees etc OUT OF MY OWN POCKET. Truth be told,my company never pushed me to go for certs or say anything like you need this and that cert to do the job or if you get this and that cert you will get a raise or anything in that context. The reason i pursued these certs and spend so much money(around 5k-which btw is 1/4 of my net year salary) and free time is because i want to be competitive in the market and up to date with new technologies,as well as increase my value as a professional. 3)There is not competition in the area. You need binoculars to spot a decent cybersec professional in the area where i live.Matter of fact we were looking 7 months to find a decent cybersec engineer for an open spot.

I was wondering what are some options (besides internships and good grades as I will definitely aim to get) for myself as I want to do everything as early as I can. My goal is to specialize somewhere in the security field, so should I try and begin by working the help desk at my school for experience? Should I get some certs now and wait for other ones later?

I'm going to my local community college to start my education and get a certificate, for now. Eventually I'll work my way up to a Bachelor's in Computer Science. There seems to be more movement towards the tech industry, with more people heading towards **IT**, **coding** and **Cybersecurity**. But with IT is it true that it's becoming too saturated? Like they'll just take anybody for help desk jobs and simple technician work which then causes the wages/salaries to go lower and lower? I'm sure when you first get started that the pay is not that great but one would hope that only lasts a couple years before you start making good money. I'm also teaching myself to code because I'm also interested in programming/software/web development. Any thoughts on this. Because if it is true that most IT workers won't be making good money for a while they need to be aware of this and the reasons why so they don't head into the industry with false expectations."

Both are from good unis and I won awards in both degrees for highest overall grades etc, my MA thesis was purely based on policy/management of cyber attacks on critical infrastructure. I am very interested in the cybersecurity sphere, however I lack the technical skillset to go in this direction. I am currently a senior compliance analyst for a large crypto company and work with market leading investigative tools and so forth, however, I really want to redirect into cybersecurity and leave behind the compliance world. From my perspective I could: 1. Uni - I feel a little old to go back and do a BSc in computer science, although I think id really enjoy it. I have the option to study it for free here in Europe. 2. Do a cert pathway like comptia and then something like OSCP after I have some decent foundations? I think I would really enjoy either pathway into the field, I am just unsure as to what would get me there faster as I feel like am a little behind with the age thing.

I have read up on career paths quite a bit and it seems like Systems Engineer is a good feeder role for Cybersecurity, but I cant seem to find much about NOC. The NOC position Im interviewing for is a better company and has better benefits, but terrible hours and the pay isnt quite as good as the Systems Engineering positions. Ultimately I want to go with the position that will help me learn the most and get into the security field. So my question is this: Would NOC Analyst be a step back for me?

I've been thinking of going back to education, as I only have about 2 years of college under my belt, but didn't finish my Associate's, which was an awful idea. It did lead to a helpdesk job for 1 year, as well as working as a printer technician for 2.5yrs. &amp;#x200B; I feel I've already had the quintessential ""college"" experience. I've grown older, I've gotten about as much experience and paygrade I believe I can get for my education level.

I feel I have too many current responsibilities between a second job, family and friends to go back to a regular in-person university, so I think doing online will be the best for my schedule, as well as cost. Now for the hard hitter questions: I'm looking at WGU currently, I'm either looking to hit their Cybersecurity track hard, and ride the BS all the way to the MS. I'm looking at WGU also because it includes certifications along the path to my degrees, I think that's an awesome plus, even though I've heard about renewing certs, which may only be a timed bonus. I've also thought about doing their Computer Science, getting the BS, and then going back for the BS in Cybersecurity, since some courses would also transfer. Would it be better to do just hard Cybersecurity, or also do Cyber+CompSci? Does anyone else have a different recommendation to a college? Thanks for your input."

So far I like it but I recently found something out that has me a little concerned. We're a small department, around 100 users and 6 or 7 locations. It's very laid back and the company itself is fine with their very slow growth. I definitely have job stability and the pay is pretty decent. Here's my concern, the IT Manager is nearing retirement, probably in the next 5 years or so. He has no formal training in IT but has managed to build a ""decent"" infrastructure with the help of outside vendors. He's not big on training but we have access to everything. Crazy right?? He just wants to retire with minimal effort. We'll keep things upgraded and maintained but I don't think we'll do anything drastic until after he's gone. And by drastic I mean just get the department a little more up to speed with trending technologies. I feel like I have a great learning opportunity since there's no job segregation but I don't have the support and encouragement to pursue my education and training. I realize for some this might be a great scenario, especially if you are new to the field.

I am a supervisor in retail. Of course I used to hate it. I make $13 working over 40 hours a week, crazy boss, irresponsible staff, typical retail complaints. I will say my boss has been very accommodating when it came to adjusting schedule to help me finish my college courses. I was studying network administration and cybersecurity. I was going for an AAS and it gave me a certificate as well, in addition to the courses prepping me for the exams. For example hardware and pc confit course was actually the comptiaA+ prep. Tired of retail so I lucked up and got into a contracting role for my first helpdesk. You see where this is going. I read up and asked people they all said I dont need a degree for this industry as long as I get certs. Then I was told by people in the industry the job is trash if the first thing they ask for are certs. My IT job has been a nightmare. Weve been in training for 3 months now. By training, we get to work and listen to our trainer. We dial in to her phone conference channel and log into a group chat. She will present her laptop via chat video while reading over the dialogue using the phone and we listen with headsets. This has been going on 40 hours a week for 3 months. No hands on, the material is often outdated, and older staff has to constantly correct her after half the day has been teaching us one way. We dont even know when this training will end. My supervisor is new as well, but he is not allowed to participate in our training. He himself has not been trained whatsoever. We ask him questions but corporate get pissed off when we try to seek help like shadowing or time to physically practice vs watching slideshows. I get paid working helpdesk the same amount as I do at my retail job. Actually, at my retail job I get more because of holiday pay, when people call out, and so on. I can end up making a lot more. At my helpdesk job I am 100% locked in a fixed rate with no chance for a raise and of course mandatory days off during holidays. Im just not sure if Im the long run Im making the right choice. I feel unprepared (and now underpaid) for this helpdesk job. Im not sure if its just cold feet or my intuition that theres problems ahead. Should I stick it out in helpdesk? My entire reason working this helpdesk job was to learn and grow having hands on and being in the environment along with it on my resume that I have worked in IT but now at the actual job I feel unprepared and unwilling to actually do what I have to do here. I realize IT is about research and figuring it out on your own but at my job it isnt just simple PC terms, theyve customized a lot so it works for their needs and security but I dont feel like theres been sufficient training and its all unprepared or rushed. If I have sufficient tools and directions Im fine but if theyre outdated and not reliable it doesnt help me. Should I stick it out another 4-6 months until my next job or should I go back to my retail job and finish college I hopes that graduating will get me a better job and riding out my helpdesk?"

Are there links to cheaper guides/books for these different certifications or are the CISCO and CompTIA prices fair price for the respective courses? Ive heard that building a PC can help you a lot in terms of learning computer hardware and things, is this true? What are good entry level it jobs that I could get now while I go to school? I know Im asking a lot of questions but truly want to get into this field as fast as I can. Thank you."

The bulk of tasks seem to be troubleshooting peripherals and working with networked Windows workstations. My main disappointment with myself was my failure to turn a basic question about experience with networked Windows computers into a positive for myself. I do not have professional experience to point to in answering that question, but I still feel I missed an opportunity. The opportunity wasn't to stand out, but at least to look capable, and I fear I sounded too inexperienced. My biggest positive about the interview was pointing to my certifications for what I lacked in professional experience. I feel I got my point across, yet it seems like there is more I can do. I'm also aware that a cert's value depends on the employer, but they are relevant for someone like myself. &amp;#x200B; Now I have an opportunity I may be able to take advantage of. The hiring manager left for vacation the day after the interview and said I should hear back, either way, in approximately 3 weeks. During these weeks, what is the best tone to use in a follow-up email? How do I approach a follow-up email? I have a bad taste in my mouth from the interview because I know I am more than capable to thrive in this position, and I'm sure the interviewers feel equally unimpressed. &amp;#x200B; Background: Currently working as a tier 1 support tech for less than 3 months (first IT experience) CompTIA A+, Net+, Sec+ 2+ years customer service experience (non-IT) Associate in CS Currently pursuing BS in Cybersecurity and Info Assurance Very little time/money for a homelab or other project, although this a big priority for myself/my resume (not making excuses, but I work full-time while taking online classes and finishing a house remodel with a deadline)."

I've been working at the same company for almost 2 years now as a chemist, make a decent wage at an entry level but have been slowly discovering that the work isn't for me, doesn't give me a spark to learn, yadda yadda yadda. Recently I have been watching a lot of DEFCON presentations in my free time and learning about game console hacking, and this is something that gives me a thirst to know more and pursue as a career. &amp;#x200B; All my life I have been a very computer oriented person, the one everyone goes to for help, asks for help on network setup, etc. I built my own computer when I was younger so I understand a good bit of the A+ exam content without studying, but would like to know how to pivot my career in a network/security direction. As it stands I do not have too much IT experience to put on my resume besides working as a seasonal ""consultant"" for my neighbor's union office, where I did basic stuff like printer configuration, fixing the internet, and whatnot. &amp;#x200B; As I understand it, the general consensus for beginner certifications seems to be A+, N+, and S+, in that order. I have also seen things about the CCNA being valuable, but to wait off on taking it until the test has been revamped. However, I am also interested in possibly taking a bootcamp to get my coding/scripting up to par, as most security jobs require a strong foundation in some sort of scripting language (javascript, python, etc...). Most people have been saying that security bootcamps are a waste of time and money, so I would rather go to a full-stack sort of bootcamp instead, even though webdev is not my ultimate goal. &amp;#x200B; What would you guys recommend? Quitting my job and doing a full time bootcamp, keeping my job and going for the certifications in the mean time, both, or none of the above? My current job also seems to be hiring like crazy for cybersecurity engineers, and the requirements only ask for a STEM degree. Since I already work here, they would much rather hire an internal person than someone outside since I am familiar with the products and how they work. &amp;#x200B; Thank you everybody for your time!"

I've taken Cisco classes before, and they were pretty interesting, and seem to go under the category of Cybersecurity.

So I'm working at a company where the engineering team is making an active effort to get me terminated. For background/context, I'm relatively new to the world of information security. My skills are almost exclusively in pentesting and red team operations. That's what my background is in, that's what I applied to this job on the basis of, and that's what I want to move into. I'm also the youngest person in the IT department by a sizable margin, roughly 10-15 years. However, the infrastructure and engineering teams are making such an effort to get me terminated that it's starting to impact my personal life, my mental and emotional health, and my personal relationships. Things that have happened include: * Making me the first responder and owner of all Incident Response efforts, without my knowledge. (Keeping in mind I'm not trained in Digital Forensics or Incident response in any way) * Actively screaming at me on a conference call for 2-5 minutes due to my lack of training. (Despite this not being apart of my training, responsibilities, or the documentation I used to carry out the IR efforts) * Physically isolating me in the workplace by moving all of their equipment to a conference room to avoid talking to me. * Following me around the office building when I take calls, telling my manager, as well as other managers in the IT department, that I'm job hopping after less than a year. * Piling on responsibilities to such an extent that I am now (again, I'm very entry-level infosec): * The owner of all IR efforts * The owner of all Workstation Patching efforts * The owner of all cybersecurity training efforts * The engineer of all application control efforts * The owner and responder of all SOC activities * Reporting any training I'm doing (through internal resources) as wasting company time and avoiding my responsibilities to my boss. * Refusing to give feedback on reports and documentation I create when asked, and then tearing them apart publicly in front of management when they're presented. * Outright refusing to speak during conflict resolution meetings, saying ""I have nothing to say"". My boss filled me in on the efforts, and has been trying to help as best he can. However, I'm still extremely limited in what I can do. Despite having a stipend for training, any major training requests I put in (such as the OSCP) are shut down almost immediately. Because I'm still very young (early 20's) and haven't been here for more than a year, I struggle to find anyone willing to bring me in for an interview where I'm at. I'm holding several certs, including CISSP, CCSP, and Security+, but no one wants to bring me in for an interview, directly citing my lack of experience. I've put in more applications than I can count (That's a lie, I've put in about 50-60 applications) in the last month, including for positions well below my paygrade, but have only had two interviews, one of which cancelled a week beforehand. I've had my resume examined by several HR professionals I know, who have all said it looks great. I can't afford to do internships or unpaid work, and I'm already in the six-figure range. However, due to personal issues, I am not in a position where I can throw $1000+ at training and certifications on my own. My boss is also actively searching for new employment, and soon won't be able to shield me from the engineering team. **tl;dr: Coworkers are actively conspiring to get me fired after less than a year. Not able to get further training for different skills, and not able to get interviews due to how short my employment has been.** What on earth do I do?"

I have some lower-division coursework in MIS and CS that I did in community college before transferring. &amp;#x200B; So far, here's what I've come up with: &amp;#x200B; 1) Obtain COMPTIA Security+. I know I want/need to do this for sure, as it's a step on the way to obtaining their Cybersecurity Analyst cert. Based on my research, I think this means I need to take Core, A+, and Network+ before taking Security+ but I'm not sure. 2) Potentially obtain a M.S. in MIS or in Cybersecurity. I've reached out to a few programs and need to talk to them regarding the specific requirements for their programs. I don't really know the value of a Masters in the field (especially as it compares to certifications), however, and I haven't come up with anything in my research. &amp;#x200B; What I don't know is whether I should stick through another year in school taking ""whatever"" classes or if I should try to finish in the Fall in order to graduate earlier (finances are not a concern for me, thankfully). If I'm applying to a Masters program, it won't matter since I will be starting in Fall 2020 either way. If I graduate early, I'll have the opportunity to find a job earlier and to start earning certs (I think I will be able to work on these regardless, since the course load I would be taking next year would be very light). If I stay in uni for the full year, I'll be able to take some more courses (though we don't have many MIS classes at my current college and the CS program is heavily impacted). &amp;#x200B; That all said, I'm wondering what options are better/best in a situation like this.

The most paramount struggle we all face is finding someone who is willing to open the first door, not every single door is closed but sometimes it is tiring to continue trying to find the one door someone is willing to open. &amp;#x200B; The most important thing for those who have higher aspirations than your initial opportunity is to never give up on learning and growing your knowledge-base, and find ways to incorporate your extra-curricular knowledge into your current job. Being able to perform the job you are hired to do will give you job security... being able to perform beyond the standards set for you will give you job advancement. &amp;#x200B; Over 10 years I have had a mixed bag of experience, but the constant underlying factor was my drive to surpass expectations and show that I was an asset worth investing in. I have some college education but no degree, and 8 certifications, my path is my own but it is not uncommon from those trying to work their way into the field. My path went from: Help Desk (3 years) \*\*-&gt;\*\* Systems Administration (2 years) \*\*-&gt;\*\* Network Engineer (1.5 years) \*\*-&gt;\*\* Cyber Analyst (1 year) \*\*-&gt;\*\* Mid Cybersecurity Engineer/Information Assurance Manager (2 years) \*\*-&gt;\*\* Senior Cybersecurity Systems Engineer (.5 year and ongoing). &amp;#x200B; Aside from the advice and impressions that I have given so far, the biggest I want to leave behind is: create a 1 / 2 / 5 / 10 year goal for personal and professional development. Many of us get caught up in wanting to jump straight into our end game that we get discouraged when it doesn't happen... we need to remember that it is the journey to get there that teaches us the most. &amp;#x200B; If anyone has any questions, I will do my best to answer them with what experience I do have."
924,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,Security Career Outlook - Help,8,bu1xln,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/bu1xln/security_career_outlook_help/,2019-05-29 02:15:51,"So, a quick recap of my(25M) short-lived career. I started as an intern at the company Im currently with a couple of year ago and had no IT background whatsoever, but the company gave me a chance. Now, the company, at the time, had 2 guys working in IT - an old sysadmin working everything, including security, on his own and a new hire, close to my age, working some help desk. Fast forward about a year. I was hired on full-time after 3 months of interning at a pretty great starting salary for someone with no IT experience , and I was quickly thrown into a help desk/sysadmin role. After about 6 months, the aforementioned new hire moved on, and the IT department was just myself and the old sysadmin. Busting my butt, with no help from the old sysadmin, I was able to implement many new changes to the system, including updating our entire ecosystem to Windows 10, encrypting all Windows 10 machines via BitLocker, moving to Office 365, etc. Trial by fire has been my motto. Obviously having to learn most everything on my own, Now, at 2 years in, I'm pretty much the IT group lead on our corporate environment because the old sysadmin has moved on, and I'm the senior member of the IT crew now (added on a few more folks with more specific roles now - cloud, network, help desk, etc.). About 6 months ago, I began to feel a little burned out. Feeling stagnant in my position with the company as there wasn't really a mentor at the company to help me see a path forward, working 60+ hour weeks, and feeling as if I had to clean up after my colleagues constantly, I began job-searching. I received an offer from a very large organization offering me about $10k more than what I was making at my current company but working in a secure area doing some pretty monotonous tasks. I took that offer back to my company with caveats, and they asked what it would take for me to stay. I, of course, low-balled myself, and said $15k more than I was making currently, and they said ""done."" So, I'm now working on a special project for the company handling NIST compliance with a security-related role incoming after compliance controls are in place. After all of that, I'm in a position where I'm handling a lot of policy and paperwork for cybersecurity, but I'd love to be able to get on the more technical side of things. With the security-related role, mentioned above, I'd be doing a lot of system auditing and control implementation, which is okay, but I feel would get sort of monotonous as well. My current job ecosystem is mainly software development or cybersecurity on the policy side with some jobs more on the technical side of security. Currently, I have a Security+ and was looking at CASP next, but I'm also open to going back to school and getting an MS. I guess my big question is this: What are some more technical security roles I could learn material on my own for, what should I focus on primarily to really turn myself into a security SME, and how far-fetched are all of my hopes here? I use some basic security tools to get more information on threats that occur with the occasional spear-phishing attempts or malware that slips through our Office 365 ATP solution, I have some basic web development skills, know a decent bit of C, a bit of scripting (python, powershell, etc.) for office tasks, and some Linux knowledge. I've done plenty of research on my own for answers to this question, I promise, but none of the answers seem to be very relevant. The idea of moving into digital forensics and/or working on IoT for infrastructure security has really intrigued me and has motivated me to really try to kick ass in my current position to learn all I can to get started in my auditing position. Thanks in advance for any help, advice, even constructive criticism you can provide. TL;DR: Started as an intern, now feeling stuck after moving into more of a policy-related security position. Asking for advice on next moves."

I've had numerous instances where it's like ok we've got a brand new business, what do we need to get and do? So... I provide a quote and source out the appropriate hardware servers, network hardware, I run and install the cabling, design and set up the data closet, WiFi, Then setup domains, permissions, GPO's, perform email migrations etc. Whole 9 yards. \-Support and administration of networks &amp; systems From helpdesk support, documentation of systems and infrastructure and beyond lol. \-Incident response &amp; resolution of escalated tickets. If our primary helpdesk guy can't solve it, It usually comes to me or one of the other seasoned team members. \[Lol there's legit only several of us in the IT/ Cybersecurity Dept\] and we all work helpdesk. But I've also had to respond to a ton of incidents like users getting phished and downloading malware or trying to wire money like idiots, entire infrastructures being compromised by ransomware, and more. \- Set up &amp; maintain cloud-based spam filters &amp; firewalls &amp; VPNs (SSL, Site to site, etc). I set them up, support them, and do everything else. \-Vulnerability analysis, scanning, and reporting. I lead 75% of our vulnerability analysis projects for numerous clients. Then usually work some pretty long hours doing so ensuring that the vulnerabilities are legit &amp; not false positives &amp; writing custom reports that pretty soon i'll be delivering with the CIO instead of me writing it for him and him going by himself. &amp;#x200B; \-Basically everything IT. &amp;#x200B; Overall, in the past several months, I've accomplished the following milestones: \- Created proper IT Client on-boarding documentation. \- Implemented and fine-tuned Patch management &amp; Managed AV across several dozen clients and over 700 PCs. My predecessor had the wool pulled over managements eyes &amp; Only 2 of our clients had patch management out of several dozen. They thought everyone was good to go... Hah! So I brought it up in a meeting and lead the project to implement patch management and fine-tune out AV solution on over 700 PCs across dozens of companies. \- Performed numerous vulnerability scans &amp; reports, one of which resulted in the onboarding of a new client &amp; reoccurring revenue. Also did all reporting. \- Currently, I hold 9 Active IT &amp; Cybersecurity certifications. My employer paid for a voucher and training for me to renew my CompTIA certs by taking the Pentest+ exam, And I passed it! :D After 5 months of intense studying daily lol. I'm currently the only employee besides the CIO to hold any certifications. I currently have my A+, Network+, Security+, Pentest+, CSIS, CIOS, CNVP, CCENT, &amp; CCNA R&amp;S. \- Designed &amp; Created a System Tray Icon to assist clients and end users with initiating support requests. &amp;#x200B; My Experience: 1.5 Yrs at my current job - an MSSP 4.5 Years as a PC Technician who also played network &amp; server admin for a service center. I fixed servers, Desktops, Laptops and a lot more while maintaining our network and servers. 1 Yr at staples fixing &amp; selling PCs, copiers and printers. 6 Yrs throughout all of this doing my own thing for my own clients. Setting up SOHOs, PC repair, Installation of IP camera systems, etc. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; TLDR: I want a promotion and a pay increase to at least 65K. I work 50 - 60 hours a week with no overtime at all and strongly feel as if I deserve it with my knowledge and accomplishments. How do I successfully bring this to the table?

I mainly want to know what the office life is like for an IT professional. Especially for someone who left a physical job spending lots of time outside if anyone happens to have had a similar transition. The reason I ask is because I work for a fire department full time and have been struggling a lot lately. My neck, back, shoulders, knees etc., all ache every day. Also, after about 12 years I just dont have the passion for it I once did. Im relatively young (mid 30s), and I would like to have a career that isnt going to take such a heavy toll on my body, or my mind for that matter (Ive already been diagnosed and am being treated for PTS). On top of all that being outside in my gear when its 110 or -20 degrees is getting really old and working inside is sounding pretty nice these days. I have always had a passion for computers in general. However, I have a strong passion for networking engineering, network security, and Cybersecurity specifically. I understand I will have to start from the bottom and thats fine. Have to start somewhere. Already working on certifications and getting back into college.

I recently moved to a new state and purchased a home with my wife and 2-year old, and wanted to spend a while working on the house and figuring out what my next steps should be career-wise. *How I got here:* I graduated from a good university with a B.S. in Physics / Mathematics. I didn't do anything with that degree, and bounced around a bit before finding a passion in web development, where I taught myself to make web apps. I started out at a startup doing web dev, but left after a year for a really cool (I thought at the time) digital advertising company where I could make much more money (at the time, that was about $70k/year in NYC). At this new gig, I busted my ass and got recognition every annual review, being promoted to Sr. front-end developer ($90k), technical lead ($100k - $120k), then front-end solutions architect ($140k), then a technical director ($180k), then a senior technology director ($215k). Throughout this time I was never the best programmer, and spewed out a fair share of spaghetti code but always had good results and delivered projects on time/budget. This company did give me a lot of experience doing a broad range of projects, from websites to mobile apps to retail installations, but I have never become an expert at anything, and dabbled in DevOps, frontend web dev (JS, CSS), backend-development (PHP/Python), DevOps (shell, Jenkins, linux admin), Cloud (AWS certification, hosting with Lambda, EC2, Cloudfront, S3, etc). I would certainly consider myself a jack-of-some-trades, master of none. By the time I got to the sr. director level, it was becoming clear that in-house technology dept was going downhill in favor of lower cost global satellite offices, and I was dreadfully ready to get out of the advertising industry. At that point, I started applying around for VP, Engineering roles, to stop having ""clients"" and start working ""in-house"". I ended up taking a VP, Product role at a company that was going through a restructure @ $215k/yr, 7% bonus (I negotiated a higher salary / lower bonus, because the company was going through a lot of changes and I generally don't like discretionary salary). In this new role I was responsible for a lot of different things, cutting across design, technology, marketing, finances, sales, etc. but I feel like my skillset is more suited on the technology side - and as I found learned over the years, I'm incredibly disinterested in anything having to do with marketing or advertising and prefer the making of things. In the VP Role, I never really got into a comfort zone  everything felt like a huge learning curve and the constant impostor syndrome dread definitely wore on me. But all-in-all, I learned a boatload about getting a product off the ground, enough to know that I want to focus more on technology than across all disciplines. Some of the things I've enjoyed the most in the past were white-boarding solutions to problems, architecting, and prototyping. I've never felt like I was particularly GOOD at these things, but I would find myself lost in a state of ""flow"" when doing them. My highest education is a B.S. in Physics / Mathematics, I also picked up a Certified Solutions Architect, Associate from AWS in 2016 which has since lapsed. *What's next?* I have never been a great networker, but generally speaking I always get along well with coworkers and others have told me that I make a good manager and leader. I value work-life balance for myself and those that report to me. In the past, I have put in 80 hour weeks which really turned me off to that lifestyle and the work people produce under those conditions is generally awful. Don't want to live like that ever again, but I do want to have a high-paying job where I can make a difference and be challenged. I've always felt more comfortable as a second-in-command than being the one bearing the brunt of responsibility, as stress gets to me and aggravates my anxiety. But, I am no stranger to living outside of my comfort zone, and others have told me that I make a good manager and leader, and that I can inspire others (even when I sometimes myself am interally second-guessing my decisions). Fields I've considered digging deeper into: cybersecurity, blockchain, data analysis/visualization, cloud architecture. At this point in my career, should I consider going back to school to get an M.S. or MBA? Does any of the word soup above scream out a good fit for any particular role?"

I am aware that some jobs in IT security require a security clearance which is a whole different ballgame, and that these investigators routinely access sealed/expunged records. I cannot stop thinking about this, and I finally am studying something that I enjoy. I was told by the court that only jobs in healthcare, law enforcement, schools can access this information and only with fingerprints provided, and to answer ""No"" on job applications that inquire about past convictions. However, this entire thing makes me feel like a scumbag. I have no other criminal history of any kind, not even a speeding ticket. Anyone who can provide some input/advice would be very greatly appreciated. Would this be a big roadblock?"

It was a phone interview with the hiring manager and another member from the security team. They threw a lot of technical questions and some behavioral ones. I think I did...okay, not great. Towards the end of the interview he mentions that there will be another job posting that will be at a higher level which means higher pay. Anyways, the next day I sent him a ""thank you"" letter for considering me for the position. He replies that he will let me know when the other opportunity that he mentioned in the interview posts on the job board. A few weeks go by and I'm thinking he may have just brushed me off and that was his way of saying ""good luck we'll notify you if there's another opportunity"" type of thing. At this point I'm thinking I didn't get the job. Then the hiring manager emails me back today regarding that position he mentioned and if I'm interested to apply and let him know. Do you guys think I have a good chance of landing this position in this scenario? I don't want to get my hopes too high although I feel like this must be a very good thing that the hiring manager kept his word and is directly reaching out about an opportunity that's at a higher level than the one I applied for."

ABOUT ME... I have almost no experience in the field (~1 school student help desk) and have just finished my dual Associate Degree (Network Systems Administration and Cybersecurity Specialist) in December. I've been applying at all the help desk positions near me, and just had a phone interview that seems interesting but I am afraid my lack of experience might be a problem. And I don't just mean for me (stress/etc), but also for the company too. ABOUT THE JOB... So part of the day to day job is just basic Windows config/manage/etc for 5 facilities. It is not a tech centric company, they have no other IT staff, and this would be the sole tech support position. They had another employee who basically managed most of their IT needs but had no training or experience, but was just tech savvy but he left. For some things they used local outside IT support but most of it is machine to machine with little or no remote administration. Just from their website I can see some very basic things that either they (or whoever they hired) handled poorly, such as no SSL even though it's offered for free by their hosting company, so I'm assuming I'll see other basic mismanaged resources. The lack of any other IT personnel is a slight worry (keeping up with issues and basic training) but nothing I'm too worried about. The posting is offering 31-39k, which seems ok to me. ABOUT THE CATCH... But the thing is they want to grow their IT to eventually build out a Domain and manage most of the sites through a network. And that would fall to me, with no real experience, outside theoretical academic experience. They already have a server and firewall at each facility, a VPN set up by another team, a SQL database that was in the cloud and they just migrated to their own servers. They have a working VOIP system. The person I would be reporting to is not tech illiterate, but also admitted that he's no expert and part of my role would be advising him on future growth. Essentially the position would grow into becoming System/Network Admin, maybe even Manager - we didn't get into specifics about how much growth. So I am meeting them in person tomorrow, and I wanted to get some advice from you guys about whether my excited but nervous outlook is appropriate or the foolish result of no experience. And a big part of it is I want to be transparent and honest, and if this is beyond my skill set I don't want to force myself on them because of their tech ignorance. It feels like a great opportunity to grow the position into anything, and gain a ton of experience. I only had a 15 min phone screening, so not a lot of chance to get into the details but I could ask and update my post tomorrow after having a chance to sit down in person for an hour. Anything in specific I should ask, mention, etc at the interview. The phone screening went well, it was with the COO and at least for my part I enjoyed talking to him. He would be the person I'd be working with most."

First post on this sub. &amp;#x200B; I'm a 4th year Bachelor of Commerce student concentrating in Business Technology Management (new Mgmt Info Systems). I believe BComm is the equivalent of BBA in the US. Last summer, I had a chance to work as a summer **IT security analyst** for my university's IT department. It was my first time being exposed to cybersecurity and I really liked the work I was doing. For the last few months, I've been looking into jobs in the cybersecurity field for my next internship (this upcoming summer is my last summer as a uni student since I'll be graduating in April 2020). My search was unfruitful as most cybersecurity internships I found are out in Vancouver or Toronto area. I live in Calgary. &amp;#x200B; I've been talking with my former boss at the University's IT department, and he sent out my resumes to some of the people he knew, so obviously I was grateful for that. He suggested that if I can't find a summer job elsewhere, I can come back for a 2nd term. &amp;#x200B; A few weeks ago, I spoke with a campus recruiter from KPMG (the accounting firm) when they came by my university for an employer info session. At the time they said they weren't looking for technology students, but then a couple of days later, a **cybersecurity consultant intern** position became available. I reached out to the recruiter I met on Linkedin, and she referred me to the hiring manager of the job. By this point, I submitted my application (cover letter, resume, transcripts). A few days later, the hiring manager reached out to me and after exchanging a couple of emails, she suggested that I meet with their head of cybersecurity consulting department. She said it'll be a coffee chat (did not say or mention it was an interview ), but I assume she has checked my resume by this point and wants to bring me in to see what I'm about. I'll be going to their office next Monday. &amp;#x200B; Earlier today, my former boss emailed me asking if I'm still interested in coming back and to let him know by tomorrow. &amp;#x200B; I'm in a big dilemma here as I'm wondering if I should accept the guaranteed internship at the University instead of gambling on myself and hope for the best with the KPMG internship. One part of me says I should take what's right in front of me, but another part of me says I should explore and try to build my network. &amp;#x200B; The program that I'm studying at the University is essentially training me to become a business / systems analyst or an IT project manager. Some of stuff I've learned so far is database management (SQL), enterprise analysis (like drawing use case, activity, business process, state machine, communication diagrams etc) and such. &amp;#x200B; My dream is to become a security architect, and I'm aware that these are two routes I can take to get there. One is being a security analyst (more technical) or security consultant (more managerial, risk governance stuff). Another thing to consider is that I'm a business student, so I don't have the technical skills an engineering or computer science student would. To make up for it, I'm planning to get CompTIA Network+ and Security+ certs soon. &amp;#x200B; Sorry for the really long post, I'm in a weird situation and would love to hear some feedback from professionals. What should I do?"

My Background, I started cracking video games for high score and fun initially. Simple games like hill climb, Temple run, etc. Its sorta easy actually, all you have to do is find the location where the game stores the data modify it offline and then get online, link it to a social account and voila! you have all the goodies! The downside is that you would get bored of the game real soon. Moving on, having wifi restrictions at home forced me to guess the neighbor's wifi password. It was easy, the reception was shitty tho! Still had no aim on what to do in life or which path to take. Was interested in hacking and stuff just didn't have the drive inside me cause well not in it for the fame. Was interested in the way how this world works, was struggling with depression, addictions and the usual teenage shit at this time as well. Music was my outlet, had religious parents who sincerely believed I am sent from hell and I am destined to reach there as well later. The only good thing out of that was when we had a youth meeting and they had a person show us about the hidden messages in songs, how apparently Illuminati controls everything and stuff. Sounded interesting, hence went down the rabbit hole of conspiracy theory and put on my Tin Foil Hat for a good many years. You know where this is leading, everybody the anonymous bandwagon has arrived. Jumps onboard. Felt I was doing something useful by being a hacktivist. Still aimless with what would make me happy in the real world. Didn't feel bothered by it very much. Took commerce with computers in school. Computers were the only subject where I excelled. Went onwards to do bachelors in networking and security. Was a shitty place, had no internet or anything. To sum up my bachelors, I did networking security in a college with a fucking LAN Network. If hell does exist the fucktards from my college management have a place down there. Anyways, the only reason I took this course was so that I can save the world in my own way, stick it to the man. lol wtf, who am I kidding now when I think about it. Anyways, for my final year project, I was interested in botnet hijacking I was pretty close down that line of being the savior for the world in my own way smh. It all came to a grinding halt when I got served a warning from my ISP stating that I am using their network service for malicious activities, proceeding to do so will force them to use legal action against me. \~ Glowing bulb above my head! Yeah right, how the fuck am I going to explain that I am reverse engineering malware and browsing shady forums to learn cyber security, aw hell no. I would have my ass locked up and thrown away. My region has zero tolerance policy for VPN, TOR, and every other technology to bypass their official blocking filters, in short, you are fucked if you do get into any legal trouble. It was the moment of realization, I knew that moving on in the future, the choices I have made would get me into trouble. Ater this incident, I changed my project from hijacking botnets to IDS systems for Linux environments. During this time I had done internships and had work experience at a few places. All as an IT Field support, network admin, tech support, product dispatch in charge, E-Mail tech support, ethical hacking instructor. To sum the above part up, I had switched 9 jobs, absconded in fact from all without serving any notice period, hardly worked at any place for more than 6 months, it just wasn't my thing. Was not into networking as a career option, I do know the concepts well, coding was really not my thing, but I can read the code to figure out what it does. I was more into cybersecurity just never was able to get crack at it. Finally, after waiting and searching for so long I was finally able to get into this place as a SOC analyst It's somewhere close to what I am interested in. I do know SOC is the lowest area to learn about technical methods used in attacks and stuff in cybersecurity these days, cause it's getting more and more automated, and the human aspect is required only if it flags something out of the already fine-tuned filters. Yet after searching for so long, this is a good break for me. My region has a pathetic employment option for freshers, all they hire is someone with a minimum of 10 years experience with a lot of certs and stuff. I am grateful for this opportunity. PM for help and advice, I am in no way a pro, but I am glad to assist with stuff. Btw, This is my first post on Reddit, hope to post more about my journey here. kindly be kind and guide me as well. \- xTz"

I'm thinking it might be a good idea to pursue a basic IT certification just to show that I've been keeping up to speed with the industry. I just want something recent on my resume. Any ideas on what a good cert for someone in my position to pursue might be? I've been doing some research and I see that CCNA is a good start? I'm thinking of trying to get into cybersecurity or cloud stuff. It's really hot and high paying right now from the research I've done ."

This is great because they have a direct transfer path to one particular university that would allow me to get my B.S in Cybersecurity while still attending my community college. I would be taking classes from professors at this university but at my community college, meaning that I can get a 4-year degree at the cost of my community college prices. As amazing as this opportunity is I don't know what jobs this could lead to. What kind of jobs could I get with this degree? What's my income going to look like? &amp;#x200B; Thank you! &amp;#x200B; P.S Sidenote, I'm working as a cashier part-time, the company has a good tuition reimbursement plan where they would be able to pay for 1 quarter of my classes a year (up to $1,500 a year, annually), leaving me to pick up the rest of the costs. Again, a very nice thing to happen, but I'm afraid I won't be able to afford it on my part-time minimum wage job ($12.50/ hr, \~25 hr max a week). There's an opening at my community college as an IT Helpdesk, (20 hrs max because it's a work-study), I don't quite know the pay but it would be more about getting a little bit more of money and experience than anything) should I try and apply for it?"

My 1st IT Job was a PT ""Level 1 Helpdesk Tech"" for a small MSP in my area. I learned a lot, traveled to lots of client sites and worked with networks/servers I never touched before. I was 22 years old, made $14/hr and worked 25 hrs a week. I was fired after 6 months. They said I wasn't keeping up with the performance they expected. Over the 4-5 years after that job, I learned a lot about the industry and what is expected from different job roles. In hindsight, I was severely underqualified for the MSP job. They had me writing up disaster recovery plans, remoting into fileservers, and deploying packages to client webpages via FTP. all stuff that a level 1 should NOT be doing for their first job. I had only just gotten my A+ a few months prior! I liked the job a lot, I liked the people I worked with and I liked the exposure to different office environments. Now with the experience of my last two jobs: I made $60k in the last year, traveled across the country for an office integration project, developed and implemented process improvement strategies within my team, have written up dozens of documentation workpapers, and as a L2 Senior tech in a prior position led Service Desk coaching meetings with L1 management. I also now have A+, Net+, Server+, MTA in Network Fundamentals, completed Cisco Network Academy course and am attending Uni for BS in Cybersecurity. so... would it be weird of me to go back after ~5 years? I really feel the only thing that was limiting me was my experience level. Knowing what I know now, I think I could be a better fit than I once was."

Im a young IT Professional (23) and have been in the field now for about a year and a little over half in the Seattle area. I learned computer repair and even took a Digital Forensics class at my high school and managed to get credits for a local college of mine, transferring to there I had gone through the entirety of Cisco Net Academy and from that point forward I went into the intro Cyber Security classes. This college of mine is well known for its cyber security courses teaching both Digital Forensics and Ethical hacking, so I was super interested in leading into these classes. I took the Digital Forensics track which was great! I didnt lead into the actual EC council exam because I was younger and didnt have the confidence in myself. Going into my Intro to network security classes I found myself completely outclassed by all my peers having at least a year of experience out in the field. At the end of that course, I was determined to get out into the field, get an IT job and then come back when I felt more experienced. Queue the cert grind, I took about 4 months to study to the A+ and eventually by the end of the first half of 2017 I had obtained my A+ certification. Moving forward I started applying for jobs. Luckily I was able to land an internship in a help desk at a fairly large SaaS company for a year. During my time there I was lucky enough to get into the CCNA Cyber Ops Scholarship and taking full advantage of the opportunity I managed to obtain CCNA Cyberops by the end of summer in 2018. During my internship I learned programs/platforms/best practices such as Jira, Confluence,Office 365, Brivo on Air, CUCM, Okta Administration, Malware triaging, asset management (asset Panda) and making really great networking connections on linked in. During this time I helped my Girlfriend achieve her GED and now she is in school for IT too! With my internship ending and them notifying me they were not going to promote me to a System Admin position in the company that had opened up, I started looking for jobs in the area. I then managed to get a full time position at a specialty retail companys headquarters where I would be doing IT work for their stores in house IT and luckily it was a 15 minute drive away from my school! Ive been in this job for about 7 months now as a T1 tech for them on a 34k per year salary. A guy above me in a T2 position has less experience and certifications than me and is making about 40k+. In my time here I have earned my Network+ and have gone back to school to finish out my info sec classes and get closer to finishing out 2 Associates in Technical Arts I qualify for So were getting to the root of my questions. I am currently in a class to complete my Certified Ethical Hacker Certification, I will finish out both of my Associates in infosec/Networking Technology probably around spring quarter of next year. My work has my back with school and works with me a bit to attend night classes. I feel stagnated in this job. A majority of what I do is just reboot the register computer and check various connections etc. Projects Ive done here have been essentially building an in office help desk, guiding interns that get hired on towards certifications and interests/people they should talk to within our company. My boss told me right now my Network+ doesnt apply to what I am doing now, and anything connectivity related is then given to the tiers above me. I had my performance review and he told me there is talks of promoting me but that doesnt mean I will be, no raise, and overall my performance is great. What do you guys think/suggest for me? Should I finish out school, get my CEH CCNA route/switch and move on? Should I stick it out at this company and see if I do get promoted and see where I go? Were in a reorg and it may trickle down to me getting promoted but its unknown what will happen. My team lead is fairly transparent with me and tells me Im talked about highly and should be patient as were a little bit of a smaller company so more unique opportunities may arise for me. The Seattle area I feel lacks the kind of mid level jr sys admin jobs that Im looking for or maybe I should be looking other places than Indeed and Dice. My interests and my end goal is to do tons with Networks, and cyber security. Next Generation Fire Walls, SIEMs IDSs IPSs hell even a Stateless firewall fascinate me as well as generally how DNS, OSPF, BGP, EIGRP work and how to make networks better. I know Im not going to land a job like that anytime soon but I just want to establish my interests. Id appreciate any guidance I can get from anyone who has been in this field for a long time. I think part of something I have to learn is to be patient but I hate feeling stagnant. Thank you for anyone who reads this, I know its a long one.I've lacked a real mentor in my career to help guide me in my pursuit to become what I am aiming to be. Tl;dr 1 1/2 year exp CCNA Cyber Ops A+ and network + certified making 34k a year in school right now will finish with Cybersecurity associates and Networking associates in spring of next year. What do to land a more network focused security/networking based jobs other than obtaining a CCNA route switch/or general advice for the level Im at at the moment"

If they had emailed a bit earlier, I would have LOVED to pursue this internship. &amp;#x200B; And then today, I got an email from a major Oil &amp; Gas company (applied for an IT project intern job 3 months ago) asking if I would be interested in a security internship. &amp;#x200B; I had a great time learning about cybersecurity last summer, but the university internship is definitely the lowest paying job. ***My dilemma is since I already accepted the university's internship offer, is it wrong for me to follow up with the O&amp;G company's interview?*** **My former &amp; soon-to-be-again boss (at the uni IT department) is my most important reference for my resume.** Many students applied for this job, but he personally reached out to see if I would be interested in coming back. And I said yes, so he probably didn't even interview anyone. I have this sense of loyalty to him too because he was very kind and patient with me as he answered all my nagging questions and as I learned the ropes of being in a professional environment for the first time. I would hate to burn the bridge with him.

I plan to get cybersecurity certs but they can be costly as you guys may know. I heard that most O&amp;G companies in my area will pay for certs as long as I remain with the company, so I'm tryna think what would be the most beneficial for my career. But like I said, my former boss at the Uni is my most important reference and he is also the hiring manager for the uni internship. &amp;#x200B; Any feedback is appreciated!"

I have an Associate's in cybersecurity, I know it's only the first stepping stone, trying to find the next one. I just don't know if I should go with the comptia security+ for my first one, or go the Cisco CCNA route. I eventually want to earn Linux+ too. I'm really lost here, I don't have much relevant experience (on paper) but have been a hobbyist for most of my life. What are your suggestions? Currently I don't have much spending money, counting on the future for that, so the question is what will give me the most bang for my buck now? Thank you very much for any advice, it will be greatly appreciated:)"
981,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,Which internship should I accept?,3,bhntup,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/bhntup/which_internship_should_i_accept/,2019-04-27 01:48:28,"Tl;Dr at the bottom, apologies if this is a bit long. A little background about me: I'm a Computer Networking Major with minors in Computer Science and Cybersecurity. It's my senior year in Wisconsin right outside the Cities, and my goal is to move near the cities after I graduate this next December to be closer to my SO. I currently am employed at an internship with company A I've held since last summer, which was extended after good performance; essentially, I have a part time position as a full stack development intern. It is approximately an hour and a half away from my apartment, but half an hour away from my parents house whom I could move back in with this summer (but really don't desire to). They have offered me to stick around and stay for another summer with a pay raise to 23 an hour. I love the work I do, but I am not enthralled with the company or it's policies and don't plan to stay unless I have no other job prospects, but they have continually suggested they will be offering me a full time position. I work with C# mostly developing APIs, but lately have been working on automated patching with servers and Azure stuff. The work is constantly fresh and new, and the company is the best-in-class for their market, so I deal with apps that impact millions of users. Unfortunately, the downsides to this internship are that remote work is non-existent (making work while I'm in school very hard; 4 hours of unpaid commute every work day, gas is expensive and wear on my vehicle) and I have no peers that are within my age group, so it can be sort of lonely. They also have one location for IT work and it is here, and I do not want to stay here past graduation whatsoever, as it is very far from both my SO and my family. As well, even if I work here this summer and live with my parents, I would still need to pay for my college apartment while getting no use out of it. I was, however, recently offered a new internship at a company B that is 25 minutes from my apartment. I am enthralled by the work this new company does, and working there after I graduate is something I deeply desire. They have an office in the cities which they say I could move to once I graduate, and have a reputation for giving interns who work there full time jobs that pay well above market average. However, the internship is in product support, and only pays 12 an hour. I'm confident in my people skills and motivation to move up in company B, but I fear this experience for the internship will be less useful as a resum builder than the work I do with company A. As well, the lower pay would be difficult to deal with, but not impossible. However, I would desire a job with company B after I graduate infinitely more than with company A. Seeing as I am reaching the end of my studies, I am motivated to work for the company B that I would rather work for after I graduate, but although both companies can nearly guarantee me a job, only one of them is in development/project work, and that is the company A I would rather not stay on with. Development jobs are plenty at company B, but I would probably need to knock it out of the park impressions wise and study outside of work to land one. I also greatly enjoy the area around my college apartment and have many friends there, and not many anymore back home near my parents. I am a part of many clubs and activities that require equipment that I can't move to my parents house, and thus would be giving up these hobbies for the summer when I have time and weather to enjoy them if I stay with company A. Tl;dr: two companies offering me summer work with promise of full time after. Company A: company I currently work for + 23 dollars an hour + fruitful full stack development work in dotNET, Windows Server, Azure, Web dev + have been working here for a year, extensive portfolio and good reputation - middle of nowhere and would need to live with my parents which is inconvenient, unable to practice hobbies - no peers in my age group, separated from friends geographically - I do not want to work for Company A when I graduate due to distance, culture, and policy, they don't offer any remote work either - commute during semester is 4 hours round trip, expensive gas and car wear Company B: new company near me + awesome company culture, enthralled with them after visiting + very short commute, can see friends and participate in hobbies + not paying for useless apartment + offers remote work during semester for interns + IT shop that is very reputable and fast growing + interesting benefits that appeal to me + full time positions pay much better than Company A on average according to glassdoor and other similar sources ~ java/apple shop, not familiar with this but want to learn - 12 dollars an hour, not even competitive with convenience stores near me - support position which is not the most interesting, need to put in work to get a development position Apologies for the wall of text and possible mobile formatting"

I've got an associate's degree and I'm working on my BS while I work full-time. Right now, my job is mostly typical helpdesk stuff with some SCCM administration thrown in (not technically part of my job description, but no one else is around to do it, so...) I have two potential job opportunities: * A job with the helpdesk at a university, doing the same thing I'm doing now. I'm pretty sure I'm going to get an offer for this one, and I'll find out within the next couple weeks. It pays $6k more than my current position and one of the benefits includes near-total tuition reduction. (I'd pay about $25/semester.) It's non-exempt, which I feel would help me balance school and work a lot more easily. * The other is a potential promotion within my current org, going to Tier II support, which would make SCCM my official responsibility. I have no idea if I'm going to get this one - it's a long shot, given what they're asking for (degrees and experience I don't have yet), and I won't find out for months. On the other hand, my boss is very positive about my chances for this position. It pays $15k more, is exempt, and has correspondingly more responsibility. I'm not entirely sure what my future goals are yet. I like working with people as much as with tech so I'd like to do a client-focused thing, but I'm not sure what my options are that pay well. (Doing research into that now. Cybersecurity maybe?) Currently, I am most concerned about affording tuition without taking out loans, and with balancing my workload with school. **tl;dr Do I take the safe bet now or wait for the long shot?**"

I've been in this role for around 6 months and I've had my Security+ certification for around 2 years now. I've been struggling with deciding what to get next as pretty much from here on any next echelon cert will set me down a career path (No doors close in IT no matter what branch you go which is great, you can always do something else!) Basically my experience in IT is pretty vast, not showboating or anything, I have around 5 years total of IT related experience, and about 7 months of experience from a full-time position in IT civilian side. Here is what I've touched on or still do: Re-imaging Troubleshooting account/computer/printer/network/hardware/software/access issues/VOIP phones/GOVT Cell phones and a bunch more misc. stuff. Knowledge management like updating templates in remedy, remedy administration, sharepoint documentation updates, procedure updates and creation, assisting other personnel in my organization with in-house IT support. In the Army I still work with Networking as a 25B (IT Specialist) and also work with vSphere and emulations for servers and firewalls. Worked with switches and also held the role of Service Desk Administrator here. &amp;#x200B; This mostly sums up my career with a lot of detail removed for personal reasons. As far as education is concerned I'm currently attending on-line college for a BS in Cybersecurity but I'm not even remotely sure I will excel in that field as its far different from what I currently do. I picked up the jack of all trades which has benefited me greatly but I feel like I'm going to become stagnant in a role like a Service Desk because of contractual requirements and salaries not being very flexible on contracts. (I am a contractor currently) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; So. The meat and the potatoes. &amp;#x200B; I've looked into the following certification paths and I have the next 8 weeks to study before jumping on one of them and knocking it out.

And I'm seriously starting to worry because I'm not young like some of you, my brain takes longer to recall information. My question is, did I choose one of the hardest directions to go in IT? Is networking typically one of the harder subjects to learn? I also like Cybersecurity and started to go that direction but most jobs require a bachelor's degree which I do not have. I'm not down playing sys admins but even Microsoft seems easier to learn than Cisco. I'm two semesters into it and I've learned a lot but if I can find something a little easier, at this point I might consider it. Working in Support always came easy to me but once I started focusing on one thing and getting certs, shit got real!

All I know about SAP is that it's a YUUGE \*\*DonaldTrump voice\*\* ERP system and honestly that's about it. What is SAP Security? and what is a career in that field like? &amp;#x200B; Hey everyone, &amp;#x200B; Last summer, I worked as a summer IT intern for my university's IT Architecture &amp; Security department and split my time working for both the architecture (drawing network diagrams, making RFP templates) and security teams. It was my first time doing security work **(Using whois to find IP, MAC, using ServiceNow ticketing system, Trend Micro DDI, etc.**) I had a great time and I am now in pursuit of a career in cybersecurity. &amp;#x200B; Since my internship ended, I've looked for security-related internships for this summer since last December but my search was unfruitful as I got absolutely no calls or emails or nothin. My former boss reached out and offered me a 2nd internship this summer, but this time as a summer security analyst, and I was told I will be work on various projects. Prior to him offering me the internship, he helped me look for other security-related jobs by sending my resumes to people in his network. Obviously, I was grateful for that. &amp;#x200B; After I accepted the university offer, I started getting interview offers from various companies I applied for many many months ago (why couldn't they contacted me earlier?!?!). Long story short, a big oil &amp; gas company (in my area, AB Canada) approached and said a security internship opened up last minute and wanted me to come in for an interview. Because it was a last minute addition, they didn't even have a job description for this position. Assuming it was IT Security (like my last university internship) I agreed to an interview and I had the interview today. They offered me a couple hours after. But during the interview, I found out that this job is dealing with **SAP security**, not **IT security.** &amp;#x200B; They vaguely told me about the kind of tasks I will be doing, but I still don't have a full detailed list of tasks, so I'm going to request a full job description before I decide to accept their offer. But ya, my question is what is working in SAP Security like? I've done some research on what an SAP career is like, but I don't think I still fully understand it. I think it's a lucrative field, but what about the job market? Will it be hard to transition to somethin else later in my career? Any feedback is appreciated!!! THANKS!"

Honestly, do you even care if I have a degree, what my degree is in, or where my degree is from? It might seem odd that I have a degree from the U.K. as an American. The University of London system is definitely legitimate, has a big brick &amp; mortar presence and is not for being a diploma mill. &amp;#x200B; I've looked into similar programs locally and they'd cost about the same with less flexibility in regards to class times/scheduling.

1000,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,Trifecta in a year. Now what?,1,bmjl77,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/bmjl77/trifecta_in_a_year_now_what/,2019-05-09 23:06:59,"So in the span of a year I have achieved the A+, Net+ and Sec+ certs. I have no formal IT training, just a passion for it. I started studying a year and half ago when my daughter was 6 months old, while also working full-time. Now I'm kinda at an impasse. I'm thinking about getting the CCNA, but after taking the Sec+ exam I am feeling pulled into that direction (also I think the market will be more favorable for that in the future). I also have been researching WGU, but I'm not really sure if it would be worth it to invest the time and money for another Bachelors (I currently have one in Education). 1000s of resumes have been sent out, and I have had a few interviews that I usually knock out of the park, but every job I have been offered makes about 17$/hr when I currently make much more than that. I have done some IT work on the side. Helped a guy wire a doctor's office with CAT6 and set up the network. Also have done a bunch of computer support for my neighborhood and volunteered my time and expertise with a local church/homeless shelter and I'm working on getting a homelab set up now. I also had the idea of setting up an LLC and doing some consulting work. My thought was to offer cybersecurity auditing to small businesses and people via Facebook (take a look at the network settings, update firmware on routers, help install onepass/lastpass management, and introduce good OpSec to them, etc)"
1001,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,Bah... what do I do?,3,azz6v1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/azz6v1/bah_what_do_i_do/,2019-03-12 08:39:06,"Hi, I've posted here before and I am familiar with the community (kind of) but I have a question. Sit down and grab a cold one though, it gets lengthy. &amp;#x200B; Since June, I've had an internship in the IT department at company A, which lines up nicely with my cybersecurity degree program. Company A has a bunch of tenants within it, and Company B is a MSB in Company A. We at Company A work closely with and enjoy working with Company B, and Company B also has a lot of customers. However, times have been a bit weird at Company A. There's less and less stuff for me to do there since I started there (as in, only one person is telling me to do things), and Company B is losing some people and gaining customers like nobody's business. At Company A, I mostly do Python work as well as a lot of day-to-day IT stuff, but a lot of my time is spent sitting and learning from one person. I'm grateful for that one person, as without them, I wouldn't be doing anything but sitting around twiddling my thumbs. &amp;#x200B; But, I'm starting to feel like I've overstayed my welcome. The person says that I am not overstaying at all, and I fairly believe them, but it's hard to find stuff to do a lot of the time which leads me to that conclusion. At Company B, I would work closely with the Company A IT team, Company A employees, as well as working support with external companies, so I would be very busy, which I somewhat enjoy as long as it doesn't bleed into my school hours. But this internship was a friend-of-a-friend sort of deal. Originally I thought it was a traditional internship that ended after this semester, which is when Company B said that they'd love to have me on their team, as they know my work well. I accepted, but later talking with HR, it works out that I am somehow there for as long as I wanted to be (or if I would have been fired)... which is odd but that's how it was. It's been roughly a week since this happened and so far I'm on a course to join Company B. I feel horrible though, I loved working at Company A and feel bad leaving that one person behind as well as the rest of the team. I will also now need to get up stupid early (read 5:30AM as a college student) to get to work on time compared to the fact that Company A didn't really start operating until 2 hours later than Company B. &amp;#x200B; But, I will be learning and doing a lot more than just programming, watching other people do things, and little run-around tasks. I'll still do programming somewhat to automate tasks, but I'll also be learning about networking, interfacing with customers/clients, leading people through support steps, troubleshooting network problems, and learning about/configuring VOIP phone systems. That sounds very fun. The one person at Company A said to just do it and soak up as much knowledge as I could while over there, but I feel bad leaving the team after not only being given a part-time job and being taught, but also for leaving the team after this long stretch of time. The rest of the team doesn't seem to care either way though, I didn't do too much directly with them all the time. &amp;#x200B; My pay will stay the same, and hour flexibility with college will also be exactly the same. Maybe I'm just being a bit ""noob-ish"" to the whole office job thing (as this was my first ever) by worrying about that, but I still feel bad leaving. Did I make the right decision? At the time with the information given, yes, but after that, did I still have the right decision? I feel like it's too late to turn around but I still don't know and probably can if I want to burn that bridge with Company B. &amp;#x200B; I am so sorry for the length. I just need opinions/reassurance on that. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Thank you for reading!"
1002,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,Breaking out of entry level,1,b034hj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/b034hj/breaking_out_of_entry_level/,2019-03-12 14:47:19,So I am on my last semester in college before graduating with a BAS in Technology Administration. I currently hold a Security + and Certified Ethical Hacker certification leaning towards pursuing a career in cybersecurity. I have worked help desk and operations analyst positions for going on 4 years now. Unfortunately my current job doesnt have any open IT security positions and they wont anytime soon. I notice it is pretty difficult to jump from entry to mid level unless you move up within a company you already work for. Does anyone have any advice to stand out in the job market and hopefully get hired on as a mid-level security analyst or pen tester? I know this is a common question but I wanted to hear your thoughts and opinions on my personal situation.

I'm slated to retire from the USAF in a little over 4 years and I have decided that I'm not all that interested in what I did while I was in (RF and Satellite Communications Maintenance). I'd like to switch to a career in Cyber Security which has always interested me. What I'm hoping is that you all can give me some pointers on how to best set myself up to make the switch. Here is a bit of info about me: &amp;#x200B; Formal Education: B.S. in Business Administration UG Certificate in Computer Networking M.S. in Cyber Security (Currently pursuing) &amp;#x200B; Certifications: Professional Management Certificate Comptia Security+ &amp;#x200B; Other: Beginner to intermediate understanding of python, ruby, shell scripts Experience with various flavors of linux/bsd over the last 20+ years Recently built homelab for hands on experience with kali &amp;#x200B; I've slow-rolled my M.S. because I didn't really see a reason to have it for 8 years and the information be dated by the time I retire. I'm planning on completing it in the next 1-2 years. The Air Force will also provide $4500 to use on courses, books, and the tests for the following certifications: &amp;#x200B; Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician (CCENT) Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) Routing and Switching Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP) Routing and Switching CompTIA A+ ce CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (CASP) ce CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) CompTIA IT Fundamentals CompTIA Network+ ce CompTIA PenTest+ CompTIA Security+ ce Microsoft Technology Associate (MTA) Network Computer Technician (NCT) Network Systems Technician (NST) &amp;#x200B; I listed all IT related certifications in-case some would be good to have as well if I don't use all of the money alloted. What I would like to do over the next few years is maximize time/money. If there are certifications outside of those listed that would be help then I'd love to hear about them. I'm also trying to time these so I'm not having to pay for certifications I can't even use yet in my current career. If something is an annual renewal then I probably wouldn't look at getting it until later. &amp;#x200B; In addition to certifications and a degree is there anything else I should be looking at? I have a R710 at home that I've been setting up to run through some e-books on pentesting, hardening, etc. How can I better utilize my VMs to set myself up? Are there any voluntary efforts I could be doing in the meantime to better build a resume and gain experience? &amp;#x200B; I understand Cyber Security is a broad term so maybe you all could help point me towards something I would enjoy most. I currently work in a management role and push paper and sit in telecons all day long. After a long day of sitting on my butt...I'd rather sit in a much more confortable chair and work on hardening my own network in a shell. I'm more happy being faced with a problem I don't know the answer to and using every resource I have to try and figure it out. Nothing puts me in a better mood then hacking at the keyboard and then figuring out how to make something work right. This spans from programming to configuring a server at home. I'm hesitant to make a hobby a career, but, I'd like to maximize my job satisfaction and I think this is the way. &amp;#x200B; I hope I've provided enough info and I'm willing to provide whatever answers might be helpful. Thank you all for any inputs you might have even if they might not be the ones I want to hear."

I was moving away from Help Desk after 1 year at an MSP. &amp;#x200B; I was initially approached by a local recruiter on Indeed for a ""Cybersecurity Analyst"" position with the duties very clearly laid out and without ambiguity. After a phone interview with the actual employer (contractor to the DoD, so I'm somewhat of a subcontractor), it morphed to ""IT Specialist"" where they said based on my experience they would like me to write Powershell scripts for their Exchange server and do network scans. &amp;#x200B; When I actually started working my tasks include 100+ tickets where I am to call users and drive around a military base to pick up their computers for reimaging. I don't even take any part in the actual configuration of the task sequences despite experience setting up an MDT/WDS deployment server. I am doing none of the work that was originally described. My job is a combination of a secretary and a moving company. &amp;#x200B; Moreso, I started and finished my MCSA: Windows Server 2016 in a time frame of 3 months, with 2 of those months being since I started this job, so it was a little galling to keep seeing them stick me more and more into a field technician role. &amp;#x200B; Are all recruiters like this? The honest ones would just send me Help Desk / Desktop Support positions like they didn't even look at my resume. The scummy ones ask me to send them my resume, don't ever contact me back for the next 3 months, then hit me up after that to see if I know anyone who would be good for a Help Desk position they need filled. But this one just seems downright slimy. I have yet to have a good experience with any recruiters."

My choice would be between: **Jr. Splunk Engineer**: This would be under an extremely technically qualified and hardworking Senior Engineer (though he's got a lot of other responsibilities and not too much time for hand-holding). They'll sponsor me getting Splunk Power User &amp; Admin certs on the job. **Tier 1 Jr. SOC Analyst**: Shift work, less pressure, and I'd get to really apply NetSec Fundamentals and grow from the ground up. More details: Both jobs would be in the same building across the hall from each other, be a significant pay bump, and came about because manager/lead is specifically looking to take a chance on me because they know I'm eager to learn. I have an English BA, CS Minor, PMP, and aim to pass Sec+ by the end of this month. The Splunk job is almost certainly better (normal hours, better pay, better team). However, I know transferring from non-IT to IT is tough enough in this industry without starting over at helpdesk, and I'm uniquely lucky to have either offer. My main concern is that I want to set myself up for **sustainable growth** in IT. If I take this rare Splunk opportunity, will I miss out on learning cybersecurity/network/IT fundamentals from the SOC job? Is Splunk too specialized a tool for career options? Or is it really just an awesome opportunity I'd be stupid not to take? Thank you for any and all insights. Let me know if you need any more information."

Most day-to-day stuff for me is policy tuning (acl,webfiltering) for fortigate and palo alto firewalls and the occasional firmware upgrade. I got offered by a different company for a Information Security Risk Analyst judging by the interviews i had with them it's not a technical role.

My question is would taking the infosec risk analyst role even if it is less technical (get certified for Security+ and other security certs I can get) be a better career move to get into being a Pentester or I continue with my path in network engineering (continue to get CCNP) then move to cybersecurity?"

Last year I completed a bachelor's degree in Computer Networking and managed to get an internship and now part time job at a Cyber Security MSP as T1 Tech Support. Since I've started working at the MSP I began reading different sources of information such as r/sysadmin and also listening to the experience of my seniors at this MSP I realized I have a lot of critical gaps in my knowledge. I don't know what exactly is an Active Directory, typical network topologies for business, basic monitoring tools, scripting, experience with Windows Server, Linux distros and many other things. None of those topics were covered in my University (regarded as the ""best"" university of my country in IT knowledge) nor I was given guidelines of which topics should be covered in a given course (so I could study by my own if I desired). I don't know where to start to fix all the knowledge gaps I have, I did try to self study but most of the time I began a topic, another concept or topic was mentioned of which I had no idea what it was and had to then learn it and go back to the topic where I started meaning it was a mess of self study with no order. By requirements of the MSP I had to certify myself in a Privileged Account Solution which involved a lot of Active Directory and I kind of just brute force my way through the cert, I do know how to handle the software but I'm unsure of how to properly adapt it to an existent Active Directory since I don't know all the repercussions it will have. &amp;#x200B; My goal is to be on a Network Engineer job, I definitely not going to stay on the MSP, I realized I don't like CyberSecurity but at least I want to get 1 year of experience on my resume.

The main question is: should I focus on getting an entry level job in computer networking or getting certs or any other suggestion? If self study is the answer then which topics are ""essential"" for a network engineer and/or for today IT needs? Or at least some good online resources where I can take classes. Which certifications could help me on my career?

What are the things I definitely need to know or the best starting certifications? What software or hardware is going obsolete? trends and such. Advice? My reaction was probably what most other professionals in the field had, too: &gt;You have no idea what you're asking. I got to talk to him and discuss a little bit and it came down to this: \1. If you have no troubleshooting experience then the CompTIA A+ is the first thing to get. It covers the basics for you. It's a foot in the door everywhere you start to go. If you've been in IT for a while, like me, then you likely don't need to do this unless you've been pigeonholed supporting a particular application for too long. It's the foundational principals that matter here. A+ is just the quickest way to get these. \2. After that, or if you already of too much experience to bother with it (like me) pick an area of focus. This will change. Personally I tried to get into cybersecurity but discovered I wasn't cut out for it. Now I'm aiming for a Linux admin type position in the next few years. The point, though, is to aim for something that sounds fun/lucrative, but you will discover that this isn't actually something you're interested in or not cut out for. That's fine and normal. Go with the flow and try for something else. You might need to go through a few things before you really get in to your niche. \3. Get paranoid about your computers. Just trying to avoid all the spyware, junkware, and malware on the web will teach you plenty about how these things work. I have 6 firefox add-ons that I use on every installation, TOR on my personal computer, and have fiddled with things like Qubes on occasion just to see if I can do it. This is for the express purpose of seeing what I can do, what I can do without, and be prepared if I feel the need to get mobile and paranoid fast. Not that I expect it to be necessary, but that I want to be prepared in case it becomes necessary (go Boy Scouts!). This sort of practising paranoia helps me visualize how the bits flow, which bits are necessary and which are not which is useful when thinking about system optimization. It forces me to learn how to practice the principle of least-privilege, which is necessary for any admin. It makes me think about how to bite back when someone wants me to do something because I need to be diplomatic when telling them that what they're asking is impossible for technological, legal, or organizational policy reasons. And so on. These three things will get you going in IT. The goal is to get you the foundational principals, get you pointed in *a* direction so that you *are moving*, and thinking about what how to minimize organization exposure. These are all necessary for anyone in any field of IT. If anyone has anything to add or questions feel free to post here. "

For reference, I have attached a scrubbed version of my [resume](URL I am under the impression that, on paper, I am qualified for many of the jobs I seek. However, in practice, I feel totally underprepared. While I hold all three AWS associate-level certs and graduated at the top of my class in my Software Development &amp; Security program, Ive barely done any of these tasks at an enterprise scale. I can articulate some basic Linux concepts, build a small application using Java, and architect a simple AWS solution using core services, but I cannot sustain a highly-technical whiteboarding interview. I feel like other candidates who recently graduated and had more technical internships under their belts would blow me out of the water, from a technical standpoint. All things considered, this leaves me unsure of where to go from here. Junior SysAdmin? Junior Developer? Junior Cloud Engineer? Cybersecurity Analyst? Business Analyst? Im looking for advice from more senior engineers and hiring managers, providing insight as to whether I would even be an attractive candidate in any of these capacities, or whether I need to keep grinding it out in this current role for a while longer.

Excuse me for the ramble-y post or any mistakes in writing.* Hello everyone, I'm a nineteen year old ex-sysadmin developer student person. I've always loved anything related to electronics. Computers, DVD players, cars, planes and more were all an inspiration to me when I was young. Now that I've completed sysadmin school and am currently in university of applied sciences (HBO, first year), I have noticed that when I'm building servers or software, I get irritated pretty quickly. I continue to weigh benefits/downsides, never being satisfied, really. I'm a theory-first kind of person, annoyed by practical restrictions. I'm a guy who has always loved learning about systems, screwing around with them to see what's possible. I'm able to professionally take requirements, make decisions and build an IT-related project. The issue is that after I worked at a business after my 3 yr. sysadmin study I noticed that I hated constantly bumping against ceilings when building things. This made me want to go to development instead of system administration, but I now notice I again get that same feeling. My brain is now trying to push me to offensive cybersecurity (this is possible within my broad study), since this has more to do with 'breaking down' then building. Which I essentially also have done since I was 7 or so. I'm thinking there is an underlying issue here and I'm guessing that cybersecurity will again bring up that frustration. I'm having a hard time deciding what area of IT to continue in and I'm constantly wondering if that frustration will ever fade. TLDR; practicalities are frustrating me, not sure what to do now. Wondering what kind of study/job would fit me best. Do you guys have any tips for me? Any help is greatly appreciated."

I would love to be done with school (slowest and most expensive way to learn), but if a masters would significantly help me, Ill find a way * And if a masters would be helpful, what type of masters? Should I just try to find the cheapest and fastest program I can to knock it out of the way and keep my experience growing, or should I take the time and put in the effort to try to go to a top school and deal with the loans? * Or, is all this thinking too far ahead, and I should just stick with my home lab for now?"

That being said, I'm unsure as to where I want to go from here. My long-term career goal is to go into security consulting. I love the strategy aspect of cybersecurity and to me that's the main reason why I want to go into it. I also find that the technologies and concepts come to me very easily. I'm currently studying for the CompTIA Security+ (501) exam using TestOut to help me prepare for it, on top of a networking class I'm enrolled in at my school. I'm looking at IT rotational programs, systems administration roles (although so many of them ask for LOTS of experience) and IT internships in security. I don't know if I should look at help desk since I'm not savvy and skilled with hardware (although I am taking a class called Digital Hardware, which is basically help desk 101).

Help desk or something like Geek Squad seems to be a natural progression, but I am open to other suggestions.

Right now, due to financial constraints, Im thinking of just PC building alongside studying for my A+ and playing around with my home network, but any suggestions are welcome so as to have a fun checklist for the future. 3). For someone who likes to work with their hands, what fields or jobs would you recommend down the line?  If it helps, the areas that currently pique my interest are cybersecurity and database administration, but nothing is set in stone and can easily change with the more experience/advice I obtain."

Due to poor networking &amp; social skills, I couldn't score an internship by the time I graduated. \- When I finally did score engineering jobs, the ones I got were mostly in construction drafting. Due to a combination of office politics and lack of mentorship, I was let go from all 3 of them (yes, you read that right). \- Around March 2018, I decided that I no longer wish to be in the field of engineering. I decided to make my passion into a career and become a graphic designer. However, the only work I was able to get were in unstable startups with temperamental bosses. Suffice to say, I was let go from 2 of them. &amp;#x200B; I should note that none of these jobs have lasted for more than 3 months. It's now March 2019 and I've recently scored a job at a local print shop. Pay is subpar, but is enough for me to scrap by.

I dont hold any certs at the moment so I figure I should take on any new opportunities that come. Is it a good idea to start at EY?"

I work a rotating schedule, and with a wife and kids, that is getting to be something I don't want to do forever, even though the pay and benefits are good. With that said, I have CCNA and Sec+ certs that I got because IT (and software dev) is a hobby, and I was bored. I'm decent in python, and have used the usual web languages (html, css, js), sql, C, and C++ in personal projects over the years, so I'm not a complete moron. I've been using Linux for over 10 years (all sorts of distros). I have a decent sized home lab with Cisco hardware, raspberry pis, and legit servers with VMs running stuff I use daily. I plan on getting an RHCSA and maybe an OSCP by the end of the year. The RHCSA shouldn't be too bad for me. I'm familiar with a lot of the stuff in the OSCP, and have used some of it, but that will be harder, I think. I know I'll probably take a pay cut if I switch careers, but I'm wondering where I should aim to get my salary back up as quickly as possible. Should I shoot for an IT gig? Or should I leet code all day and try to land a software FAANG gig? I think I'd prefer to stay in IT vs. software. And I'd really love a cybersecurity job. Devops doesn't sound bad. But, I don't have the job experience to land one of those out of the gate, I think. I'm currently in a MCOL area, but I'd be open to relocating wherever. Any thoughts, ideas? "

I already know this isn't a true, ""Computer Science"" degree, its basically Information Technology. With that being said, I have a few questions... Any CS individuals, have you ever come across an IT person working in the same area as you at work? What can you do in the CS field with an IT degree, since IT isn't full blown CS? Another question is, the major im doing is from a highly noticeable research university. Top 50 overall in the US. There are two ways to get this degree. You can either enroll in the main university (28-32 ACT score) plus $60k tuition a year or you can enroll in the ""part-time division"" of the school. SAME DEGREE, SAME MAJOR CLASSES, just social science, humanities, math requirements. The Partime division is what I can afford (no way the same cost as the regular university) but will employers shy away bc my degree would say B.S. Applied computing from X University from X school because it wouldn't have B.S. Applied University from Main entrance to university school... Also, what minor would be best with this degree? Business Studies? Management? Accounting? Finance? Thanks!"

I do support, such as imaging machines, installing new workstations, configuring/domaining and various troubleshooting. I also do light administration for one network, such as maintaining active directory, recently set up WDS for pushing new installs, etc. Finally, I also deal with some networking, mainly sorting out heavy port security on a managed switch when I install a new machine. I deal with several VLANs with their own functions. This job pays really well, but I know I have a mandatory move coming up (location TBD) and I really need to pinpoint what I want to specialize in. &amp;#x200B; I have a degree in Cybersecurity, A+ and Sec+. Trying to map out my next certification. In my mind, I have two options that really interest me. System administration is interesting, and I'm scrapping together some parts to make a VM box to play around with at home. I know I've only scratched the basic of sysadmin while dealing with the domain controller, file servers, print servers, WDS, etc, but I am always learning more. &amp;#x200B; Second option I'm leaning (more heavily) towards is Networking. Managing the Cisco switches has been quite fun so far. Most of it has been self taught as well. Prime example: new PC install, domain it, clear port sec, get err-disable. Find out WHY! Learning all of the different commands, troubleshooting various issues, and resolving said issues really interests me. &amp;#x200B; So, how to proceed? I either want to study up for MCSA Server 16 (and push to MCSE Core Infrastructure) OR go for CCNA R&amp;S and beyond. For those in Sysadmin and Networking positions, what do you do on a day to day basis and what do you suggest to expand my knowledge? &amp;#x200B; Thanks!"

I was very fortunate that I was able to afford college thanks to my parents, so I didn't need to work through college. Not to say that I didn't try though. I sent in applications through my B.A. and A.A. years for desktop support, and couldn't seem to get hired, so I re-worked my resume, and applied for more jobs in desktop support, and I still have nothing to show for it.

My question is, if my area is so limited that the only entry level IT work is with temp contracting companies, but I'm too old to afford such a lifestyle, should I focus on something else? It seems with IT right now, either you are a sys admin training for Dev Ops work, or you are coming out of college with the proper degree to settle in a middle ground IT or Cybersecurity work. I do not see entry level any longer. (Going back to college isn't an option either as I will not be given anymore funding for a second degree without taking out more loans than my career path can pay back.) I could invest more in certs as I have been studying for many of them, but if there are no openings around asking for them outside of low pay temp jobs, then I worry about the mess I'm about to get myself mixed up in.

I only apply to or work with recruiters on contract roles with 1099/C2C payment terms.

I am going to be starting a Bachelors degree program in Cybersecurity starting Jan. I currently have an Associates in Electrical Engineering Tech. My current roll has me working on some Telecommunications equipment. I work with modems that my company uses to communicate with our SCADA group and controllers out in the field. If modems arent communicating they get sent back to me and I log in and see that settings are correct and that features are set properly. Only very specific telecom and engineers have the credentials for this work. I also work on Cisco grid routers in a similar fashion. The CGRs require a bit of Triage on my end and then I either order replacement components, swap them out and get them activated; or I log in and work on them with terminal software and see if its software related. I am technically a Technician not in IT. Could I use this experience as something IT related in case I apply for work elsewhere. Would future employers value what I do now? Or would they really push for someone with a broader knowledge and with an IT title. My goal is to stay with my current company and get into a different department more closely related to what I want to do. "

I've done some research in the field and it's about as broad as the ocean and as deep as it, too. I kind of see myself doing more technical stuff as my background is kind of technical. I've also done quite a bit of research into Application Security and that seems to potentially be a good fit with my SE background. * ""Where do you see yourself being in X years?"" * I really want to end up in a management position I think. I'm still early in my career(like, super early) so only time will tell and experience will help me decide that but for now I would like to end up in a Director or manager position eventually. * ""Do you see yourself more technical or policy-making/management?"" * Again, I'm not exactly sure as I am still early in my career anyway.

I reenlisted in the USAF for another four years, mostly because I didn't have a plan to get out. But I'm willing and ready to leave my military career behind and move to the Pacific Northwest, and live my life out with my SO and family as civilians. My military job requires a clearance (TS) but my AFSC is not in IT. I'm interested in jumping in, I've headed to EdX and am working through some cybersecurity classes seeking professional certificates. Soon I'll be getting into coding and hoping to get into earning professional certifications (Security+, etc.). I'm considering Palace Fronting into the ANG to get into a cyber job for experience, but my brother has convinced me to rethink my choice (mostly, telling me not to be afraid to pay for health insurance, and that certs are more important than dedicating another enlistment when I'd rather get out, even if it's part time, and that I can easily make a living without the military coddling me). I would rather not be a contractor but I suppose if it brings home the bacon and gets me experience, I will. I just want to be able to support my family while my SO goes to school. He gets out six months before I do. I don't have a degree, but I have time to work towards it. Is that something I should do, or should I stick with building up certs? I haven't decided precisely what I want to do, since I'm only now dipping my toes into the water. I can/will do it all to have a life once I leave the military life. I've struggled to figure out what I want to do with my life after the Air Force, but as a linguist, I'm a career student, so I know I have the capability to learn. I just have to figure my shit out and make a plan. I also have the capital to go to school while I'm in as well as gather up certs until I get out. I do have the CompTIA IT cert flowchart, I've read through some other posts with some advice, but a lot of them ask how to get a clearance, etc. I just want to put my energy where it matters most since I'm unable to take on internships for the time being. TL;DR: Military service (10 years by the time I get out), TS clearance (though I would prefer private sector vice government/contracting), willing to get certs and/or a degree. What will make me the most marketable when I get out? Should I stick with the CompTIA flowchart and just build up those certifications? Should I also be getting a degree? What online degree programs are the most robust (though I am already working through EdX for certifications and will be heading to the base Education Center to test for other IT certs such as Security+)? TYIA for all of the help. I'm sure you can tell, but I'm a planner. I just need to make one so I can feel comfortable moving on with my life. Working toward something while I'm serving is the best option, I think any vet would agree. Thanks again!"

It is fine. I don't mind it at all, but I was really hoping I could break into the cyber security field. I have tried to convince employers to ""give me a shot"" but they claimed I was ""too valuable in my current position"" and have tried (obviously) and have continued to try to apply directly or through recruiters/agencies to open cyber security positions. As I move on my current path it is (or IS IT?) financially impossible to take a step back to just get my foot in the door. I really love cyber security and work on things at home all the time (reading, videos, online mini classes, etc..) just because I enjoy it. But maybe it is just a ""hobby""? I understand follow your dreams, but at some point my dream of being a baseball player died too... I am fine with that. Sometime's dreams are just dreams. I am 40 yrs old. 2 kids. One wife. Should I be thankful for my current job and push forward there (which I am fine with) or continue to strive and stress over getting into a field that I have no experience (or certs - of which I used to have one but it expired)? Forensics, Incident Response and Malware Analysis interest me the most (for what it's worth) BUT honestly it is ALL fascinating and I would be so excited to get into any area. If you think I should keep on keeping on, what should I do? Find a way to take and pass cert exams? Are there part time (evening) ""internships"" that would allow me to keep my full time job and possibly sanity while getting on the job training?

1179,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,Questions on breaking into IT and networking:,1,9pew6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/9pew6b/questions_on_breaking_into_it_and_networking/,2018-10-19 11:31:51,"Sorry for the paragraphs of text but I thought my situation would be better understood that way. So I'm making a career shift into IT from something totally unrelated, which was more of a humanities/political science field. But I've found I really do have more of an interest, passion, and skill in this field. And when I was younger I was still into it, and got a minor in IT/cybersecurity topics, and learned some coding that I mostly forgot. So I'm not just completely coming out of nowhere. That being said, I realized even though I knew a variety of topics and could handle my own computer okay, I was behind others as far as basic computer/IT knowledge in many ways. At first I wanted to take a school class but then decided to just take a cert course. I ended up going for my CCNA having zero IT experience and barely any knowledge, but somehow passed the tests on my first attempt and got the cert after a few months. I came to realize I really did like networking a lot and saw a future in this, even though I kind of fell into it. I still felt a bit weird though, as if I had jumped to a higher level without having basic foundation or prereqs, since the guys selling me the course said A+ is for people who don't know what computers are (quite an exaggeration), and told me to go for this. After getting my CCNA, I applied to tons of places and didn't get so much as one response back. The weird thing is, after updating my resume to make the CCNA the focus of it and detailing the various LAN/WAN techs and protocols I learned from the course, and adding that resume to places like Indeed, I started getting several emails a week from organizations saying they needed network engineers, in many cases ""senior"" engineers, which didn't make sense. For one, almost all the job description requirements listed familiarity with or knowledge of some other random technology in addition to the material on the actual cert, which I didn't have, or said you needed 2-3-5 years of experience at least. I don't get why I'm being contacted for senior positions when all I have is a CCNA; isn't that like CCIE or CCNP? Also, I thought, screw it, I'll just apply to some of these anyway and see what happens, I mean they contacted me... turns out not one of them ever got back to me after that, even though they seemed so interested initially. I get the feeling these recruiters just quickly skim over the headline or top of my resume and saw CCNA and networking protocols and assume I must be experienced in that, not realizing until later (after I show interest) when they actually look at the resume in more depth, that I have zero IT experience, at which point they probably think... ""whoops, our bad, nvm. best of luck though buddy."" I tried applying to more lower or entry level networking, data center, NOC type jobs but have had no luck in getting any interviews. Furthermore all the temp agencies I tried with either flat out ignored me or in some cases showed interest and then ignored all my subsequent emails. I will admit I live in an area where IT is big, around northern Virginia. I thought that would be an advantage at first but now I think maybe all the good people come here (lots of competition) and a beginner trying to break into the industry would have more luck in some little rural town at first. I've been getting mixed advice on what to do: my one friend who is the head of networking and IT at a news station says he worked his way up from the bottom with no college, started at help desk (which he hated and recommends for me to completely avoid if possible). He said to try going straight into networking or even try being an independent consultant/contractor.... how can I be a confident consultant with no experience?? Others say you should maybe consider help desk jobs just to get some preliminary experience. I decided to get my A+ even though some said to not worry about it. Mostly for the actual knowledge, to feel better about my own IT foundation, than the actual use it may/may not have. I've gotten the first part, 901, and am trying for the second soon. It's a very broad but shallow test. I did do a decent amount of hands on work in my own home lab with Cisco equipment, and assembled a PC, helped family with various problems, and did a bunch of other things messing around with Windows and Linux. But how does that translate into getting a job... I want to volunteer at the Red Cross in this capacity at first but even there you're screened and there's competition haha."

I've been around computers my whole life, enough to be able to perform a service desk IT job relatively decently. Obviously I have no training or certificates, this is just a ""hobby"". That being said, I have close friends high up in the IT world (Directors/Managers/etc) telling me that if I get a few Cybersecurity certificates they can find me a job right away that would pay almost double my current salary at entry level and put me on a path to success. It sounds good, the problem is.. I don't know if its for me? I've looked into it and while some parts of Cybersecurty sound awesome, others seem to be an IT support type of role helping companies with their firewalls/etc. Could someone provide some more insight? Lastly, I'd point out that I am not passionate about any particular job. I just want a job I can do without hating, that pays well and allows me to life comfortably and provide for a family one day. My current field is extremely limited unless I move out cross country, whereas Cybersecurity it sounds like I could work from anywhere. Is it as easy as my friends say? Just a few certificates and hook ups? What other things should I consider? Any and all advice is welcome."

This is not a tier-1 analyst role, it is a high-profile client-facing role, but the compensation is low compared to average entry-level analyst roles per Glassdoor and Payscale, but similar to the low end. &amp;#x200B; I expected that there was going to be a more impressive offer, considering the value I provide, the nature of the role, the geographic costs in the area, and that I could probably expect a similar offer if I were to select an analyst role. &amp;#x200B; I would appreciate any insight into how to consider this offer, given that it is the first offer on the table, for the role I want, but I am expecting other competitive job offers in the next few weeks. How much should I reveal to this potential employer, or the other companies I am interviewing with, about my current status and concerns?

I am currently working a help desk-like job. I've been working it for about 2.5 years now and over that time have secured a Networking Associate's Degree. I will, at some point, be getting a CCNA but don't feel quite prepared for it yet. I didn't want to stop there, so I signed up for a Bachelor's Degree in Cybersecurity. I am likely going to move on to my Master's, but that's up in the air for now. The Bachelor's degree has thus far set me up for the CompTIA A+ cert (I am taking the second portion today, feeling pretty confident about it), and the Network + (likely taking this next week or the week after). I will eventually be getting Security +, Project +, CCSP, SSCP, CIH, ECES, and CIW-WSA. If I decide to take the Master's, I will get the CEH and CHFI. These feel like pretty solid certs, but I wanted to get an opinion on them and see if they are relatively good certs and what kind of job it will land me right out of my Bachelor's with around 3-4 years of help desk experience. In my job, I always focus on my soft and customer service skills. I feel I am gaining more experience in this every day and I am generally doing quite well, as most of our employees are really happy when I come around to help. I am also learning an incredible amount of hardware and software troubleshooting skills, as well as some networking and printer troubleshooting skills. Unfortunately, I do not get much of an opportunity to work on security-related tasks. To make up for this, I have signed up for a couple of Palo Alto Virtual Test Drive webinars. I am trying to get my hands on as much security experience as I can, because I want to feel prepared when I am looking into a job like that. Does it sound like I am doing the right things to set myself up? I am almost 26 and really trying hard to get a well-paying job in a career that I am ambitious towards and that I love doing. I want to be in a security role more than I've wanted anything. Is there anything more I can do? Thank you tons for any advice or guidance!"

Most of my experience is service desk. Little bit of playing with servers (I do mean a little) and Im not horrible with SCCM and PowerShell automation. Looking to stay in infosec, but also wouldnt mind specializing in network or servers before getting dirtier in CyberSecurity. Considering a MS in CyberSecurity. Really looking to see whether itll make any kind of difference at my level or not. "

My only complaint is that I wish i got to code more! &amp;#x200B; My goal is to become a security engineer at one of the big tech companies, and would love any advice on the best way to develop my skillset to move towards that goal.

Also what are some things that I can do on the side / learn to make myself more qualified / marketable to becoming a security engineer? Thanks in advance!!!"

I want to enter high-level IT Management within the next 5-10 years, so it's also another reason why I'm interested in this masters program specifically. I intended to study for the A+ and then continue on with Network+ and then Security+ to compliment the Masters program because the program is primarily executive level training, with only a few technical parts on cybersec. The program itself is only a year long, beginning in May of 2019 and ending in May of 2020. So .. as you can see, I'm in a bit of a tough spot, but I'm open to any comments and suggestions! "

I am starting to see that I have been pigeonholed in this position in now and now I am wanting to make a move that would put me a better situation the next time I interview for something like this. Right now I am taking classes for there A.S. in C.S. but I am wondering if I should stop and just focus on taking certs because I already have a degree in a non-IT related field or just continue on with trying to obtain the associate degree. Another question is are there any job skills or things that I am doing through the LMS that I can transition to a different field in IT that I am currently I am fairly new to the IT field and I want to make this my career but I am just not sure what I should do next to start moving up and as always try to make a better living. I would appreciate any and all critiquing.

I'm pending acceptance into WGU and looking to get my degree while working full-time. Looking at both of these degree plans, and the certs and courses that come included, combined with the knowledge I have about the industry (Your degree does not determine your job) I'm looking to gather some general advice from those of you currently in the field. About me: 26/M working helpdesk for a MSP at an academic institution. Have about 6mo. of professional experience, and a little on the side tinkering around with dumb stuff over the years, and built 2 PC's. Currently, I'm set to enroll in the BSIT:CSIA pending evaluation. I have the A+ cert, and am studying for the Security+. End-game? I'm looking into security. What I'm really wondering, is how should I approach the early/mid-game? Would taking the networking route give me better short-term prospects through the CCNA/CCNP, etc. versus the ISC2 CSSP Associate and the like? I'm not expecting to jump into a security role even straight out of school with a degree, and even with another year of helpdesk exp. But I'd like my knowledge to be as functional as possible, while increasing my pay to a level in which I'm not concerned if i'll make it in case of a small emergency.

For background: I completed an A.S. in Computer Information Systems with a college certificate (one-year program) in Cybersecurity. I then relocated to a different state. I enrolled in the local university in my new area, but they wont accept most of my transfer credits to fulfill degree requirements. Most of the classes Ill need to re-take as a result are not available online.

I love the field (cybersecurity), I applied for a couple SOC analyst positions in the past and just got 1 interview where they destroyed me. It was a L1 SOC Analyst position, yet they were asking me questions regarding automation with Python and other languages. It was pretty advanced for me (this was a year ago). I am now more comfortable as I am a sr. support engineer for a cyber sec company where I get to work with Powershell scripting, SQL, APIs, SSH etc. However, I am still having a lot of trouble getting into a InfoSec Analyst job -- I don't get any calls. Here is the funny thing, I currently have a BS in Information Systems, MBA with a minor in Project Management, Sec+, Splunk Cert, another old sysadmin cert, one more IBM cert and taking a SSCP cert next month before the test changes again. Also, 7 years of experience in IT and I currently make a bit more than a L1 SOC analyst so I am debating whether or not I should take that path. What I know is that I desperately want to be out of support. I have what it takes for a SysAdmin/Application Support role but I love cyber security. Having said this, how did you go into the field?

After years of drifting aimlessly through depression after high school, in 2015 at the age of 23 I enrolled in my local community college's Applied Associate Degree in Cybersecurity program. Prior to this, I had about a decade of self-taught IT knowledge, but nothing that would be enough to get me a job. The community college's program was an NSA/DHS Center for Academic Excellence, but while it gave me a lot of good thousand-foot-level information, none of it would be useful in a practical job experience. For that reason, after getting the degree in 2017, I've now transferred to a Bachelor of Applied Science in Cybersecurity program at a university. I should note that I have no relevant job experience at all at the moment, but I'm looking into IT help desks, as is frequently recommended on this subreddit. I also got my CompTIA Security+ earlier this year, but without any experience I don't know what to do with it. I feel like I'm simultaneously overqualified and underqualified for a lot of positions. What would you recommend as my best focus while in school? I'm trying to find part time work at a help desk, but many of the positions are full time. I would also like to get an internship next year. My goal is to be able to move my way up through administration and into security. I realize security is not an entry level position, which is why I want to get a head start on experience right now. Any advice is greatly appreciated."

1234,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,Advice to new IT Professionals,94,9bja81,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/9bja81/advice_to_new_it_professionals/,2018-08-30 22:42:40,"Ive been noticing a trend on questions lately and figured I would start a discussion. People seem to come here and ask a variation of can I make it without -insert problem area-. The answer is almost always yes, but itll be harder. If you must question something, or ask yourself if its possible, its likely going to be an issue. To get a job in IT or to advance in IT, youre going to need a combination of experience, education or certifications. Now, how can you get experience without a job? Thats difficult sometimes. If youre in university, internships or hiring programs sponsored by your college are the way to go. If you are outside of college or coming to this later in life, it becomes more difficult. There are opportunities to volunteer for organizations or even some short-term contracting work, but its hard for most people to do this. This is because from what I noticed by the time some people think about switching into IT they already have family and financial responsibilities. So its a matter of trying to find entry-level jobs that will accept you without experience. MSPs, and Small businesses are more likely to take a chance on you if you're able to talk the language. They do have downsides though, as these places are usually filled with stress and people that were taught bad habits and so pass them onto other people. Education. It should be simple, but its something that is asked several times a day. It boils down to this, yes, you should have it. The minimum people should shoot for is a bachelors preferably in Computer Science or Information Technology. While a cybersecurity, networking, and database degree will be accepted its just not looked as favorably as Computer Science. This is because the degree paths of the specialty degrees are too new, and not standardized across colleges, and that means its harder to vet what you know. Anything less than a bachelors, its going to make your career more difficult. It shouldnt matter, but it does, and youre going to have to fight against people that went to college and just have the mindset that it makes you a better candidate. Rather than struggle, its easier just to accept the fact and get a degree from a respected university. Certifications. This is a hot topic here. Generally, what I notice is that people ask What certification should I get to get started/advance in IT. The response is usually A+, Network+, Security+, or even more randomly CCNA. Certifications can be useful, but without experience, its just a piece of paper. More so, because if certifications are being recommended they need to match what career path a person is following. If somebody wants to be a Systems Administrator, a CCNA is less useful, instead focus on RHEL or Microsoft certifications if somebody wants to go that route. Each specialty has its own certifications that are valued, but the answer is rarely CompTIA or CCNA. CCNA is only useful if youre looking to go into big enterprise networking, and then the minimum you should have is a CCNP R&amp;S. I say this because most smaller organizations do not pay for the cost of running a Cisco stack, and rather than spend a lot of hours studying something that youll never use, spend it on something that directly relates to what you want to do. To flip this topic. What are some trends that you all have noticed? Do any of you have any advice that you can give people? Feel free to even call me out on some of these points as I welcome a discussion on these topics. "

Cloud technology and Cybersecurity appeals to me the most as I find the concepts interesting. It's just that I don't know much about it. My options are essentially to start from scratch and obtain certs while working a helpdesk job and move up which would take some time following by enrolling in an MSIS program and hope that the degree will teach me enough to get me a decent (if entry-level) job in IT Security.

I'm currently in school going for a B.S in Cybersecurity and I have a little over a year left. I am in the Army National guard as a 25b(Information Technology Specialist) so I have a security clearance. I also have my security+ certification. About 4 months ago they fired the Systems/Network Admin and decided they weren't going to re hire and they were going to see how well I could handle holding both roles. So far everything has been going great and while I'm not an expert in any particular thing yet I have been able to manage all of the fires that have started and I seem to be able to manage dealing with both jobs. SO my true question is when should I start either asking for a raise(The Admin before made 3x what I do) or looking for another position. I'll add the systems I'm currently working with for a reference. AD Management Cisco VOIP Phones(CUCM, ect) Palo Alto Firewall(Very basic policy management but we were able to migrate our old firewall to a new one) O365 Email Management Managing our DELL Equalogic SAN( Replaced bad controllers/hard drives that have had errors for a long time) Managing VMWare esx hosts All helpdesks task(Managing tickets for around 120 users) I'm sure there is more i'm not thinking about.

1262,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,WGU Cybersecurity Degree: My Thoughts,3,92guds,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/92guds/wgu_cybersecurity_degree_my_thoughts/,2018-07-28 08:04:45,"Hi all, \*(This post is my personal opinion, but might turn into a good source for prospective students to this school to consider, as well as informing those unfamiliar with the school or degree program. This is a long post. Please feel free to comment and disagree/agree.\* I have noticed a lot of talk on a lot of forms about the semi-new WGU Cybersecurity/Information Assurance degree program (bachelors). I suspect this is partially attributed to recent cyber events popping up in the news more and more, as well as the increased marketing budget for WGU (I see ads on TV all the time now). After reading a couple of articles on the program and reading through some posts, I decided to see what the fuss was about. I have been in the industry for some time now and in the past have noticed IT specific degrees tend to help people, all things being equal. Now, obviously there are plenty of people who make it just fine in this industry without any degree, or perhaps they have a degree in an unrelated field (business, management, etc...). Often these people instead go for certifications and hands on experience, which can definitely beat out a college degree. So in light of all this, I took a look at the program and what was offered and for how much. After looking at the courses, I was decently impressed, though not completely blown away. What did strike my fancy was the combo classes that give you certifications upon completion. From what I understand, the final to test out of the class is successfully passing the associated certification exam. WOW. I have seen dozens of ""cyber"" programs but few that actually give you the ability to get something out of it other than a piece of paper with your name on it. Now to be fair, not all of the certs I saw impressed me. Some of the CIW certs are OK, but nothing to write home about. What is great are the ISC certs and CompTia certs. Yes, those ISC and CompTIa certs are important... for entry level jobs, which leads me to one of my main thoughts on this degree, which is that this will help you land an entry -mid level position in the cyber industry. The most likely position that someone going through this program would get would most likely be an analyst type position, perhaps at a SOC. What I will say about the program is that the certs along with the classes is a big green light to a lot of employers looking for entry level people. I have been a part of many hiring panels and whenever someone in IT comes in (any discipline) with college work focused on their craft AND they have industry certs, they are always near the top of our list (assuming they have decent soft skills, aren't creepy, etc...). Now I want to emphasize a very important point to those who I know will comment saying ""you need experience, you won't get hired without XYZ""... That is true for higher level positions than what this is geared for. This is geared for entry-mid level positions that are designed to take new and raw talent and continue training them. From what I see at least, this program will absolutely get your foot in the door to interview for **most** Security Analyst I or II positions. I would absolutely pick someone with a specialized cyber degree and certs over someone with just certs (**assuming all other criteria are equal**). I would say that this program is actually pretty solid. No program is going to teach you everything you need for that first day on the job. No amount of certifications and home labs will completely prepare you, even for an entry level position. There are just too many factors at play. That is OK. These positions are not meant to start someone who is already a master at IDS, Firewalls, and scripting. Sorry they just are not meant for that. They are meant for people who can learn, show passion for this work, and are self motivated. People who love to research, read, and learn every single day. That is what this field is all about. I know I have gone somewhat off topic here, but it is important for those reading this to know that this program is legit. They do not allow just anyone in, the grad rate for this program is not high due to the difficulty, and a lot of people from what I read end of dropping out because they just can't keep their personal life, work life, and school life in balance. With a poetry degree, they probably could, but not with something as hard as infosec. To wrap up, I want to give you newbies out there my thoughts on what to do if you are absolutely sure this is the field you want to be in. I split it up by category, so see where you fall in. Veterans, feel free to disagree with me and comment below. Lets give these guys lots to think about. 1. This first type of person has no college degree, no certifications. Complete noob to IT, but they know InfoSec is for them. **My Advice:** Attend this program. You get the formal training, all the theory, the hands on work (labs), and best of all, the certifications. Work on your soft skills, technical writing, and communication... by the end you will be ready for your first job. 2. This second type of person already has a degree but not anything IT related. Perhaps they got it in accounting or business (whatever). You also have no certs. **My Advice:** Do this program... really... do it. Yes, getting a second bachelors is not ideal, but I can tell you in my experience, we always look more favorably to the people we interview who have a real IT degree. We have hired plenty without an actual IT degree, but all things equal, we tend to choose the person with the more focused degree. These people tend to understand the theory and business impacts more than those who just got certs. Now I know there are going to be a lot who disagree. I would only suggest this for the WGU model. This is because since you already have a bachelors, you won't have to do any of the gen ed crap, and if you are lucky, had a few classes to knock off some of the IT related courses. I saw a post that one guy was able to transfer in nearly half done. That to me is worth it. Buckle down, knock this program out in one or two terms. The cost is low and thanks to their structure, this is a good deal. If you start talking about going to an expensive state school or something, then no... do not get a second degree. Go for certs instead. 3. This third type of person already works in InfoSec. They may or may not have a degree and some certs. Most likely they do have a mixture of the two. **My Advice:** Don't bother with this program. You are good. Consider perhaps a masters degree (which WGU offers) that will certainly serve you well if you wish to move up to management some day. Other than that, don't bother. All in all, I believe most employers view this school favorably. Not only does it show your passion for the industry, it shows you can work on your own and get shit done. You don't need a pat on the back for good work. You stay up late studying and practicing. You earn it. That is the kind of employee most places are struggling to find in today's society. If you do this program, get the degree, the certs, and as much lab work as possible, I can tell you that you should have no issue finding a job. Remember, you have to interview well and have good soft skills. If you don't have those, no amount of certs or degree will help you. If you are the complete package: degree, certs, soft skills... you will succeed if you try. PS Don't listen to the people who say WGU is not respected or is just another online ripoff school. It is not. They don't allow just anyone in. I saw you had to get certs or have 2-3 years work experience just to be **considered** for enrollment. Ripoff schools don't require you to do that, they just let you, your family, and dog in no problem. Also, do not listen to the people who say a Cyber degree is useless or is just a fad. It absolutely is not a ""fad"" or a gimmick degree. Yes, there are some crap programs out there, but there are some crap programs for any type of degree, from IT all the way to healthcare. You can find crap medical degree programs, but that certainly does not mean they all are crap (if they are, better find a new doctor). This program, these certs, and this school will help you. Is it for everybody, no. If you already work in InfoSec, chances are you won't need to bother. Getting a masters makes more sense for you, mainly if you ever want to move up to management. "

The problem I am facing is that my title is computer specialist, which does not nearly cover what I actually do. I also do not know what job titles I should be looking for to fit what I do on a daily basis because I could be doing anything.

(Not what I was pitched that it was going to be, not happy that it's what I'm doing, but I'm contractually obligated through January.) I've asked for other side work and something more meaty to chew on, but I've been explicitly told no. I was told that the executive's IT needs are too important to allow any distractions of any kind, so I can't pick up any project work or anything like that. **Net result? I fuck around on the internet for at least 6 hours per day waiting for someone to ask for basic IT help.** Tangentially, my fiancee and I have decided to move to New York City next May, as she's secured a full time offer at a big bank (with a healthy salary to boot). So I know I need to leave the company in 9 months, but because of the philosophy of my higher ups, I can't get my hands on anything meaty to bolster my resume. Further, I'm worried about my marketability and my ability to contribute in a financially meaningful way to our household in NYC. I'm worried that right now, the only thing I'm competitive for is more helpdesk stuff, which would return a paupers wage in Manhattan. **But what I can do, is take those 6 hours per day that I'm fucking around on the internet, and do something productive with it.** As long as the executives and their secretaries get their printer drivers reinstalled and their WebEx meetings started on time, I'm free to basically do what I want sitting at my computer. My constraint is that I have a computer with dual 27"" displays, one of which has a privacy screen on it and nobody can see it without it being blatantly obvious to me that they're trying to look. I also can't have any books or anything out, so everything has to be on the computer. Basically, I need to look busy even if I'm not busy. (Perception is everything in/around the executive suite) ----------------------- **Background:** * Navy Veteran - 3 years nuclear power plant operator (submarines), 3 years Communications Intelligence * B.S. Management Information Systems, Standard State Flagship * Currently working for a F50 non-tech company with the title of ""Associate Information Technology Manager"" but functionally, I'm L1 helpdesk for a bunch of millionaires. Side perk is that I do have daily experience interacting with executives (soft skills, yay!). I'll have been here for 1.5 years by the time I leave. * I am a CISSP **Some routes I've thought about:** * Project Manager - maybe, but I'd need to work on certifications, and there's virtually none that don't require relevant experience to get certified. Of which I have none. * Business Analyst/IT consultant - I think this could actually be a good one. I spend all day, every day in front of C-level executives, and people say I network very well. A client facing role is something I think I'd be good at, and I think I can really play up the soft skills from this role to help me get there. I'm not sure what else I should be doing to make myself irresistible though. * Learning to program (better)/ Get involved in data - I've only taken a couple of programming classes and a database class, but I do have 4-6 hours a day, 5 days a week, for the next 9 months to work on it. * Cybersecurity - This could be interesting to me, but I actually don't have a lot of cyber/infosec experience. I passed the test on my first try, and I got my full CISSP (NOT associate) based mostly on the things I did in the intelligence community when I was in the Navy. Other than already having my CISSP, I'd be starting at square 1. Frankly, I don't even know where to begin, or how to best use all my free time. I currently make about $85k in a MCOL city. I have no illusions that I'm going to be able to maintain the same standard of living in NY, but if I can't find something at roughly the same salary, I'm worried about my financial situation, especially with student loans. My fiancee will be an analyst at an investment bank with regular 85-100 weeks, so proximity to her office will be the most important factor in determining where we live. This likely means lower Manhattan, or Brooklyn Heights/Dumbo. **A Note on relationship advice/advice regarding the actual move to NY:** Before we get there, I know people are going to chime in on their opinions on her choice to live in NY and her insistence on living as close to the office as possible, and how it's dumb that she refuses to even consider anything other than Manhattan or Brooklyn. I get it. I've had this fight with her a million times. Basically, I either need to move to new york with her for 2-3 years (Even though I don't want to), or our future is that we don't have a future. I'm choosing my fiancee, so I'm moving to New York. We all make sacrifices to make our relationships work. Mine is that i'll go to New York for a while, and hers is that we're not there for the long haul. The bargain that we struck is that we'll stay in New York for 2-3 years while she completes the analyst program. After that, we'll either a) move to a lower cost of living city for her to get her MBA, b) she'll insist on moving to an office in a lower cost of living city when she becomes an associate c) if neither of those two pan out, we'll move to a lower cost of living city and find new jobs at a slower more relaxed pace. I'd like to keep this post focused on the career aspect, not the relationship/where to live aspect. **I'm here to humbly ask for as many suggestions as possible to point me in a direction that doesn't result in me struggling to survive in NYC.**"

Capgemini or TCS hasn't stated in which position or field I would work but Cap has assured me that it wont be service desk. For both I will be undergoing 6 months training.

I have already chosen the university I will attend, but it offers two different paths relating to the career I would like to have and I am having trouble deciding which would be the better path for me in terms of having a successful career and making a fortunate living. One thing I want to immediately say is that I do not want to program. I am fine with having background knowledge of CS and having a broad understanding about how everything works, but I do not want to code or program. I want to be an analyst/manager. I have done a great amount of research and I'm still a bit stumped on what to do. I plan to get a Masters after my Bachelors, and do it whilst working. I've read to get a bachelor in general IT (which the university offers) and minor in CS (which they offer as well) along with elective classes and joining clubs and such relating to CyberSec. The university then offers a Masters in Cybersecurity, but from what I've seen relating to the coursework, it is mostly programming and cryptography. My university also offers a Bachelor of Business Administration in Information Systems. It has one class in Information Security Management. It also contains elective courses relating to CyberSec. It then offers a Masters of Science in Business/ Information Systems. What would be better to do if I wanted to be an analyst/manager? I would assume the business/IS degree, but am I sacrificing that foundation and understanding of in depth IT and CS? Is that not recommended? Would it be worth more getting the Business/IS degree than the IT/minor in CS degree, or the other way around? If I were to get the bachelor's in IT, I'd start in a help desk. Where would I start with the bachelors in the business/IS? Would I start as an analyst right away, and then, when I would do the masters program relating to that, I would work my way up as a manager and then with years of experience even higher? I would be able to do the bachelors in IT/CS and then do the Masters in Business/IS but I'd have to do an admission test. If not, I'd need four years work experience. The Masters in IS seems like it contains rigorous coursework relating to IS, and I'd assume would allow me to move up to higher, more executive positions in a company. Correct me if I'm wrong. I do not want to code/program. Thank you. "

After that I moved to my current position doing sysadmin work for a motorsports team.

I'm now a one man team taking care of 2 separate teams, everything at our main office, and an offsite office. Some of the stuff the original sysadmin put in place is in place, but for the most part everything has been redesigned or rebuilt by me. My title is still ""technician"" but I'm the only guy doing everything. I love this job, and it's a perfect marriage of interests for me (I don't think I'll ever be able to find another job where I can do both I.T. and pit stops) but working frequent 12-16hr days, traveling 120+ days a year, and being on call on every day off is wearing on me.

The thing is, I don't know where to go next, and there's talk of some turbulence at the company coming up. I feel like I'd be doing myself a disservice if I just took a job at a small-midsized company doing sysadmin work, but that's all I know currently to apply for.

Besides trying to get into the diplomatic service (which is incredibly, incredibly competitive), I'm thinking moving into IT is probably a good bet. I do find it interesting, but I'm not the kind of person who has been obsessed with this stuff since I was 12 years old. My initial interest was in information security because I heard it was a hot field. There are masters degree programs which I could study online (australian degree programs), but in order to qualify for government student loans I would have to be in the country for at least one unit of the degree. also a full time degree load would be probably too much to handle at the moment so then I'd be looking at 3 to 4 years to finish it part time depending on when I return to australia. after doing a bit of research I also read that these 'cybersecurity' programs might not provide me with the all around knowledge that I would need to really excel, and might limit me in terms of job offers. So now I'm thinking that doing an online TAFE course (technical and further education, it's vocational school/community college in the US i guess) would be a cheaper and more sensible option for now to give me some good base skills, and I could do the masters back in Australia if I then decided to pursue that. but there's computer networking, web development, programming, general IT courses. I'm not really sure which is the best option.

For some entrepreneurship can mean something else for them, but for me, entrepreneurship means being able to be an individual that knows who they are both personally and professionally. You see yourself as a brand that has qualities that you posses though you dont want to follow the traditional societal standards. Technology has always been something that I have been passionate about, I can talk about it all day long if I wanted but talking about and doing it are two different things. A few years ago, I felt the urge to start a business or thinking about starting one, I knew it would be in technology but the question was where. Then you would read and hear about in the news about the hacks and data breaches happening in big organizations and that is where I knew where I needed to be. Information Security is a very huge industry in itself I have done my extensive research to figure out which area would I be best suited and where I can be strongly suited. In case you are wondering I have completed a Cybersecurity Management certifcate program based on ISACAs CISM (Certified Information Security Manager) designation at a university in the city that I live in and I am in the process of taking the steps to study for the Project Management designation. My focus is towards the information security risk consulting side assisting businesses with their information security strategy to align with their business initiatives and bridge the communication gap between business management and information security management. Im highly aware of the technical background for information security, though I do know there is also the high need of translating, addressing the risks, the threats in a business to those that are not tech savvy and that they are worried about is it going to hit their bottom line (if they do get attacked it would hit their bottom line anyway depending on the size of the business or project), what is the return of investment if they put x-amount of money into the budget/resources/third-party vendors that will secure their business. The question(s) is has anyone started their own business in Information Security more so in business projects/freelance/consulting/advisory area or thinking about going into doing something like this? If you did start a business, projects/freelance work, how and what did you do to get started especially breaking into this industry? Thanks in advance for your feedback/advice. "

I have a BS IT, a few certs, some old MCSA/MCSE, a current RHCSA/RHCE and expired VCP. My main duties at work are managing a vSphere environment, keeping the lights on the SAN, managing AD/Exchange/Windows/Linux servers in a small-to-medium sized business. Also managing a couple of junior admins/helpdesk guys and reporting to the IT Director. I'm bored out of mind and also hit the salary ceiling in my current role and would like to explore some new directions, namely Information Security/Cybersecurity where I would be interested to be in a Blue team or Cloud administration/engineering/DevOps. Now the problem is that at my current role I just briefly touch on some security aspects, such as IAM and centralized logging, but nothing specifically related to cybersecurity. At the same time, all of our operations are on-prem so I don't have practical work experience with any cloud, though I did play with my home projects on AWS and IBM Bluemix. I do script with bash and powershell and somewhat familiar with Nagios and Ansible. Now I'm not sure what career would be a better option for me.

The problem is, I'm 6 months in, I'm absolutely miserable and its starting to weigh on my relationship and my mental health. I graduated with a Bachelors degree in information systems and I went to work for a Fortune 50. It was one of those deals where they hired you as an IT Manager but you wouldn't know what your exact role was until you showed up on day one. I showed up on day one, and I was supposed to be a manager of the white-glove executives only, super exclusive concierge IT help desk. I was supposed to have 3 direct reports and 11 contractors around the world supporting various executive offices. What ACTUALLY happened is that I became level 1 help desk for executives and their assistants, and it sucks. This is primarily due to my manager being a micromanaging rage-aholic who loses it if I try to do anything myself, and he refuses to hire any technicians for me to actually manage because he thinks me and my coworker can do it ourselves so why spend the money (this results in him working 70 hours a week handling our management responsibilities at other sites/to contractors and such in addition to his own scope.) Like it really sucks: * The hours suck (7-6 5 days a week, no flex time, no wfh even though the rest of the company does at least one day a week) * The people I support are some of the worst people I've ever met and they all treat the help like trash (myself included) * My manager sucks (He's an Army vet and I was able to confirm through some friends that he got out after 9 years because he failed to promote to Major because he micromanaged the shit out of everything and created a hostile climate amongst his troops - this is something that has apparently not changed in the 18 years since he left the Army) * I was recently told that I was in this position for at least 4 years because while most new hires only spend 18-24 months in their assignment, the executives don't like turnover in the roles that support them so this is now a 4-year role. * My one up manager has no interest in how anything is going as long as the C-suite isn't sending her nastygrams. * My manager once told me that if &lt;CEO&gt; walked out of his office and said he was going to get his car washed I should take his keys and do it for him because nothing is more important than his happiness and productivity. * There is no professional development, and there is no clear path for me after this role is over, especially not one outside the support/operations group **Which is not something I'm interested in** In short, I hate my job, I hate the city I live in, I live here alone because I moved for this job, I have no friends here, and I'm just plain old miserable all the time. To make things worse, while I'm sitting here changing mouse batteries and reinstalling print drivers, the people I graduated with are now for the most part either data analysts, business analysts, junior PM's, tech consultants, or cybersecurity analysts. I could have done this job 4 years ago and saved myself half a decade and $60k in student loans and I feel like every day I spend in this role makes me less and less marketable to the types of roles and places I actually have an interest in. I'm 6 months out of school and wondering if I can/should just quit and try to find a new job and then act like this part of my life never happened. Honestly the only thing that keeps me from quitting every morning is that I'd have to pay back my signing bonus ($7k - it would hurt but I could do it) and I don't know if I can find a job 6 months after starting this one. *Edit: A Little about me:* * I'm a military veteran (no more clearance, nor interest in obtaining one) with previous experience in nuclear power and signals intelligence * Internship at a Fortune 50 doing some hybrid PM/BA work * Internship at a Fortune 50 as a Robotic Process Automation Engineer * BS- MIS from a major State University * Currently in the Midwest and I hate it * **I did get my CISSP about a month ago on my own time and my own dollar, in an attempt to make myself more marketable for the day I get to leave this hell-hole** "

I have not been seeking a new position in the 9 months I have been with this company, since they pay quite well and they offer a very generous benefits package. In the past two weeks I have started receiving calls, one directly from a pharmaceutical company and another from a fairly well known technical recruiter to work for a nationally known hospital. Originally I figured ""Ok, I'll just listen to what they have to say."", but the more I have begun to entertain these calls I have been feeling guilty because I genuinely like my current place of work. And now the recruiter for the nationally known hospital said that I meet all the qualifications to be a Senior Cybersecurity Engineer and stated a salary which (unknown to him) is a $35k/year raise for me, and this hospital still offers pensions. I guess this is just more of a rant, but it would be nice to hear from other people who have been in a position where they weren't looking for other jobs but started getting offers that were hard to refuse."

I am looking to make a career change to IT, but I'm not really sure when the right time to make the move would be. I currently work as a sales estimator at a manufacturing place so a 100% unrelated field. However, I have wanted to do this for a few years now so in 2012 I started college. I recently finished up a BS in Computer Networking and Cybersecurity. In a few weeks I'll be taking my Network+ exam and I feel confident I will pass... if not I'll just retake until I do. After that I plan to get right into and completing Security+ as fast as possible. My dillema however is I make pretty good money where I'm at right now... I just hate the job. I have a wife and two kids and all the things that go with that like a mortgage, car payments ect. I wan't to make the change into IT as soon as possible, but I'm worried because many of the entry level jobs simply will not pay the bills for my household. If it were up to me I would quit my job today and go work at any given help desk to immediately start gaining experience, but I just don't have that ability to take that large of a paycut. The absolute bottom dollar I can go for and maintain my bills is about 45 thousand annually. My question is, in order to even make that somewhat remotely imaginable when should I make the jump? Should I start looking after my security+ or would it behoove me to do my CCNA first? I plan to complete a CCNA as well regardless. Like I said I have a steady job right now, so I'm in no means in a rush. If it could take up to 2 more years of preparation, I'm OK with that. I just wan't to put myself in a position of education/certification where its possible to make a salary high enough to sustain. Again, I'm not concerned with any dollar over what it takes to survive because I understand how important experience is. I live in Houston TX and from what I have herd, the IT market here is pretty hot. What would you do in my situation? Continue gathering certs or would you start looking for a job after having a degree, net+, and sec+? Any input would be very helpful. I have been preparing for this jump since like I said, 2012. Its now 2018 and I feel I'm close to the point, but I'm just nervous. I will note, I do understand how 'unimportant' a degree is in IT. Unfortunately I was already about 90 credits in before I got that memo so I figured I would finish it up anyways. That is why I'm pounding certifications now. Live and learn. "

Anyways, ever since February, I've been applying to any job posting I see. The past 3-4 weeks, I've applied to at least 50 internships/full time positions on various job boards like indeed, Glassdoor, and even my own college's job board. Out of those 50 or so applications, I've only gotten one call and the person who interviewed me said they would email me the next week, well, it's been 2 weeks since then and no email has shown up on my inbox. This is what is bringing me down. I've applied to many places and only one responded. I don't want to graduate with no experience and I don't really know where to go from here. I want to enter the IT field (SysAdmin, etc.) but I also want to get into IT auditing, risk management, etc. Is help desk the default starting point for every IT student? Are online applications even worth submitting? Should I just go to a recruiter or staffing agency and let them find me a job/internship/opportunities even if it's bad? I just want some experience. I understand it's probably late to get an internship for this summer (won't stop me from applying), so in case I don't get an internship, what should I do this summer? Try and get any certs? Which ones would make my resume more attractive to land that first internship? Sorry for the long post. I feel very lost at the moment so any help and advise is appreciated."

My question: If I am picking up relevant SysAdmin skills while working ""General IT"", would it be wise to also put in relevant coursework on my resume?

My four-month Cybersecurity internship is coming to an end as of this week and I'll be graduating after this work term! Earlier today, my manager offered me a full-time position at the firm, which is great! But, this is where it gets ugly. Prior to receiving this offer, I accepted a DevOps position with a known retail company. According to my colleagues who work there, it's a great opportunity that I shouldn't pass up. If I were to take the Cybersecurity offer, it would be possible for me to get high-quality training and courses (namely the OSCP and GPEN). Since this is a consulting firm, I'd also have the opportunity to bridge into different fields like Machine Learning, DevOps, and Networking. To top it off, my teammates are highly skilled and I like what my manager has envisioned for the team. Everyone's cool and a pleasure to work with. In regards growth, my manager has given me the go-ahead to apply for a future PenTesting position, which is also something I would be extremely excited about. But, this would also mean burning the bridge with the work arrangement that I have made. The DevOps position gives me the opportunity to rotate positions every 8 months. I'd have the opportunity to get training and would also receive an allowance to pursue some courses. Some of the alumni from my college work there and have said positive things about the place. Additionally, the work arrangement they've provided is quite flexible. I don't know much about the team, but the manager sounds professional based on our phone conversation and he seems to know about networking and development. I'd have the opportunity to get involved with Cybersecurity as well, but I wouldn't have the same access to training as my current place. There are also some pretty cool opportunities to find positions in AR and VR and work with innovative technologies as well. If I accept this position, my current manager said that he'd welcome me back, but I would also have to compete with potential new hires. Should I stay in Cybersecurity and burn the bridge to the other company? Or should I test the waters and see if I would like it in retail? TL;DR - I accepted a DevOps position prior to my internship, but my manager is offering me a full-time opportunity in Cybersecurity."

I did a course for CCNA but did not attempt to write the exam as I got the job in between. The thing is I would like to move to something that is related to cybersecurity(do not have much clarity or if there is much difference between infosec and pentesting). I talked to a senior regarding career advice and he suggested that I do an MS which would help me start afresh with a job from campus interviews. He told me that I needed to strengthen my foundations as I did not do my UG properly. The thing is I do not think I have it in me to complete an MS. The other option that was suggested was to continue testing for another 6 months or so in a much larger company and move to a networking position in the same company whenever an opening presented itself. This way I would not be losing any experience and would also get to transition easily into a basic job in the field of networking. My original idea was to do a couple of certifications and get a basic networking job and do more as and when required to further my career. The thing is that my senior says the certificates wont be valid in 10 years. It may help me land interviews but most ppl will be looking past all this. He says I shouldn't be wasting my money going after something that won't help me in the longterm. I am only an average student but I am willing to learn. I do not really wish to do an MS as I don't think I have it in me to go through the course and do not wish to waste my parent's money and my time which if possible I could have spent better. I have completed my Bachelors in Computer science. I am lost now and do not know how to proceed with the next part of my career. Can someone pls suggest how to go about planning my career from here on?

However, my role is not really client facing. Mostly System Administration. I am also pretty advance in terms of education, and tons of tech experience. I have a PhD in Cybersecurity. Lately, I have been feeling the need to grow. I am 30, but I wouldn't want to be 40 and still staring at screen writing codes and implementing security controls, etc. I feel the need to start looking into Management, and issues that deal with proposals, and how to lead etc. I applied for Deloitte Federal as a Senior Consultant within the Cybersecurity Team in Rosslyn VA, and interview was solid. HR quickly replied after in\-person interview saying initial feedback were amazing, I should hear from him soon. My choice of Deloitte is only because I feel I can learn the business side of Tech, from proposal, managements, clients and all the bureaucracy, and also do the Tech stuff per clients demands etc. Considering eventually, I'll like to be a Chief Officer, Partner etc. rather than a 40/50 year old still writing codes, and implementing security controls. I also applied for other DoD contractors similar to my current employer, and I have been getting calls. Amazon, ManTech, Lockheed, etc. One called to tell me they are desperate and willing to pay up to $130K. Thats a nice bump from my current salary. However, I am skeptical because all these jobs have the same same job description as my current job. Either InfoSec Engineer, System Admin etc. None has anything to do with Technology leadership, business or management. I think I'll keep feeling the need to grow and advance if I go with these options, thus Deloitte. My questions are: 1. I am new to consulting firms, and all the reviews are saying the suck the blood in you. However, the little reviews about the Federal side of Deloitte says its pretty chill. I mean they don't even care about MBA, the are just looking for Tech guys, with little management/business experience. 2. Regarding pay. Is it possible Deloitte would match or offer more than $130K? I am open to taking a pay cut. But I just want to know. Also, does Deloitte help students pay off students loans. 3. What would you do if you were in my shoes? 4. And as a Senior Consultant what should I expect in terms of signing bonus, annually increase, 401K, annual bonus, powerful laptop etc. do all these need to be negotiated or it is by default. I would really love a nice signing bonus. 5. I am a bit introverted, I am open to socializing, and can hold a conversation, but it just drains my energy. Would this go with working for Deloitte? I am actually willing to learn how to work on this, nothing against being introverted. But I really want to be a leader. 6. Please add anything you think its worth knowing that I missed. Thanks a lot."

Furthermore, I just finished my A+ and am currently working on my ccent/ccna. I was able to land a job at a decently sized ISP, as a field technician/ fiber splicer. The issue is that upon my first few weeks it has become pretty clear that company doesn't give a shit about it field techs, low pay, low raises and mandatory leave at the end of the day. I've talked to a few IT pros, mostly sys admins, guys in the NOC. And from what I've been told certs are more profitable than say a 4yr. My original plan was to just earn certs net+,s+,Linux+, ec council stuff, while working as a tech and then slowly jump into the IT/ cybersecurity field, but I just don't know right now. Since my degree was more like a trades program and I used a lot of dual-credit classes for the generals, so none of them to my knowledge will transfer to a 4yr program. The good thing is that my dad works for the college I graduated from and they just recently made it so partimers and their families get free tuition. Any advice will be tremendously appreciated. "

Not sure how long it will be. I'm finding that doing part time internships while taking 5 classes is really burning me out in college. I work around 20 hours a week at internships and my grades are kinda suffering. (around 3.2 gpa). Will my GPA really matter if I have 2 internships already under my belt when I graduate? Right now from what I read, unless my GPA drops massively (to below 3.0), any internship experience is way more valuable. Is this true? Would 2 internships be enough to be ready after I graduate? How long do they have to be? Right now I'm just doing mostly help desk internships. I'm not sure what I want to specialize in but I was thinking System Administrator or Cybersecurity (more leaning towards Sysadmin). I also have a Comptia A+ cert and I was thinking of studying for Network+. I've put it off for now but I'm planning at studying the same time I take the Network class at my college, which I felt made sense to study both at the same time since they overlap a lot. Should I be trying to make more time for other certs by the time I graduate? Lastly, I'm planning on building my own homelab (in a few months due to space constraints). Just how much does a homelab matter on your resume? I wanted to build one thats actually useful (NAS storage) and for Virtualization practice. "

Minors included are Data Science, Software Engineering, Computer Science, IT for Business, Digital Humanities, Games Design and Cybersecurity. I am able to double major, extended major, one major or do a major with either one minor or two minors. As you can see, there's a lot of options. It's a bit overwhelming.

This fall I will start in an online degree program either in, Information Technology at ASU(emphasis in cyber security), Computer Networks and Cybersecurity at UMUC or Computer Science at UMUC or CS at a local brick and mortar university. I will take some advice on those as well. I will make this quick. 1. I do not have an IT degree but have an AAS in Electronics. 2. I have Windows experience in IP settings and setting up networks for office and home use. I recently created my own home network with Unifi equipment and I'm constantly tweeking my setup based on new things I learn. Knowing what gateway numbers, IP numbers, etc. That's all daily stuff to me now. 3. I have command line experience, VI editor experience, network config in Linux OS(Suse and Helios) and Linux based servers, and I've started to learn Python and C++ but just beginning. 4. I install and do maintenance on servers for diagnostic imaging storage and we also have a setup for VMware which give our customers the benefit of having several stations for viewing scan results. 5. When I was with a previous company I setup laptops for remote communication to a central web server that compiled weather data. Windows based and all over FTP to keep a tight leash on what traffic was allowed on DoD networks. We did everything from setting up static IP, firewall exemptions, and naming conventions to meet network standards. 6. I also have extensive experience with creating ethernet cable and fiber optic channel bank interface management. 7. In addition to the IT experience, I have plenty of personnel managment and project managment experience under my belt. What job should I be looking for while completing my degree. I want to end up in cyber security and maybe one day writing code for better traffic encryption. That just seems sexy to me in terms of cyber security but I've only read about that and not how to get there. I honestly will take all the help I can get. Sorry if it's scattered or poorly worded. "

I am 31 years old and I have spent my entire 6 year IT career in cybersecurity. I have an academic cybersecurity Masters degree and am a current CISSP. Yet I want to give it all up. My passion is gone, my brain is fogged, I have no faith in my ability to do the job. My interest in computers has completely faded, I no longer have any confidence in my technical aptitude. I look at technical news articles and find myself not interested, or on many occasions just not understanding the content. Some of my colleagues at work get very excited over technical details and implementations that I honestly couldn't care less about. In short, I feel completely burned out and need a change. I am definitely in the wrong job at the moment (not going to say precisely what I do) but I'm now starting to think I'm in the wrong *career* as well. I think about what a promotion in my current field would look like - and realise I don't want a promoted post in cybersecurity. I look at 99% of cybersecurity job descriptions - and few of them truly grab me. Is it lucrative? It can be - so long as you're in the US, or have some high level management position in London. But is it worth it? Potentially no. Not if you genuinely hate it and don't feel like you have the aptitude, not to mention that will preclude you from the big bucks in any case. My big overriding concern is that security has become just another passing IT bandwagon. We've had software engineering; we've had ""The Cloud""; we've had ""DevOps""; we've got analytics and Big Data; we also have security. People keep telling me ""But we need cybersecurity people and there will be 1.8m open cybersecurity jobs by 2020"" and all that fluff. Well, again, not worth it if you don't want to do the work. If they were recruiting 1.8m midwives or teachers, I wouldn't rush out to do that either. With the bandwagon effect combined with academic security courses and random certs popping up everywhere like Japanese Knotweed, then the circling LinkedIn recruiter sharks, it just sounds like these ""1.8m jobs"" are just going to end up hiring monkeys and eventually paying peanuts. Lucrative? Maybe not after all. Once those bandwagons roll on, what's next? Out of all the CS graduates I know, hardly any of them still work in technical IT of any kind. Many of them have moved on - they now work as product managers, business consultants, propositions managers, marketing, sales... These people are much smarter and more educated than me. They were more successful in their IT careers than I currently am. Not only that, these people have absolute glittering prospects, much more variety in their work, and promotion is a simple matter of turning up on time and being able to spell your own name. They can also change jobs and do something completely different *yet again* at the drop of a hat. In IT, I don't feel like I can. I feel typecast in my current role and the aforementioned LinkedIn sharks assume that's *all* I want to do in life, or am even capable of. That's a horrible position to be in. I was on a major UK graduate programme with others who held roles such as legal, marketing, etc. and guess what? Only those doing technical IT work have suffered. Everyone else is banging on the CEO's door and got more promotions than hot dinners. This has led me feeling very resentful and left behind. So, three questions really: 1) Is this normal and can you empathise? 2) Ever experienced this before and how did you deal with it? 3) Know anyone else who has been in this situation? I am horribly burned out and was really looking for any kind of advice."

The college offers other majors such as database management, gaming &amp; application deve, Computer Information Sys and Network Technologies.

I didn't make it from scratch but I understand a lot about SQL. I was logging into RDP's and configuring IIS/APACHE, it interested me like a hobby... a hobby that made money. I had also dug into some other computer fun being SQL injection to understand how SQL worked. Also running Linux on a device but still can't figure how to download programs from the CMD. I'm a problem solver, and an entrepreneur at the same time. I also have legal interests, so Cyber Security had sparked too.

I got my BS in MIS and thereafter I was offered a Help Desk job a this company thus I took the job in hopes of moving up with in the company. But it seems like the company is not doing so well and the environment sucks. I feel like I'm sucks working in the Service Center making me fell quite frustrated/depressed. I have been applying to other places but it seems like no one want to hire me. The other thing is that mostly 90% percent of the jobs (Help desk and associate infrastructure positions) i came across are asking for 3-5 years of experience. I wonder having 2 and half way of experience might be keeping me from getting an interview or there is something that I'm missing? I hate the feeling of not be able to do anything or learn. The place I live around is pretty non-urban area thus colleges or university don't offer IT Cert program. Certs: I have been researching for CCNA/networking related classes/certs in person or online, but I haven't found any classes near me. I did find a bunch of online courses that says you can pass the CCNA cert after taking the course but I'm not sure since the reviews are hard to find from people who went through the course or don't have any review. So far I'm almost done with my MicroMasters program in CyberSecurity online from RIT and now I want to start getting my certs. I have learned a lot through the MicroMaster program in terms of cisco router and acl's and I have tried self-studying for CCNA but I keep loosing passe after couple weeks of studying thus I'm looking for a class that will keep me organize and guild me through the leanings of CISCO/get me to pass the CCNA Cert. Has anyone gone though a online learning as such for getting your CCNA certs or anything of this kind? I'm open to other certifications but I'm looking for course that will get you the certification if you put the work and effort into it. I have been thinking about quitting my SC job and going to a community college back home full time to get couple certs. I organized a list of courses I can take that is offered at the community college back home. According to my planned courses i can get my A+, Network+, Security + and CCNA in a year which is included in the course itself. (This is what I'm looking for but online) But, I'm not sure if i should take the step of quieting and going to a community college or continue my hurt of online classes that will get me the cert if I put in my sincerer effort. Please help! Looking for advice. This is quite stressful and I want to learn and find a better job based on my own merit. I just need a sense of direction and opportunity to get the certs (which I think community classes can provides) and be with my family back home. Advice? "

My problem here is that I have two different offers from two very different companies and need advice deciding. Company A: An Engineering consulting firm, &gt; 100 users. They really, really like my resume, and beyond the co-op would long term like me to help implement standardization to their network (vlans, NAC, SCCM, etc). So basically I would have lots of leeway to build, design, and improve their systems. But downside it is pretty unstructured, without defined roles. Company B is a Investment firm that works with high net worth people. Total Staff is &lt; 75 They already work with an MSP to coordinate their infrastructure and helpdesk needs. However they use a lot of specialized database and analytics software, so need local help for their custom thin clients. I would have access to VMware Hypervisor for all their server in MSP 'cloud', and admin rights to AD and local resources. Additionally, the role would involve lots of SQL/Database analytics (something I want to get in to), Vendor coordination and management, and some cybersecurity and infosec stuff. So, basically a many hats role with an MSP support component . So Thoughts? I know this is kinda scattered in formatting, but I still mulling it over, as both companies want me to stay long term beyond internship in ever expanding roles."

A little background: I'm a recent graduate with a master's degree in civil engineering. I've recently been hired by a firm and am making pretty decent money as an entry level engineer. The only problem is: I don't think I want this to be my career. There are several reasons why I studied engineering: Analytical thinking, good money, make parents proud, etc. ... But it's not really making me as happy as I thought it would. I've always loved computers and tinkering with them ever since my parents got me my first computer, and I've been studying up a bit on stuff like Linux, security, SQL, etc. on my spare time (when I have it ... My new job has been having me do a lot more overtime than I would have liked). This sort of stuff interests me a lot, and I think I'd like to make a career in IT. The things that interest me most are virtualization, cloud computing, networking, databases, and cyber security. I'm not exactly sure which direction I want to go in, so I thought I'd ask here. I'd prefer working in one of these fields, although I'd need to get a better idea of each by tinkering. Cybersecurity, virtualization, and cloud computing look the most interesting at face value. But being hireable is also something that's important to me. I don't want to quit, and attempt to apply for positions that hardly ever pop up. Will I be able to make a career in IT if I get some decent certifications? I'll be able to take tests, because I'm making decent enough money, and I'll be able to study after work. I've looked at several different certifications and paths. Are there any particular recommendations for a beginner who wants to get himself out in IT and look somewhat competitive, even though he doesn't have a degree in computer science/IT? tl;dr: Civil engineer (MS) wants to go to IT because current career doesn't feel fulfilling. Interested in Cybersecurity, virtualization, cloud computing, networking, and databases. What do? Thanks"

I'm really torn between actually deciding what to major in because of the demand for each field. I have about of year of Networking experience with a BS in Computer Science. Computer Science: If I were to major in CS, I would focus on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence integration with Networking. I am currently a Network Engineer and I'm slowly seeing the migration to SDN so I really feel these skills will be valuable. Networking: I would love to just be a master of networking. This major would really solidify my specialization and back up my experience in the Networking field. I also plan on staying up to date with certifications so I won't rely entirely on the major (I know how valuable real-world experience is over formal education.) Cybersecurity: So I think eventually I would love to transition from Networking to Cybersecurity, especially blue team Network Defense. I have grown a great interest in Network Security including firewalls, IPS/IDS, VPNs, network security monitoring, etc. and could really see myself moving into a Security Engineer role eventually. So if you had to choose based off my background and interests, what major seems most valuable to you and why? Would really appreciate some direction here.

The company im with now I have nothing left to learn, most times I am teaching my superiors things and Ive learned all I can learn about ISP side helpdesk. the company has an internal IT department, and I have a good relationship with everyone that matters, I interviewed a while back for an internal IT helpdesk job but their career path is not logical to me because after commissions I would take a 35% paycut to start in internal IT helpdesk, with no clear position available after that, So its time to move on. Moving is an option to some major cities in the region, but would like to avoid moving if possible. The good news is there is alot of Sysadmin, Networking, decent helpdesk opportunities, and im not opposed to working helpdesk in an environment where I can pickup new skills or increase my current knowledge and get official experience to put on my resume.

I'm testing for the last half of the A+ soon and am trying to put myself into a position by proving what I can do for potential employers. I'd like to test for the CySA + but am not sure what I could use to bolster that certification. Bottom line: I live in an area with no opportunities and just have to move. Would the following plan actually be useful in getting my foot in the door for security? 1. Been working at service desk (entry level) for at least one year. 2. Get the CCNA and Security + in one year. (Will have worked in service desk just under 2 years by then) 3. Learn Python and C++. 4. Create two projects that are clearly CySA + oriented and post on Stack Overflow. 5. I do have a Bachelors degree but not in MIS or IS. It's a B.F.A (Bachelor of Fine Arts in Visual Effects unfortunately) I'm not sure what else to do from there but it's very difficult to get off of service desk and the pay isn't enough to be honest about it. I'm making less than 30K a year and there is no way to go up in the company I currently work at. Insurance is terrible and has gotten worse, the 401 (k) has insanely high fees so I can't participate in it and our paid time off is just lumped into a couple of days. Pretty much anything with more experience in networking would be a huge boost for me to make a jump. I'm looking to change employers locally as well. How soon can I take the Cybersecurity Anaylist cert from CompTIA or is there another cert that can bridge that 5+ year gap that would be worth getting? I've been looking at digital forensics, the SANS institute and there are a lot of certs out there for Cybersecurity in general so I'm not sure what to tackle in that area. I also can't afford to go back to college and since I can tic the ""Bachelor's degree"" box I'm hoping even though it's an art degree I can get a real job with it. My degree was in visual effects and the pay is terrible. They don't even have internships that pay so I was never able to get my foot in the door. (i.e. Black Swan lawsuit sums it up) My degree actually does focus on problem solving and that's the great thing about it, however most people confuse Visual and Special/Make-up Effects so I'm trying to move away from it. I had to write code for effects but am unsure of what to focus on for the CySA + in particular. Any advice on Cybersecurity would be much appreciated. I do like to drill down into computers and have peeked at the Network + info but have no idea if the Cicso classes are worth it. I can't afford $1,000 + for a two day lab to be honest. My employer will reimburse me for passing certs though I can't get anyone to give me the fine print on this agreement. I'm really wanting to get away from service desk as fast as possible and this looks to be the only way out right now. "

Where do I go from here? (long post &amp; portfolio)",9,80fkaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/80fkaq/almost_26_incredibly_passionate_about_technology/,2018-02-27 06:14:59,"Hey everybody, just wanted to say thank you in advance for taking your time to read and offer any insight, and I apologize if this turns into a long, scatterbrained post. I'll split this up into a few parts to hopefully make things more coherent. I'm also going to post a sanitized version of my portfolio for advice because I'd like some outside perspective if others see problems I don't. **1: Misc. background info** Going to try to condense this as much as possible. I'm 25, born and raised in rural Central FL for the first 22~ years, went through a divorce young and moved back in with parents who had relocated to a slightly larger town a few hours away, but still very few tech opportunities. Finally broke away 9~ months ago and moved to Pinellas (Tampa area), FL. I've honestly had dreams and desires to get out of Florida for years now, but I always let one thing or another hold me back. Moving to Pinellas was also when my GF and I finally moved in together, and Pinellas was the only place we could agree upon between her college choices and wanting to stay near to her parents, while still moving to a more populated area with more opportunities. About 3 months ago we decided to go our separate ways and she decided to move back in with her parents, leaving me in a place that I had come to realize isn't as great as I thought it would be for my field. I don't want to waste time spinning my wheels with the whole ""I don't know what I don't know"", which I already feel like I'm doing. To help me keep from rambling, this will be continued below at #4. **2: Skills, Accomplishments** I've honestly accomplished quite a bit when you look back at everything, and I think it's more me holding myself back than my skills or ability, but more about that at #3. Until a few months ago, I was just using a resume and a cover letter, but I felt it didnt convey my passion as well as it could, and after some research have done my best to turn it into a ""portfolio"", which in my case is just 2 more pages at the end, but I felt it allowed me to convey myself as a person and as a professional better. [**Portfolio Link**](URL (Formatting got messed up slightly while sanitizing) (TL;DR: AA Degree, CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ all passed first try from self study, broad knowledge but I don't know exactly where I want to focus myself yet because so many different things interest me. If I had to pick one career path today and never change though, I'd absolutely choose some form of cybersecurity.) **3: Issues/Struggles I've been having** Here is unfortunately where a lot of the things holding me back come into play. I was home schooled for middle and high school, and I self-taught myself through Florida Virtual School for the most part while my parents worked. From 16-19 I also played WoW for an average of 8 hours almost every day (time I wish I could get back). Although I breezed through grade school and college for the most part, I've had a lot of difficulties since then, and I've come to learn a lot about myself in the past 3 years. I was always introverted growing up, looking back I'd describe myself as lethargic and unconfident, or unmotivated. When I was 23 I went to my doctor and asked him about Adderall, after doing weeks of research about ADHD and wondering if it had been a battle I didn't know I was fighting. He prescribed me 2x 20mg Adderall XR each day, and the first words I'd use to describe it, is that I have a constant fog clouding my mind, obscuring my motivation and focus, and it had been lifted. I started a new job full time doing data entry/reconciliation, but felt like it still wasn't enough, it still wasn't the tech job I wanted, but didn't know how to get. The rest of the story is in my cover letter above, but TL;DR: Quit that job, started studying for Network+, passed it a few months later, passed Security+ a few weeks after that, moved to Pinellas. After a few months, started full time in my first serious help desk position, even though I was told I was overqualified for the position I told them I honestly needed to start working soon. They also hired a new help desk manager (only one) that started the day before I did, and it caused me to butt heads with him more than I should have. I don't want to waste time bad-mouthing because it's not classy, but it was issues such as it taking 6 weeks and over a half dozen times of me asking the manager to get logins for Duo.com and ControlUP, to which he would always reply that he'd have to see because he didn't think that was ""Tech 1 work"" and that ""more technical things like Duo administration is something the Tech 2's would probably be better off handling"" even though the Tech 2's assigned to train me (who had worked there 2-5 years) had already trained me on what they did in it during the 2nd week, and told me I'd be getting my credentials for it soon. After 4 weeks of not being able to do my work efficiently, I finally had them both in a room together and just brought it up, ""hey, you guys need to figure out what's going on with Duo, because I'm getting conflicting stories and I personally feel the manager is wrong"". Manager was wrong and I had my login the next day, but I was ""making waves"" that I probably shouldn't have been making, all because it got to the point it was literally paining me because I was wasting so much of the Tech 2's time forwarding tickets I was capable of doing, because the manager wasn't taking the time to listen to me and comprehend what I was saying. Multiple other instances of little things like this lead to me becoming quickly demotivated, spending time at my desk learning python programming in my VPS instead of working on the endless cycle of mostly ignorant tickets, taking more cigarette breaks, and 2 weeks before my 3 month contract (to hire) was up, they fired me at 4:30pm on a Friday with a mostly empty office over ""attendance issues"". I'm pretty confident that if I could have gotten over myself and my drive to do things correctly the first time, not been so blunt and just ""played office politics"", I'd still have the job. But I'm narcissistic enough I'd rather lose my job being right, and persistent about it, than to spend my hours working for inefficient managers who aren't using both ears and a brain when they listen, in a job that I was quickly coming to feel wasn't worth my 100% effort. **4: Where to go from here?** So here I am in this limbo, ""overqualified"" for Level 1/2 helpdesk, ""underqualified"" for every level 2/3 help desk because I don't have years of helpdesk experience, and no desire to even go back into a helpdesk role. I feel like my life, or at least my willpower to attain the life I want, didn't start until I was 23, and even though I'm extremely capable, at the same time I feel like I don't know anything and that I'm still just a failure, because so much of my knowledge/time has been self-taught, either because I was an introverted homeschooled teenager living on a dirt road in rural Florida, or because I after I got my AA I refused to get caught up in the senseless debt-prison of 4 year degrees here, and instead decided to educate myself instead, same as how I was raised. I'm almost 26 and I feel like I have nothing to show for it yet, I feel like I'm so far behind where I COULD have been if my ADHD was caught earlier, that I'm years behind where I SHOULD be in my life. These thoughts drive my depression and my anxiety every single day of my life, even though I know they shouldn't and that I should just be proud of where I am today. But I don't know where to go from here, how to break out of this self-defeating cycle feeling burnt out by life itself, and just be happy and proving my skills and capability to my employers, and holding down a steady career. Instead when I get to the 2nd phone interview for a cybersecurity position, I've been freaking out and over preparing for things that I already know, writing a 2,000+ word document trying to pre-prepare my words so I don't trip up over myself and sound stupid like I always do, then they ask me if I know what a reverse proxy is and I say yes and they ask my to explain in depth and all the thoughts are swirling in my head but no thoughts are forming, no words are coming out, and I'm having a silent meltdown they can't see that just ends in a ""no, not off the top of my head, I apologize"" and me crying into my pillow because I feel like a fucking idiot because of my anxiety and my long, silent, non-answers because my brain just overloaded and shut down. I've been working on the words to make this post for 7 days now. I have revised most things for coherency, but some of these thoughts that I feel are important to my situation and where I want to go, I couldn't get to fit in anywhere so I'm just throwing them in here, though most pertained to #4: (TL;DR: At the very least I want to get out of Florida, and hopefully eventually emigrate to another country). All in all, I feel like a fucking mess, but all I want is to be on the right path. I don't know how to break out of ""entry level"" and ""help desk"", but I feel I'm ready to. I want to do something that matters, I want to make a difference. I'd happily take a job tomorrow working in Networking or Security doing the 8-5 and on-call like so many people, but if I could I'd take a job today working in a developing country working on their Solar Energy infrastructure. I'd take a job today working for one of the companies expanding Arctic shipping routes through the Northern Sea. I'd take a job today working for one of the projects trying to bring internet access to rural developing communities that need it most to integrate and utilize todays technology. But I still feel like I don't know anything, like I'll never be a desirable candidate to work on anything that matters to me, or matters at all. I know things arent instant or overnight though, and I feel like I'm always stretching my mind in too many different directions, and I'm trying to figure out what the best things to prioritize are. Is finally completing and hosting my personal/professional website as a concrete ""project"" something that should be a priority, or would it be superficial? I would love to leave the state of Florida, or emigrate to another country if possible. Am I good enough for it? What would the first steps be? I would love to live in a smaller community (country) and feel a better sense of belonging and purpose. I want somewhere neighbors can engage in discourse, but I want to get away from the senseless, malicious discourse going on here. I'm turning 26 next month, and I'll no longer be able to stay on my parents insurance, and the state of insurance in our country is such a twisted game it makes me sick to my stomach to even play, so many senseless hours choosing between health benefits packages and comparing them like Cable packages for the first time last year honestly made me nauseous. America is too large and too fractured for me to feel the sense of community, belonging, and purpose that I wish to feel, that I need to feel. Am I good enough to join another community, would they ever accept me?/ I legally can't even hook up my own solar panels here without connecting them to the grid so if the grids power is out So is mine. Period. Florida law. It gives me a depression in the back of my mind that I'm not ""free"" that slowly drives me insane. Thank you for your time reading, I sincerely appreciate it. Edit: Two questions I thought about yesterday I forgot I had - How do I market myself better? - Is not having LinkedIn hurting me?"

Currently getting my AA (Cybersecurity) at a local technical school and my BBA (Finance) at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (getting both at the same time). Hopefully if everything goes right I should be done by the first quarter of 2020. Though cybersecurity field has a multitude of unfilled positions available I am still concerned with not being able to find a job upon completion of my degree. I think my biggest challenge is having real experience. Hopefully I'll be able to land an internship soon but in the meantime, are there any companies/positions that I should look into to work in while I am in school to get relevant industry experience? This is only my first semester taking cybersecurity courses and I really like it and based on my professors' feedback it seems that I am fairly good at it. Are there any programming languages that I should learn by myself in my free time (I basically have little to no IT knowledge besides the basic workings of using an everyday computer). Also forgot to mention, I currently work full time as a ""Computer Repair Technician"" but realistically I'm a glorified label maker and mouse clicker. Only get paid minimum wage so if I can find a position even remotely relevant to cyber security that I can work at while completing my degree that would be great."

The reason I'm unemployed is I did a IT support contract job that lasted a little over five months and then I decided I wanted to make a career change. My previous roles had all more or less been desktop support/help desk roles and unfortunately some of them didn't end well which has given me a less than stellar job history. I think the reason I wasn't happy in those roles was because I wanted to do something else, although I'm not sure what exactly. Just something more interesting, challenging, and to be frank, better paying. I have some interest in Cybersecurity so I decided to get a CCNA because I thought it could help if I wanted to move in that direction and because it would help my resume. But I also had some interest in web development so I did a web dev boot camp and put together an OK portfolio and tried applying to front end developer positions but haven't gotten many responses yet. Now I no longer receive unemployment so I figured I needed to get another temporary or contract job if I couldn't find something in network administration, cybersecurity, or web dev. So I applied to the desktop support/help desk temporary or contract jobs and yesterday I got an offer. The offer was much lower than what I've seen for other contract work but it's with a university nearby that's got a good reputation. I asked if they'd up their offer and they said they would think it over and get back to me on Monday. They played up the connections I'd make by working there, that it was based on the department budget, and that I could apply to other jobs while in that position, if I wanted. I feel like they're low-balling me because they think I'm desperate or that the university's reputation and potential opportunities are enough incentive to make up for the low salary. I have some savings so I'm not desperate at the moment but I do realize I need to make a choice soon about what I'm going to do. I feel like I'm sort of a mid-life crisis point where I need to choose which career direction I want to go in and that's much harder to do when you have a job. I thought with that time I have I would continue to do web development projects to improve my portfolio, gain new skills, and apply to more web dev jobs. And since I have time, also work on some IT security certifications to see if that's where I want to go. I just hate committing to something because I'm afraid of what could happen if I don't and then regretting it later. I feel like I've done that a lot in the past. Plus, it's an indefinite contract and they say most people transition into full-time role after a year or so, assuming there's an opening then. Right now, I'm not interested in that because I've lived in this same city for all my life so I want to branch out and get a fresh start somewhere else. Still, it's tough to turn down a job offer when you don't know when the next one will come and you've been out of work for a while. I believe I can get another contract job (hopefully a short term one) but it's hard to tell when that'll happen. What do you guys think? Am I being short-sighted? "

With the start of 2018 I've set out to find a new path for IT for myself, Security. I've recently interviewed for a Information Systems Analyst position and it looks like it will happen but there are catches. The hours for the company are pretty stretched, where you work 5 days at 12 hours (7a-7p), then have a couple days off, work a couple more, then few more days off. The schedule itself doesn't sound so bad, but I have been going to school at night to get a degree in Cybersecurity. I currently work an 8-5 so getting to school at 6PM (to 10PM) isn't a big deal. I'm about half way through my degree and am having trouble weighing out what I should do with this job opportunity. Effectively what it means is that if I took it, I would have to not only be late to my classes but at the start of Q2 2018, I would shift to nights and work (7p-7a). Is taking this job worth me extending the time it will take me to get through school? I am doing quite well in school and with some exceptions I am familiar with most coursework. Additional benefits of the job: They require you to shadow and train for 30 days where they root out any weak areas you may have, then set up a program for you where you aim to watch online courses and get certifications in order to better yourself as a technician. Essentially they don't want you to just collect a paycheck, and I love their approach.. Again, the problem is that if I did that, I would have to extend schooling. The job itself is exactly what I am passionate about and what I want to do, and I would learn ALOT!

The attack came from a company we do daily business with (their domain was hacked and the hacker hijacked their mx records, and put in valid SPF records). The wording was spot on for our business, and worse yet, when one of our employees responded to the e-mail to verify because it was not a report they normally send us, the hacker communicated back almost immediately affirming it was correct. The only clue at all was that it was a ""Docusign"" document that had a link to download, routed through bit.ly (so it bypassed our document block and link scanner by using a link shortener to disguise). Now to the point, we are not the size where we can have a dedicated cyber-security headcount.

Quick background on myself... 3 and half year Army infantry veteran (the Army actually helped me find out that I want to work primarily with my brain not my body anymore lol). I got out and started getting certifications. Within a year I had my first help desk job and then a year later was promoted to a Systems/Project Engineer for an MSP. I used my time during that to take on some of the biggest tasks I could and learned a lot. I decided to use my great skills and title with low pay to look for the same job with higher pay. I got one. I am now a systems engineer for a fairly large network around 15k users (public school district). Now I am 25 years old and I still have the itch.. I love powershell, automation, security, and just diving into problems. But I still want more.. I want to be a engineer, and I want to be in security. I want to be in these fields with others that are passionate about problem solving, that work on IT projects in their free time.. the nerds of the nerds... ya know? Passion and problem solving drive me. Movies like AlphaGo, Googles DeepMind AI project that won in Go against the top player in the world! That stuff inspires me. But how do I get there? I know there isn't a specific road map. But what can I do to show that I want to and QUALIFIED to work with some of the best engineers in the field. I would like to work on the Security side. My end game: I would love to work with some of the best engineers, whether thats Northrop Grumman, Google, General Dynamics.. I just want that passion. But I am NOT from an Ivy League school. I am currently going to school while working for my BS in Cyber Security and Information Assurance from WGU. I am obtaining certs at the same time. I would like to follow up my degree with a CISSP or OSCP. I know this takes time and I have been and I am committed. Life is a marathon, not a sprint. But is there anything that anyone here can recommend? Do you think my experience as a systems engineer, BS in CyberSecurity and Information Assurance, and CISSP or OSCP is enough?

I just wanted more opinions before I locked down my choice. My biggest concerns are job availability and security. Ive been told Network jobs are harder to get into due to a more competitive market. Conversely, I also worry whether I can wrap my head around the Developer side as it seems to require a lot of coding. It also sounds like school isnt necessary for either. For Networking, the goal is to get an entry level Help Desk job to get the experience and skill sets on the job, then earn whatever certs companies requested. For Developer, an entry level Programmer job is what you need, though Ive also heard that its possible to enroll in a school that will place you in a sponsored entry level job.

Apologies for length, but this is harder than I thought to consider. Currently, I work for state government. I have a myriad of duties, but my primary title within my department is an Information Security Officer (working with FBI tech security policy). It's a great job, I have a lot of fun, I travel a lot, and despite some typical work bullshit, it's pretty awesome. There's another job that I'm thinking of applying for that is very similar to what I'm doing now, except on the HIPAA side of things in another state department. It's four steps above what I make now, which would be about $13000 a year more (gross). The title is not nearly as cool, as it's actually considered a Programmer but it's not really programming at all. It's doing a lot of the stuff I do now (tech audits, security policies, incident response, etc.) but because the other department doesn't have a relevant job position available in their roster that are applicable to the job's duties, they had to pick one that was close enough but not exact. I know the department hiring manager; he and I have worked together because I've actually audited his department (they deal with some FBI data which means they're subject to audit) and I believe we've developed a really good rapport and professional relationship. I reached out to him and said I was thinking of applying and he said he was surprised that I was thinking about it but seemed extremely supportive and said I would be a very competitive candidate. Not that I have this in the bag, and I'm sure there are plenty of other good candidates, but I think my chances are really good. Anyway, I'm weighing the pros and cons. I really just don't know if this would be a smart move. I love what I do, but I think this other job has more opportunities. FWIW, I'm 32, so I think I'm still young(ish) enough that I can still have a lot ahead of me for career growth. Also, I have my GCIH certification. Please.. any advice. What would you do in my situation? I've bulleted out my major thoughts and concerns. Life goals: * Have a better-paying job (possibly in the private sector) where I can telecommute full-time or do independent consulting so that I can travel for leisure/work * Make enough money so my husband doesn't have to work or move to a place where he can find a job in a big city that he wants to live in (his field is pretty specialty and hard to get employment, so if we move like we want to, I'd have to make enough money to support us until he could find another job) * Reach relative financial independence by 40 * Learn a lot more about IT and get more certifications * Considering enrolling in WGU for a BS in cybersecurity * Finish writing a book (my first love is writing, so my independence/freelance/telecommuting possibility would permit me more time to do this) Pros of current job: * Lots of travel (mostly in-state, some out of state) * Bad ass title * Great experience doing on-site technical audits * Have learned a lot about network security * Currently a supervisor * Am well-liked by other management and staff * Have a lot of awesome coworkers and friends that I get along with and that I truly enjoy * Amazing network of peers across the country and at the FBI * Potential to get good federal job based on current field and experience * Actually really enjoy what I do Cons of current job: * Limited growth. This is my biggest one. There's nowhere to move into, unless one of our IT managers leaves and even then, I'd end up losing my current title and job duties. I'm the only one who does what I do and it's assigned to my current position. There's no promotion that would allow me to keep this type of work. I'm basically stuck. Any promotion would of course be more money but I'd be doing something different. * Understaffed. Because it's state government, we're limited on resources and staff. I work a lot of unpaid overtime (however, I do get to take a portion of extra time worked to bank as vacation time. I've accumulated over 100 hours this year which may be a pro in a way.) * Overall stress of meeting deadlines. Because I'm the only one that does what I do and can do what I do, I'm solely responsible for hundreds of agency audits and there's a lot of pressure/lack of support by upper management who don't realize how much work goes into this job. Keep in mind, the IT auditing/FBI stuff is only part of my job and I have a shit ton of other duties to do (which could be a pro since I have a lot of hats). Before I got into the job, they had a TON of turnover (at least four other people in fewer than two years cycled through). * Somewhat unhealthy work environment. My immediate boss overworks *tremendously* and management above her does not -- and they don't seem to care or want to do anything about remedying this issue. My direct report has been on permanent OT for five years. Again, management just poo-poos it, because at least our jobs are getting done. Another coworker has had a couple of breakdowns at work because of pressure, deadlines, and work refusing to let her get OT to get things done. The expectations are unreasonable and unrealistic across the board, not just for me. * Inflexible with scheduling. They don't allow telecommuting and they don't allow flexible work schedules (such as doing four 10s or getting every other Friday off by working longer days). This is actually kind of a big deal for me. I *hate* doing the typical M-F 9-5. Pros of new job: * I have an advantage over other applicants because I have the compliance experience with one of their required policies * More opportunity to grow and get more experience relevant to IT. I'd probably be better able to increase my knowledge and skills a lot faster * I know some of the people there already, so I think I'd easily fit in * My new boss is awesome and very easy to talk to. I know it'd be different if I ended up working under him instead of ""with"" him, but he's very knowledgable, laid back, and really nice. * More relaxed work environment (casual dress and probably better opportunity for flexible work schedule) * More money (approximately an extra $600 a month more after taxes) and since I wouldn't be a supervisor, I'd be eligible for OT * Doing similar stuff I do now * Closer to home * Would learn more compliance requirements of other industries which could benefit me in a possible future of being an independent consultant/auditor Cons of new job: * No longer would be a supervisor * General possibility that new job would suck/wouldn't be good fit/wouldn't be enjoyable * Leave the current field I'm in that I REALLY like and lose access to that networking/peer group (well, some of them) * Probably wouldn't travel much at all * Doesn't look as impressive on a resume as current title * Would be harder for me to get a federal job (if I end up going that route) back in the field that I'm currently in What would you do?"

This post is to help me organize my thoughts and hopefully get some feedback from you all regarding the title. **Prior experience**: Four years as a sysadmin in the Marines ranging from desktop support to enterprise architecture planning, deployment, and support. **Current job**: Contracted SOC Analyst at an MSSP for previous 6 months. Company is what most would consider a SMB and located in the greater NYC area. **Situation**: Current company I'm contracting for wants to hire me full-time. I haven't been given an offer letter yet, but I'm told to expect one in the next couple weeks with a salary of $65,000/yr and benefits. This is a bit higher than my contract rate, but I wanted to get my foot in the door for security and took a low rate. I haven't been able to get a comprehensive breakdown of said benefits; HR is currently ""finding it."" But I know that being a 24/7 SOC, I won't get those morale boosting perks like paid holidays off or overtime for working on holidays. Not a huge thing, but I worked through just about every holiday in the Marines. I'm not trying to go back to that. **Struggle**: I don't know if I am overvaluing myself or if my company is undervaluing me. I asked how they decided on $65,000/yr and I was given the nebulous answer of employment demand, experience, and what the company can afford. Nothing more in depth than that. I get the feeling that ""what the company can afford"" can accurately be translated to ""we're not giving you more than this."" My cursory research shows that for this location and job the median income is roughly $90,000/yr salary. It's difficult to adjust for other intangible factors such as experience, work load, initiative, etc. $90,000/yr in this area still isn't much, but I would be happy with it. $65,000 is barely paying the bills. I also commute over 2 hours a day in horrendous traffic. Over 90 miles each day. It's about 12 hours a week of driving. I also work Tues-Sat, so I only get one day a week to do things with my wife (teacher) besides watch tv and eat dinner at night. This is a big deal for me, and I want compensation to reflect that time investment and lost opportunities. **Why I think I'm worth more**: -On a team of 8 analysts, I account for over 24% of incident cases resolved in the past 6 months. I also contribute as much or more than other team members in creating and revising our SIEM rules. -I'm the only person on my shift (7am-4pm) that can adequately understand and communicate with with our partners/customers, so I'm always the go-to person for handling customer calls and emails. -I have an MSci in Education. Subject matter not entirely relevant, but it equips me to deal with people and also demonstrates a capacity for learning complex ideas. I'm also currently pursuing a second MSci in Information Systems with a concentration in Networking &amp; Security. -Pursing industry relevant certifications on my own time and money, as well. Currently enrolled in Cisco SECFND and SECOPS with examinations scheduled for late March. Also studying for Net+, Sec+, and Linux+. -Certified for vendor-specified tools that we will be offering services for later this year. -Much time spent at home working in my lab to get a deeper understanding of different systems and environments our customers are on. **What is probably counting against me**: -Lack of security experience. This is my first job in a security role, though my job in the Marines involved many of the broader ideas and concepts in cybersecurity. -Lack of industry relevant certifications. Most of my certs are equipment/vendor specific and don't apply to the industry as a whole such as CompTIA, EC-Council, Cisco, etc. So uh, am I full of shit or should I put on a smile and start sending out my resume?

The other issue I have found, is that if I sense a position might be opening up, management instead moves people into newly created positions, and never actually advertises the role. So a manager recently left, and instead of filling his role, they broke it out into two different roles and filled them with people. So you can see it is hard for me to move up in my current organization. So I listed my resume and am seeing what opportunities are out there. The problem is, what I have been seeing have been trying to lowball me, or do a lateral or sublateral position movement. I honest dont think what I am asking for is unreasonable. Last recruiter I talked to told me a position for Technical Lead topped out $10k below my minimum movement number. My minimum movement number is a 20% increase in pay. ideally I would like 25%. So, the qualifications: AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate VMware VCP5-DCV Microsoft MCP 70-640 CompTIA: A+, Net+, Sec+ BS CyberSecurity MS CyberSecurity Finishing up MBA The other thing I have found difficult is the Catch-22 of leadership. E.g. You must have X years of management experience to apply for a management job. How do you get that experience, if experience is required to get the job? (One of my pet peeves) Any suggestions on what path I can take, certs to get, or other ways to grow and advance my career? Thanks in advance. "
1421,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,What part of IT might I be good at?,1,7fuiph,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/7fuiph/what_part_of_it_might_i_be_good_at/,2017-11-27 22:21:04,"I'm currently 30 with no experience in IT outside of a required 120 hour internship at my college's internal IT department as a PC Technician Tier 1/2 Support(according to my supervisor). I have 8 years of retail experience and live on Oahu, Hawaii. The job market here is very dry on the software dev side, but almost everyone needs IT services of some kind. One possible market is cybersecurity due to the many military bases we have, but nearly all positions require a security clearance of Secret or higher, which I do not have. &amp;nbsp; I will be graduating this Fall semester with an Associate's Degree in IT that is focused towards programming(Visual Studio using C#) and cybersecurity(basically 3 security classes, the last one is not required for the degree, but qualifies me for the CEH exam). I have a CompTIA A+ and Net+ and am scheduled to take Security+ in the middle of December. &amp;nbsp; I'm kind of curious what career path I should take, basically what position I want to aim for, how high up the ladder that position might be, and how to move towards it. I feel I am strong towards programming, although due to a lack of research I did not focus on Computer Science as you normally would and cannot afford to go back to college either to change majors or continue towards a Bachelor's at the moment. My immediate concern was getting my foot in the door, work for a year or so, and go back for my Bachelor's. &amp;nbsp; I've been eyeing Cybersecurity as a field because of the local job market and I've been told that it's a field with 0% unemployment. The caveat might be that I need a Bachelor's to get my foot in that particular door. I'm eyeing the Penetration Tester position, though I'm not quite sure if that plays to my strengths or if there's a non-security alternative. &amp;nbsp; I know little about actual hacking and penetration testing in the practical sense. I was able to follow a walkthrough, make multiple adjustments(because it never works like it says it should), and was able to gain root access to a sickOs VM. That doesn't make me suitable for pen testing, it just (to me) demonstrates an enthusiasm to jump into something I know little about and perform a lot of on-the-spot troubleshooting to fix whatever issues that prevented me from using my Kali Linux VM to penetrate the other VM. &amp;nbsp; My experience as an intern reflected that as well. I wasn't a fan of the physical labor, the physical installation, spending an hour pulling out all the network cables from 20 computers and moving everything. But I was like a kid on Christmas morning when the Help Desk brings over a laptop or PC, says it's broken, and they don't know what's wrong with it. I enjoyed especially difficult solutions that frustrated even my senior coworkers(Windows update hanging, enabling the root account on a Mac to wipe all old install files of McAfee, finding the most efficient way to install all necessary drivers on a wiped Dell PC, how to stop File Explorer from opening up after an image of Windows 10 is put on). &amp;nbsp; I will be having an interview soon where I expect to be put at a Help Desk(but more customer service role rather than the hands-on work). Which is fine to start with, just not sure what the next step is. Presumably if I can't get my foot into security until I have a Bachelor's, what position should I try to shoot for that would best qualify me? I have it in my mind that my path should be something like Help Desk ---&gt; ? ---&gt; ? ---&gt; System Admin ---&gt; Security Analyst ---&gt; Pen Tester. Also plan to pick up CEH, CCNA, CCNA-Sec, CASP, OSCP, CISSP along the way."

I got the call a week before from the hiring manager, saying they wanted me to come in at x time on y date. After hanging up with them, I never got a confirmation email. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but this particular company required everyone to be a registered visitor to even get into the building. I never got this. I called once, twice, three times, and always got voicemail. I finally got a call back the morning of the interview, saying it was still on with the manager. So I arrive 15 minutes early, they *still* don't have me recorded as having anything scheduled today, despite the hiring manager themselves confirming that they sent the email to me not three hours prior. But I register in person, and explain that I'm here for a followup interview, and they give me my visitors badge. 15 minutes later, I get greeted not by the manager, or the hiring manager, but by the CISO himself. He explained is was going to be him, HR, and the manager themselves. We get into a conference room, and it's completely empty. The CISO seems perplexed by this, but doesn't react beyond remarking that they should be here. He explains he hasn't actually seen my resume or my cover letter, and that he doesn't know that much. So he asks a few questions, I ask him a few questions, and this entire time while we're kind of stalling for the actual manager to show up, not a word. But during this time, I find out it's not an analyst position, or anything even close, but an Engineer position. This was completely news to me, as the application itself said Analyst. Anyways, almost an hour passes, and they haven't even reached out in any way to let us know that they wouldn't be able to make it. The CISO explains he has a meeting to get to, and shows me out. Now, this is a *huge* company where I live. Not just big, but known for professionalism. I get that they have a lot of responsibilities and things can just happen. And especially where this is InfoSec, I get that things can happen. But it seems wildly unprofessional to me that not only do neither the hiring manager or the actual manager even showed up, or that could even be bothered to reach out and say they couldn't do it, and to reschedule, but that both the HR guy and the proper manager don't show up. This really didn't instill any confidence in me. Basically, is this a red flag, and should I avoid them? Or should I just pretend it never happened, and give them another chance? I'm still fairly new to InfoSec, and don't exactly have massive amounts of experience to be able to go anywhere, but I'm employed full-time in Cybersecurity anyways at current. tl;dr: Scheduled a followup interview, no confirmation email. At the interview, neither the HR rep or the actual manager are at the interview they scheduled. It's an hour-long talk with the CISO who doesn't even know that much about the position. Find out the position is completely different than what I applied for. What should I do??"

I'll be honest, the college I attend is nothing great (I'm studying in Poland) and I've just started the very first semester. Obviously I can't choose my 'specialization' before the third one (one semester is 6 months here). Until then I'm supposed to get the basics of IT. It'll be three and a half years before I can get my degree... and here in Poland, the college I attend is not really that well-known, so I suppose it's even worse abroad. The thing is I've finished a technical school with focus on IT (a type of a high school where I had been learning the basics of IT for 4 years - electronics, Linux and Windows (Server, 7 and 8.1), networking - types of cables, routing, iso/osi, protocols, setting up servers etc. - and programming in C++ and Python + web development HTML/CSS/JS/PHP). I've created couple simple programs and set up LANs on my own, so I'm not really 'fresh'. People who finished high school know basically nothing about those things unless they learned on their own (I'm not saying I'm better than them by any means, we just were taught different things). In my previous school I had the possibility to get CCNA, but since it's valid for 3 years and we had 2 more to go, I decided to not waste money. You probably can read from my post that I know nothing about current situation in networking/sysadmin fields. My question is simple and very straightforward. Do I need the degree to get into networking/sysadmin/security fields? If no, which certifications do I need to get in order to grab a job somewhere IT-related? Thanks in advance"

After finishing my BA, I would like to continue into a masters program focusing on Security. Not sure what exactly, but I have lots of time before I get to that point. My question is one... is my current plan for the time being a good plan for success? and two... what would you suggest for certification exams to take? I currently am working on finishing up my studying for the CompTIA A+ 902 that I plan to take in January. After that, I will earn the Net+ and Sec+ certs to get the base three certs from CompTIA.

I chose these two schools because they're regionally accredited, accessible (fully online), and affordable (~$200 per credit hour). &amp;nbsp; I already have a 2 year diploma in CIS from a local CC in Georgia. I have the CompTIA A+ &amp; Security+ for whatever they're worth. Currently I'm now a NOC specialist that reports to an infosec manager. The role will be expected to pivot into being some sort of odd NOC/SOC wombo combo fusion role, which I think is pretty cool in terms of being a learning opportunity. I'll be monitoring external client network(s) but then there'll also be the duties of internal security incident management, physical security like CCTV, etc. Overall, not bad and sounds like pretty cool stuff. Previous to my current role, I've had two previous jobs for a year each: * Really junior sysadmin apprentice (great experience and really enjoyable, but part time and low pay) * Service desk analyst on contract (was purely a monetary decision, I would not go back to hell desk ever again) &amp;nbsp; I'm already enrolled in WGU's BS CSIA program and I have to say, I'm personally not liking it very much. It feels like a mistake to have started in this program and I don't want to have some buzzword meme degree. There's all these certs in the curriculum that I don't think hold much value, that both I and others don't really care about, such as anything CIW and EC-Council. Since I started 10/1/17, my thoughts are to drop and get a refund in order apply for FHSU's online BS in CS in the Spring semester. I can use the time in between to study Python programming and the CCENT/CCNA since that'd be more valuable than a dozen certifications, many of which aren't very recognized or held in very high esteem. I'd rather have less certs that pack more of a punch than tons of CompTIA's entry level offerings or Microsoft MTAs. "

I have found that a lot of people do not realize that there are a lot of non-profit state and private schools that have a full campus, do most of their classes in person, but have an online division. Many talk about WGU as though they are the only way to get an online degree from a non-profit school. It isn't. In fact, there may even be an online program in your state that allows you to avoid the entire online degree stigma entirely. Here are just a few of the programs I suggest looking up which have a very good tuition value/reputation ratio. Some of these degrees are cheaper than WGU, but most are only 1.5 to 2 times the price. Don't just look at the link because often they have other similar majors, so go to their main list of majors if you want something like cybersecurity instead of IT. - [Kennesaw State University](URL - [UMass Lowell (I did this program if anyone has questions)](URL - [Dakota State](URL - [University of Wisconsin-Stout](URL - [University of Maryland, a bit expensive](URL - [Minot State](URL - [University of Illinois at Springfield](URL - [University of West Florida](URL - [Fort Hays State University](URL - [Middle Georgia State University](URL - [Colorado State University Global Campus](URL - [Wilmington University (the only private university listed here)](URL - [University of Florida](URL - [Columbus State](URL Particularly in IT, often these universities wouldn't have enough people in their area interested in that major, but have found they can offer it online and get way more people interested as a result. But you benefit from the reputation a university gets when it has a physical campus and is allowed to take public money. That is just going with some of the cheapest options I have found, and not even all of them. If money isn't as big of a factor to you, places like Penn State, Harvard, Virginia Tech, New England Institute of Technology, etc also have great online programs. I just don't think it is worth spending that much on a college degree if you don't come from money. The only thing you won't get from most of these programs is a short-cut. They are traditional 120 credit programs. You can't take the A+ and get college credit for that. But you will get something that will help your future, allow you to do the coursework online, and may put you in a better position career wise than if you went another route."

1442,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,A couple questions regarding next career steps and updating my resume.,4,76laab,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/76laab/a_couple_questions_regarding_next_career_steps/,2017-10-16 07:00:06,"Hey all, I posted here a few months back a bit frustrated as a recent college grad unable to find relevant work experience after graduation. I'm happy to say that since then, I was able to find work at a great company for which I had very relevant industry experience and they were really excited to bring me on board. I've been working here since early July. The work I'm doing is basically Tier 1 tech support, which obviously isnt what I would like to be doing and theyve made it *very* clear that there isnt any room for lateral movement within the company. They have goals to promote me by Q2 2018, to a consultant position where I would be working even more heavily with clients. Consulting is not the field I want to be in within the next five, or even two, years. So, I'm looking for other work. I feel like I'm back in the same position as I was at the beginning of the year, that the experience I have and the work Im doing (helpdesk) is not relevant to the fields I want to get in to (cybersecurity, networking). I want to get some certifications, namely A+ just to start off. I guess my questions are, if you were in a similar position, like, just started a job, set up for promotion very quickly, but it's not the work you want to do, what would you do? I've just updated my resume and I'm thinking of sending it out to a couple security companies in the area but I'm a bit worried that I won't hear back from them because I don't have any relevant experience. My family has told me to wait for the promotion and find out what they're willing to pay and I can use that as leverage when negotiating salary. I like the idea of that, but I honestly dont think its worth it since Im going to leave anyway no matter what. I can stay here until the end of the year at most, but after that, they are going to be hiring new people to replace us who are moving up and I'll be stuck another few months having to train them. And I don't think I can stay at this job for that long. Also, is it frowned upon to leave a job after six months? I feel like many people these days don't spend more than a year at any one place, but I've literally only been here three months so far. If I left in December, I feel like it would be bad taste. Would this look bad to future employers that I left so quickly? What could I say if this came up in an interview? Last couple questions: - What's a good way to set myself up and start studying for certifications? I spend most of my days at work, which can either be super busy or very slow depending. It's hard for me to set a schedule to study for my A+ especially when I have so many other things to worry about during the work day. - What's a good timeframe/schedule for getting your certs, specifically A+? Can I study for like a good two or three months and take the tests, or does it generally take people longer than that? - What are other good certs to start out with? I recently heard Network+ isn't great but I thought it would at least be a good starting point. Are there other alternatives that are more worth it? What about Security+? - I feel like it wouldn't be cool to put my academic goals on my resume... something like ""seeking relevant professional and academic experience and looking to obtain certifications and higher education in relevant fields"" ...would this leave an employer with a bad taste? Like, in that I'm no longer talking about the company's goals at that point but my own goals and how they can help me with achieving them? Is there a way I can put these things on my resume without making it all about my own goals, or is it best to leave it off altogether? - What about my education experience? Now that I have my first full-time job, I feel like it's a bit less relevant to talk about my education in my resume. It's still relevant, but how much can/should I talk about it and what should I leave out? And how relevant is the one page rule? My apologies, I know this post is loaded but I would really appreciate any help and advice I can get. I've posted my resume here so if anyone would like to give any critique it is greatly appreciated! [Resume](URL Thank you!"

I am thinking this is the proper place to ask career questions regarding the infosec/cybersecurity side of IT. A little background about myself. I am currently working in a Network Admin/Sysadmin role for service company for the last 4 years. I also have a B.S. degree in CIS with a Network/Sysadmin track. I touch alot of different devices and setups. From basic level one support to firewall management and interoffice connections. All of the environments I management are Windows based. I am looking to change career paths from the Network/Sysadmin side to Infosec side. Got my Comptia Security+ cert earlier this year as starting point on my resume. Just working on Network+ for a easy quick cert to get. I know these are low level certs but they are quick and easy. I am looking to jump into some other certs and looking into a InfoSec career position with a Network/Sysadmin side of IT. Ideally I would like to work for a InfoSec consulting company. My question being what are some good resources to start studying up or certs to look into. I have been looking at some of the SANS certs. This question is kind of open ended just looking to pick people's brains who maybe made the switch.

Cyber security, software testing, cloud, Web development, networking or anything that would be fairly easy or quick to learn and will easily land me a job in the future so I wouldn't waste any time.

I was lucky enough to land a full time internship in a well known government agency in the cyber security field. My goal is to work in the cyber security field in some capacity. My dilemma is that I'm not sure where to go next. In my internship is beneficial in the fact that I can stay in the program as long as I am enrolled in school. When I receive my degree there's a chance I can be brought on as a full time govt employee. The problem with that is the pay. The internship does not pay that well so I am forced to take on a part time job to make ends meet and pay for school. This results in me having to work an average of 60 plus hours a week. Given my lifestyle I can only handle two classes a semester. If I continue on this path it would take me about four years to get my bachelor's degree. This would require me to work two jobs and go to school part time for the next four years. I have been doing this for one year now. I thought about looking into the private sector that would pay more but I understand it would not offer the job security that the govt would. The private sector job would allow me to work less and get my degree program completed sooner. I worry that if I leave the government position I may messed up my chances of easier path to success. I also worry that since I have no certs and no bachelor's degree I would have to work my way from the bottom and take a help desk job. I do have an associate's degree in IT and I am currently working on my Security+ Cert and looking forward to getting my CAP cert next. I do realise how hard it is for people to get in the govt. I already have my foot in the door, don't know if it would be smart to leave. Looking for any advice you all have, maybe someone who went through a similar situation. Thanks in advance. "

I had no certs or related schooling (still dont mostly) so I felt really lucky to be hired there, and have learned a ton of networking stuff on the job. My role is basically a help desk position with a little bit of NOC duties. We have a wide range of customers, so sometimes my day is just explaining the different between a LAN port and WAN port to a one-of customer, other days I am troubleshooting a 300 site VPN with one of our large MSP partners. It's all over the place and I'm in over my head sometimes, but I've learned a ton. On Friday my boss and CEO pulled me aside to tell me that my boss, our IT director, was quitting. They also said that his position, or a restructured position similar to his, was open to me if I want it. They both think I'm totally capable, but I'm not too sure. I know all of our current customers inside and out. If the company stayed exactly like it is, I definitely could do it. What concerns me is new things. Sometimes when we onboard a new customer I end up talking to an engineer from another company with 10+ years experience, trying to sound like I know what im talking about when they mention double redundant pc load letter encryption while I'm actually scrambling to find it in Cisco's knowledge base. I think if I take this job, I may be in a lot of situations where I'm asked to do trigonometry and I barely even know algebra. Before, I could always just brainstorm with my boss to figure these out. Now, it will just be me. I started my degree in cybersecurity at a trade school about 3 months ago and it has definitely accelerated my learning, but I won't be done for almost 2 more years. Right now I am at a place where I could probably pass the CCENT, but I am still regularly getting less than 70% on the CCNA practice tests. TL;DR - Offered a job I am definitely not qualified for, and it will be sink or swim with no one else to fall back on. How can I be ready and not mess it up?"

If anyone has advice to help me out, I'd really appreciate it. I went to college to be a mechanical engineer. Took lots of math and science courses and had 2 internships. Wasn't happy with my major so I switched to Criminology and graduated with a B.S. in Sociology (i know...) I worked for a year for a family business unrelated to my degree. Now this wasn't the main focus of my job, but whenever one of the stores had tech problems, I would get on the phone with the manager and try to troubleshoot the problem. If the issue couldn't be resolved, I'd drive to that store and look at it myself. I didn't do anything that requires a deep understanding of IT, just if the computer/printer/wi-fi wasn't working, they'd call me and I'd try to fix it. My goal is to get an entry level job in IT, gain experience, and advance to higher level careers. From my understanding, people should break into the IT industry before even attempting information security. I'm currently enrolled in the Cybersecurity program for an Associates of Applied Science at my local community college. I'm taking an Intro to Networking class and 2 other classes for PC hardware, software, OS, etc. Next semester I'll be taking classes for UNIX, Network Security Basics, and 2 other security classes. I'm learning to use Wireshark and I've built computers, installed VMs with VMware, setup an Ubuntu home file server with an old PC, did a couple things with my Raspberry Pi. Also, I don't know how relevant these are but I know: web development from building websites (HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery) and Java. I'm not sure if college leadership, research, and awards matter. So after all that, I've been getting mixed opinions on what I should be doing. I live in an area with plenty of tech jobs but I feel so incompetent. I have a Bachelor's so is an Associate's worth it? Masters in IT/business? Industry certifications? More home-lab experience? Internships? Just start applying for entry level jobs? Ultimately, I'll decide the next step for myself but I want to know what some of you think. Thanks for reading."

For 4 of those years I have been working as an ETL developer and now am working as a Software Developer. I know that looking for entry level jobs for cybersecurity is oxymoron, but I was wondering if after I get my degree I would need to jump into an either network/system/DB administrator role to build up my competencies before moving into a security analyst role. My main hope is that the certificates above would just get my foot in the door. I do not expect to right away get a job in the cyber security field. In summary my question would be would a person with the above certificates be something that a company would be interested in looking at for a security role or information assurance roles. Would direct lack of that experience automatically disqualify me, even if I am willing to settle for lower salary to learn? I saw questions when asking about cybersecurity coming from people that are right about to graduate, but for people that have experience with IT would it be just as hard to land a job within the security field without working as a network or systems admin? Any advice would be appreciated. For reference this is the university I decided to get my degree from (URL main reason being is that its a non for profit and also provide all materials for the certifications while also giving you classes preparing you for taking those certs.

I am currently torn between these two choices. Both choices are at my local national university where i did my undergraduate. The cybersecurity degree is a part time degree but I missed the application deadline by 2 weeks (found out about it end june) and have to wait till next year august intake. My original plan was to sit in all the lectures from aug to next year and sit for tests for the first 2 intro to comp sci mods and 1 math mod (since they allow exemption for these 3 mods) and get exempted from them when I apply next year. The program is quite a traditional degree program and I should be able to get exempted from most of the 'extra' university requirements since I did my undergrad there. It looks like quite a rigorious program with lots of focus on systems and mods with security in the name but I'm not sure how competitive it will be to get in. I believe there is also a work study (40hrs?) component in it. I also just found out there is a Graduate diploma in System analysis which is a full time 1 year diploma meant for graduates switching into IT. Looking at the modules, it seems like there is SQL, full stack, java suite, asp.net, mobile, project management and a 5 month internship as well. It seems highly geared to being as 'work' ready as possible. It starts in Feb 2018 and applications end in Sept. So I'm torn in which one I should go for, not to mention I'm not sure how competitive they are since they are kind of under the radar at the moment (i hope) and I screwed up my bachelors with a poor GPA (below 3.0) and graduated in Philosophy. They both cost roughly the same per year but the part time degree runs longer of course. I've been learning web dev (hate it) and python on my own so I'm just a beginner.

The thing is, it's not the highest thing on my list of potential career options. I know how to do it, but I'm not too big a fan of it.

I've applied to hundreds of jobs. I've had a good number of interviews and then they never call back or they just say ""we've decided to move along with other candidates"". I know the resume is important as a first impression, and I think I have that down (maybe just need a few tweaks here and there but I've had my resume critiqued by a handful of people since like September) because I am getting noticed by recruiters and hiring managers alike. This is why I feel like my problem lies in the interviewing process. I do my best to sell myself and I emphasize that I'm always open to learning new things and taking on new opportunities. And these are entry-level positions I'm applying to, so, I mean...isn't that mainly what they're looking for? Is there something else? I don't mean for that to come off negatively, I'm just genuinely trying to figure out what it is that I'm doing wrong. Most, if not all of the people I've graduated with have found jobs by now and it's just really disheartening and it's stressing me out and I feel like I should have found something by now.

I held out hope for security though, thinking that something like pentesting (yeah, I know, I know) or blue team duties would be more technical and thus more enjoyable for me. But after reaching this point with my sys admin job, I don't think that I can handle anymore work that doesn't involve coding or CLI work at the very least.

And yes, this is super general IT where I learned bits and pieces of everything (web design, SQL, networking, etc.). I primarily focused on my CCNA courses (intro to networking, R&amp;S, scaling networks, and connecting networks) throughout the program as well as cybersecurity. I am actually going to go to get my Masters in cybersecurity this fall. So far, I was blessed to work as an intern for one of the Fortune 500 companies last summer, working with their internal DNS team. Right now, for this summer's internship, I'm working with the same company with their internal network engineering team. My first dilemma is that I'm stuck between cybersecurity and network engineering. Clearly, my internship experiences focus on network engineering but it's been hard for me to find and obtain any other work related experience with cybersecurity. If I do see a job posting of such, I noticed they're always asking for ""at least ___ year(s) experience with help desk"" or something along the lines of that. And the only ""real"" technical experience I have is with these internships. My second dilemma are certs. Since I'm graduating (literally in two days, yay) with the bachelors degree, should I still be aiming to get certs? I have zero. If I should get into certs, which ones should I be looking into? I didn't know whether I should obtain at A+ or not considering my degree, but like I said, I don't know what I'm doing, career-wise. Was really really considering getting CCNA since I've been doing all these courses to help me prepare for it, but idk, I've always been nervous with tests and money's kinda hard to come by considering I have living expenses to pay for. Third, I've already gotten a big feeling that my internship company is going to want to hire me for a permanent position. (I had the offers after my first internship but I was still finishing my last year for B.S.). The thing is, I just hate the commute and I'm not sure if network engineering is what I want to focus on if I'm going for my Masters in cybersecurity. Everyone is nice here but I feel left out and out of place, considering I'm very young compared to everyone else here. I have been constantly looking for related entry level jobs closer to me and there aren't many cybersecurity related ones. And if there are, they're mostly looking for experienced people.

The money looked right I saw more growth there so I took the job and start in a couple weeks. Yesterday, however, I ran into my old supervisor who works in cybersecurity now and let me know that they have an opening. He asked me to send a resume to see if I would be a fit and he could send a formal job description/posting. This would be the dream job since I just received a degree in cyber security. I was looking for security jobs, but found it difficult since I have no experience and only the degree. I feel as though once I build a foundation outside of tech support it may be a better chance. Would it be a bad idea to look into the job my ex-supervisor may send me? I understand it's just ""looking into it"" and no commitment, but I also understand that if something does come up it would be a burned bridge with the new job. Is it ever OK to do this?"

My prime interest has always been IT, though my first real job was in government, as a police detective for most of my 20's. I made a change into the private sector in 2007, starting off as a logistical clerk at a large IT company who provides maintenance services, etc. Before long I was offered a position upstairs as a buyer, the main reason at the time being that the workload was, up until then, being handled by one person and, specifically, this one person ""hadn't had proper time off in 3 years"". They needed to bring someone into the buying department, and they needed someone savvy enough to be trained in virtually everything to do with corporate buying in as small as possible amount of time. A month later I was able to handle the department by myself while the other buyer was able to enjoy his much-needed vacation abroad, which emphasized the fact that I was fully entrusted with the responsibility of the entire portfolio, which included high-end customers like Standard Bank, FNB, SPAR and more. During the next 5 years, I developed relationships with suppliers, optimized workflow, actively pursued best cost scenarios and everything else related to being a professional buyer. With no major hiccups in that time I've proven myself to be just as capable as their originally sole buyer. The only difference was that he earned a lot more that I did... experience, right? I accepted that and continued to prove myself in every way I could, but the caveat was that I had no real positional growth opportunity. I reported directly to the Procurement Director, which meant that in that position there was no real way up for me except in salary, which even at its pinnacle wasn't enough for me to get by comfortably. But for someone without a degree, I was left dismayed. The major catalyst came in 2015 when I underwent spinal surgery, in the upper neck region. I was booked off for 3 months but was back behind the desk in close to 2. As hard as I tried getting myself set up as comfortably as possible, the 2-hour daily commute was what caused most of the pain and discomfort. I requested from the Procurement Director that I am allowed to work from home for a limited amount of time, to assist in easing the pain and speeding up the healing, but was denied based upon company policy. To me, it was literally a decision between their wealth and my health, and I resigned shortly after to continue the healing process at home. The plan was to use my time developing skillsets more in line with what I might want to do for a living, which includes programming, writing, and music. I started following every online resource I could find on development, I've taken keen interest to Python, Open Source and Linux in general. To get by financially I joined a friend in a small woodworking venture, where I initially 3D modeled kitchens and bedroom installations for him and handled the marketing. As my neck healed I was able to help in more physical stuff like assembling units and installations and this sustained me for the time being, along with playing the occasional live or DJ gig. I have a high-school diploma, detective's certification, and a week ago I finished my LPIC-1 through Linux Professionals Institute, passing both exams. The reasoning behind my latest certification was simple, I'm always helping friends and relatives with fixing computer hardware and system related issues, though I've always seen it as exactly that, helping. It was just something I would easily offer to do[I] because I like doing it[/I]. I know Windows to the degree that I could easily troubleshoot things and come up with solutions, or figure out how to do it otherwise. Over the last 3 years I've grown attached to Linux and while I've managed to learn a lot about general desktop usage on Linux by myself, I needed a way to get myself up to at least the level I'm at with Windows, in terms of offering some kind of support. Right now I feel like I'm in the 'make or break' stage of my journey. I need to decide what's next soon, which leads me here and to the point of this post. The most obvious next move is that I do the next level LPIC-2, which is for software engineering and I want to begin as soon as possible, but I need to either put myself on the job market at an entry level position for something I like or start generating a steadier income through a start-up. Here's a list of things I feel I could pursue, and I would like to hear about my chances by anyone in that particular field. * Freelance web design and hosting, I'm fairly competent with CSS, HTML, and the Django framework. I'm also aware that I have a lot to learn in this field, though I would find enjoyment in that, I'm sure. * Cyber security; my past experience as a detective, along with my keen interest in networking and cyber culture may open a door in that direction. I don't really know if it's too long ago (that course was in 2004) or even relevant to cybersecurity. * Home Automation; I'm an avid hobbyist with microcontrollers and have programmed various chipsets and prototyping boards. I've experimented with PIR, ultrasonic, pressure and many other types of sensors in my own home automation setup that I actively maintain. I could provide that service to others in a way. * Find an entry level job as a developer at a company that excites me, appreciates my value and allows me to develop myself further. * Writing; technical writing, reviews blog, tutorials, that sort of thing. There may be options that I'm currently oblivious to, so I would love to gather a bit of an outside opinion on it. What would you suggest? I'm 35 years old living in South Africa. Thanks for reading!"

I'll try to paraphrase and give this story the shortest version possible but a quick TL;DR is that... **TL;DR : Company wants to hire a sole IT guy to support their business of roughly 35 people as well as head *multiple* projects such as efficiency solutions, website overhaul, social media and any other tech issues that arise. I am currently in school to obtain a Comp Sci degree specializing in Cyber Security. I have done small work for the company before, they want me to come on and complete multiple large scale solution projects for their company. How do I evaluate myself and approach them back with an offer they have asked for?** So here's the deal. I do a fair amount of side business providing tech support for local companies. I am not yet certified such as CompTIA or CCNA for examples, but I have a decent amount of self experience working on projects and providing solutions. Currently in my second year of college and working on a 3+1 program, only 19. The only official things I can cite are winning regional and state competitions in Cybersecurity as well as previous projects for local businesses. Last week I setup a meeting with the owners of this new clients business to sit down and discuss plans to overhaul their website. This meeting went from a 30 minute pow-wow to a 2 hour, long term project discussion, that ended in a job offer sort of. After outlining roughly 6-8 months worth of work, expectations and deadlines, they asked if I could complete it. I informed them I can but only with dedicated time. They responded with ""What you're saying is, if we pay you full time you will dedicate your time to here."" (On a side note, I have done side work for them before, they have informed me they are extremely happy with me and even pay me over what I request as a tip for work.) They said they need someone who can take the project and work on it without issue and doesn't need to be guided. They then asked me to send them an offer and to quote ""Whether we do this as an on retainer or coming on as a full time employee is up to you."" I've only ever done work for companies as proposals and short term projects. They've made it clear they need someone full time to manage their IT issues and take care of projects they come up with to help the company. I want to send my offer detailing a full time position and either Salary or Hourly, I have compared the national average for a tech support specialist and it is listed as 42k on Glassdoors, and roughly the same in the Chicago area (Where I am.) I do not understand how to put this in writing, nor how to estimate whether 42k as the average is a lowball figure or not. I know without the proper experience I shouldn't expect high pay, so I'm really abit lost here whether I have the leverage to approach with this kind of offer which will likely turn into negotiation. I've received varying degrees of advice but all of it positive, ranging from ""Send an offer for 70k!"" or ""Shoot for 30k"" and others suggesting do retainer. I am asking for guidance in terms of how I approach negotiating my pay, what this means for me and what I should watch out for. Ninja Edit: I am currently employed full time at a retail job and do NOT need this job. I would be fully willing to leave my retail job for this as the experience is worth more than even the money to me. Anything over the 20k before taxes that I currently make is really just icing on the cake for myself at my second year of college. They are the ones who put forth the idea of me coming on as an employee, and they approached me with the work so I believe this gives me abit of leverage. I have already asked /r/personalfinance about this but haven't received alot of help. Thank you in advance!"

(read in the wiki a CS degree leaves me in a good position, but curious to see what others have done) * are there online resources/classes I could take to learn more, and get a feel for the work? * how much would I need to focus on getting certifications for entry-level positions? (I realize the trifecta of education/certs/experience is ideal but as I understand it, getting certs can get expensive and wondering if it was worth trying to get hired first and then seeing if my company would be willing to sponsor me for some of those) * what is a typical day like for a sysadmin? (personal experiences that may give me insight and confirm/dispel any notions I may have about such a role) * is helpdesk work inherently part of a sysadmin role? * if I have a preference for linux systems, will it be an option to exclusively work with that? Or will most roles require me to have some knowledge/background managing Windows systems/servers? * would it be foolish for me to pursue this, and instead try to get into a more devops role?

Worked on their mobile ordering system implementation, too. * 6 months network implementation (config &amp; physical installation) for my university. I wrote software to automatically configure all of our switches (""auto-provisioning"") and it's our new standard process. * 6 months at our data center, auditing customer equipment and implementing some infrastructure management software for temperature and power controls. It extends to some service management software and can cut tickets as necessary. Just recently, I was accepted into the IT intern program for a massive aerospace company in the US. Today I interviewed for final placements and a couple of managers marked me as a top candidate, giving me the choice between them. They seem to be great positions and it's hard to choose between them. Right now, my career has been out of control due to an IT reorg I'm going through and how rigorous school is, and I don't have a concrete idea of what I want to do with my career other than I want hands-on work as well (not paper pushing). Here are my final choices: * Intern position for revamping the company's change management process from the ground up, with some project management work on the side. It sounds like I will be doing the bulk of this project and work with a lot of teams. * Systems design and integration for global security operations, where I will work on designing systems for enforcing extra security policies when equipment/users enter high-threat countries. Technology in use unknown other than it's heavy in Sharepoint. * Another systems implementation position, heavily involved with configuring and deploying servers, handling data center migrations, and answering escalation tickets (sounds like tier 3 help desk, though...).

I'll graduate with a M.S. in Cybersecurity &amp; Information Assurance. I live in a small college town in North Carolina that doesn't have an IT scene. Because of this I'd like to start my own consultant firm that provides security audits and pentesting services. I'm not sure if this would be the best move, or even possible for that matter. If I don't take this route then I'll have to acquire an entry level position, which means I'll have to move. That alone seems daunting (I hate moving lol), but won't stop me from attempting to become successful in the industry. Here's a little bit about my job history and experience. The only jobs available where I live are construction, retail, and burger flipping for the most part. There are a few computer repair places, but most of them consist of two guys who don't like to hire anyone (I've tried for years. They hire no one, period). None of these pay well at all, so I've been doing odd jobs the past few years to make end's meet, such as moving furniture, mowing lawns, and other random things (I make about $400 a week). When I'm not working I've been attending college and tinkering with cyber security - mainly coding, practicing security audits by modeling businesses in 3ds Max (lol I know (-.-) but the power of imagination goes a long way) and compromising some spare computers. I've just recently started to explore the world of bug bounties through sites like HackerOne. So I have hands on experience, but no relevant job history. I do have the following certifications or will be getting them within the next year: * CCNA * CCNA - Security * CompTIA A+ * CompTIA Network+ * CompTIA Security+ * CompTIA Project+ * CompTIA Linux+ * CIW Site Development Associate * EC-Council Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator (acquiring soon) * EC-Council Ethical Hacking and Countermeasures (acquiring soon) * CPT (If necessary then soon. Not sure at the moment.) Regardless of what path I take I'd like to end up performing security audits and pentesting services at some point. Should I attempt a start-up or seek an entry level job?

Here are my thoughts. 1st option. Eastern Illinois University has an Management Information Systems program which is a mix of busiess courses and IT course. They offer a master's in cybersecurity if I wanted to go that route, which looks enticing to me. Thought with this is to get the bachelor's degree and get my certifications while still in school--security+, etc. 2nd option. Illinois State University has an information security and assurance program which is more technical and specific. Same thing here about getting certifications.

I've always been interested in computers, programming, and web design. I have 1 1/2 years left before I get out (voluntarily) and I'm working on getting my certs (A+, Net+, Sec+), as well as, working on a Bachelors degree in Computer Networking and Cybersecurity. My father is a programmer and he started from scratch in his mid-30s. Plan: I plan to separate, hold my current job in the civilian sector for a bit because it will be a great source of income, go to school, and work towards getting the experience I need to pursue IT (depending on which route I want to go). I will also still have a Secret Security Clearance when I get out along with my basic certs (hopefully). I feel very confident in this route. With all of this in mind, do you think I'm heading in the right direction? Sometimes I feel like I should hold off on school and learn programming, web design, etc., and focus on my certifications.

I hear experience is key to getting a job along with certifications. I will have a variety of good benefits upon leaving the military. Any advice on which route would be the most effective?

I'm a 25 year old IT guy who just received a very interesting job offer from a previous employer. I left my previous position 3 months ago for a few reasons. It was my first IT job (helpdesk) and my first real job out of college. I really enjoyed the people I worked for the most part (with the exception of one person, which I'll get to in a moment) but I wasn't making nearly enough money to make ends meet or to achieve any of my life goals like getting my own apartment or paying off my student loans. There were a few pretty glaring issues in the Dept when I left, such as Lack of communication between the InfoSec team and the rest of the IT guys. I worked very closely with the Security Analyst since getting into Information Security is a career goal of mine, and there was a big disconnect between the old guard and the new cybersecurity initiative. There was a certain coworker that, despite very admirable personal qualities and decades of experience and knowledge was MISERABLE where he worked and made it very difficult for me to do my job, as we worked very closely on many projects. Things would get swept under the table or disregarded for weeks at a time, until so much work piled up it was impossible to catch up. He HATED being there and it was a big blow to morale, as he was very vocal about this. Last, and most importantly, I was becoming very bored. I want to become a Sysadmin and then eventually find a role in cyber security, but I was stuck doing the Helpdesk gig for two years with no sign of advancement, even though my bosses and MGMT seemed to like me very much. As I was very pessimistic that any of this would change, even after speaking to MGMT about it a few times, I floated my resume online and immediately got contacted directly by an IT manager at a different company, and was offered the job after a single technical interview. After negotiating salary, they offered me 35% more than my current gig and a title bump. So I've been here three months and I'm bored to tears! I went from a 9 person department for a 320+ person company that had dedicated staff for server maintenance, desktop support, cyber security, etc to a barely four person department for a 500+ person company. The rest of the department (and it's barely a department, we report to the CFO!) is spread all over, so I hardly get to interact with anyone. Most of the dept is awol at any given time, so there is zero communication. This has disrupted the few projects I've already tried to start to the point of no return. Also, while the staff and executives here are truly wonderful professionals, I have no interest in the industry (automotive) and find it to be fairly boring. The job is also pretty autonomous, but it consists of remarkably simple break fixes and is generally just very tedious. Today I got a call from my previous employer. Turns out they COMPLETELY revamped the entire department based off of suggestions I had made in my exit interview. The above mentioned unhappy employee has left for a different company, and they want me to come in with an even better title, salary, and benefits, and I'd be reporting directly to a recently promoted mentor of mine to learn more about networking and cyber security. The CIO, Director, Department Manager, asked to get me back specifically. There are a few caveats. My current employer is in the middle of a big digital infrastructure transition right now, and I'd kind of be leaving them high and dry if I left. Also, I've only been here for a few months, is it bad for the resume? Is it a good idea to go back, now that the company knows I'm ready to leave if I don't get what I want? Tl;DR Better job offer from previous employer, but I've only been at new job for 3 months. What do?"

After I realized late in highschool that college was out of my reach for where I lived and my monetary situation (which I now realized just how wrong I was) I joined the Navy with the intention of CryptoTech - Networks (essentially a internal PenTester for the US Navy). When I was recontracted to a less relevant field, I gave up on my dreams. Fast forward 2.5 years, and after 2 years of school I get medically disqualified from service, thus giving me another chance at the IT field. I started college but due to job issues and family obligations ended up going full time as a LAN Admin in local government. I realized the other night that if I keep shooting for certs and requirements for my current job (MCSA and LPIC) it will get harder and harder to shift into CyberSec as I want to eventually. I've also been told by a person in the field that due to my connection to the US Navy in general, that I will never be picked up as a PenTester by any real group. So here's my question Reddit, is it too late (due to my prior positions) to get any real job with a PenTesting group and if so, what are they looking for and what can I do to make myself more attractive toward them."

Just some background information on me at the moment: 18 years old, currently in my first semester of community college, attending for an A.S. in Computer Science. Now here's some information on my impasses: 1. Computer Science is super, super math intense here. To get the credits I need, I have to take Intermediate Algebra, College Algebra and Trig, Pre-Calc, Calc I, Calc II, and Calc III. I am horrible at math and don't see myself easily doing any of those classes besides the first two listed. 1. In high school I took numerous IT classes and some programming classes. I've always enjoyed the actual physical aspect of the technology much more - operating systems, networking, building computers, etc. 1. My school offers a couple of tech-related degrees including: * [Computer Science \(A.S.\)](URL * [Computer Science \(A.A.S.\)] (URL * [Web Development \(A.A.S.\)] (URL * [Networking Technology \(A.A.S.\)] (URL I linked all of the curriculums for each of the degrees incase it would help any of you help me with this. Now, as I said I'm currently taking the first degree I listed. It's just super math heavy and a lot of the logic and program classes aren't holding my interest. The last option I listed is what seems to interest me the most, but I'm worried about switching to that. Not only is it an A.A.S. so I wouldn't be able to transfer to a four year school but I'm also worried about the security (financially, and with a career) picking that over Computer Science. Ideally, I've always wanted to work in IT with network management and maybe cybersecurity. This is why I'm so confused. I hear all the time how stable and good it is to be a Computer Science major but it just doesn't seem to be my niche. On the same stroke, the Networking Technology seems to have everything I've always been interested in: networking classes, security classes, etc. But the fact it's not a transferrable degree scares me. I really apologize if this isn't the place for this but I figured asking IT people their opinions would be the best bet for this considering this is a decision that will impact the rest of my life. I've also heard from a lot of people that IT isn't secure and it doesn't make sense to go into it over CS. I really would appreciate any and all advice you all could give me and maybe help me make up my mind on all of this. It's been causing so much stress for me lately. "
1523,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,Finishing a Bachelor's degree in unrelated field - need some advice,3,5hilwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/5hilwd/finishing_a_bachelors_degree_in_unrelated_field/,2016-12-10 16:16:31,"Hey guys, I'm looking for a bit of advice of where best to take my career based on my situation. Apologies for the wall of text. I'm currently finishing up my last two courses for my BSc in Psychology. When I started this degree, I was unsure of what I wanted to major in, and felt this was the right path at the time. Halfway through the degree I came to the conclusion that Psychology would not be the field I wanted to continue in. Nonetheless, I decided to stick with it, with the mindset that since I was halfway through, that I might as well finish the degree. Unfortunately, this did not turn out as hoped - I felt extremely exhausted, depressed and out of steam. My overall GPA progressively fell to a little over 2.0 which resulted in me being kicked out of university for one year. I took the year off as an opportunity to explore the IT field. I managed to get into a one-year intensive AEC (Attestation of Collegial Studies) program in Network Administration, which I loved and ended up doing well in. This opportunity allowed me to secure an 3-month internship, and was asked back for a 5-month paid work contract doing mostly technical support work. Fast-forward to the last few months, where I managed to get re-admitted to university, and have been working to finish up my remaining courses for my Psychology degree. At this point, I am left with wondering what steps to take for the future. I would ideally like to work in the cybersecurity field, and want to keep taking steps towards that goal. I currently have a part-time job that is totally unrelated to the IT field. Would it be advisable to look for an IT-related part-time job, and then to try to complete a second BSc in Computer Science while working? I have also considered applying for a post-graduate diploma in Computer Science, but am not sure if this would carry the same weight as a Bachelor's degree. TL;DR Finishing up a BSc in Psychology. Wondering whether the next best step would be to complete a 2nd BSc in Computer Science while having a part-time IT job. "

I'm currently majoring in Cybersecurity at an online college that is accredited but my job leaves me zero time to study/work on school work. I'm also attempting to self-study security related things such as penetration testing and learning Python. I realize that this seems like a lot on my plate, but before moving to my current job, I was able to do all of this. I used to work in customer service as an assistant manager in a corporate bakery and my current job would be my first job with professional experience. Even though it sounds really nice on paper with a good company name to add to my resume, I feel like I'm wasting time and just not learning what I could be learning. I'd rather take a pay cut and work at help-desk or some other IT related position that would allow me to practice what I'm learning in class and could directly support what I want to do in the future.

So, I'm a 23 yo M, 1.5 years out of college with a BS in biology. Went to college hoping to be a doctor, switched to dentistry late in my collegiate career, and I am now in the process of applying to dental school, but outlook on getting interviews is not looking that great. I have a 3.2 overall GPA with 3.75+ in my non-science courses. I've always been great with computers and have a pretty good business mind as well. I screwed around my freshman year and had shit grades in science courses but pulled them up since then. I'm now on the search for a backup option, should dentistry not pan out, and my family/friends have mentioned MIS/CS as a possible option. My other option is to pursue a MS in biology/biotechnology but I did lab work and graduate-level research for my senior capstone project and I was not a fan of the tediousness and boring nature of being stuck in lab all the time. Anyway, I have a family friend who is a current MIS major who has told me it's the way to go as his father was also an MIS major and now a president of a major defense contract company, but I'm not sure if this is the right career path for me. Not to say it isn't but I have no CS or IT background at all. I can work my way around any OS and have basic HTML/CSS/JS knowledge along with plenty of basic computer hardware and software knowledge (I'm the go-to computer guy around my family, girlfriend's family, and all of my friends - even long-distance friends who call me for computer solutions). I also love solving basic computer and IT issues around the house and other peoples' computers (I've worked with personal computers running Windows and OS X/macOS and enterprise systems running older Windows systems). I've applied to a nearby university to enter their MIS program in the spring, just in case. I would apply to a CS or online MIS program but I don't have any prereq's to warrant it. And to be honest, I know CS is a ton of math and I am decent enough to keep up but not if it means taking more math classes (already took Cal I my freshman year along with basic statistics classes in my college career). Was wondering if I could get some opinions here on a possible move and if it's worth it to pursue a 2nd degree and even an MS in CS or MIS/Information Security (I have a sweet spot for cybersecurity in my heart). Also, any help with directions for a MS, and even internship ideas, if it's worth it, would be great as well. Let me know what you think.

I am 23 years old. No college or relevant career experience. I've kind of hit a rut in working mundane retail or sales jobs and I want to give myself the means to do more. The motivation for IT comes from a lifelong love of computers. I know nothing about coding or programming, I did not enjoy math in high school, and I don't think I want to be sifting through data and/or crunching numbers in a backroom all my life. Through my research, I've been led to believe that the best option forward for me would be CIS or MIS. I've also lurked on reddit and seen a lot of people talking down to those that pursue this sort of degree and writing it off as ""CS lite."" It is hard to get a definitive answer anywhere regarding what the specific job prospects would be post-degree with either of these majors. I guess this has something to do with the fact that these majors can differ greatly depending on the school. Friends of mine who do considerably well in IT told me I would most likely enjoy being an IT manager of sorts, while others tell me cybersecurity doesn't involve coding and math and would be a great field for me, as well as that there is no clear cut path to IT management. The advocates of cybersecurity seem to mostly harp on the fact that it's easy to get a stable job. The others tell me I will hate the kind of data-crunching work that cybersec entails. I live in NYC and am currently in my first term at a local community college. I do not like the vibe here and I'm planning on transferring ASAP, hopefully to a program with a guaranteed transfer agreement with a good 4-year school for a CIS major. I am looking in NYC/NY and finding very little in the way of anything concrete for CIS majors with regards to the guaranteed admissions agreements. I am well within the means of relocating if need be to a particularly good 2 year school/CC with open admissions, that has an articulation agreement in place to guarantee transfer to a good 4 year upon completion of the associate's degree. I know that the california state system is particularly good, but first have been trying to explore local options in NJ and CT, but mostly to no avail. I apologize for this being so long. I am trying to make up for a lot of lost time and wanted to provide as much info as possible. Anybody with advice on where I go from here, what tools to use, particular fields of IT I may find interest in or which ones you think I'd like (or you like, for that matter), recommendations for schools (CC's with transfer agreements or 4 year schools to work towards) would be greatly appreciated.

However there are a couple of issues. 1. I have no experience in any IT/IS job at all(yes I should have got an internship) 2. The security knowledge I have is mostly theory based and hardly any practical use(if any) same with networking. 3. Unsure of what jobs I should be looking for(job titles etc) googling has given me very vague information. I was told certifications are useless unless you have experience so I'm not sure where to go. Ultimately I wanted to get into cybersecurity but have kept my options open as to where to shift self-learning focus.

I've been at a standstill for a few months now, and I believe it is at least partially because of my geographic location, but there is of course room to improve myself. I wanted to reach out to the internets and see if others have experiences or advice to share. To put it short, I am trying to break into the IT Field. I am having difficulty finding any advertisement close to entry level (Anchorage), and the ones that do are gobbled up by folks with experience. Internships/volunteer opportunities? Haven't seen a fragment of one. I've gotten 2 job offers - each were for a contracted job installing retail equipment (plug and play really), one was a grand total of 8 hours while the other was 40 hours. I have a B.S. in Cybersecurity, courtesy of UMUC. Graduated with a 3.865 GPA. It was a great set of courses and I learned quite a bit. I chose to continue with education and am actively enrolled in graduate courses with 4 more to go. I recently nabbed my A+ cert and plan on pushing towards CCNA R&amp;S, then Security and beyond. I am an Air Force vet, but am completely changing fields from what I did active duty for almost 7 years. **Some** of what I did can translate to the IT world (think Emergency Operations Center, communications equipment custodian, etc.). I've been told I have a pretty solid resume considering I lack the solid professional IT experience. But here I am, working on ATVs, cleaning outdoor recreation equipment, and doing outdoor trips for military and family (MWR). It's not a bad job and I have fun, but it's not a *career*. $11 an hour part time doesn't cut it with a wife and (soon) two kiddos.

I'm confident with using Nginx as a web server and reverse proxy, creating SSH keys, SSL/TLS, user and group management, file permissions, symbolic links, setting up the firewall, private networking, etc. I've been successful with using Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana to create a basic SIEM for monitoring failed SSH logins and monitoring the Nginx access logs for HTTP requests. I typically use Qualys SSL labs to check my sites for proper SSL/TLS configuration, and I'm learning how to implement security headers for added protection. &amp;nbsp; I'm now working to improve my knowledge and proficiency with using Docker. I'm comfortable writing basic web applications and building containers using preexisting images (Redis, Python, etc) and deploying them. I'm also familiar with continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). I'm building a static site, pushing it to Github and letting the service I use compile the repository during each new commit / push. I'm making a little headway with learning Go and Rust, since several positions I've been interested in require knowledge with Go. Rust is just a bonus since it's a fun language to work with. I'm not a *great* programmer by any means, I need a lot of practice. &amp;nbsp; Besides all of that, I'm comfortable using Compute Engine (Google Cloud Platform), and using EC2 (AWS). While I haven't done it many times, I know the importance and how to set up firewalls, create load balances, etc. &amp;nbsp; I'm an honest person, so I don't want to list anything on my resume that I'm not *extremely* competent with. I suppose I'm a bit afflicted by ""imposter syndrome"", even more so because I've never had an internship or worked in my field yet. However, the logical part of me is thinking that the only way to become confident with your skills is to work among others, learn from those with more experience, and gradually become more proficient. &amp;nbsp; **My background:** &amp;nbsp; I'm a new graduate, about 3 months unemployed. I have a Masters and Bachelor's in Cybersecurity and Computer Science. I've applied to 50+ positions, all met with rejection (about 5-10 so far) and the rest nothing.

Two years ago, I started working in the IT department at my school as a part-time employee. This was not a student worker position or work study job, it was just a part-time position that was open in the IT department answering phones, submitting tickets, and fixing printer issues. After a year, I was moved into a slightly better paying position in the school's department. In this position, I work the help desk the majority of the time, but I also do things such as: create images for computers, deploy hardware and software across campus, fix printer (and any other hardware) issues, add/remove/maintain computers on the school's network and manage them using Active Directory, and resolve A/V equipment issues. My question is... where do I go from here? I make pretty awful money and now that I've graduated college I am looking for something to advance my career. I'm interested in working in cybersecurity ultimately, but for now I simply want to move away from the help desk and into a more technical role. I would like to be able to improve my programming and scripting skills in a new position if possible, but right now I don't even know where to start looking. I do not have any certs currently - is work experience enough to take me to the next step? **TL;DR: Recent college graduate with 2 years experience at the help desk - not sure where to go from here.**"

And I apologize for the long post in advance, but I really need your help, as my whole future depends on your help, and this important post. I am interested in Information Security, in fact, I have a strong passion in it, and that's why I chose IT Security over Medicine, Passion over Money/Prestigious. So I decided to make it my job field. I am enrolled in a Computer science program in a university, 1 month and 12 days left for it to start. I plan to have a master degree in CyberSecurity/IT Security if it's worth it. I have prior experience in hacking some machines, but nothing major, I was just a script kiddie unfortunately. And as I want to be a professional hacker/penetration tester, I am building the right strong skillset, including programming, networking, operation systems...before I start hacking any machine, or studying any security related degree/certification. I reached the part of my plan where I learn networking, my plan was like this: Network+ &gt; CCENT &gt; CCNA R&amp;S. I was planning to study them now, and take the exams in my last university year. The main reason I wanted to have those certification (or the CCNA R&amp;S) in my resume is to approve that I understand networking. So, I got the ""CompTIA Network+ All-In-One Exam Guide, Sixth Edition(Exam N10-006)"" Mike Meyer's book, and got shocked by how much information is need to be memorized in order to pass the exam, and understanding that information (which is the only needed in the real world field) isn't enough to. And, this is just the basic network+ cert., so the CCNA R&amp;S has much more to memorize (probably 1000+ pages). Also, all that memorization is not needed in the security/hacking field, I just need to understand TCP/IP, know how to pivot, understand wireshark, understand how firewalls work..I don't need to know how to configure 100+ switches with 30+ firewalls, and some load balancers, that is the networking man job. I understand that to hack a network protected using a firewall, and an IPS for example, i need to understand both of them in order to hack it, and that's what I am gonna do, I want to understand and memorize what's needed for hacking, but not 4000+ pages of networking at least. And i am gonna deploy that practically in labs. I am gonna configure switches, routers, firewalls, IPS &amp; IDS.., but I am not gonna memorize tons of things, just to pass a certification, that I am not gonna use, neither in the job, nor in my own hacking journey. Then, I kept thinking, is studying them using ""books maybe + cybrary + labs -packet tracer, virtual networks using vmware workstation-"" enough to fill this gap ? I checked indeed.com to see some job posts, and what they require, and no one required having those certifications, just a few required understanding TCP/IP. This same thing applies to Microsoft, and Red Hat, I planned to get some of their certifications, to approve that I understand Windows and Linux, but i think there is no need anymore. I can self-study them without getting a certification, for my knowledge base only, and focus on the security certifications, so I can now achieve the CEH (just to pass the HR), OSCP, maybe elearnsecurity (their courses are good, but their certifications are not well known unfortunately, so I don't know if it will help me getting a good job), and much more. And I thought, doesn't achieving OSCP approve that I understand the needed knowledge to do a penetration test ? Such as TCP/IP understanding, wireshark, linux, windows, scripting...as this knowledge is required to pass it! So, I can approve it to the employer this way. So now, I can achieve some important security certifications within my bachelor years, then I can join a master security degree if it's worth it (in USA or EUROPE) OR I will get a good security-related job immediately after graduation (I don't study in USA or Europe currently, but I would like to work there, as the people there appreciate Information Security much more than here), and then, I will start harvesting SANS certifications -i wish i can afford them on my own now-, and after some years, I will get the CISSP, and maybe then I can work as a CISO! Which is my goal, to be a CISO (As I know, it's the most paying and prestigious job in this field). In the same time, I will study security books as much as I can, I will build my own lab, I will use vulnerable machines such as the vulnhub's ones, i will use ctf365.com, I will stay up to date with security news and vulnerabilities, I will donate to penetration test local companies, i will attend CTFs, conferences, and bug bounty programs, I MAY make a blog, and I will do my best to fill up my resume (I will make a seperate post to gather as much as possible on what things can help my resume). You may ask, why did I post this if I already made my decision ? I didn't. I am still worried what is the right thing to do, that's why I need your help. I don't know what is better. I don't know if my path will work or not. I apologize for the long post. I hope you answer my following questions, and I appreciate any additional advice and suggestions. I hope you correct and direct me to the right path. My whole future depends on your help. 1. Can I get a security-related job immediately after graduation (I mean my first job is security-related one) with a CS BA degree, CEH cert., OSCP cert., and the self-study stuff that can be put on the resume (such as: books, online courses, achievements, donations, a blog, CTFs, conferences, bug bountry programs...) ? 2. Is my plan/path realistic ? 3. Can the CISO level be achieved this path ? (I think I need a management/Business certification to be a CISO) 4. Additional notes, advice, and suggestions are appreciated. Thanks in advance. -LonVenu | Reddit"

Simple answer to the click-bait question: You can't. I like to poke around in the questions here from time to time to see what people are having trouble with and what direction everyone is heading. One thing in particular that I see far too often is entry level people aiming for a career in security with no credentials other than maybe a basic certification. Schools and TV do a great job of making it sound like this is a fun and easy way to make a crazy amount of money. Be a white hat! Ethical hacking for loads of cash! And it's partially true - high level security experts make a very comfortable living, easily averaging above 100k. But here's the part they don't tell you: 1. Security is saturated. Too many people entering the field means that competition for the few jobs out there is growing like mad 2. There are very, VERY few ways to break into security at entry level. Probably the easiest way to do so is to retire from the military with a high level security clearance. Other than that you're going to have a long path. 3. It takes a good 10 years to become proficient enough to be hired as part of a typical corporate security team 4. Cyber security training is not the most useful technical education you can get So I'm not saying this to discourage anyone, but just to set proper expectations. Yes, you can still get into security, but it'll probably be a longer path than you expected. /u/VA_Network_Nerd made an excellent post about this topic yesterday, and I encourage anyone interested in the security field to start there: URL He's absolutely correct in that you must have a thorough knowledge of networking, operating systems, hardware, and/or applications before you can begin securing them. I think a few people didn't like hearing that - hence the downvotes - but I can verify that he speaks the truth. As an example - I work for a fairly large organization of about 15k employees. We have a few hundred in IT alone. Of those, our security team is a total of 4 people. The CISO has a PhD &amp; the rest have CISSP/CISM and/or masters degrees. None of them have less than 15 years experience. So sure, keep security on your list of things that you want to do. But make sure you have a solid plan on how you can work your way into the field by first becoming an expert in whatever it is you'd like to secure. "

However, my love for technology as a young adult led to me explore this field as a career and I love it. I am currently working in IT as a Desktop Support Technician. However, i am pretty much doing system admin work: I oversee our backup and replication servers, configure and administer our Network Monitoring Software, administer users through Active Directory and Office 365, handle any hardware issues related to our in-house servers and networking equipment(switches), provision user workstations and phones, and I am the only person on the team who really knows how to use Powershell. I have written numerous scripts and even some tools that my team uses. I've been doing this for about a year now I and I wanna take the next step, but I need some good advice. I got my CompTIA A+ last year and this year i just got my CompTIA Network+ in March. I want to continue my studies and my career but I don't know the best route to take. I'd like to become a full System Administrator and then after a few years of experience, transition into a more Information Security Role, maybe IS Analyst. However, I look online and see that many of these jobs require a ""technical degree"" of some kind, which my Anthropology degree doesn't fall under.. My Questions: 1) Does the need for a degree really impair someone from getting a System Admin position or Information Security Position? 2) Should I get a second bachelors at a local community college: a Bachelors in Applied Science in Information Technology, a Masters Degree in Information Systems at the university, or just continue getting certs like the Security+, CCNA, etc.( Many community colleges also offer IT related certs) Obviously, the cost of going to community college is significantly lower, were talking $2000-$5000 range while a masters is $30,000. But please take a look at these curriculum's and tell me what you think. 1) Masters Program($30,000): URL 2) Bachelors($4000-$5000): URL 3) College Certs($2000) - CyberSecurity URL - CCNA academy: URL - Network Admnistration: URL Thank you again for taking the time to read my post and I look forward to your reply "

1562,cybersecurity,ITCareerQuestions,[Cybersecurity] Should I move from a vendor to management consulting?,5,40lzq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/40lzq6/cybersecurity_should_i_move_from_a_vendor_to/,2016-01-12 21:38:49,"Hi /r/ITCareerQuestions, I am considering a career switch from cybersecurity to management consulting (in the cybersecurity field) and hope to get some opinions! Quite some background information to follow, so skip to the tl;dr if it's too much. Background: I'm 26 this year, currently living in South-East Asia and have approximately 10 years of freelance web development experience (also while in uni). I moved into cybersecurity after graduating with a Bachelor's in Computing in the UK, and had a year's training as a security analyst in the US with a well-known (in the industry) cybersecurity vendor. I've since moved back home last year and have joined the local office of the same vendor as a systems engineer, supporting the sales team with my technical expertise of the product. Everything's great: love the environment, nice colleagues, awesome manager, above average pay for a graduate and room to grow. The opportunity: I just had an interview with Booz Allen Hamilton and am expecting a job offer from them in the next few days. With BAH, they are offering the role of a consultant within a cybersecurity team, fundamentally to advise clients on their cybersecurity needs. My lack of experience is apparently not a major factor, since they are currently building up expertise in the area, and need people with various levels of experience. This is a role I have always envisioned myself to be in 5-10 years down the road after getting some years under my belt, but this opportunity will help leapfrog the process significantly. Additionally, I would be moving out of the vendor field and more towards the customer end of things, which will also help broaden my exposure. In my current job, I am already feeling a little ""closed in"" having little exposure to the rest of the industry and third party products. Apart from that, I'm expecting. BAH to offer a *very* attractive pay package with an increment in the 50%-60% range. The problem: I've only been with my local office in the new role for 3 months. My manager worked very hard to get me the 1 year training stint in the US, and bent over backwards to get me the local job after. I am eternally grateful for his help, so this puts me in a rather sticky situation! My current company is not a bad place to be. It has brand name recognition, I get to work on interesting projects with big clients, and the environment is very supportive even though I am one of the only fresh grads here. My dilemma: Should I dive into this opportunity with BAH? If so, I would be coming off as the selfish asshole moving on a whim to better prospects (the attractive pay raise doesn't help my case). Or should I stay loyal to my manager and my current company who helped kickstart my career? I honestly would be hard pressed to find a better manager! On the other hand, I can't help but feel that in a few years, I will be kicking myself for passing on this rare opportunity. It is a ""good"" problem to have, but a problem nonetheless. I can't really discuss this with anybody I know in the industry, so I'm looking forward to some thoughts from anybody! tl;dr No push factors, just a strong pull. Should I switch to management consulting from the vendor space, given that I am really happy where I am, but will be offered a better package and better exposure? Is the grass always greener on the other side?"

Qualifications: * High School Diploma and/or IT Related coursework in computer science, information technology, or other technical field of study * A commitment to excellence and to making a difference; results driven, improvement focused, and action oriented self-starter who can handle various responsibilities simultaneously and proactively and continually look for a better way of doing things Duties: * Primary point of contact for all incoming help desk support tickets and IT Helpline calls * Provides general office support to the Information Technology Director and Manager with project as assigned * Maintains a high level confidentiality with regards to all internal, external matters and other material as deemed necessary.

I've taken the bare basic IT and CS courses in university and have an A+ certification to my name. I'm currently studying for the Network+ and plan to obtain it in March (seeing as it's considered an assessment at WGU, I decided to just get a head start). I've grown up on technology - from video games to computers, I was always the individual with the proper know-how around family and friends. I believe I have the eagerness to learn about everything that is involved with a position like this, but is that enough? I really do want to begin gaining relevant experience in the field and this position seems like it would be the best opportunity I could get for a while. It's part-time, which is ideal because I want to have time to focus on my degree and other aspects of my life while I'm young, and the employer is a five minute walk from my house.

I'm looking for an entry level IT position so that I can actually work with the technology I've been learning about. I'm a little antsy and I just want to get in there and learn as much as I can and get some experience. The problem is all the positions in the area I live require anywhere from 1-3 years experience (even for help desk positions). I have not come across a single opening that does not have this requirement in addition to experience with Active Directory, VMware, etc. I live near a base and there are plenty of contractors to go around, but they all have high standards for even the junior level positions. I look online and everyone says that the A+ should be good enough, sometimes more than enough to get at least a Help Desk position. I just want to know if it's just because of the area I live in or if it's because my experience is lacking. I wouldn't mind moving somewhere to get an entry level position if that's what it takes to get experience, but how common is that with other people seeking entry level IT positions? I guess I'm just asking for some kind of guidance/support because at this point I don't know what's going to happen when I finish my second degree and I can't get a job with no experience and some certifications.

From tech writing to IT?,3,3uc3n6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/3uc3n6/30m_from_tech_writing_to_it/,2015-11-26 22:10:27,"**First, some background:** I graduated almost 10 years ago with a Bachelor of IT, and I had the choice between two offers at pretty big companies - one was an IT consulting role, and the other was a network engineering role. Honestly, I had no idea which way to go, so I decided to go the consulting route. It was primarily software dev and business analysis at client sites; however, it wasn't really what I wanted to be doing. I realised that I probably should've gone with the other job offer, but it was too late by then. Being young and ignorant I stayed at that job, addicted to the pay and the prestige of working for that company, and hoping that my career would just ""work itself out"". After 5 years there moving from project to project, I had a turning point and realised that I hated the work I was doing. I took a sabbatical, teaching English overseas and doing a bit of blogging/freelance writing on the side (as I loved writing in high school). When I returned home I was fortunate enough to get a job as a technical writer after going AWOL for a couple years. That should be the end of it, right? It was okay at first (""Hey, I'm getting paid to write stuff like this!""), but these days I struggle to find meaning in my job, and I'm getting worried that a tech writing career is going to lead nowhere. I thought back to the choice I made when I graduated, and decided to start studying for certificates and tinkering with a small homelab. I discovered that I really enjoyed what I was doing, and decided to pursue this path. **So, here's where I stand:** * I've been in the industry for a while, but I have hardly any IT experience (i.e. nothing like help desk, desktop support, or server admin). Mainly software development, BA work, and a bit of post-production dev support * I'm working on getting some certifications - currently studying for my Net+ * I'm considering network administration at the moment, but I'm still researching what's out there. * I'm lucky enough to be getting paid well above-average at my current job (which is helpful because I have a bank loan to pay off), so adjusting to a lower salary will be a challenge, especially as I have dependents to take care of. However, I understand I'll have to take a bit of a hit. **My questions:** * Will I have to bite the bullet and start over in help desk? * Are certifications still worth it at this point? * Should I just suck it up at this well-paying job and keep studying until I can get a better role? * Are there any interesting fields worth looking into? A friend of mine works in cybersecurity, which is intriguing, but it looks like you'd need some background in network/systems adminstration. Thanks for reading - appreciate any thoughts or feedback."
