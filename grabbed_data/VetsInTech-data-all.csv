I work at an office as an assistant and make about 30k/year. I live in California and that salary is a joke here. I have been reading and navigating through different careers, different salaries, tuition prices and all that. I am already 24 so I feel old and out of practice to do a 4 year degree. I thought about cybersecurity or web development as an option. Salaries seem very good, jobs seem to be in demand but I am getting a little confused about education requirements. Do I need to go back to University and get a Computer Science degree or something related or has anyone had success with bootcamps. A nearby school had a bootcamp by Trilogy Education Services and I requested information but they needed me to register and pay this week even though classes begin in December. I have looked at trainingcamp.com"

Impressively, 100% of the class passed the course on the first attempt, which has been hailed as an extraordinary accomplishment. Our veterans are simply amazing, said Katherine Webster, CEO and founder of VetsInTech. They are natural leaders, have a great work ethic and excel at working in teams across different cultures. This graduating class demonstrates the capabilities they have, especially in the #cybersecurity field. Infosec is so grateful to our veterans and honored to be partnering with VetsInTech, said Jack Koziol, CEO of Infosec. ""Most of the students in this class had little to no IT or security experience prior to taking the course. That all 20 of the students passed the exam on the first attempt is an extraordinary accomplishment and a testament to the quality and character of these veterans. VITs cybersecurity program is made possible through a $1 million gift from Craig Newmark, founder of craigslist and Craig Newmark Philanthropies. Two more Infosec Security+ courses are scheduled for VetsInTech. The next course in June will be held in San Diego, followed by an August session in Colorado Springs.
