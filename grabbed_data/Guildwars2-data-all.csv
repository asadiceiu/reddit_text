0,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Warrior Elite Spec Idea for Cantha Expansion,1,iif5yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/iif5yj/warrior_elite_spec_idea_for_cantha_expansion/,2020-08-29 06:45:35,"I would like start off by saying that this has no chance of actually happening, but I thought it would be fun to think about. I would love to see a Warrior elite spec in the next expansion that is inspired by unarmed martial arts. The spec wouldn't actually use a weapon, but it would give you skills for each hand that is free. So if you have no weapons, your skills could look like this (skills below are not balanced, just an example of what it could look like): 1. Strike 1. Basic attack chain, ends with applying weakness 2. [Power Attack](URL 1. Always a critical hit, applies vulnerability 2. 4 second cooldown 3. [Flail](URL 1. Stance 2. Gain quickness for 3 seconds 3. Reduce movement speed for 3 seconds 4. 10 second cooldown 4. [Distracting Blow](URL 1. Dazes for 0.5 seconds 2. 10 second cooldown 5. [Grapple](URL 1. Knockdown yourself and enemy 2. 15 second cooldown Where I think this idea would shine is that you can choose to wear a one-handed weapon or off-hand weapon and you could still get the skills from this unarmed specialization (i.e. if you have an empty main hand and a shield, you would get all the shield skills plus Skills 1, 2, and 3 from the unarmed skill list). I think that would provide a lot of build customization. That said, here are some reasons this will not happen: * There would be no signature ascended weapon for the class, so what would the collection even be for? * Without weapons, you miss out on two big stat items in your equipment, so it would be hard to justify ever getting this specialization (I guess they can just buff the skills to compensate, but that sounds like a balancing nightmare). * This elite spec's trait line would probably be too similar to the non-elite Strength traits and Physical utility skills. They can also allow the Warrior to wear Focuses in the main hand or off hand and pretend like they are ""fist weapons,"" but that is probably too stupid (I would love to see it though). Anyway, I was bored and felt like getting that idea out there. Anyone else have any far-fetched elite spec ideas for the coming expansion?"
1,vulnerability,Guildwars2,5-Man Twin Largos | 5:14 Kill,79,hr8qw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/hr8qw6/5man_twin_largos_514_kill/,2020-07-15 06:01:21,"&amp;#x200B; # Let's Not Do That Again (seriously) Hey there Reddit! Back in May, I formed up some friends to tackle 5 man Largos after realizing how strong condi chrono (cChrono) was (pre July 7th patch). At first, our goal was ""let's just kill it"", but it very quickly turned into ""let's kill it ***really fast***"". The intention was to spend even more time theorycrafting but on such short notice of the changes to cChrono, we had to act fast and ended up developing the split phase strats in just a few days for a somewhat scuffed kill. While we all know that we can do better than this, getting a kill that's just over a minute better than the previous \[SC\]\[CnD\] run is something we're satisfied with. A sub 5 minute kill is definitely possible and can probably be grinded out to the 4:45 range. The nerf to cChrono hurts, somewhere in the 10% range, but it's possible that we could make up for the lost damage and more with cleaner movement and strats. This was my first experience grinding out and researching a boss for a record kill time and it's been a blast, I hope to stick around for even more speedruns. **The Roster** Pupsi (Ruffy.2508), Puddles (dissa.1632), Felix (mordefelix.5826) - DPS cChronos Chem (Chemistry Practical.5806), Levi (Brokenyew.3901) - Heal Tank Druids/DPS cChronos Proto (Mordrede.6872) - StM (*Seize the Moment*) cChrono Shoutouts to: Kacodo, Reckoner, Emi, and Atomic Elf for filling for us as DPS cChronos and saving us from the forbidden 4-Man Largos. **Composition** * We opted to go for the highest damage composition: 1 heal druid tank and 4 cChronos, also seen in the latest Largos record by \[dP\]. The most significant component of this is being able to stack cChronos to remove the need for a dedicated alacrity-giving chrono and to instead have a full dps, 0% boon duration cChrono with StM for quickness. The druid handling the tanking mechanic itself offers a very minor dps increase by allowing the usual tank chrono to drop their toughness/vitality for power/precision and allows the chrono to use scepter 2 double-tap/blocks more deliberately. * Each cChrono dropped their expertise signet in order to free up a utility slot for an ethereal field of some kind \[*build was courtesy of dP*\], and this loss was made up by taking more viper's pieces and some expertise infusions. For our fields, we ran 3 alacrity wells with 1 feedback. Ideally, there is at least one feedback in each sub for extra damage since feedback lasts twice as long as the alacrity well. Our pistol 4 phantasm projectiles and pistol 5 projectile would pick up finishers from these fields for extra confusion, in addition to blind finishers from the smoke field from the druid's smokescale (*whenever the smokescale was actually on group...*). * The druid here ran minstrel's gear for tanking slotted with Monk runes. Alternative rune sets were considered, like Pack runes for better might/fury and Herald runes for better protection uptime, however the outgoing healing modifier was too good to replace. * For weapon sets, x/warhorn is absolutely necessary for vulnerability and boon uptime. Sword/warhorn was what was settled on as axe has too many projectiles and would steal field finishers from the cChrono projectiles. Greatsword was considered on the other weapon set in order to tank tornados, but staff became more valuable after the Kenut tanking pattern was more ironed out as staff offered more mobility and healing. * It was also found that marksmanship works very well in maintaining might from pet swapping and giving more vulnerability each time the druid gained fury. Specifically, there's a vulnerability gap with cChronos as the only DPS. Base storm spirit applies 6 seconds of vulnerability every 10 seconds, so cChronos can only apply 9 seconds of vulnerability every 10 seconds. This 1 second missing of vulnerability has to be made up for by the druid. * Build used in the kill can be found[ here](URL **Nikare P1** The main motivation behind our movements was to mitigate the effects of Nikare's dashes, which meant finding a way to control the dashes in a way that minimized dash distance. The dashes are controlled by targeting: furthest -&gt; furthest -&gt; tank. While our tanking shortened the length of the dashes as much as possible, this does not mean Nikare starts auto attacking sooner. This is because he remains animation locked even when dashing into the wall. The main benefits of shortening the dash distances are: clones shatter on Nikare faster, the torch 5 phantasm travel time is reduced, the path of the projectiles is consistent, and safer and predictable movement. * Starting the fight itself already has a nuance: Nikare spawns on the platform and performs an animation where he bows. Hitting him before this animation goes off means that his attack pattern is RNG before first dash, which is tragic for cChronos because they could miss their block and it would throw off the timing of the rotation. However, if Nikare is attacked after/during this animation, the attack pattern of 4 autos into bubbles is always preserved. This means that precasting anything that damages is a no-go because it would randomize the attack pattern. For this reason, sun spirit is precasted on the far edge of the platform because it was found out that time warp procs the sun spirit's burning buff and would start the fight early. * The first dash set *(a set of 3 dashes)* is handled in the same way that the current \[dP\] record handles it. We all stack North for the first block and the cChronos rotated about 90 degrees, back out slightly, and enter CS *(Continuum Split).* The first dash is blocked and Nikare is chased down by the cChronos until CS ends which enables the druid, who moves to the tanking spot during the first dash, to take aggro of the last two dashes. This puts Nikare on the northmost edge at the end of the last dash, which is where we tanked him for the rest of P1 to eliminate movement. The first knockback bubbles were mitigated by nature spirit stability (*only trusting it about 75% of the time...*). * Every dash set afterwards is handled by having the StM cChrono move out and bait out the first dash. This gives the DPS cChronos enough time to react to the second dash, and lets the druid tank keep Nikare where he ended up at the end of the 3rd dash. Specifically, the tanking spot is the midpoint of the north edge. Ideally, Nikare dashes first to the midpoint of the edge counter-clockwise of the north edge, back to group on the second, and towards the north tanking position on the third dash covering very little distance. * We spent probably 90% of the time optimizing this single aspect of the fight on Nikare P1. As far as we know, dashes occur approximately every 30 seconds/ 16 autos with a large variance in the amount of time/autos. This is because making Nikare do something that isn't autos, as in things that have a cast time like bubbles or any movement, will ""eat"" an amount of autos before the next dash. Ideally, you get about 16 autos between dashes, where each dash is preceded by bubbles; but if autos are eaten before hand because of early bubbles or movement, dashes can happen after, say, only 14 autos. * We had the StM cChrono bait out the first dash in every subsequent dash set as we lost the lowest amount of DPS by doing so. It's possible to have the druid tank bait this dash out, but the timing in general is too tight for this to happen because it could result in Nikare moving. * Tide pools were handled aggressively: the first tide pool gets dropped at center. We are able to get away with this because we tanked on the edge, far enough from the tide pool that it would take a while for it to overwhelm us. If someone on group got a tide pool, they would walk out slightly backwards and drop it behind group. If the StM baiter got a tide pool, they would walk towards the baiting spot drop it there. These pools would often cause trouble with baiting so we tried to see if the mechanic could be baited but we've concluded that it is RNG, at least with respect to relative positioning to Nikare. * Knockback circles are usually dodged or blocked but the first one is stabbed through. However, sometimes the circles are overlapping which means that one stack of stability is not enough. To reduce the chance of getting knocked by both circles, the cChronos moved to the edge of the circle hitboxes. The circles have a target cap of around 5 which includes minions, spirits, clone, phantasms, etc, and prioritizes targets closest to the center of the circle. * In the \[dP\] record, their DPS check was to phase before the second dash set; our DPS check was to phase before the third dash set, which required around 160k squad DPS. This was a very tough DPS check to hit, and in fact in our kill we did not meet this check. Additionally, we had to phase before we got overwhelmed by aggressive tide pool placement. **Kenut P1** * In our kill, there's not much going on here as we spent very little time researching detailed strats for Kenut P1. We tanked center until the first boon rip attack, which is baited out by a DPS cChrono. This is overall a DPS loss but we did it this way because the StM cChrono has to focus on getting enough quickness stacks out to the group before the first boon rip and the druid tank was focusing on getting boons and spirits up. The druid would move and tank at the bait spot where the bait spot is generally free of tornados. Just like in the current \[dP\] record, the druid ran celerity to guarantee enough quickness. * In later runs, we would actually stack tight enough on Kenut to enable the tank druid to also kite. **Split Phases (Nikare and Kenut P2 + P3)** As mentioned earlier, we expected to have more time to theorycraft the split platforms, but our time was cut short by the balance patch (*and not wanting to re-optimize our gameplay with new shatters*). The biggest motivation for our deliberate movements was to maintain spirit uptime for higher damage and better boon uptimes for safer phases. * By moving optimally to Kenut P2, we got a no-tornado platform. Again, we tanked center until the CC phase, and then moved to the west-most side. No tornadoes became crucial in having high enough platform DPS to glide directly to the Nikare P2 spout. This was needed for our druid so that he didn't have to land in the water and lose his spirits. * In later runs, the cChronos would actually only glide halfway to the spout, and use underwater skills to superspeed dash to the Nikare spout for a few seconds timesave. * Our first tanking position on Nikare P2 was on the east-most side. This is where the druid tank would pull their spirits and give boons. After dashing, the new tanking position would be at the north-most side. After phasing, we would wait on the east-most side of Nikare P3. This small amount of time was to allow the spirit pull abilities to come off cooldown for Kenut P3. This is the biggest difference in P3 when comparing our run to the \[SC\]\[CnD\] run. * We waited for bubbles to appear on Nikare P3 and used that as our cue to glide to Kenut P3. The druid would give boons on the west-most side and we would move back center to kill. We had to kill Kenut before Nikare since we phased Kenut to P3 before Nikare. * We killed Nikare on the west-most side again for spirits while trying to avoid Nikare's massive cleave. **Takeaways** * Nikare should be tanked on edge in non-mirage comps to ensure no movement outside of dashes. Alternatively for mirage comps, tank close to the edge, where the only movement should be after the last dash. Tank should move in order to bait the second and third dashes in a way that the third dash's distance is minimized and so that the stack can only get hit a maximum of two times. * If possible, Nikare side druids should learn to bait the first dash to further minimize the danger of the dashes. * Kenut baiters should bait to a spot that will be free of tornados and the tank should move to the bait position. * Druids should be very aware of their spirit positioning and pulling to ensure spirit uptime for safer and faster runs * Druids can consider dropping skirmishing for marksmanship 3-3-2 if they find that vulnerability is low or need extra boons at split phases. There should not be issues with boons or vulnerability on Nikare and Kenut P1 with a 10 man composition and 2 druids. * *Bonus: the pre-event scales with how many people are in instance. We found that we low-manned the pre-event faster with a fractal-like comp faster than many PuGs do with a full 10 man squad.* **Log and PoVs** Log:[ URL [Levi](URL \- Heal Tank Druid [Puddles](URL \- DPS cChrono [Felix](URL \- DPS cChrono [Proto](URL \- StM cChrono"
2,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Dread Power Core Necro SPvP Guide: When you have no friends left to disappoint and plenty of enemies to BM,1,hsnai9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/hsnai9/dread_power_core_necro_spvp_guide_when_you_have/,2020-07-17 12:08:00,"**Prefacing this by saying:** *This build isn't for everyone, it's incredibly squishy and inefficient, more on that at the bottom.* **Intro:** Hi everyone. Never really done this before. I'm not on any real GW2 community sites like Metabattle nor want to make a Youtube video. So kinda hoping this gets some traction. So ever since the new spite trait Dread was revealed I was curious: Who TF was this for? It doesn't make much sense in pve, after all most fury and quickness buffs would be applied by a dedicated boon giver. Likewise, it's not really for Reaper pvp either. Reaper already gives itself quickness where it counts during shroud through Reaper's Onslaught. Even if you wanted to try taking Blighter's Boon or Deathly Chill (which I'm not sure why), you would have to sacrifice either the life force, crit, and damage from Soul Reaping or the only sustain keeping you alive in Blood Magic. Even then, there's probably more appealing options if you get that far considering that Reaper's Onslaught also reduces your shroud cds when you complete an auto attack chain and gives you 300 ferocity. So, through process of elimination, I nailed it down to Core (I never really considered Scourge that seriously despite Power Scourge in WvWvW, as it's shroud skills are more focused on conditions) and tried a couple different variants. In the end this is the *disgusting abomination* I came up with. **The Build**: 1. Valkyrie Amulet (1200 Power - 900 Ferocity - 900 Vitality, this'll make more sense when you see the traits, you actually don't need any precision at all in this build so the extra vitality really helps) 2. Runes of Speed (gotta go fast, especially key for juking) 3. Staff - Axe/Warhorn (staff has fear on its staff 5, along with good life force generation, while axe is the main power dps weapon and warhorn gives swiftness for rune of speed). Staff sigils are energy/escape, axe/warhorn sigils are doom and exposure (Staff once again is for utility/survive, axe is for burst so you want to apply vulnerability for axe 2 and poison to reduce healing they might be receiving). 4. For Traits, top being 1 mid being 2 and bottom being 3... Spite 111 Curse 231 Soul Reaping 232 . The key thing here is you won't have Blood Magic's Unholy Martyr, so if you get conditions during shroud you're going to have to prioritize a condition cleanse after shroud ends. Furthermore, you don't have any real sustain or defense on your own without Blood Magic (ignoring allies you'll have protection from elite skills should you choose to take them and Weakening Shroud... that's it!). so you need the extra Vitality from Valkyrie Amulet. As for crit/precision, along with the default % you're picking up a random 180 precision from Curses, 2% crit per condition(you'll usually get 6-10% from your own conditions but can have like 14-16% on focused targets) , 20% from fury (which is often, its when you enter shroud or fear), and then 33% in shroud giving you about 40% out of shroud, 77% in shroud, and 90% in Lich Form. *Lich Form gives added crit, which is key*. I take improved fear over 10% damage in Soul Reaping since people are trained to just ignore the fear, and that's usually enough time to kill them. And it's also nice to keep enemies other than your target feared for longer, especially considering your spectral ring and staff 5 are aoe. 5. Heal, Utility, and Elite traits are Consume Conditions, Spectral Ring, Spectral Walk, Lich Form. Again, you kind of need to sacrifice boonstrip for condi cleanses and stun breaks, since you're very squishy. You should still have enough boonstrip with Weakening Shroud, Chill of Death, and Unholy Feast to get kills anyways. The good news is with all of your fears and jukes you can avoid a lot of power damage. Though taking things like Flesh Wurm could be interesting, I have found a lot more success with things like Well of Power and Spectral Ring due to their persistence in shroud and Lichform. **How to play:** So what does this all mean? This means with this build you are generally getting powerful spikes of burst damage off of axe 2, Shroud 5+4, Shroud 1, and especially Lich Form. Lich form with no quickness was nerfed. Lichform with quickness, especially on a squishy target that's being feared by Lichform 3, just rips through people like they're paper. You can generally surprise a lot of people in average combat as they aren't expecting a Core necro to burst down so quickly. And every 150 seconds you get access to a form that kills multiple people in about 4-6 seconds. It's... it's cute. *The key thing to remember though* is that *Dread has a 3 second internal cooldown*, meaning you don't want to spam your fears. Instead, you want to intermix them in your rotation. Ideally for instance you'll start off with a staff 3 to set some chill and poison on the target, staff 5 to fear (or just initiate with a staff 5 if you think the person will try to dodge roll after the staff 3 or is too close), and then immediately switch to axe/warhorn and axe 2. You should prepare to go either Lichform or Shroud depending on the situation, but remember to time yourself to wait on fearing until the 3 second internal cd is done. You don't want to waste a cooldown, especially on your lich form, for a not-as-OP state. A good indicator is when you notice your quickness is about to expire. A quickness from fear about to expire mean it's been a little less than 5 seconds and means you're ready for another one. So why does this suck? Well for starters it's incredibly unreliable. Power Reaper does its job a lot better because it has access to three stacks of stability on shroud 3 during its combo. You barely have access to one stack of stability during Lichform. Getting interrupted makes you panic as you try to hide, contemplating why you chose to be a disappointment in life. If you get interrupted and rooted in shroud just sit there even more useless. It also takes away a lot of the sustain of Core Necro. There's only so much 900 vitality, shroud, and your small bag of tricks can do. You're going to have to be incredibly judicious with jukes, stunbreaks, and dodge rolls to not be downed all the time. Lastly, it takes away the support aspect people have come to know and expect from Core (even if Ritual of Life was nerfed into the ground). The good news is you can kill enemies faster than a core necro can rally them anyways (besides, an Elementalist's glyph of renewal is the new team rally anyways). **tl;dr:** It's a meme build for killing unsuspecting players who won't target you because they think you're tanky and won't avoid your damage because they think you hit like a wet noodle. But it is more unreliable in killing than Reaper, and more unreliable in supporting/surviving than a traditional Core necro."

As a writer and game designer, I couldnt help myself to do this new specs brainstorming, getting on board with the next expansion hype train. I know this isnt new, spec brainstorming is always out there, and with all the rumors about the next expansion taking place in Cantha, Im pretty sure our new elite specs will have a canthian background. So far, GW2 has done a terrific job in creating expansion themed specs (especially Druid, Scrapper, Mirage, Scourge, and many others I wont just list here because you already know them), and probably well get specs like Ninja-Thief, Samurai-Warrior, Fireworks-Engineer, and stuff like that. However, for this list my angle was to strengthen the stereotype of each profession fantasy: The Warriorest Warrior, the Rangerest Ranger, the Elementalistest Elementalist (try saying this 5 times in a row), the Necromancerest Necromancer, etc. Btw, I also think Arenanet will give us new weapons for the next batch of specs, but thats just my opinion! Thisll be long, so heres a TL;DR list: * Elementalist - Ascendant * Engineer - Tinker * Guardian - Keeper * Mesmer - Hypnotist * Necromancer - Warlock * Ranger - Hunter * Revenant - Golemancer * Thief - Swashbuckler * Warrior - Vanguard Feel free to read through the entire post, or go straight to your favorite professions and leave your comments/ideas :D **Elementalist: Ascendant** * Focused on attuning to only one element. They cant change attunements in combat but they can Weapon Swap. * Attunements replaced by Ascendancy. * Ascendancy have extra effects (you can still attune to the same element). * One of these extra effects must be reducing the recharge time on conjured weapons. Fire attunement reduces the recharge on Lava Axe, Water reduces Frost bow, Air reduces Storm Hammer, Earth reduces Stone Shield. * New weapon: Shield. * Skills are about absorbing damage and reflecting the attuned element. * New utilities: Mantras. Recite Power Words to gain a powerful spell; the final spell depends on the attunement. * For example: *Power Word: Shield*. Recite the words of a protective spell, gaining Barrier and Stability. When its finished, it creates a spell that grants Barrier and an aura based on your attunement. * *Power Word: Control.* Recite the words of a controlling spell, launching nearby foes. When its finished, it creates a spell that damages an enemy and inflicts a controlling condition (Fire: Cripple, Water: Chilled; Air: Blind; Earth: Immobilize). * Like the Arcane spec, most traits vary according to your attunement. * Consider removing the *Conjurer* trait from Fire spec and give it to this spec, changing the tooltip to Gain an aura based on your Attunement. &amp;#x200B; **Engineer: Tinker** * An inventor, strategist and tactician in the battlefield, focuses on support and Condition Damage. * Toolbelt skills replaced with Stations. * Each Station gives 5 charges of the same weapon or tool, occupying the weapon slots from 1 to 5. Each time a charge is used, the slot becomes depleted. When 5 charges are depleted, you go back to your weapons. * Stations can be used by other 4 players, and they offer different utilities mixed with minor damage. * Example: F1 Station - Relief Canister Module. A grenade that explodes around the user for a minor self heal and a decent ally heal. * F2 Station - Gunk Lab. Gives 5 charges of throw Gunk. * Each Elite Skill provides a unique Station. For example, the Elite Mortar Kit no longer provides with Orbital Strike, but instead the F5 now places a Station that grants a powerful Bazooka. * New weapon: Main hand Dagger. * Weapon collection Dagger is an epic swiss army knife. * New utility skills: Meditation. The Tinker has a brief lapsus of geniusness. * Example: *Eureka!* \- Cures a condition, breaks stun and heals for a moderate amount for you and nearby players (literally finds the solution for the current problem). * Elite Skill: *Train of thought* \- Your 10 following skills/attacks inflict increasing conditions. * 1 - Vulnerability; 2 Vuln + Bleed; 3 Vuln + Bleed + Burn; 4 Vuln + Bleed + Burn + Confusion; 5 Vuln + Bleed + Burn + Conf + Weakness, and so on, and so on. * The F5 Station for this skill gives 2 charges of Consume Plasma. &amp;#x200B; **Guardian: Keeper** * Focused on defense and aggressive/defensive tactics. * Gain 2 new virtues; you can select which are your 3 active virtues. * Virtue of Fortitude - Passive: Taunt enemies for 1 second every few attacks (10?). Active: Grants Retaliation to you and allies. * Virtue of Temperance. Passive: reduce incoming damage and condi damage by 10%. Active: Grants Protection to you and allies. * New weapon: Main hand shield. * Yes, you can Dual wield Shields. In fact a trait would grant you bonus damage if you use two shields. * New Utility skills: Stances. How you position your shields is important. * For Example: *Dragon Wings* \- Knockdown and damage enemies with each pulse. 3 Pulses. * *Testudo* (like the famous Roman formation) - Become immobile and invulnerable for 3 seconds, gaining Stability and reflecting incoming projectiles. &amp;#x200B; **Mesmer: Hypnotist** * Applies a special effect called Hypnosis; your attacks and skills benefit from affecting hypnotized targets. * Spec focuses on direct damage, criticals and a tad of Confusion for extra damage. * Shatter skills replaced with Hypno skills. Your Clones now invade an possess (Hypnotize) the target instead of being shattered. * For example: F1 *Narcolepsy* \- Each clone applies 2 seconds of Hypnotize, deal increased damage for each clone. * *F4 Gallus Gallus Identity* \- Each clone applies 3 seconds of Hypnotize, and 0,5 seconds of Polymorph into a chicken. * New weapon: Main hand Dagger (throwing daggers, 900 yrd range) * Weapon collection is a dagger with a pendulum. * Deals more damage to Hypnotized targets. * Utility Skills: Nightmares. Are considerably more powerful against hypnotized targets. * For example: *Dream Eater* \- Inflicts Cripple and Weakness to the enemy. Double duration to Hypnotized targets. * *Sleep Paralysis* \- Stun the target. Deals critical damage if the target is Hypnotized. &amp;#x200B; **Necromancer: Warlock** * Dark magic and demonic pacts. * Death Shroud replaced with Soul Contract. Offer your soul to a Demon to gain power; you become possessed and gain empowered utility skills. * Focused on inflicting burning and torment. * New weapon: Sword. * Spec collection items make you look like a demonic cultist. * New utility skills: Pacts. Deal damage to yourself to gain life force and useful skills. * For example: *Imp Pact*. Burn yourself and your foe. Gain life force every two seconds while you are inflicted with Burning. * *Djinn Pact*. Damage yourself and block the next three attacks (three wishes!). Release a torrent of fire and shadow with every block, inflicting conditions (Burning and Torment) and gaining life force. * Utility skills while Soul Contract is active: Hell Gates. Momentary gates to hell that summon infernal horrors. * *Flames from Hell.* A whirlwind of fire erupts from the ground, initially blinding enemies. Combo field fire. Combo finisher: whirl. * *Elite Skill: Demonic Servant.* Summons the servant of the demon you signed the contract with. The Servant drains your life force to sustain itself and deals massive damage. &amp;#x200B; **Ranger: Hunter** * Extra love for the pet+ranged combat combo. * New weapon: Rifle. * Pets replaced with Primal pets, which are harder to kill but deal less damage. * Primal pets: Stonehead, Dolyak, and others. * They offer a wide range of CC options. * Beast Mastery traits focus mostly on pet damage; pet related traits for Hunters are focused on bulkiness and utility. * Make it so Beast Mastery doesnt feel mandatory for the build. * Rifle skills have same long range as Longbow. * Can be both Condi or Power. * Condi works with Bleeding and Burning. * Power works with raw Power instead of Ferocity and crits. * New utilities: Coordination. They affect your pet and next attacks in one way, and your next attacks in another way, similar to Thiefs Venoms. * For example: *Aim for the Head*. Your pet next 2 attacks Taunt. Your next 3 attacks deal increased damage; each attack deals 5% more damage than the previous one. * *Oil coating.* Your pet next attack knocks down the opponent (makes them slip). Your next few attacks extend the duration of burning on your targets. Attacks also apply an extra stack of Burning if the target is already burning. &amp;#x200B; **Revenant: Golemancer** * Legendary Asura Stance: Snaff!! We all love Snaff. Period. * While most common people must do a lot of research to become a Golemancer, its rather easy for Revenants who commune with Snaff. * New weapon: Off-hand Focus. * Weapon Collection is Snaffs Golemancy Arm. * Ancient Echo replaced with a Golem pet that has different skills depending on the channeled legend. * F2 is Golems special skill (depends on current legend); F3 Commands the golem to attack; F4 commands the Golem to retreat. * You can use dyes to customize your Golem! * Utilities are Legendary Golemancer. They act like Ranger Commands, for they command your Golem to do stuff. * For example: *Magnetic Pulse*. First use pulls nearby foes towards the Golem. Second use pushes them away. * Elite skill - *Meteor Strike*. The Golem leaps to target area, landing with a massive force. Deals a lot of damage, applies Burning and Cripple and the Golem gains Quickness. Leap finisher. &amp;#x200B; **Thief: Swashbuckler.** * Yarrr!! * Steal replaced with *Parley*. Stun your target and become invulnerable for 1 second. No longer shadowsteps. * Spec Mechanic: Gold Coins. Passively stack gold coins when you use Parley and some skills. When enough Gold Coins, consume all stacks and call for a cannon barrage on your location. * New weapon: Axe. * Stealth Attack grants Gold Coins. * Weapon collection includes a shoulder pad with a flapping Parrot. * New Utility skills: Treasures. Magical trinkets from all across Tyria! Similar to Signets, but both passive and active effects trigger the cooldown. * Examples: Elonian Ankh; Arah Gemstone; Tarir Runestone, etc. * *Elonian Ankh* \- Healing Skill - Passive: prevents from being downed and heals for a decent amount, but the cooldown is doubled. Active: heals for a decent amount and applies Barrier. * *Arah Gemstone* \- Passive: go into stealth after disabling an enemy and your next Stealth Attack applies 3 stacks of Poisoned. Active: emit a shadow nova that applies Daze and Poison to nearby enemies. Both have same cooldown. &amp;#x200B; **Warrior: Vanguard** * Burst skill replaced with War Zone, which creates an area that benefits allies and dampens enemies. Vanguard Warriors are greatly benefited by War Zone. * War Zone is a Smoke Combo Field. Spec fantasy toys around shaping the battlefield with smoke and other tactics. * Supportive/defensive spec with a possible Dps build. * New weapon: Scepter (Best combinations with Shield or Warhorn). * New utility skills: Command. Work in a similar way to Shouts, but they provide different benefits to allies. * For Example: *Forward!* Rush forward and Daze your foe, while granting Swiftness and Quickness to nearby allies. Leap finisher and breaks stuns. * *Retreat!* Gain Barrier while granting nearby allies with Superspeed. * Scepter skill 3: *Raise Morale*. Boosts you and your allies with boons. Grants a chunk of adrenaline. * Traits benefit granting and gaining Boons and Barrier. * A trait would grant you a boost to your damage after leaving Stealth. Warriors have many Leap and Blast finishers, Vanguards would gain Stealth often because of War Zone."

Warrior gains a great amount of DPS thanks to that fire aura and is the best dps class for this fight. To further increase everybodys DPS we brought a Power Holosmith that shares Pinpoint Distribution and also provides vulnerability. The reflect mechanic of the fight was handled by a Mirage with the traditional Feedback skill. I believe the hardest part of the fight was to sustain the damage with close to zero group healing as the only healing we relied on was the regeneration provided by the boon Daredevil and everybodys personal heal skill. # Our Squad Comp: (click on the names for each Point of view) |Subgroup 1|Subgroup 2|no subgroup| |:-|:-|:-| |[Aura Share Condition Weaver (Roul)](URL |[Soulbeast (Alex)](URL Daredevil (Trace)](URL |[Banner Condition Warrior (Luna)](URL |[Power Holo (Hint)](URL Mirage (Nika)](URL | |[Condition Warrior (Obvious Trash)](URL ||[Condition Renegade (Kiki)](URL |[Condition Warrior (Stijn)](URL ||Condition Renegade (MrTea)| &amp;#x200B; # Join our Community [Discord](URL if you have any questions or just to hang out. # Visit our website: [Snowcrows.com](URL"
8,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Elite Specialization Idea: Bioengineer,11,g2c1x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/g2c1x9/elite_specialization_idea_bioengineer/,2020-04-16 19:54:45,"Prelude note: This is simply brainstorming, from a player who is in no way shape or form super experienced or a pro in the game; as such, some details of the spec are not covered in this and/or may need balancing tweaks. &amp;#x200B; The Bioengineer Bioengineers are elite specializations of Engineers (woah!); they combine several fantasy-scifi themes such as that of the alchemist, the fleshcrafter, the haemonculus, bio-augmentation and the concept of the supersoldier, or else such biological modifications. As a spec, Bioengineers gain benefits to their overall performance and abilities, be they favouring melee combat or ranged accuracy by modifying their bodies through chemical, surgical and other scientific means, and by the end of their experiments gain the ability to vat-grow a unique type of genetically-tailored custom lifeform, one of its kind and docile enough to be controlled, catch-all called a Chimera. &amp;#x200B; Profession Mechanic: Combat Drugs replace the Elite Toolbet skill of the Engineer, allowing them to inject themselves with various stimulants and potent medicine, which convert specific conditions suffered into specific boons. (Example: Poison condition &gt; Regeneration boon, Chilled &gt; Swiftness etc). &amp;#x200B; Traits: \- Minor Trait/Weapon Proficiency: Surgeon - Allows the Bioengineer to yield Daggers in either hand; Dagger mainhand skills: Skill1 Vivisection: a tri-part combo of swift slicing and stabbing accurate hits, the third of which applies Vulnerability on the target; Skill 2 Surgical Cut: a slower, deep cleave applied on a single target to rip them open, applying Bleeding and Cripple; Skill 3 Terminal Stab: deliver an aimed strike on a vital part of the enemy's body, which has an increased chance to critically hit and Stuns (1s) the target; if it crits, the skill recharges faster/lowers cooldown. Dagger offhand skills: Skill 4 Scalper Swoop: Throw several scalpels from between your fingers in a cone infront of you, hitting up to 3 targets in a 600 range; Skill 5 Biowarfare: Coat your blades and ammunition with a deadly toxin, causing your following attacks and abilities to apply extra Poison condition to their targets. \- Minor Adept: Combat Drugs - gain access to the combat drug toolbelt skill, aswell as a few Injection type skills that provide various buffs and boons; \- Major Adept1: Field Surgeon - gain extra Healing Power when yielding a dagger; convert a percentage of your Precision into Healing Power; \- Major Adept2: Stamina Stimulants - regenerate Endurance faster; gain Vigor at the end of a dodge roll; \- Major Adept3: Rebouncing Robustness - when struck by physical types of crowd control and displacement (Stuns, launches, knock-up/down/backs etc), gain Regeneration that stacks/refreshes with consecutive suffered conditions of the same type; \- Minor Master: Enhanced Muscle Fibers - periodically gain Might in combat while attacking or using skills on a cooldown interval; \- Major Master1: Enhanced Reflexes - Successfully evading, dodging, blocking, or criticially striking a foe grants a 1-2s Quickness; \- Major Master2: Enhanced Immune System - Periodically cleanse yourself of a stack of a single condition of Poison, Bleeding or Torment; cleansing these conditions with any ability grants an equal stack of Regeneration; \- Major Master3: Enhanced Perception - Deal extra damage to foes above a range treshhold (600+); briefly Mark foes on which you apply a Condition; \- Minor Grandmaster: Nutritional Efficiency - gain extra Vitality; a percentage of your vitality is converted into Concentration; \- Major Grandmaster1: Neural Resistance - Periodically cleanse yourself of a stack of a mental-derived condition such as Fear, Taunt and Confusion, and convert them into their corresponding positive boons; \- Major Grandmaster2: Chemical Warfare - Poison you apply to enemies also Blinds and Cripples them; \- Major Grandmaster 3: Super Soldier - your Toughness is increased; gain Retaliation when struck by a Critical Hit. &amp;#x200B; Chimera: When Bioengineer is fully mastered (all hero points/traits unlocked), the engineer gets a mini crafting-like menu to manage their vatgrown lifeform project; this menu automatically saves its progress and can be opened and closed at will by right-clicking the Bioengineer trait menu. ""Crafting"" the Chimera lifeform takes a symbolic amount of Reagent investment, through which the Bioengineer extracts valuable bio-genetical information and biomass to use in their custom creature. The Crafting Slots for reagents are five, and their composition determinates the Type of the chimera lifeform that can be grown out of it. The Type of the Chimera determinates its appearence and its set of skills and stats. Mechanically, the Chimera acts as a powerful Minion, but shares similiarity with a Pet in becoming inactive instead of dying when its health is depleted. almost all Chimera type recipes universally require a reagent for its cranium (skull) and a reagent for its general tissue composition (meat). In terms of appearence, they use 5 custom models in total, all of which resemble existing creatures somewhat, but are clearly unnatural (as in vat-grown), with streamlined muscle growth and biologically-advantageous features that would be otherwise too costly to maintain/evolve into in wild nature. Types of Chimera: \- Hulking Beast: a massive quadpedal lifeform with dense bone and muscle structure and covered in biological scales, spikes and a shell, this creature has the mass and strength to crush even a Norn to a pulp. Has the largest healthpool and toughness out of the chimera types, and attacks that knock down/back/launch their target foes on an interval basis while dealing respectable direct damage; Appearence: Think of a mammoth crossed with a crab crossed with a hedgehog crossed with a horned beetle crossed with an armadillo. Crafting Requirements: 1x Large Skull, 1x Slab of Red Meat, 1x Ancient Bone, 1x Armored Scale and 1x Vial of Powerful Blood. \- Perfect Predator: A muscular, sleek and aerodynamic quadpedal lifeform capable of fast, vicious and efficient attacks to hunt down and kill their prey quickly. Has increased movement speed compared to other Types of Chimera, and attacks that close the distance between the predator and the target with leaps/sprints that apply bleeding and cripples, and highest direct damage of them all. Appearence: Think of a predator canine crossed with a predator feline, on steroids, with xenomorph (Aliens)-like elonged head and shoulderblades/spikes. Crafting Requirements: 1x Large Skull, 1x Slab of Red Meat, 1x Vicious Claw, 1x Vicious Fang, 1x Vial of Powerful Blood. \- Toxic Arthropoid: An oversized, 30+ legged insectoid-arachnoid carapaced creature that stores an extremely lethal form of venom in their sacs and stingers. This type of Chimera has limited ranged capabilities mixed with melee attacks, all of which apply Poison condition to their targets; it is also the 2nd most durable type of chimera in healthpool thanks to its exoskeleton nature. Appearence: A giant centipede that burrowed extra traits and appendages from spiders, scorpions and wasps to create the ultimate nightmare fuel. Crafting Requirements: 1x Large Skull, 1x Leaf Fossil, 1x Powerful Venom Sac, 1x Vicious Fang, 1x Armored Scale. \- Molluscoid Monster: With a smooth biomass made of tentacles, this amphibious fiend is a versatile and adaptive creature capable of restraining its target with its many flexible limbs. Its attacks Immobilize the target on an interval, and its touch apply Weakness to those it grabs with its tendrils. In addition, this type of chimera gains increased healthpool and power when fighting underwater. Appearence: A cross between octopus, squids, jellyfish and other tentacled or snailish creatures or perhaps a Lovecraft horror; female Pact Commanders are adviced to not get too ""friendly"" with this being. Crafting Requirements: 1x Large Skull, 1x Slab of Red Meat, 1x Giant Eye, 1x Pearl, 1x Armored Scale. \- Draconoid Serpent: A legless, long-bodied creature adourned with a set of wings, this dragon-inspired lifeform employs is flight capability, slithering grace, fire breath and camouflage to strike at its targets and apply Vulnerability and Burning effects on them with hit-and-run medium ranged attacks. This type of Chimera will use an attack, then use a form to disengage - either fly away with Evade or camouflage in Stealth, then repeat this pattern. The draconoid remains camouflaged until combat is first initiated. Appearence: A snake crossed with a chamelleon crossed with bird (for wings); very close to aztec/mayan dragons or chinese dragons in mythology. Crafting Requirements: 1x Large Skull, 1x Pile of Crystaline Dust, 1x Armored Scale, 1x Vial of Powerful Blood, 1x Vicious Fang. &amp;#x200B; Once ""crafted"", Chimera lifeforms can be switched on will (out of combat) by the Bioengineer, but only one Chimera may be active at a time, through the trait menu. Each type of chimera only need to be crafted once to be permanently unlocked. The Chimera act as a powerful, but dumb, ally to the Bioengineer (because they're minions after all), and their types can compliment or add flavour to the playstyle of their master."

Using Ashen Demeanor and sigil of rending helped with vulnerability uptime speeding the kills as well. Tactics in general are the same as before. CCing Skorvald in 2nd phase while he is raising his hand cancels the surge attack, staying in front of him prevents him from teleporting away and in 3rd phase he will move to mid after the beam if you are behind him. I had initially thought of only doing Arkk but after getting sub 7:00 kill casually I chose to give Skorvald an hour or two and here's the result. [Video](URL [Log](URL"
10,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Why am I always losing all drive in this game?,1,ez90ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ez90ic/why_am_i_always_losing_all_drive_in_this_game/,2020-02-05 23:43:51,"Preface: long post about my experience with GW2 in the past and now. So Ive been playing literally every MMORPG this past year, most of them f2p of course, but most of them are also hopelessly pay2win. Ive spend a good time in most of them. My main game was once ff14 for 5 years, then WoW for like 2 months. I've played ESO for about half a year and GW2 back when it came out for 2 months and then about 4 months before the first expansion came out. I am normally totally not a fan of the horizontal progression of GW2. I love it when you get stronger and stronger. While the progression in ff14 was pretty stale, there was still gear upgrades to hunt for which helped you clear content faster and faster. Very satisfying to get your clear times down by 10-20% from week to week in group raids. Back when I played GW2 I did fractals, over world completion, silverwaste farms, the usual stuff. I dabbled in crafting but at one point I just moved back to FF14, because it got a new big patch. Since then I wasnt able to get into GW2 ever again and I just dont know why. I would get the drive to play it, download it, delete my latest char and make a new one. Id play to about lvl 20-40 and then I'd quit. I've done this about 4 times already in the past 4 years. (Side note: 4 slots have chars from the beginning of the game and knowing how GW gives out gifts to year old chars Im not deleting them. They also funtion as a bank now.) So I delete my latest char from about 1 year ago, a lvl 32 Guardian, and made a new Thief. As from the start of the game I made another Human, but soon after geetting through the opening I felt fed up with it. So this time I made a Norn. I was very happy with that choice, finally a new start. I also had much fun with the dual pistol build from [here](URL (well as far as you can call it build with such a low level). I couldnt wait to get to lvl 21 for the specs. But as soon as I got to lvl 21 I looked through all available options in an example leveling build and also the build in that video and suddenly I completely lost interest. Like from HYPE 100 to 0 in 1 second. So far I was killing stuff quickly with my 3 skill (the pistol barrage), sometimes adding the 2 for a vulnerability stack. But after seeing all the interactions of the build for when I reach max level I felt like ""uhh this is never going to change"". I rewatched the entire Thief video from these guides to make sure and indeed, the game does not change at all. You go to a mob, you press your 2-3 buttons and you move on. There is like zero progression in your character. If I look at ff14 for example, the blackmage. You start out with little firespells in a small rotation with ice. Later you get access to the bigger ones, the AoE, the interactions with the procs and the tier 3 spells. And the first kit is complete at lvl 50. Then at lvl 60 it changes compeltely again. Once again at lvl 70 and then at lvl 80. You feel more and more powerful with bigger and better spells. But in GW2 I feel like you will always just shoot stuff with your flimsy pistols, or go up and stab mobs with your tiny daggers. The skills are the same from lvl 10 to max level. Sure you get an elite spec or two later, but taking a look back at the video it doesnt change anything. I feel like its not enough to justify keeping going with this game. If I then remember how the endgame doesnt offer any progression I completely lost interest. I was about to give this game another real go, be satisfied with unlocking elite specs, getting through the expansions (btw i do have the raptor, got it from my old main to make questing easier), getting all the mounts unlocked, work on ascended and maybe make a legendary weapon. But the fat that the entire build system is so severly lacking is such a big turn off. Here a bit more crit, here some might upfront, here a little poison. It doesn't add to the gameplay at all, it just helps moving down stuff with your 3 skills more easily. (My old main was a mesmer, before that an Ele. Didn't like eles idea of spellcasting and didnt want to play another mesmer for now) Yeah, so that's me rambling here, but seriously, does anyone know why this games combat, character building and progression feel like its not worth the time invested?"

The major difference is that we had to compress all the roles into 5 people. We took the Firebrand for quickness and vulnerability and the Renegade for alacrity, might, extremely high cc and some heals in form of Soulcleaves summit. The Daredevils were taken for the shadow portals, kiting and their stolen skills (bombs for pulling and plasma for boons) as well as their very high dps without needing a healer. Our Warrior ran For Great Justice to supply missing might and we used the Spellbreaker elite specialization to boonstrip the boss with Winds of Disenchantment. The first two lamps were done by the Spellbreaker while everybody else was hitting the legendary adds. The last lamp was done by the Firebrand and one of the Daredevils, while the Renegade and Warrior tanked the two wyverns. In the boss phases we killed the protection and retaliation pyre using portals to skip the running part between them. We had a spellbreaker which allowed us to skip stability while still being able to cc the boss. For the last 33% we were standing behind Qadim to not get hit by his attacks. # Our Squad comp: |[Spellbreaker (Luna)](URL |:-| |[Renegade (Stijn)](URL |[Firebrand (Max)](URL |[Daredevil (Trace)](URL |[Kite Daredevil (Fallen)](URL &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; # Visit our website: [Snowcrows.com](URL"

Below is a list of items I think may bring new life into a beloved part of your amazing game. - Bring EOTM back as a main map - Make it larger, more points of interest, but keep its original style. - Dont give it gliding and mounts (at first). See if players enjoy the classic style of WvWvW then act accordingly. This will save time and money while giving the player a nostalgic experience. - Make it Blue or Green map. - Give us a precursor-ish reward track. - Make it take longer than other tracks and only give us the crafting items needed to create one. - This can be done by allowing us to pick the crafting item reward at each step for which precursor we want to build. - Make the Precursor, that can be made from the reward track, Account Bound. This will give us a much-needed reward boost while not ruining the economy. This will also get players back into PVE to gather mats for making legendries. - Allow players to level in WvWvW again. - I know you want players to experience the game in its full, but I think youre leaving money on the table by not allowing players to see just how much fun running with a 30-50 player squad can be. - In December make all of the siege shoot holiday themed weapons. Catas shooting presents and trebs launching sleighs. That kinda stuff. - SMC has Krampus as the commander. **This last one is just a general thought and a consideration for future games due to the extreme affect it would have on the game.** - Make conditions an added damage with it mostly being effect based. Such as Fire doing a little burning damage but mainly lowering armor (vulnerability) , or bleeding doing more damage if the target keeps moving (torment). - Youd also remove condi gear because its not supposed to be a viable build is this idea. - This still makes condis scary but wouldnt make them an insane power house thats difficult to balance. Also melding condis mean fewer condis to balance. Lastly, thanks for making such an awesome game and for not giving up on the Guildwars IP after the first game. I understand you guys are going through a troubling time now and I have full confidence you guys will come back swinging hard with awesome updates. I hope you all have a happy holidays. PS:Put out more books. TLDR: If you didn't read it then wasn't for you."
13,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Snow Crows [SC] Qadim the Peerless World Record 3:43,186,d1bf0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d1bf0c/snow_crows_sc_qadim_the_peerless_world_record_343/,2019-09-09 00:15:25,"Hello Reddit and fellow Guild Wars 2 players, &amp;nbsp; Snow Crows is happy to present you the world record of Qadim the Peerless with a kill time of 3:43 (8:17 left). &amp;nbsp; After getting worlds first kill on Qadim the Peerless with our guild, we wanted to do a very fast and smooth kill of this fun boss. &amp;nbsp; There has not been any other record kill of this boss, so we had to figure out all the details ourselves and came up with a team comp we were happy with. &amp;nbsp; ##Our game plan: - ####Tethers: In order to get a good time we realised we had to maximize tether uptime. Each person tethered to a pylon adds a debuff to Qadim which makes him take 5% more damage. Taking advantage of that was one of our primary goals. The debuff lasts 5 seconds so in the first 40% of the fight we swapped tether links between players back and forth to gain additional stacks. Following that we tried to always have the maximum possible amount of stacks up. At 40% and 30% when he consumes the pylons, we achieved that by having tether chains from the remaining pylons to the current stacking position of the group. Those chains of tethers and our DPS allowed us to have Qadim not jump back into middle after consuming the first pylon and instead go to the southwest pylon right away. &amp;nbsp; - ####Fire Field placement: We basically used the Fire Fields each player gets at both 80% and 60% to block the running paths of the anomalies. Those Fire Fields actually damage the anomalies after they have been broken. To achieve that every player had an assigned position for the split phases. &amp;nbsp; - ####Last 20%: In the last 20% of the bosses health Qadim tethers to three players, who then again relink to 3 more players in the range of 600. Each person affected by such a bad tether deals 25% less damage. To avoid getting unnecessary damage debuffs we had the tank and two Deadeyes each take one bad tether and had them stand on the opposite site of the boss outside of the partys range. &amp;nbsp; ##Our Squad Comp: | Subgroup 1 | Subgroup 2 |:-----------|:------------| | [Quickness Firebrand (Max)](URL | [Tank Chronomancer (Nico)](URL | | [Banner Warrior (Chris)](URL | [Heal Druid (Alex)](URL | [Condition Renegade (Sali)](URL | [Pylon Rifle Deadeye (Fallen)](URL | [Condition Renegade (Breke)](URL | [Pylon Rifle Deadeye (Elu)](URL | [Condition Renegade (Stijn)](URL | [Pylon Rifle Deadeye (Stephan)](URL [Log](URL &amp;nbsp; ##Chronomancer The Chronomancer was an obvious choice as tank for us. The class has very high sustainability without requiring a lot of heal and it offers high defiance bar damage to recap the pylons faster and help with the anomalies that had to be broken. Chronomancer also provides a good amount of quickness and alacrity for the group. From 100% to 40% our Chronomancer handled the so called Shark mechanic by standing in the path of it and applying invulnerability to himself to block 2 out of 3 of its hits which made the other players able to focus on damage and tethers. At 40% to about 25% the Chronomancer was responsible to be a part of the tether chain from the southeast pylon to the group. ##Druid Just like Chronomancer Druid was an easy decision for us. Druid offers enough heal, might for our full squad, a huge DPS buff with spotter, frost and sun spirit and a good amount of defiance bar damage for both the splits and the anomalies. Over the course of the full encounter the Druid had the important job to break the anomalies so they would die to the Fire Fields placed in their paths. Starting at 75% of Qadims health the anomalies spawn every 30 seconds between the pylons. While the first spawn is random the other spawns are clockwise which made the Druid run around a lot. At 40% the Druid was part of the pylon chain from the southwest pylon to the group. ##Firebrand The Firebrand was taken to supply the squad with the missing quickness that the Chronomancer didnt provide as well as its high personal damage and the opportunity to bring stability and aegis to prevent knockbacks which increased DPS uptime for every player. The Zeal version of condi Firebrand also provides extremely good Vulnerability uptime. Until 40% the Firebrands job was to be between its assigned pylon and Qadim to create a tether link between the rifle Deadeye and the group, while still being able to attack the boss. At 40%, 30% and in the last phase the Firebrand provided stability and aegis in order for the group to not get knocked back. ##Warrior Just like every raid squad ever we had a warrior for its personal DPS and the banners. On this boss our warrior had to juggle around with the banner placement quite a bit. ##Renegade We chose Renegade as our primary DPS class for its high personal damage, the alacrity it can provide and the boonstrip we utilized in the last 20% of the boss. In the first 60% the Renegades tethered to the pylons while still attacking the boss. During the phases every Renegade provided alacrity to the group using Orders from above in combination with the trait Righteous Rebel. Right before every split phase the Renegades had to provide alacrity to the Deadeyes so they would not have Shadowstep cooldown problems. In the last 20% they used Spontaneous Destruction to remove Retaliation and Protection from Qadim. ##Deadeye Everybody who has done this boss before knows there have to be 3 pylon kiters that basically stand within the pylons range. Rifle Deadeye is a pretty common choice for it and we did not find anything better. The class has very high personal DPS because it sustains perma might, fury and protection while having invigorating precision to heal itself. For the first 60% the Deadeyes had to be connected to the pylon and pick up the orbs that spawn once per phase for each pylon using Shadowstep. This was actually a critical part of our kill as Shadowstep has a cooldown of 50 seconds and often we phased too fast so Shadowstep was still on cooldown while the next orb dropped. Dropping an orb basically wipes the group as it inflicts heavy damage. To fix this we had the Renegades provide alacrity to the Deadeyes while ccing the pylons. From 40% to 20% the Deadeyes were part of the tether chains to increase tether uptime. In the last 20% two Deadeyes took the bad tethers and kept them from spreading to the group. &amp;nbsp; #Visit our website: [Snowcrows.com](URL"

At 50% it changes a little as I try to bait out the ice spike, so that it doesn't drop on the pillar, which causes chill and damage before I jump up on the pillars to avoid his slam plus having to dodge the snowballs.

16,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Power Boon Chronomancer - The balance problem,0,crquoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/crquoq/power_boon_chronomancer_the_balance_problem/,2019-08-18 05:38:31,"These are just ideas that I want to put out there. It'd be nice to have **constructive** feedback. Power boon chronomancer has been in the spotlight ever since its introduction in Heart of Thorns. However more recently, the attention it has garnered is usually with negativity, in particular with its balance. I propose that similar to how druids Grace of the Land was adjusted, the solution is to remove Signet of Inspiration in its current iteration and balance accordingly. I believe that Signet of Inspiration has caused so many problems in terms of balance. Quick history of SoI: It was once spread all boons currently on the chronomancer to players like a boon version of epidemic. Then it was apply a stack of boons currently on the chronomancer (affected by boon duration). Then it was extend the existing boons that are currently in use on the target (not affected by boon duration). This is the gist of the skill. In between, the skill Mimic was nerfed as a result of Continuum Shift interaction with Mimic and the multiplicative value of using Mimic, CS and SoI together. However, mimics use case scenarios for literally any other skill was not multiplicative to an extent of being a problem. Portalers in open world maps for example. While it is understandable that a class providing both Quickness and Alacrity as well as utility the existing trade off is too high due to the concentration/boon duration not affecting SoI. I propose the following changes. &amp;#x200B; **Skills** *Signet of Inspiration* * Remove Signet of Inspiration in its current iteration * New SoI: Passive: 180 Concentration; Active: Heal allies around you. &amp;#x200B; *Mimic* * Remove restriction on being unable to be reset by other mesmer skills - Without Signet of Inspiration, problems with regards to multiplicative value is reduced. * Reduce Mimic CD to 12s &amp;#x200B; **Wells** *Well of Calamity* * Reduce Well of Calamity CD to 18s *Well of Action* * Reduce Well of Action CD to 24s instead of 25s * Increase Well of Actions Quickness to 6s from 5s *Well of Recall* * Reduce Well of Recall CD to 24s instead of 25s * Increase Well of Recalls Alacrity to 6s from 5s &amp;#x200B; **Traits** * Change \[Alls Well that Ends Well\] from Wells heal allies when they end to applying unique changes to wells. 1. Well of Eternity: Apply a 5 second buff that ignores the next death blow and heals for an amount. If the buff expires, heal a smaller amount (similar to Engineers AED and Tempests Rebound) 2. Well of Calamity: Increases the damage of Well of Calamity by {an amount} (example: 150%) 3. Well of Action: Increases the base duration of Quickness applied by {33% or 50%} (numerical balance adjustable) 4. Well of Recall: Increase the base duration of Alacrity applied by (33% or 50%} (numerical balance adjustable) 5. Well of Precognition: Applies either all or some balance pending: Protection (2s or 1s), Resistance (1s), Retaliation (2s or 1s) on each pulse AND/OR Wells place in Well of Precognition pulse 50% faster (most difficult to implement). 6. Gravity Well: Additionally applies Weakness and X Vulnerability per pulse * Sieze the Moment: &amp;#x200B; My goal of this set of change ideas is to push Power Boon Chrono such that when providing both quickness AND alacrity, its personal DPS is still less than alacrity renegade. However, when only providing one (ie: just quickness), the Power Boon Chrono should land somewhere in between damage of Condition Quickness Firebrand or Alacrity Power Renegade. This concept is intended to also potentially free up a utility slot by reducing the absolute need for SoI and allows for less boon duration to accomplish that goal and to further distinguish trait options between DPS power chrono and power boon chrono. Would this make Boon Power chrono easier? Potentially. However I think this is where its fine to be easier. When given the choice to optimize for damage in multiple potential avenues (ie: if a fight can be made easier with portal or feedback or multiple **instances** of CC where Mantra of Distraction could be valuable), then you can sacrifice Signet of Inspiration and equip say two diviners earrings in substitute; making use of the horizontal progression of stats that we have in the game. I think that this would at least be a better starting point for adding complexity as the problems we see now have basically arisen from any tweak being over done as a result of SoI."
17,vulnerability,Guildwars2,How to Efficiently Balance WvW &amp; PvP?,0,cucjmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cucjmh/how_to_efficiently_balance_wvw_pvp/,2019-08-23 21:25:45,"Hey everybody, I want to hopefully create a discussion on how to mainly balance WvW, but also PvP, efficiently; 1. By tweaking and changing key skills and traits instead of complete class reworks. 2. Without changing PvE balance *too* much in the process, or even the elite spec leveling experience. For example, this would be my take on the top 3 professions; Scourge, Firebrand and Herald, who are dominating the meta for far too long (Anet Roleplay WARNING): **Scourge** The changes were meant to decrease the number of area-of-affect boon corrupts while increasing purity of purpose. * [Sand Savant](URL : This trait has been reworked. Shade skills heal and grant barrier to nearby allies. * [Sadistic Searing](URL Replaced the cooldown reduction of [Punishment](URL skills portion of this trait with applying burning when using a punishment skill. * [Devouring Darkness](URL Number of boon corrupts decreased in WvW to match the PvP version. * [Lesser Spinal Shivers](URL Number of boons corrupts decreased to 2 in WvW only. * [Spiteful Spirit](URL Number of base boons corrupts decreased to 1 in WvW only. * [Unholy Feast](URL Number of boons corrupts decreased to 1 in WvW only. Notes: All of the trait changes decrease boon corruption. Barrier synergy for scourge 1-1-1. In pve, heal scourge may be weaker for 10 man but definitely stronger for 5 man. **Firebrand** The changes were meant to increase the number of meaningful choices for support Firebrand while bringing it more inline with other support roles and decreasing stability application. * Baseline: Tomes' page count has been reduced by 2. Mantras now have one regular charge and one [final charge](URL * [Archivist of Whispers](URL has swapped places with [Swift Scholar](URL * [Weighty Terms](URL Replaced the cooldown reduction of mantra charges with mantras gaining an additional charge. * [Epilogue: Unbroken Lines](URL Increased the base cooldown of this trait in WvW to match the PvP version. * [""Stand Your Ground!""](URL The number of stability stacks granted by this skill has been decreased from 5 to 3 in WvW only. Notes: Base number of tome pages goes up by 1 but you can't increase it anymore.

Notes: How Phase Smash suggestion works is the rev travels through the mists (evade), steps out of it to deliver an attack (can be damaged, cced and etc.) and then travels back to starting position through the mists again (evade).

Warrior, on the other hand, supports its allies in a much more flexible way. * The way the specialization support its allies is also different from, say, Banners, being more demanding on timing to perform on call (particularly Shouts and Warhorn; audio cues, specific, responsive), instead of to maintain the effectiveness and to standardize via good Discipline (Banners; visual cues, general, long-lasting). * The skirmish aspect is also different from Ranger's Skirmish, with the later more focused on being evasive, while one the hand Warrior being more suppressive, particularly with Longbow. **Deciding the Themes** Inspired by real world military tactics, I'd propose three sets of traits, each taking a horizontal line in the specialization. * The first line will be skirmishing and tactical maneuver, with its focus on disrupting enemy formation (Taunt), suppression before clashing in melee (Longbow) and envelopment. (Bonus on Flanking). * The second line will be frontal shock action and routing, with its focus on preparation (enhanced damage per boon), shock effect (soft CC upon disabling) and taking down routing enemies (immobilization). * The third line will be reserved for functions that help allies recover and reorganize, taking in the good old traits for Shouts and Warhorn and to enhance them further. ## Traits **Minor Traits** * **Adept, minor:** Element of Surprise  Grant Might (3 stacks for 10 s) to allies and Slow down foes (for 3 s) around you upon entering combat. * **Master, minor:** Vigorous Rehabilitation  Grant Vigor to allies when you use a healing skill. (Duration 8 s) * **Gradmaster, minor:** Resounding Command  Boons you apply onto allies last longer. (15%) **Major Traits** **Skirmishing and Maneuver** * **Adept:** Provocative Skirmisher  Fear you deal becomes Taunt. Enemies taunted by you gain 5 stacks of Vulnerability for 5 s over time. Taunted enemies deal less damage to you. (10% damage reduction.) * **Master:** Fire for Effect (previously Burning Arrows)  Dual shot causes burning and longbow skills recharge faster. (Unchanged.) Smoldering Arrow becomes Smoldering Sulfur, in addition to its previous effect, creatings an AoE that pulses Weakening and Poison each second for 1 s over 2 s. (Total number of application: 3) * **Grandmaster:** Pincer Movement  Deal 10% more damage when attacking from the flank or behind of your foes. Attacking from the flank or behind of your foes cast Lesser 'On My Marks' on them (with the duration of the effects reduced to 3 s; cooldown 25 s). **Shock, Routing, Chasing down** * **Adept:** Line of Departure  Increases damage for every boon on you. (Unchanged.) * **Master:** Shock Tactics  Inflict Slow and Weakness on enemies you disable (3 s with no Cooldown). * **Grandmaster:** Leg Specialist  Immobilize a target when you cripple them with a skill. (Unchanged.) Immobilization you cause last longer (50%). **Reorganize and Recovery** * **Adept:** Quick Breathing  Warhorn skills have an increased number of targets, grant an additional boon, and grant adrenaline per ally affected. Grant +120 Concentration. ([As announced](URL * **Master:** Shrug It Off  Use ""Shake It Off!"" automatically when you have a number of conditions on you. (Unchanged.) * **Grandmaster:** Vigorous Shouts  Shouts heal allies and grant adrenaline. Shouts recharge faster. (Skill Coefficient raised from 1.2 to 1.5) Shouts grant Vigor to allies. ## Skills **Shouts** The aim of these changes is to address the lack of Boons for allies and to improve the effectiveness of certain under-performing and barely slotted skills. * 'Fear Me!': The base cooldown is reduced to 40 s. Grant Retaliation for 6 s. * 'On My Mark!': The skill becomes an AoE of 180 radius around your selected target. (If no target is selected the skill cannot be deployed.) In addition to its previous effect, grant Quickness for 3 s for 'On My Mark!' and 2 s for Lesser 'On My Mark!'. * 'Shake/Shrug It Off!' In addition to their previous effect, grant Resistance for 2 s and 1 s respectively. **Warhorn** I am going to quote myself in [another thread](URL for the reasoning behind the changes proposed below: &gt;I would so much like to see Stability be added to Charge, so that people actually use it preemptively before clashing into melee, instead of afterward trying to get out of the hot zones. Nowadays, the skill is used more like how Guardian's 'Retreat!' is meant to be (yet mostly is not). Such inconsistency between the actual application of the skill and the intended function suggested by the text always makes me chuckle. For Call to Arm, just add group Resistance, so that the weapon might actually be regarded viable. * Charge: This skill would only removes movement impairing conditions and then increases the damage of affected allies' next 2 attacks by 25% in addition to its previous effects. Increase swiftness duration from 10 seconds to 15 seconds. This skill becomes a blast finisher. ([As announced](URL Grant 3 stacks of Stability for 5 s. * Call to Arms: Removes 3 conditions from affected allies instead of specific conditions. Grants barrier in addition to vigor. ([As announced](URL Grant Resistance for 3 s. **Longbow** The change is aimed to bring the now under-powered Burst skill in line with other ones. * Combustive Shot: Reduce the interval between pulsing direct damage and Burning to 1 s. (Number of pulses is increased to 4, 7, 10 as a result.) ## Potential Play Style * With Warhorn and Longbow, a possible revival of Marshal attribute combo (++Power, ++Healing, +Precision, +Condition Damage). * Potential Hammer Berserker with Tactics to spam Immobilize, Slow and Weakness. * A support Warrior build that provides reasonable burst Healing,Barrier and Cleansing with Shouts and Warhorn. * A smaller, secondary 'hit squad' working in coordination with the main group, with its aim to prey upon enemy backliners in WvW."

Lethality is a stat that penetrates toughness values. it would be separate from vulnerability because lethality acts as a definitive amount of damage - despite the amount toughness the enemy has.

As it stands, the utilities are almost entirely bad in PvE (the elite can sorta be useful, but is still outshined by golem). Most of them do stuff the core class can already do--might generation on a class that can self stack to 25 no problem; vulnerability (granted, with a not so useful addition of unblockable); condi transfer (but fewer stacks than core signet). The one interesting one (imo), Rise, is fun to use, theoretically useful if youre derping around, but ultimately does nothing for the class outside of some OW stuff--also probably outclassed by shade or other minions. Then you get to the GM trait. Once upon a time, it allowed for a novel (in fact, meta) way to play reaper. Since the changes to get to a more ""pure"" spec, it is nerfed to the ground and obsolete, yet it remains. This is a GM trait slot and can be changed into something really competitive/interesting for the class. Itd be tough to beat out Reaper's Onslaught, but at the same time, as a GM slot, it has reason to be strong (and since most of the power of RO is caked into 50% quickness uptime, it wouldnt be super tough to make a good PvE trait since most groups already run a quickness provider, would just need to beat out the 300 fero)."

First things first, I'm surprised there's not a Longbow Proficiency trait that lowers skill cooldown, especially since Hunters Ward has such a long cooldown, maybe have it included in Piercing Light. Ok now going through the actual Longbow Skills: Puncture Shot: Bouncing Arrows that cause Cripple if they bounce, which really synergies well with Dulled senses (Inflict Vuln on crippled enemies) and Zealot's Aggression (Dealling extra damage to crippled targets). This skill is fine in my opinion. True Shot: Powerful piercing shot with a cast time. Pretty nice skill but I feel it's missing something (especially since it has a Channeled Cast time), maybe adding a Vulnerability or enemies hit by True Shot are pinned for 3 seconds. Deflecting Shot: Fire a missile that blinds enemies and blocks missiles. Blocking a missile increases damage dealt. Cool concept, clunky to use. My thought is since it no longer destroys projectiles, but instead blocks them, have it be a Channeled Guard (like with Mace but for only ranged attacks) this would remove the clunkiness imo. If you dont block a ""missile"" you can do a second input for a weaker shot. Symbol of Energy: Fire a slow, arcing arrow which explodes on impact to burn targets and sear a symbol of energy into the ground. This ability is fine, the 15 sec cooldown seems excessive, I'd knock it down to maybe 12 sec. Hunters Ward: Form your arrow into a barrier and deal damage at the location. This tool tip doesn't really tell you what's going on, you fire a volley of arrows on a location, this AoE is hit with 4 instances of damage, the last doing a significant amount of damage more than the previous 3, this final attack also casts Hunter's Mark, which is a Ward that keeps enemies inside a chained barrier. Hunter's Ward is an awful skill imo, it's a 3 second Channeled ability, for a 5 second ward, for a palpable amount of damage with a 40 sec cooldown. With all this stuff going on it should really do something cool, but it doesn't. I would remove the channel, shorten the cooldown to 30 seconds to be in line with other wards, have it just be the final volley since that's the only one that matters and have the enemies inside the ward burn for the 5 seconds. Anyways that's my thoughts on the Longbow, 4 years late . Do you agree, disagree, think I should crawl back into the hole in the ground I call my home? Leave it below."

They should do some damage like fire field + blast or leap should deal additional damage mobs with an explosion. Lightning field + whirl or any psychical projectile should daze enemies. Using water over lighning should also stun enemies and deal damage. I want to see more effects that getting ONE STACK OF MIGHT, O MY GOD SUCH POWER!

I feel like Necro Staff could be so much more cool than what it is now. Maybe going half melee half caster would be a cool way to rework it. Your 1 could be a simple melee combo that did bleed on the 3rd hit. 2 would be a frontal cone cleave attack that gave chill. 3 would be a necrotic flame that did burn and reduced healing. 4 is an AoE target poison. 5 could be another AoE target that desecrated the ground causing skeletal hands to claw at enemies giving them chill and vulnerability.
25,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Power Warrior and its Current State in PvE,132,bc0ohs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bc0ohs/power_warrior_and_its_current_state_in_pve/,2019-04-12 00:42:05,"Greetings Reddit, I was hoping to start a discussion on a class and build I really enjoy playing and that I feel sometimes gets ignored for discussion on other classes. I do want to preface this by saying that I think this is probably the most balanced and varied we've ever seen the classes in PvE. There is previously unheard of diversity between the support classes with almost every DPS class being competitive or near competitive with each other with the only notable exceptions being mirage slightly over the power curve, and power warrior, power revenant and condition daredevil being under the power curve. # The Current Position Currently Power Warrior occupies a meta viable spot in the role of banner slave in a few select raid fights and in fractals. Power warrior's role in a group is largely to provide banners but also to provide EA, CC, supplemental might in party comps without druid and boon strip if the chronomancer/renegades you're with are incapable of doing it. The majority of the time, the power warrior will want to be traited in strength, discipline and tactics. As a DPS, power warrior can trait into spellbreaker instead of tactics. In this role, warrior can provide moderate CC and boon strip but it suffers from a rather crippling interaction between the burst and berserker's power, the most important damage modifier for power warrior. Spellbreaker and Berserker (ironically) both only provide one stack of berserker's power when they burst as opposed to the 3 stacks a core warrior using a level 3 burst will provide. This results in a ramp-up time for both elite specs, something that is a characteristic of a condition build. Spellbreaker does not have the damage to compete with condition builds however, and is even amongst the lowest power DPS classes according to the [benchmarks](URL To further compound upon this issue, the benchmarks are an overestimation of spellbreaker's DPS with a fairly significant portion of its damage coming from dagger 4, which will do more damage on a golem because the golem doesn't use any skills. Finally, even when you finally do ramp up to spellbreaker's peak damage, its burst is still nothing to write home about. So you might be asking that if at least power BS has a meta occupied spot, is there really an issue with power warrior? In my opinion I believe that it's still an issue. I really enjoy playing power warrior and it saddens me that I can't play it without feeling like I'm handicapped relative to the daredevils and dragonhunters out there. Even if you don't agree, I think there's some strange design choices within the class that can be addressed. Namely that the class has a 'burst' mechanic but has very poor burst. Additionally berserker has a rage mechanic in which it is supposed to go into a powered up state but it does less damage in its rage than the more defensively inclined spellbreaker. # The Disparity Between Greatsword and Axe This isn't an issue that necessarily warrants Arenanet's attention. Greatsword is a very strong weapon for warrior in PvP, but in [previous patches](URL GS has been buffed with the express purpose of making power warrior more viable in PvE. I do believe it's likely Arenanet's intention that GS be a viable weapon for power warrior in PvE. As it stands though, greatsword's modifiers are so far below axe's modifiers that it's hard to justify using the weapon. In fact it's not even used on spellbreaker and for core warrior it's noted as a very minor DPS increase. To highlight the issue, let's take a look at the modifiers. [The Modifiers](URL (numbers for cast time are from [dps.report](URL and so might not be 100% accurate) The important numbers here for determining the worth of the skill is the CPS. That number is the coefficient of damage that skill does per second and is directly correlated with the amount of damage that skill does per second relative to other skills (barring modifiers). When determining whether a skill is worth using over just auto-attacking you'll generally want to look at how its CPS compares to the CPS of the full auto chain. As you can see axe has very good modifiers with many of the skill outside the auto-attack going upwards of 3-5 CPS. Greatsword, on the other hand, has its signature skill, Hundred Blades, doing barely more damage than an axe auto chain. For a skill that roots you and has a long cast time, it seems silly to me that the skill has almost no pay-off. Whirlwind attack might also look good here but it will only ever reach that high amount of damage with a large hitbox target (where you can land all 4 hits) or against a wall. Whirlwind attack also comes at the price of displacing you away from boons and potentially making your life difficult if you're using thief runes and need to flank the target. Arcing slice is the only skill here that is unconditionally doing very good damage. # Power Warrior Being Pulled in 5 Different Directions Currently, power warrior seems to be pushed towards taking strength and discipline as their primary trait-lines. Interestingly though, there is something for the spec in each of the other 5 remaining trait-lines as the third remaining traitline and they're all unique niches for the build. Unfortunately the only ones that see any use are tactics as the more support-oriented version and spellbreaker for the purpose of being the highest DPS spec for the build and/or boon strip. It is my opinion that tactics is positioned fine for the purpose it provides. Spellbreaker's damage is undertuned but I don't think they can (or will) change the biggest problem with spellbreaker which is that the burst only provides 1 stack of berserker's power. This is because doing so would require changing a mechanic of spellbreaker that would likely break it in the context of PvP with adrenal health (which works in the same way that berserker's power does). Outside of these two traitlines, I believe there is an archetype for power warrior entrenched in each of the remaining three traitlines that seem to be somewhat developed but not entirely functional. # The Executioner and the Tank. There is a recurring theme present in warrior of doing more damage to foes low on health. Throw Axe (Axe 3) and Arcing Slice/Arc Divider (Greatsword Burst) both do more damage to foes with low health. Additionally there is a trait in discipline that applies quickness upon hitting a foe with less than 50% health and a trait in arms that gives stacking ferocity upon active use of a signet and will start activating a lesser signet of might when hitting a foe with less than 50% health. The former isn't significant because it's competing with axe mastery, a more critical trait to power warrior. The latter is an interesting trait in a traitline that doesn't offer much for power warrior besides vulnerability and a passive attack speed boost that doesn't stack with quickness. This makes arms a decent enough solo traitline, but leaves a lot to be desired in a group setting. If you try to invest yourself fully into this archetype, you'll just end up with a lower damage build that catches up a little when the enemy is below 50%, but not enough to justify its pitiful damage above 50%. The Defense traitline also, oddly enough, has traits that benefit power warrior. Cull the weak is a 7% damage modifier and Armored Attack is a trait that gives you power based on your toughness. The traitline seems to be trying to push the warrior to take high toughness and survivability while mitigating the investment by providing a damage modifier and additional stats that you want anyway. Unfortunately, without a more efficient attribute combination like demolisher, I find it hard to believe that any power class will be an efficient tank. # Berserker Power Berserker has experienced a lot of nerfs prior to the release of PoF and Arenanet never revisited the spec despite it being what is, in my opinion, the most promising for power warrior. The most notable nerfs was the changes to make arc divider slower and to make the berserker bursts only give 1 stack of berserker's power per burst when in berserk. The nerf to arc divider makes greatsword even more weaker than axe than it already is. The berserker burst nerf was also fairly hefty though it's not quite as crippling to berserker's potential burst as it is to spellbreaker. Berserker has the choice of using a level 3 burst or going into berserk and so can stack berserker's power before going into berserk. This doesn't work so well in practice however because it requires a set-up time in which you have to headbutt -&gt; burst -&gt; blood reckoning -&gt; berserk and then do your burst. In content like fractals, most bosses will phase before you get to execute your burst. Additionally you barely gain any damage out of all this set-up. The reason I believe berserker has the most potential however is that its design and theme is most oriented towards what you'd want as a power DPS class. Thematically berserker is a class that goes into a powered up state for a short period of time and then spends some time cooling down between these burst phases. Likewise the traits suggest that this was the intended design with bloody roar and bloody reaction both specifically bolstering your damage while you're in berserk. Finally berserker is not very effective in PvP and so has the most room to grow in PvE without risking the integrity of other game modes. My hopes are that they revert the nerf to the berserker primal bursts and make berserk feel more impactful for the warrior's damage, even if it comes at the expense of the warrior's damage outside of berserker's burst (maybe some sort of trait that increases your damage in berserk but decreases your damage outside of berserk as some sort of exhaustion mechanic? Can flavor it as a kind of frenzied rage). # TL;DR Power DPS warrior is missing the burst and damage required for it to feel like a proper power DPS class. The class could do with some focusing of its traits and rebalancing of its damage. I'm eager to hear all your thoughts on the matter. Also if you're wondering why I went through all this work, it's mostly because I had a lot of fun playing around with meme builds and doing math and stretching warrior to see what it was capable of."

It is now time to evaluate the mount and look for improvements. In this post I want to exclusively focus on its ability to destroy gates. Following assumptions were made: \- Players not mounted or using a siege weapon deal 200 dps to non-hardened gates or are AFK (looked at both scenarios) \- Comparison was made with a Superior Flame Ram \- Unlocked all points in Flame Ram, Warclaw and Siege Might, no supply refund from Supply Master \- No repairs, no structural vulnerability \- T0 non-hardened and hardened T0 to T3 gates \- Ignored supply shortages barring the group from building another Flame Ram, but allowing them to speed up siege through the mount &amp;#x200B; Method used: Determined the break-even point for damage per time and supply between Superior Flame Ram and Chain pull for destroying full hp gates. Findings: Currently there is no point in using Chain Pull. You should place between six (T0 hardened) and nine (T3 hardened) Superior Flame rams before considering the Warclaw Possible solutions: (I) Make the Warclaw viable for zergs. This could be done by increasing the Chain Pull damage to 4000 (is 2000). At that level the strategy would be to place two rams for T0, three rams for T2 and four rams for T3 and then use the Warclaw. This could also be done by giving the Warclaw the ability to buff nearby Flame Rams or debuff gates. However simply increasing the damage does the trick and is significantly easier. (II) Make the Warclaw viable for roamers / small-scale (talking about groups that do not have enough supply to place a ram). Could move the supply cost from ""Chain Pull (active)"" to ""Chain Pull"" (the one that swaps the skill bar and applies the chain). Increase cost to five to ten supply. While this is certainly a possibility I am very unsure if it is a good route to go. (III) Create new gameplay around the Warclaw. Build palisades and gates around leveled camps. Rough estimates for good health pool: 0(T0), 80k (T1), 120k(T2), 160k(T3) for 4000 damage and 0(T0), 30k(T1), 45k(T2), 60k(T3). &amp;#x200B; Thanks for reading. TL;DR Chain Pull is not efficient right now. Please make it good Anet."
28,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Balance Patch analysis from PvE reaper PoV,9,bivzwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bivzwl/balance_patch_analysis_from_pve_reaper_pov/,2019-04-30 08:58:57,"Been seeing a lot of videos posted about the latest balance changes, and when it comes to reaper, most of them (potatoes/teapot/etc.) seem to focus on PvP and WvW. I dont play much of those modes, though I play PvE in the raid and CM scene and felt like there wasnt much explanation of the changes with regards to those modes. *Locust Swarm: (NERF)--This ability took a pretty big hit. Previously this was used before entering shroud. The reason this was done was because the predominant traits (and really the only viable ones in high end--not just OW--PvE) include soul reaping and reaper traits to boost ferocity by 600. Prior to the patch, youd benefit from a massive crit damage boost by casting this before shroud, then getting the boost to each tick in shroud. The reduction in overall duration didnt really matter, however, the change from ""damage"" to ""lifesteal damage"" meant that this skill no longer crit, ie. this skill no longer benefits from the massive ferocity boost. And it turns out, without this boost, there is no DPS reason to cast the skill. Additionally, while the life force gen isnt bad, it isnt really needed, and the lifesteal is pretty pathetic, making the whole change a pretty big nerf. *Soul Grasp: (BUFF)--This skill is pretty great, though it is a competitive pick now, so it wasnt an outright buff to the class (which is a good move by ANet imo). To appreciate the skill you have to realize it competes with Dec Defenses, a free 50% crit trait in PvE that easily brings most people to perm-100% crit. (Should also be noted that this trait let necros gear valks over zerkers, though in raids and CM, the extra 2-3k HP didnt really mean much; it was a minor bonus.) This means that for current reapers taking Soul Grasp, they need to go back to zerker gear, but also supplement with a combination of food, assassin gear (ie. less power), and/or accuracy sigils (ie. cant have force/impact...at least on one weapon set...you can still have your axe/wh set using those sigils since shroud still gets free 33% crit). This means that the 10% bonus isnt exactly 10% since it requires losing power or damage boost you could otherwise get using Dec Def. Overall, it ends up being something like 7%, which is still nice. (And also, it is important to note that the healing part of this trait is very nice, not worth traiting for alone, but definitely solves the massive problem reapers would have in that they would miss group healing while rotating in their shroud.) *Death Spiral: (NERF)--I think the intension of this change was to encourage use of GS3 below 50%. However, digger spam is still more dps below 50%, meaning this skill is still only used above 50%. And above 50%, this skill lost 22% of its damage. It does have a slightly shorter cooldown, however, this is mostly irrelevant since you dont end up fitting in an extra cast with the proper rotation. In the end, this skill is still worth using above 50%, but it just took a big DPS loss during an attempt to redistribute the damage. *Focus 4: (NERF/MAYBE)--Given what they did with guardian focus rework, I had some hope that necro focus would come out looking good, sadly, no. This is a good skill for OW or whatever, but it still has no place in any meaningful PvE as it cannot deal any meaningful damage, cannot offer any utility to compete with the WH (even post nerf to WH5), and in general brings nothing to the kid (that much life force is unnecessary for any necro spec in PvE and vulnerability isnt hard to stack, seriously discounting the condi's worth in PvE). But, I cant say the skill itself is nerfed as the skil it replaced was also pretty bad; itd be more apt to say they replaced one bad PvE skill for another bad one. *Other skill changes: The rest were just increases in range, so buffs. IN GENERAL, counting in the nerfs to weapon skills, the buffs from the new trait, and the required change in gear due to Soul Grasp, the end result is an overall buff to reaper by something like 5% (plus a super useful in shroud heal)."

(Disclaimer: I'm no gameplay expert, there are probably flaws with my ideas, but this is just purely from one player's view. Not a rant, just sharing my views on what could be) The problem with them being underwater exclusive, is that we miss out on quite a few good skins. Firstly, because I think I speak for a large portion of the playerbase when I say that fighting underwater isn't the most liked occupation. This means that several good skins, such as Kamohuali'i kotaki and Kraitkin, among many others, are basically never seen, even though these are great looking weapon skins. Additionally, underwater combat being only a small portion of the game, means there is probably way less time and effort spent on designing these, as underwater-only legendary weapons and underwater-only weapon skins in general are way less asked for. Then of course the problem arises, which professions could use which of the three on land, and in which way. As far as the users go, I think most professions should be able to use them in the same way as they can now, probably with a few tweaks to traits and definitely changing around most of the movesets to be more suited for on-land use. As far as the spear goes, I think spears should be for playstyles that are more focused around striking people directly with the weapons instead of relying on magic. Spear could have a similar fighting style to underwater, being a fast and agile weapon that requires you to be dedicated to your attacks and is focused around attacking a small amount of targets. Like this, it could have long animations that deal a lot of damage if you finish the animation. It could get some changes to underwater themed moves, such as changing skills similar to the thief 3 to jumps. Spear should probably be a power focused weapon over-all. Trident on the other hand, on land it could be a weapon focused on using magically enhanced attacks in melee range. Specifically melee range, to avoid overlap with staffs in terms of playstyle(except for revenants, which already use melee magic with staff) some moves have to be changed quite a bit, especially the basic attacks, whirlpool-like skills and skills that use the 'sinking' cc effect. Trident could be a condition or boon focused weapon. spearguns could be changed in a similar way to spears to fit on land and not overlap too much with rifle and/or pistol(s). It could use mainly long ranged moves with a long cast animation, focused almost solely around dealing heavy damage and leaving behind much of the utility of the rifle or pistols. spearguns would probably deal mainly power damage, with some bleeding and vulnerability in some places. As far as attacks go, I don't think these have to be changed all too much, apart from the engineer mines having to be sent to the ground, the nets having to be replaced with some other skills and maybe reducing the movement range of the mobility skills in trade for some extra damage. I think turning underwater weapons into amphibious weapons could open up other playstyles. Additionally, maybe binding some spear skins to underwater combat, exploration and chests, but allowing them to be actually used outside of water, would make going underwater more attractive to players(and krait chests more interesting). ~~and I really want spear skins from xera and matthias among other boss skins and skin groups~~ Thanks for reading, have a chocolate chip cookie :) (.)"
31,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Theorycraft: Revenant elite specialization - Vanquisher,11,b8xg5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b8xg5i/theorycraft_revenant_elite_specialization/,2019-04-03 23:41:40,"Hey everyone, this is just an idea for a Revenant elite specialization I've been mulling over for a while now and wanted to share with GW2 community. All suggestions are welcome! &amp;#x200B; **Name**: As we all know, name for a class/specialization is important. It needs to be a descriptive word that gives strong impression of what that class does. I went through couple of names for it, like Redeemer, Defender, Champion, Captain and eventually settled for Vanquisher. The reasoning for this will be outlined through rest of the text. &amp;#x200B; **Initial considerations**: So, how do you approach designing a new elite spec for Revenant? I posed myself two questions/axioms on which further theorycrafting would be based: 1. Elite spec needs to have a clear role that doesn't infringe too much on existing specs. 2. Revenant elite spec is closely linked to the Legend it channels, both thematically and mechanically. The chosen Legends needs to be: * a) Strong, recognizable personality * b) Influential to at least one major group of playable characters (like Glint, Ventari, etc.) * c) Died before the beginning of Gw2 story, as to not create unnecessary confusion in timelines. &amp;#x200B; **Theme development**: As a most obvious and noticeable aspect of a Revenant spec, I started from existing Legends and what/who they consist of, then proceeded to consider what they lacked. As last elite spec featured a charr, human Legend already exists, sylvari we aren't even sure even go to the Mists after death (as far as I know) and asura are a bit too technologically oriented for them to mesh with Revenant theme (in my own opinion), a Norn legend made the most sense. Norn's are already highly spiritual people, both in personal lives and in matters of their racial connection to spirits and the Mists. Now, taking in account initial considerations written above, which notable Norn would work as a Legend? The answer came surprisingly easy: [Asgeir Dragonrender](URL The very dude who led Norns and the four spirits south as they escaped the awakening Jormag. The founder of Hoelbrak, grandpa of Knut Whitebear, and the same badass that nabbed himself the tooth of Jormag like its no one's business. &amp;#x200B; **Mechanics development - Role**: As mentioned before, the Vanquisher needs to have a clear role that isn't direct infringement of existing one. For that, I settled on power/support hybrid that is thematically based on ""inspiration""/""inspiring allies"". Or rather, the trope of charismatic leader who leads troops from the front lines and inspires them both with his skills and powers. This would also fit very well with Asgeir Dragonrender and his achievements. So, how would he go on about inspiring people, mechanically? Primarily through consistent output and maintenance of boons, and then giving further, unique effects from doing so. Main focus would be on: Might, Fury, Resistance. Secondary focus would be on: Regen/Healing, Protection, Stability. More on that later in the text. &amp;#x200B; **Mechanics development - Weapon**: While Asgeir is depicted with sword and shield (and we already have those in case of Revenant), the Greatsword sounded like a good fit for what we're trying to achieve here. After all, he is a burly Norn famous for going toe to toe with an Elder Dragon and the idea is that he uses his weapons to inspire allies around him, so Greatsword also makes sense thematically, to certain degree. Note: I won't be going too much into details, such as specific numbers for dmg and cooldown. Those are something that can easily be calculated once other things are done with their design. Proposed Vanquisher Greatsword skills: 1. *Autoattacks* \- 3-piece chain with average/above-average DPS. Second attack inflicts Vulnerability. Third attack grants Might in AoE. 2. *Mortal Assault -* Strikes twice with powerful blows. Each strike applies 5 stacks of Vulnerability. Dmg is increased by 1% for every stack of Vulnerability on target. 3. *Linebreak* \- Leaps forward, striking enemies and applying Cripple. Grants Aegis in AoE to allies. 4. *Skillful Strike* \- Strikes the enemy. If the attack hits, for 5 seconds Daring Assault is replaced with ""Encouraging Cry"" - grant allies Quickness and Stability 5. *Perforate* \- Stabs the enemy and inflicts dmg and Daze. Autoattack is disabled and weapon skills 2, 3, 4 and 5 are replaced for single cast. * Skill #2 is replaced with ""Decapitate"": Rips out the greatsword from enemy and slashes the enemy in a circular attack, dealing massive damage. Dmg increased for enemies below 35% health. * Skill #3 is replaced with ""Rip out"": Rips out the greatsword from enemy under an angle, dealing dmg and granting Fury in AoE. * Skill #4 is replaced with ""Knock Out"": Hits the enemy with a fist and rips out the greatsword, dealing dmg and inflicting Stun. * Skill #5 is replaced with ""Show Mercy"": Carefully pulls the greatsword out of enemy, does not do additional dmg, grants Regen and Stability in AoE. &amp;#x200B; **Mechanics development - Utility**: Legendary Vanquisher utilities are related to Asgeir/Norn's in general connection to the Spirits of the Wilds. I personally fancy the idea of Asgeir being their champion and thus able to facilitate the use of all 4 of them at once, unlike most other norns who usually focus on single spirit and its aspects to follow. The special ""plot twist"" that makes these utilities unique is that they would gain additional effects depending on which (main) weapon you are currently using. Which is easy as Revenant doesn't have plethora of weapons, and those that it does have have rather clear role on their own. This would also cement Vanquisher as good all-arounder hybrid. 1. Heal: *Howl of the Wolf* \- Heals in AoE and grants Fury. 1. Sword: Grants Might in AoE 2. Mace: Applies Confusion in AoE 3. Staff: Grants Regen in Aoe 4. Hammer: Grants Protection in AoE 5. Greatsword: Grants +20% boon duration in AoE 2. Utility #1: *Strength of the Bear* \- Block all direct dmg to you and allies within 600 range for 1 second and then retaliate with a powerful counter-attack. The dmg of counter-attack is increased by 10% of its base dmg for every hit Vanquisher blocked (max 15 hits/150%). 1. Sword: Deals additional dmg 2. Mace: Inflicts Bleeding and Vulnerability 3. Staff: Removes 2 condi's in AoE 4. Hammer: Grants Retaliation in AoE 5. Greatsword: Converts 1 condi to boon in AoE 3. Utility #2: *Flight of the Raven* \- Deal dmg in AoE around yourself. Steal 1 boon per enemy hit. Grants Resistance in AoE. 1. Sword: Grants Alacrity in AoE 2. Mace: Applies Blinded and Torment 3. Staff: Heals in AoE 4. Hammer: Grants Stability in AoE 5. Greatsword: Grants +33% reduced condition duration in AoE 4. Utility #3: *Ferocity of the Leopard* \- Leap at the enemy, dealing dmg and applying Chilled and Weakness. 1. Sword: Grants Quickness in AoE 2. Mace: Applies (lots of) Bleeding 3. Staff: Grants Swiftness and Vigor in AoE 4. Hammer: Stun Break in Aoe 5. Greatsword: Grants Lifesteal (dmg+heal) for several seconds in AoE 5. Elite: *Rage of the Wilds* \- (10 sec duration) - On activation, refresh duration of boons on allies in AoE. Grants Protection in AoE. For the duration of the Rage of the Wilds, boons cannot be stripped from allies. 1. Sword: Allies gain +1% increased dmg per unique boon on them 2. Mace: Allies gain +1% increased condi dmg per unique boon on them 3. Staff: Allies gain +1% increased incoming heal efficiency per unique boon on them 4. Hammer: Allies gain +1% increased damage reduction per unique boon on them 5. Greatsword: Allies gain +0.33% of all above per unique boon on them &amp;#x200B; **Mechanics development - Class mechanics**: What better way to inspire your allies than with magnificent banner? But these are a bit different than what Warrior has, adjusted to fit the theme and mechanics better. Accordingly, I named them Grand Banners (name subject to change). Vanquisher gets to use 3 different banners (F2, F3, F4). They have their set duration and cooldown. Only one banner can be active at the time. While a banner is active, its attached to the back of the Vanquisher (every banner has its own recognizable design and color-coded effects) and it pulses out effects periodically in AoE. 1. F2: *Grand Banner of Unyielding Strength* \- Grants Regen and clears 1 condi. Deals dmg. 2. F3: *Grand Banner of Fiery Heart* \- Grants Might and Swiftness. Applies Burn. 3. F3: *Grand Banner of Iron Will* \- Grants Retaliation and Stability. Inflicts Daze. &amp;#x200B; **Mechanics development - Traits**: Traits are a bit tricky to get, but I hope I got their feeling right and their theme and tiers right according to other elite specializations. * Minor Proficiency - *Greatsword Proficiency*: You can wield greatswords. * Minor Adept - *Bannerman*: Gain access to Grand Banner class mechanic. * Major Adept - *Unrelenting Courage*: Casting Heal skill also applies Fear in AoE. Outgoing healing efficiency increased by 10%. * Major Adept - *Deadly Furor*: While under the effect of Fury, gain 10 Ferocity per stack of Might. * Major Adept - *No, you*: Once every 10 secs, clear 1 movement-impairing effect and apply it to enemies in AoE instead. * Minor Master - *Powerful Fury*: Whenever you apply Fury, you also apply Might. * Major Master - *Chosen of the Wilds*: Legendary Vanquisher utility skills have 20% reduced cooldown and are unblockable. * Major Master - *Sword Champion*: Greatsword skills have 20% reduced cooldown.

Allies under the effect of Might have +0.75% dmg per stack of might. * Major Grandmaster - *Immortal Will*: When you are brought to 0 health, heal 50% instead and gain (all) boons.

I am in no means an expert in balancing, all of these are suggestions and concepts in the hope that it may inspire others. Some of you may already seen some of the changes I've posted here in another topic I made a few months back, but things have changed since then. &amp;nbsp; This will be an enormous wall of text ahead of you, just so you're warned. &amp;nbsp; What has changed? * Traits have all been revamped with the design focus on fun and build diversity. All mandatory traits are now baseline.

(6 sec) &amp;nbsp; --------------- ###Core Elementalist: Combo Trait Bonuses --------------- The concept of this new mechanic is to make core classes interesting again in comparison to all the other Sepcializations - Trait Combo's: While having no Specialization selected, having Trait lines next to each other unlocks bonus traits in between them, of which you can choose 1. &amp;nbsp; For example, Having Water in the middle, Fire on top and Earth on the bottom will unlock trait combinations between Fire - Water and Water - Earth. So the order in which you place each trait line now makes a difference. &amp;nbsp; **Fire + Water**: &amp;nbsp; * **Frostfire**: Applying Chill on a target will also apply Burning and vice versa. (1 sec cooldown for burning) ( 3 sec cooldown for chill ) * **Boiling Waters**: Deal 10% increased damage to burning targets while attuned to Water. * **Rejuvenating Flames**: Attuning to Fire grants Vigor and Regeneration to 5 allies in a 180 radius. &amp;nbsp; **Fire + Air**: &amp;nbsp; * **Blazing Speed**: Apply Swiftness when Attuning to Fire.

I've also added more controlled AoE options for the Scepter in order to compete with Dagger against multiple enemies. &amp;nbsp; **New Mechanics**: &amp;nbsp; **Fire** - **Heating Up**: Weapon skill 1 for Dagger, Scepter and Staff in Fire Attunement get amplified when using other fire weapon skills.

Applying Chill on a target with Icicles will consume the debuff and apply bonus damage depending on the amount of stacks on the target. (100 damage/stack) **Air** - **Overcharge**: Weapon 1 skills in Air Attunement grant a stack of Overcharge, causing your next other Air weapon skill to have less cooldown after activation by 5%. (max 6 stacks - 30% cooldown reduction) **Earth** - **Executioner**: Earth weapon skills deal 2% increased damage for each % of the target's missing health. &amp;nbsp; **Balance changes:** ---------------------- &amp;nbsp; **Dragon's Tooth**: A skill with 2 charges - charges up over time when in fire attunement and gain a charge when attuning to fire. Activating this skill will launch a dragon's tooth from your location to the selected area. * Impact Damage lowered from 799 -&gt; 490 (980 total damage from both charges) * Burning damage lowered from 1,310 -&gt; 805 (1610 total damage from both charges) **Dragon's Claw**: (Heating Up) Now Pierces Targets. Hitting a target with all 3 projectiles applies Burning. **Flamewall**: Damage from 37 -&gt; 120 Continuously applies it's damage to targets over it's 8 second duration. (Damaged targets cannot be damaged from this ability again for 1 second.) **Fireball**: (Heating Up) &amp;nbsp; **Ice Shards**: Applies Icicles **Shatterstone**: (Ammo: 3 - Gain a charge every 4 seconds. Have full ammo when attuning to Water) Summon a shatter stone at the chosen location, chilling enemies on contact (90 radius) which last for 6 seconds. When an attack deals a damaging hit against a shatterstone, or upon exiting water attunement, the stone(s) will explode. 459 Damage - 5 Vuln - Chill (180 radius) Cooldown reduced from 3 seconds to 1 second. 20% Increased damage to chilled targets. **Water Trident &lt;-&gt; Frozen Trident**: (On cast, water trident leaves behind a frozen trident on the ground and vice versa, picking this up will allow you to use this skill on an area).

Applies critical damage to chilled targets. **Vapor Blades**: Applies Icicles **Ice Spike**: Deals 20% increased damage to chilled targets. **Water Blast**: Applies Icicles * Every time Geyser and Healing Rain heal a target, increase the damage, healing, projectile size and healing radius of this skill on it's next cast by 5%. &amp;nbsp; **Arc Lightning**: Every time this skill reaches a new stage, it will fork and strike 2 nearby targets. If the target is isolated, shock the target for bonus damage instead. Fully completing the channel will cause one final fork/isolation shock. Grant a stack of Overcharge for every stage. **Blinding Flash**: Now also interrupts actions. A successful interruption dazes the target for 1 second. **Lightning Strike**: Becomes empowered after completing a fully charged Arc Lightning. (Visually stronger). * Damage lowered from 426 -&gt; 380 * Empowered: Initial Damage 380 -&gt; 460. After a small delay (1.1/2 seconds) strike target for 3 additional weaker lightning strikes. (25 damage each) **Chain Lightning**: Damage 258 -&gt; 320 If the main target is isolated, apply a discharge to the target for (150) bonus damage.

Cooldown increased from 8 -&gt; 10 **(Elite): Summon Greater Fire Elemental** (Duration 60 seconds) **(Elite): Summon Greater Water Elemental** (Duration 60 seconds) **(Elite): Summon Greater Air Elemental** (Duration 60 seconds) **(Elite): Summon Greater Earth Elemental** (Duration 60 seconds) Stomp Cooldown lowered 18 -&gt; 12 Stomp now also Immobilizes targets (1.1/2 seconds) &amp;nbsp; **Glyph of Storms**: Cast time of all Storms reduced from 1.1/4 -&gt; 0.3/4 sec. &amp;nbsp; **Tornado**: Take 33% reduced damage from projectiles. &amp;nbsp; --------------- ###**New Unlockable Weapon Skills** --------------- Instead of always adding new Specializations, another possibility to provide content is to let players seek out and unlock new weapon skills for their core weapons. Inspired from Guild Wars 1 where the player heads out into the world to find skills. &amp;nbsp; Once unlocked, a player can replace one of the weapon skills (except for weapon skill 1) with a newer one. This opens up new customization and possibly fix issues some weapons may have. &amp;nbsp; **New Skills** &amp;nbsp; **Tomb**: Engulf the target in a -x- bubble for 5 seconds, dealing low damage and applying -condition- with every interval. Applying direct damage to this target causes the bubble to splash -x- in a 180 radius. At the end of it's duration the bubble will explode. - **Fire**: Flame Tomb: Engulf the target in a fiery bubble, dealing damage and applying Burning with every interval. Direct damage splashes fire in a 180 radius. Explosion deals greater damage and applies burning. - **Water**: Watery Tomb: Engulf the target in a freezing water bubble, dealing damage and applying chill with every interval. Direct damage splashes water in a 180 radius, healing for small amounts. Explosion heals allies and damage/chills targets. - **Air**: Vacuum Tomb: Engulf the target in a vacuum bubble, dealing damage and draining endurance with every interval. Direct damage splashes sharp winds in a 180 radius. Explosion damages enemy targets and applies Swiftness and Vigor to allies. - **Earth**: Sand Tomb: Engulf the target in a sand whirling bubble, dealing damage and applying Bleeding with every interval, apply Blind every 2 seconds. Direct damage splashes Bleeding in a 180 radius. Explosion applies Bleeding and Blind. &amp;nbsp; **Ray**: Channel a stream of -x- at the target. Applying low -&gt; medium damage and effects with each interval. Completing the Ray applies greater damage and a bonus effect. - **Fire**: Heat Ray: Channel a stream of intense heat at the target. Applying damage and burning with every interval. Completing the Ray applies bonus damage and grants you 3 might. - **Water**: Frost Ray: Channel a stream of intense cold at the target. Applying damage, chill and vulnerability with every interval. Completing the ray applies bonus damage and immobilizes the target for 2 seconds. - **Air**: Gust Ray: Channel a stream of strong wind currents at the target. Applying low damage, interrupting all actions and pushing the target away during the channel. Completing the ray applies bonus damage and applies knock back on targets in a 240 radius. Gain Swiftness. - **Earth**: Petrifying Ray: Channel a stream of petrifying earth at the target. Applying low damage, weakness and cripple with every interval. Completing the ray applies bonus damage and stuns the target for 1.1/2 seconds. &amp;nbsp; **Shard**: (Ammo: 3) Launch a shard of -x- at the target, a successful hit will cause the shard to fall on the ground near the target closest to your position. Picking it up will refund 20% of it's cooldown. - **Fire**: Lava Shard: Launch a shard of lava at the target, dealing bonus area damage if the target is burning. - **Water**: Ice Shard: Launch a shard of Ice at the target, dealing bonus damage to Chilled targets. - **Air**: Lightning Shard: Launch a shard of lightning at the target. Dealing critical damage. - **Earth**: Crystal Shard: Launch a shard of crystal at the target, deals 5% increased damage for each unique condition you have applied and increases the duration of your conditions on the target by half a second. &amp;nbsp; --------------- ###**Thanks for reading** --------------- &amp;nbsp; Thank you for reading this wall of text and I hope you've enjoyed my changes and ideas about the Elementalist and the new Trait and Weapon system. &amp;nbsp; Tell me what you think and if you already know some cool builds please let me know! &amp;nbsp;"

PoVs: [Roul/Thief](URL [Deathly/Chrono](URL [Fennec/Chrono](URL This trio is something we wanted to do since quite a while already (roughly 5 months), but never ended up doing until we finally continued it last week. We worked a lot on the strats and even managed to break the old pre HoT 5man record by a few seconds! The Thief was in charge of getting to entities and to the endboss as fast as possible to solo them as well as stealthing the party and applying vulnerability. The Chronos sped up the run a lot with their portals while also providing party wide quickness and massive dps. While one chrono joined the thief in the endboss fight to provide 25 vuln on it, the other chrono killed off the npc to skip a pretty nasty dialogue that prevents the endboss from being attackable for roughly 15-20 seconds. Everyone was in charge of seperate stuff, which is why each PoV shows a different job being done! Hope you enjoy."
34,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"The Warclaw: Thoughts, speculations, pros and cons",0,au8scw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/au8scw/the_warclaw_thoughts_speculations_pros_and_cons/,2019-02-25 02:10:08,"I wanted to make this post due to the fact that we never got the Warclaw stream. Major condolences to the devs after a very difficult. &amp;#x200B; I wish to talk about the potential capabilities of the Warclaw and pros and cons of using it in WvW. &amp;#x200B; First and foremost the Warclaw has 4 capabilities. One of which is just allowing players access to faster travel speed and 3 different skills. &amp;#x200B; The engage skill being some type of pounce, which at this point we have no idea if it can do damage, apply conditions or both. This skill can be very good or detrimental depending on how it's balanced. I've heard from some sides of the debate that it shouldn't do any damage and only apply conditions, or very low damage, etc. I personally think that it should do some damage, but not so much to take even one third of even the glassiest of classes like eles. I think Vulnerability and Bleeding could be good conditions that the attack can apply as well considering you're being attacked by giant cat claws. They should not have a hard CC like knockdowns. That can certainly break the game. &amp;#x200B; The Chain Pull is a siege skill used to break down doors. (Other structures not sure if they are effective). This skill probably makes you completely stationary. Now in terms of balance, I think it should do between one sixth and one eighth the siege damage of a Ram. In other words, my balance would be using 6 or 8 players on mounts on a door is the equivalent of one Ram. Not sure if using this skill also requires supply, but I highly doubt it. Using this should be a better alternative to a group of players than just spamming their AoEs and Auto attack the doors. Using this may leave players very vulnerable to attack and dismounts if they aren't paying attention to their surroundings. &amp;#x200B; Final ability is a Evade skill that looks like a Raptor leap but with Evasion properties like the Jackal. Not so sure what the distance is on it, but I'm guessing slightly less than a maxed out Raptor. Although it could potentially be upgraded if its upgrade are unlocked in a similar fashion to other abilities in WvW. This should be very useful to of course dodge attacks, use it for quick escapes when things go south and potentially give zergs a method to attack another zerg's backline and such. &amp;#x200B; With all that out of the way, I want to make a list of Pros and Cons for using the Warclaw. Pros: 1. Faster travel: Pretty self explanatory. Should feel good to reach places faster, have it break falls for you if you run off cliffs and of course eliminate that sense of moving so slowly when you first hop into your team's base and desperately trying to reach your zerg on the opposite end of the map. 2. Siege supplement: As long as it's as strong as I mentioned earlier, this should be a good extra for siege combat. 3. New engagement options: Fact is the evasion can add a new element for combat. Being able to jump through the backline of zergs, sweeping camps like a Calvary and new pushing methods available when attempting to capture keeps and of course go through the insane bottle neck that always happens in Stonemist Castle halls. It shouldn't be used as a primary method of attack due to a few cons I'll mention here, but should be good enough for some potential high risk, high reward play if done right. Cons: 1. Large Hitbox: Frankly, riding the mount makes you stick out like a sore thumb. Almost every player will see you coming. Might not be a good idea to use it if you intend to sneak into or around structures. 2. Low health (Potentially): The Warclaw could have an average health of 6k. If I were to give it a highball number, I'd say 8k at most. Would make sense for a Warbeast to be made strong enough for war, but of course we'll have to see for ourselves how that goes. But regardless, having a low health pool makes you quite vulnerable to getting dismounted real quickly with high damage attacks. And we all know how bad it's going to get when you get knocked off. About 2 seconds of you bouncing off in place will make you very susceptible to more attack that will kill you quickly. So yeah, make sure that doesn't happen and run when you can. 3. Not great for pure combat: A fundamental aspect of zerg combat is to make sure that everyone in the group has boons applied to them. Without boons, zergs can die off really quickly and can't do much damage. With that said, you will lose access to your utility skills while mounted on. Best thing to do in that case is to make sure that everyone gets off their mounts as soon as they see an enemy zerg to then top themselves off with boons before engaging. &amp;#x200B; Overall, my recommendations or thoughts when using the mount if everything I've mentioned is accurate: 1. Every group will use the Warclaw mostly for quicker travel. 2. Havoc groups will make the most of the mount given that they mostly avoid engaging zergs and just capture objectives. 3. Using the Warclaw offensively can be very situational. It to me shouldn't be used for pure combat. Only used during certain scenarios. &amp;#x200B; With all that said, I hope I've hit the nail on some things, but of course we'll see how it goes when it goes live. Hope you've enjoyed the read and add anything else you've thought of down below. &amp;#x200B;"

But at this point I'm pretty confident the achievement is bugged. This achievement is for the Dragonsblood Rifle and requires you to kill 30 enemies with a rifle in Thunderhead Peaks. One of the other achievements requires you to apply vulnerability against 30 enemies and then kill them and that one ticked off just fine. So far I've killed well over 30 branded and regular enemies by getting killing blows with a rifle on my Engineer, the same with kits, the same with Photon Forge, and killed 30 branded as well as regular enemies on my Thief. I've also done an entire met event on my Engineer where I did not keep track of what enemies I killed or with what I got the killing blow with.

The latest MTP videos and discussions about Freezie and the latest LW story instance showed some ideas of what can be done. &amp;nbsp; For me (play on NA servers on OCx timezone) the hardest part of raids (and sometimes even FOTM CMs) is to find groups. Most static groups start too late for me (I have to work early) and it's really hard to find PUGs. &amp;nbsp; For some people the content is too hard, or takes too long. Some people have bad ping and think they won't be able to react to the fight or mechanics. Others might not understand the mechanics and are not capable or willing to research it. &amp;nbsp; Personally, I don't think just having an ""easy mode"" will make (a lot) more people opt to try the hard/normal modes, but most likely do the easy mode and be done with it. In the long run, raids will be just easy mode as less people play the harder/normal versions... &amp;nbsp; But what if raids were scaling content? And such scaling could be applied to more than just the traditional raids, but create more instances (story instances, dungeons, etc) that could use the scaling system too? &amp;nbsp; The idea of the scaling is to use specific NPCs, just like GW1 used heros/henchmen/mercenaries. Just like the final instance of the LW used a couple optional NPCs. **This way, not only people learning the fight can use the NPCs to make it all easier, but groups that are missing one or more players can fill up at the cost of lower rewards.** - Each NPC creates a change in the fight and takes up a space in the squad (so a max of 9 NPCs can be hired). - Hiring a NPC will reduce the rewards for the instance (just like in the LW episode). - Only one NPC of each type can be hired. - NPC's buffs and actions have unlimited range. - With the exception of the tank NPC, NPCs do not drawn aggro or take any dmg. They only die when all the players in the squad are defeated. &amp;nbsp; NPCs Ideas: **Offensive NPCs** - They deal dmg and/or provide buffs to the whole squad. dmg is focused on the marked target, or on the target that the squad leader is attacking, or on the highest level (non invulnerable) target in the area. - The Offensive Chronomancer: This NPC will maintain quickness and alacrity to the whole squad and deal massive breakbar dmg whenever the breakbar is open. It does small dps with a ranged GS attack and constantly strip boons from its target. - The Necromancer: This NPC will constantly remove conditions from the whole squad and apply all conditions (doing small dps) to all mobs in the area. It constantly corrupt boons on all mobs in the area. - The Deadeye: This NPC will stay far from the boss and shoot it with their riffle. Essentially a Single target DPS bot. It does constant high dmg to the boss (or the highest lvl opponent in the area that is not invulnerable), dmg is of constant value independent of boss thoughness or weakness. - The Elementalist: This NPC does constant high AoE dmg to all mobs in the area. Essentially a AoE DPS bot. dmg is of constant value independent of boss thoughness or weakness. - The Herald: This NPC will provide the whole squad with 25 might and fury. It does small cleave dps with sword/shield. It does massive breakbar dmg whenever a breakbar is up. - The Warrior: This NPC provide banners and apply 25 vulnerability on the target. It does moderate cleave dps with a greatsword. &amp;nbsp; **Defensive NPCs** - They will heal the whole squad and provide defensive buffs. They can also ress downed players. - The Druid: This NPC will cast strong heals around any player that goes below 50% HP. His pet will quickly revive downed players, one at a time. - The Water Tempest: This NPC will constantly cast small area heals and provide regeneration and vigor to the whole squad. At least once every 90 seconds he will ""rebound"" any and all downed players back up. - The Scrapper: This NPC will provide the whole squad with protection, stability and constant bulwark gyro buff. It will also send a explosion gyro whenever the breakbar is available. This NPC sends a function gyro to ress any downed player, one at a time. &amp;nbsp; **Mechanic NPCs** - They help with fight mechanics in different ways. - The Guardian: This NPC will drawn aggro from everything that has an aggro mechanic. It's very sturdy and heals itself and constantly blocks attacks. This is the only NPC that can be downed and defeated, he can also be raised by the players or other NPCs. - The Defensive Chronomancer: This NPC will slow the fight down. Boss attacks will be slower, phases will take longer, mechanics will slow down, enrage timers will double. Great option to learning the fight. "
39,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"Siren's Reef, a review",1,akixsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/akixsh/sirens_reef_a_review/,2019-01-28 13:39:23,"Let me preface this by saying how glad I am that we're going to be consistently getting new fractals (until we hit 25 unique fractals, then who knows what will happen). That Anet wants to tell a story/storyline behind each fractal is great (chaos/nightmare/shattered). With that said, Siren's Reef has to be my most hated fractal to ever touch the gamemode. Let me try to explain how painful it is to go through this fractal on *any* tier. Even without instabilities thrown into the equation, each encounter in the fractal contribute to its tediousness. To start, the group must clear a group of saurians. Sure, no big deal, it's similar enough to clearing the trash mobs at the start of other fractals like chaos or cliffside. However, unlike those fractal trash mobs, saurians are arguably one of the most irritating species to fight; * Bonebreakers: They run you over until you break their bar. * Bristlebacks: They spam their scales at you unless you reflect, and if you don't reflect, you get destroyed by them. You want to interrupt them? Break their bar. But wait... they've stopped attacking because by the time you get enough CC to break them, their attacks are done. * Smoke(Smog*)scales: Evade spam attack as an opener then immediately afterwards throw down a blind field and stay in it. I get the feeling Anet initially put Smokescales in but then realized how much stronger they are to Smogscales and swapped them out. * Stonehead: The only mob of the bunch that isn't a pain to kill. All you do is CC, burn, and avoid the easy-tell attacks. Afterwards, you get to a cannon to clear away a wall by shooting some mines; but apparently if someone runs into the mines, you can't blow the wall up until all of the mines respawn. Why would this even be a decision? Then you move onto fighting pirates as some pre-boss fight. These would be ok if they didn't crap out boons like they've just eaten at a taco bell. Stability, might, fury, quickness, protection? They've got it all. Let's not forget the conditions they put onto us: chill, vulnerability, weakness, blind, and some various damage-over-time condis like bleeding. You finally get into the boss fight in the middle of the fractal, a skeleton that spams instant-down/kill mines. You try to CC him but then realize he doesn't even get stunned, only vulnerable likely because one of the constantly spawning pirates put stability on him. You can't pull any of these spawning pirates in to cleave them because they all have stability. The boss itself pulses its own boons. You can't move because you're absolutely surrounded by mines. After you finally kill the boss, you move onto the ""hot potato"" maze. I think they could've made this section of the fractal worse, but decided not to; regardless, it's still pretty bad. Throw the stashes to your teammates to run it for a little bit to the end to then give it to the next person. Avoid those detection circles though! Otherwise you get to see more boonspamming pirates. Another issue I could see some groups having was that the throw animation and casting-times were so long that by the time the stash would land on their teammate, the detection circle would be over the teammate. The last part of the fractal that I'm going to discuss is the final boss fight, which in reality is 3 separate fights. First off, I am glad beyond words that there are checkpoints between each boss; the group I was doing this with wiped after the 2nd boss because we became overrun with trash mobs - I wasn't even aware that they put them in until today because I often avoid Siren's Reef because of my points above and below. Moving along, your party is besieged by constant waves of pirates that must be defended from by cannon fire. While 2 people are using the cannons, the rest of the team runs the treasure to the ship to spawn the next boss. Once the treasure is placed, the next boss spawns. Each boss fight is fairly similar in some regard. They all pulse their own boons, there are constantly spawning pirates which will pulse their own boons to others and stun the your party, and the boss has its own knockback mechanic to launch you off the ship. After killing the captain, the fractal is over and you can move on from the devastating trauma you've had to endure for the past 10+ minutes. You get barely any rewards throughout the fractal except for the end rewards; the pirates don't drop anything (because they're constantly spawning, Anet probably wanted to prevent them from being farmed). That's the whole fractal *without* instabilities. Today, Siren's Reef was a daily T4 with the instabilities: No Pain, No Gain; Sugar Rush; and Hamstrung. With these instabilities, Siren's Reef became significantly more tedious. Every pirate spawning that was hit automatically started with 10 might, fury, and protection on top of the boons they output themselves as well as Sugar Rush (because all the trash mobs are elite or less). Hamstrung wasn't as bad, but could be felt through the maze as picking up the treasure caused us to get stacks of agony and then triggering Hamstrung to add movement speed debuffs. Hopefully ArenaNet can dial down the issues I've mentioned above, but for the time being I will likely not be running this fractal ever again. The time it takes to go through the tediousness of this fractal is not fairly rewarded at all. Deepstone was on a similar level to this, but after playing Siren's Reef for a couple of weeks I would gladly take Deepstone over Siren's Reef. **TL;DR:** Siren's Reef's gameplay is awful, I would rather do Deepstone over it."

41,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Necro elitespecialization concept: The Equalizer,1,a78e31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/a78e31/necro_elitespecialization_concept_the_equalizer/,2018-12-18 17:05:31,"As a longtime necromancer main, I've been pondering for quite a while now on how a new elite specialization for the necromancer might look like, adding new facets and ideas without changing the entire core concept of the necromancer. After a few reflections, I settled on the following concept which, in my opinion, would make for a great and fun elite specialization. I'm writing it down here mostly to get feedback and the offchance of a bored A-net employee stumbling on this post and perhaps taking inspiration from some of the ideas featured here :smile: . #Lore background: The life force, a force that is intimate with all living things and represents their time left alive. A capable necromancer knows how to suck it out of its victims and use it for its own dark schemes. The death force, the absolute opposite, the ying to the yang, indicates the proximity of a creature towards its end. The higher the death force, the nearer its bearer stands at deaths door. Even this invisible power, unrecognizable to the untrained eye, can be manipulated. The Equalizer has dedicated his life to this art. His goal is to create an absolute balance between these two forces ... a balance that benefits him. So he uses his destructive powers to suck the life force from the bodies of his enemies to feed them his allies deemed worthy. By extending these lives their death force is released which the Equalizer in turn uses to rain down even more death upon his enemies thus giving him more life force for his deadly plans. #Main concept The Equalizer gets, next to the well known life force which mainly fills by death and damage to enemies, access to a new resource called ""death force"", in contrast fillingt through healing and resurrecting allies. In logical conclusion he also gains a second shroud adding to the offensive death shroud with a supportive life shroud filled with healing and boons for him to support himself and his allies. The gameplay would now boil down to the Equalizer using the strong heals in the life shroud to gain enough death force to enter the death shroud where he in turn would do enough damage and the killing needed to fill the life force and swap back to the life shroud. A good equalizer player would be able to juggle between these two shrouds (with a 9 second CD) while one still lacking experience or one getting pressured by damage will have to use the normal necro weapons, aswell as the new one (the shortbow), therefore making that content relevant aswell. #Traits **Minor Expert** Allows the necromancer the use of Pact-abilities both inside and outside of the shrouds and exchanges the death shroud with the life shroud, providing him with supportive abilities. Also gives him access to a new resource, the death force, filling up through healing done while in the life shroud (x% of healing done while in life shroud as death force), which in turn can now be used to enter the death shroud. While in death shroud, gain life force based on damage dealt (x% of damage done while in death shroud as life force). While in death shroud 100% of the additional Healing Power and Concentration gets converted to Power and Ferocity respectively. While in life shroud 100% of the additional Power and Ferocity gets converted to Healing Power and Concentration respectively. 50% of the damage and healing taken while in a shroud additionaly gets applied towards the Equalizers health pool. **Expert Majors** 1: You gain life force through applied conditions instead of damage dealt (1% per condition). You gain death force through applied boons instead of healing done (1% per boon on self, 0.25% per boon on ally) 2: You deal 1% more extra damage to enemies with vulnerability per stack. Healing on allies with regeneration is increased by 20% 3: Your abilites in death shroud steal life. damage taken in life shroud is decreased by 20% **Minor Master** While in death shroud, damage to the Equalizers health pool is decreased to 40% (instead of 50%) **Master Major** 1: While in a shroud the attribute conversion aplies to condition damage and expertise instead of power and ferocity respectively. The boons and condition done by shroud abilities last 50% longer. 2: Damage dealt and Healing done is increased by 5% when when either life force or death force is over 50% and increased by 15% when both are over 50% 3: While in death shroud you gain 20% of your ferocity as toughness. While in life shroud gain 20% of your concentration as vitality. **Minor Grandmaster** Your healing has a chance, depending on your prescision, to critically heal for 150% of its original value. **Grandmaster Major** 1: Every death shroud skill applies a random damaging condition on each hit. Every life shroud skill applies a random boon on each heal. Applying a condition to an enemy removes a boon (5 second interal cooldown per enemy). Applying a boon to an ally cleanses a condition (5 seconds internal cooldown per ally), 2: When changing directly from one shroud into the other gain 10% increased damage and healing for 12 seconds stacking up to 5 times. Duration refreshes on each stack but all stacks are lost at once. 3: Damage taken while in a shroud fills up life force aswell as death force (x% of the damage taken for other shroud, x/5% of the damage taken for own shroud) ####Comment In the traits I tried to follow A-nets approach as in the PoF specializations and thus the upper, middle and lower traitlines have each been given a clear identity. The numbers for the % figures are, of course, tweakable depending on game balance and should mainly just represent the rough concept i was going for with the specific trait. Furthermore, I tried to emphasize strengths for this specialization in all game areas, so that this class would be playable in PvP (through something like Boonstrip, Stabi, Survivability) as well as in PvE (Raids, Fractals etc). The damage values of the normal death shroud are relatively low, which is why I've considered such strong damage multipliers. In addition, I took the holo-smith's approach and its individualization of the photon forge through its traits as a model to shape the traits of the Equalizer with regard to the individualization of his shrouds. #Skills ####Healing Skill Healing bond: **Pact**. Heal for a small amount. Bind yourself to the nearest opponent (900 range) for 5 seconds. Whenever you take damage steal 200 life from your connected enemy (internal CD 0.5 seconds). 25 sec CD ####Utility Skills Decaying bond: **Pact**. Bind yourself to the targeted enemy (900 range) for 9 seconds. Whenever it gets a condition, you gain the appropriate converted boon. Whenever you receive a boon, your target gains the appropriate corrupted condition (0.5 seconds of internal CD in both directions). 30 sec CD Strengthening bond: **Pact**. Bind yourself to 5 allies near you (600 range) for 9 seconds. Whenever you grant yourself a boon during this time, all bound allies also receive a copy of it and you receive the corresponding corrupted condition for each boon that is shared this way. 36 sec CD Shattering bond: **Pact**. Bind yourself and 4 allies near you (600 range) to the targeted enemy (900 range) for 3 seconds. Whenever you heal a bound ally, you inflict 50% of the healing done as damage to the target. Whenever you deal damage to the target, all bound allies are healed for 20% of the damage. 35 sec CD Protective bond: **Pact**. Bind yourself to up to 5 nearby allies (600 range) for 4 seconds. You receive less 10% damage from all sources for each bound ally. Whenever one of the bound allies takes damage you transfer 50% of the damage to yourself. At the end of the duration you deal 50% of the damage taken by this ability to nearby enemies (180 Radius). 40 sec CD ####Elite Skill Binding Remorse **Pakt**. Bin yourself and 10 nearby allies to eachother (600 range) for 3 seconds. Each bound ally deals 2500 damage with each strike as extra damage. This damage heals each bound ally for 500 (20%) and grants a stack of might for 7 seconds to each nound ally aswell (internal CD per person 1 sec each). 120 sec CD ####Comment: Of course, as with the traits, the numbers in these skills are of course not perfect in terms of balance and are again mostly for representing the concept of the skill in question. A goal while making these Skills was always to balance the positive aspects for allies with the negative aspects for enemies so creating an equal amount of conditions or damage on one hand aswell as boons and heal on the other, just distributed in a way that would be beneficial for the Equalizer and detremental for his enemies. Another design choice was the importance of having atleast one skill which synergizes well with each one of the trailtlines so that every player has atleast one skill that suits his playstyle. ####Skill while in the life shroud 1: **Projectile**. Heals allies it passes through. Splashes a heal around its hit target instead of damage. (like water-staff autohits on elementalist without the damage) 2: **Targeted Area**. Shadowstep to the targeted Location (600 range). Heal 5 allies in the area and give them Regeneration for 8 seconds aswell as alacrity for 3 seconds (180 radius) 3: **Area**. You stunbreak 5 nearby allies and grant them boons. Nearer enemies get more boons. (600 radius for 3seconds of stab and protection, 360 Radius for 6 seconds of 2 stab and protection) 4: **Area Channelung**. Heal 5 nearby allies strongly over 9 pulses (600 radius), Gain 0.5% extra death force for each ally per pulse. 5: **Area**. Bind yourself to 5 Allies (600 range) for 4 seconds. Pulse healing and might (2 stacks for 12 seconds) 4 times to bound allies. At the end every bound ally gains 6 seconds of protection. ####Comment The skills in the life shroud are not that different from the ones we know from the death shroud. Instead of causing damage to enemies, allies are healed and instead of afflicting condition, you gain and distribute boons. But the main concept of each of the abilities remains the same. The strong synergies then occur in conjunction with the traits, which then either grant greatly enhanced healing, much higher boon application or longer survivability. ####Shortbow skills (900 range mostly) 1: **Projectile**. A shot which deals damage to the first enemy hit and splashes a small amount of healing to allies at impact (180 radius). 2: **Targeted Area**. Shoot an arrow to the targeted area which explodes into a field lasting 3 seconds and pulsing once every second (180 radius). Enemies in the field get 3 stacks of confusion for 5 seconds per puls. Allies get 5 seconds of retaliation per puls. (5 target limit) 3: **Area Projectile**. Shoot 12 arrows in a circle around you (360 radius) which on hitting an ally heal them and grant you death force for each arrow hit (2%). 4: **Projectile**. After a short time of aiming fire a fast arrow which hits enemies near the target (360 Radius) for high damage. Grants life force for each enemy hit (5%). 5: **Projectile**. A strong shot which stuns the hit target briefly (2 seconds). After hitting the arrow shatters into 5 parts which when picked up grant 3 second of stability to an ally. ####Comment With these skills, it was important to me to offer each of the playstyles a good skill without all the others feeling completly useless. Furthermore i made sure that this weapon, like most other weapons, had increasingly stronger abilities and longer cooldowns from skill 1 to 5. In addition, when playing with the shortbow, you should have the ability to choose which one of the shrouds you enter first. Thats why the shortbow needed to have an ability to create life force aswell as one to create death force. Overall the shortbow should be an alternative to the Staff without directly replacing it and reflect the general themes, feeling and concept of the rest of the elite specialization. #Important Stats Healing Power and Power/Condition damage Concentration and Ferocity/Expertise Prescision #Conclusion If you've made it this far through this Novel i can just say: Thanks :smile: . Ofcourse i know that the chance that A-net is going to make this class into an actual elite specialization is extremly low and thats totally fine. I just wanted to make this public because it was a little passion project of mine and because i love playing necro so much. I would love to read your opinions and critizism and if by chance an A-net employee stumbles over this i would love to hear from him how my concept compares to A-nets design philosophies when creating new elite specs (just out of curiousity :wink: ). All in all i tried to make an Elite Spec which uses the main concept of the necromancer, the death shroud, and give my unique spin on it while still giving us a reason to keep using the old death shroud skills and setting a strong contrast to the shroudless Scourge in PoF. It was important to me that the class, while playable as Power DPS, Condi DPS and Support would not invalidate any of the other Necro elite specializations. With being half support-half damage it doesnt compete with heal scourge as a full support or the DPS specs as a full dps but can exist beside them letting all elite specs stay relevant. The numbers being mostly placeholders I leave the balancing to A-net :wink: . Even if the elite spec doesnt get released, perhaps I gave someone at arenanet some idea or maybe i just gave you a good time reading this. all in all i just hope that you enjoyed and if you have tips and ideas or questions, feel free to ask. I hope you liked this elite specialization: **The Equalizer** Thx A-net for your great game Erik aka. Shen Deathbringer"
42,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Necro elitespecialization concept: The Equalizer,1,a78giw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/a78giw/necro_elitespecialization_concept_the_equalizer/,2018-12-18 17:15:29,"As a longtime necromancer main, I've been pondering for quite a while now on how a new elite specialization for the necromancer might look like, adding new facets and ideas without changing the entire core concept of the necromancer. After a few reflections, I settled on the following concept which, in my opinion, would make for a great and fun elite specialization. I'm writing it down here mostly to get feedback and the offchance of a bored A-net employee stumbling on this post and perhaps taking inspiration from some of the ideas featured here :smile: . #Lore background: The life force, a force that is intimate with all living things and represents their time left alive. A capable necromancer knows how to suck it out of its victims and use it for its own dark schemes. The death force, the absolute opposite, the ying to the yang, indicates the proximity of a creature towards its end. The higher the death force, the nearer its bearer stands at deaths door. Even this invisible power, unrecognizable to the untrained eye, can be manipulated. The Equalizer has dedicated his life to this art. His goal is to create an absolute balance between these two forces ... a balance that benefits him. So he uses his destructive powers to suck the life force from the bodies of his enemies to feed them his allies deemed worthy. By extending these lives their death force is released which the Equalizer in turn uses to rain down even more death upon his enemies thus giving him more life force for his deadly plans. #Main concept The Equalizer gets, next to the well known life force which mainly fills by death and damage to enemies, access to a new resource called ""death force"", in contrast fillingt through healing and resurrecting allies. In logical conclusion he also gains a second shroud adding to the offensive death shroud with a supportive life shroud filled with healing and boons for him to support himself and his allies. The gameplay would now boil down to the Equalizer using the strong heals in the life shroud to gain enough death force to enter the death shroud where he in turn would do enough damage and the killing needed to fill the life force and swap back to the life shroud. A good equalizer player would be able to juggle between these two shrouds (with a 9 second CD) while one still lacking experience or one getting pressured by damage will have to use the normal necro weapons, aswell as the new one (the shortbow), therefore making that content relevant aswell. #Traits **Minor Expert** Allows the necromancer the use of Pact-abilities both inside and outside of the shrouds and exchanges the death shroud with the life shroud, providing him with supportive abilities. Also gives him access to a new resource, the death force, filling up through healing done while in the life shroud (x% of healing done while in life shroud as death force), which in turn can now be used to enter the death shroud. While in death shroud, gain life force based on damage dealt (x% of damage done while in death shroud as life force). While in death shroud 100% of the additional Healing Power and Concentration gets converted to Power and Ferocity respectively. While in life shroud 100% of the additional Power and Ferocity gets converted to Healing Power and Concentration respectively. 50% of the damage and healing taken while in a shroud additionaly gets applied towards the Equalizers health pool. **Expert Majors** 1: You gain life force through applied conditions instead of damage dealt (1% per condition). You gain death force through applied boons instead of healing done (1% per boon on self, 0.25% per boon on ally) 2: You deal 1% more extra damage to enemies with vulnerability per stack. Healing on allies with regeneration is increased by 20% 3: Your abilites in death shroud steal life. damage taken in life shroud is decreased by 20% **Minor Master** While in death shroud, damage to the Equalizers health pool is decreased to 40% (instead of 50%) **Master Major** 1: While in a shroud the attribute conversion aplies to condition damage and expertise instead of power and ferocity respectively. The boons and condition done by shroud abilities last 50% longer. 2: Damage dealt and Healing done is increased by 5% when when either life force or death force is over 50% and increased by 15% when both are over 50% 3: While in death shroud you gain 20% of your ferocity as toughness. While in life shroud gain 20% of your concentration as vitality. **Minor Grandmaster** Your healing has a chance, depending on your prescision, to critically heal for 150% of its original value. **Grandmaster Major** 1: Every death shroud skill applies a random damaging condition on each hit. Every life shroud skill applies a random boon on each heal. Applying a condition to an enemy removes a boon (5 second interal cooldown per enemy). Applying a boon to an ally cleanses a condition (5 seconds internal cooldown per ally), 2: When changing directly from one shroud into the other gain 10% increased damage and healing for 12 seconds stacking up to 5 times. Duration refreshes on each stack but all stacks are lost at once. 3: Damage taken while in a shroud fills up life force aswell as death force (x% of the damage taken for other shroud, x/5% of the damage taken for own shroud) ####Comment In the traits I tried to follow A-nets approach as in the PoF specializations and thus the upper, middle and lower traitlines have each been given a clear identity.

44,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Why is warrior axe so good?,1,a9kaqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/a9kaqi/why_is_warrior_axe_so_good/,2018-12-26 12:40:21,"Just wondering why axe is considered so good on warrior. I understand off hand 4 and 5, but what makes main hand axe so good? Is it the vulnerability or is the auto just higher DPS. I would think the auto on main hand dagger would be good because of the might and critical hit damage?"
45,vulnerability,Guildwars2,A Breath of Fresh Air in Fractals: Boonhorn Tempest,1,abyjvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/abyjvs/a_breath_of_fresh_air_in_fractals_boonhorn_tempest/,2019-01-03 09:27:09,"**TL;DR** Boonhorn Tempest is an offensive support designed to be an alternative to Druid in Fractals. At the cost of Spirits and Spotter, this build allows for greater flexibility depending on the needs of the party while maintaining decent healing and 5/6 boons that Druid provides. Pros: * Perma Fury, Swiftness, Regen, Vigor, 25x Might * High Vulnerability Output * Moderate protection uptime * Decent Healing * Lifesaver via Rebound * Extended Aura Duration * Static Charge Cons: * Might dependent on field blasting * Lose Spotter &amp; Spirits [The Backbone](URL Under the effects of the Large Mist Mobility Potion with 150 AR, this build will hit about 80% boon duration, which is more than enough for boon uptime. From here, there are three main builds depending on the needs of the party: [Standard Offense](URL This build maximizes damage while still being able to maintain boons. Used if your party doesn't need much healing. [Healing Gear](URL Used if your party needs a little extra love from your heals while still keeping up damage. [Please Don't Die](URL Dropping Arcane and Imbued Melodies means you need to take more Harrier's gear to keep up boon duration. This is likely more healing than needed in a fractal setting, healing over 1,000 per shout and Overload just from Elemental Bastion. Due to the amount of auras you give allies from Powerful Aura/Unstable Conduit, you can forgo Feel the Burn and Flash Freeze for things like Glyph of Renewal and Frost Bow. Always take Aftershock though for the blast finish. ###Rotation * Fire: 5 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; Overload -&gt; Aftershock -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4 * Earth: 4 -&gt; 2 From here, you have time to overload one element before repeating. This allows you to Overload Earth for more protection uptime on your party, go to Water for healing, or Air for damage. 75% of the time you can go through Air for the damage and CC. ###Might While your might generation is dependent on blasting your numerous fire fields, you don't have to worry too much on making sure your teammates are in the blasts due to Warhorn 4, Heat Sync, which copies your might to allies in a radius of 600. With this skill, you can actually output over 40 stacks of might to allies while in fire, so you will be more than covered. ###Fury, Regen, Swiftness, Vigor Given when spreading auras. Pretty simple. Also grant regen and swiftness when going to water and Air, respectively. Fury is also copied from Heat Sync. ###Vulnerability Air 5 &amp; Overload, is all you got, and will likely be all you need. ###Healing Brought to you from 5 sources: Regen, Wash the Pain Away, Water 4, 5, and Overload. Reserve Water 4 for if absolutely necessary, as it's also one of your few CC abilities. ###Auras Tempest's contribution in the unique abilities department, are mainly used for handing out boons. However, there are specific instances to prioritize spreading certain auras. Aftershock should be used after Overload Fire as another blast finisher, or during phases with lots of projectiles. Flash Freeze should be used whenever your team is going to take a big hit, preferably timed after going into Earth for Protection as well. Feel the Burn should be used off cooldown. It is also the only one that can be activated during a channel, as it's an instant cast. ###Conclusion While not an optimal replacement for Druid in the meta, Boonhorn Tempest aims to be a viable, more offensive focused alternative that can be used in situations with a low healing requirement to provide a greater personal damage contribution to the party. This build can also be modified to output exceptional healing, generous aura application, and powerful party saving skills."
46,vulnerability,Guildwars2,My personal list of GW2 armor runes PART 1,1,9yheyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9yheyw/my_personal_list_of_gw2_armor_runes_part_1/,2018-11-20 01:52:34,"In light of the November 13th patch with the major armor/sigil runes overhaul, i have made my own personal list on armor rune changes. I personally felt that most of the runes changes were lackluster and the minor power creep on the 6th rune did little to address the issue with build-crafting in the game. There are some runes where i have not changed the effects and instead buffed them as it sometimes feels a bit underwhelming. For most runes, i have added either a 4th tier effect and/or a 4th and 2nd tier effect. I will NOT be covering weapon sigils as i have limited understanding of them. I would also like to mention that Im a mostly pve player and the most difficult content i have played is tier 4 fractal challenge mode. As such, most of these changes may be horribly biased against PvP, WvW and perhaps even raiding, and if so, i apologize. Do feel free to comment and provide constructive criticism on what you think might be under/overpowered and/or uninteresting. Also note that these numbers are very much subject to change as these are more of a flair thing and to promote niche playstyles.

TLDR at the bottom if you're lazy but please read the whole thing, it's not as long as it looks due to formatting. Feedback is appreciated as long as it's not ""This bad/dumb/lame ect.,"" or ""You're bad/dumb/lame ect."" I think the problem most people have with banners and spirits isn't that they exist, but that they're unique. With that in mind, I thought up this. Guardian trait Perfect Inscriptions changed to: Healing and Elite Signets gain reduced recharge and improved passive effects. Utility Signets no longer have an activated ability, instead passively boosting 2 stats for allies within range. Recharge Reduced: 20% Effectiveness Increased: 20% Utility Signet Radius: 600 Number of Allied Targets: 10 Effects do not stack with Warrior Banners Bane Signet gives 170 Power and 170 Ferocity Signet of Wrath gives 170 Condition Damage and 170 Precision Signet of Mercy gives 170 Healing Power and 170 Concentration Signet of Judgment gives 10% reduced Damage and Condition Damage taken and 170 Toughness Engineer trait Experimental Turrets changed to: Turrets no longer Overcharge when first placed, instead granting Boons and an additional buff to allies in the area Healing Turret: Vigor (3s) and a chance to heal when attacking (note: would still grant regen as well) Flame Turret: 3 Stacks of Might (10s) and a chance to Burn enemies when attacking Rifle Turret: Fury (5s) and a chance to grant bonus damage to nearby allies Rocket Turret: Retaliation (3s) and a chance to apply vulnerability when attacking Thumper Turret: Protection (3s) and a chance to gain additional Protection when hit Net Turret: Swiftness (10s) and a chance to Cripple enemies when attacking Buff Interval: 10 seconds Boon Radius: 600 Buff Radius: 1,000 (note: attack ranges would be unchanged) Effects do not stack with Ranger Spirits These changes apply to professions that already have an idea somewhat close to the unique buffs in their current traits and would enable slightly more flexibility in group comp as far as the unique buffs are concerned. I feel pretty good about the Guardian changes, as the only things you lose that might matter in PvE is the stun on Bane Signet, but Guardian has decent CC without it and could always take Hammer of Wisdom if they needed additional that badly. I'm not much of a PvPer, so I'm not sure how badly the res on Signet of Mercy would be missed, but this doesn't strike me as a PvP trait anyway. Maybe I'm wrong about that. The other issues I see is not with Guardian itself, but with Warrior potentially losing a spot in PvE because Guard gives the banner buffs with better dps. That's almost a pro though, as it could incentivize Anet to look at Warrior and make some changes instead of allowing it to stake by on the strength of it's unique buffs alone. I'm less sure about the Engi changes, as I have very little experience with the profession. I was trying to keep the idea of the original trait as much as possible, but I'm not entirely sure these changes would be balanced. And maybe the trait would need to be swapped with something in a different line for it to work build wise? Again, not an Engi player. TLDR: Change traits for Guardian and Engi so Signets and Turrets match, but do not stack with, the unique buffs of Warrior Banners and Ranger Spirits."
49,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Suggestion: A few changes to the weaver elite,1,a1szxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/a1szxq/suggestion_a_few_changes_to_the_weaver_elite/,2018-12-01 01:43:18,"Hello Reddit. I would like to talk about some issue's that I currently have with one of my favorite elementalist skill; 'Weave Self'. Weave Self is a very fun skill that sees almost no play in pve because it's being held back by a few problems. First of all there is the problem of the toughness buff that you gain while attuning to earth. As most of you will know almost all raid encounters use an aggro mechanic that relies on the tank having the most toughness, which is a huge deal for this skill because it grants the user a whopping 320 toughness. The one condition build that runs this skill also has to deal with 150 toughness from an earth trait. This means that the tank has to run more than 1590 toughness to be able to tank reliably. An easy fix for this would be for weave self to grant flat damage reduction. Secondly there are a few, what I consider, 'boring' buffs from water and air. Water grants 20% outgoing heal effectiveness (which is fine) but also 20% boon duration. Weaver is a very selfish spec that grants almost no boons so I find this a weird design choice. 20% boon duration would be amazing for something like a tempest but it's practically useless for a weaver. Air grants the user 50% increased movement speed, which sounds amazing until you realize that movement speed is handled uniquely in gw2. Movement speed in this game has a hard cap that can almost be reached with only swiftness out of combat. This skill won't make you run like sonic but will instead feel like having super speed. This might be more of a personal opinion but I find this very boring on a spec that has a lot of sources of swiftness already. Not to mention on a specialization that has a trait that enhances swiftness. Finally there is the unique skill that you gain if you manage to 'gather' all the elements. This skill is called 'Tailored Victory' and floats up to 5 targets around you for 2.5 seconds. Thematically I like the idea of a float on elementalist a lot but practically I find it way too hard to use this skill reactively. This skill is already one of the hardest skills to use in the game (it forces a complete change of rotation) and it takes a long time to 'gather' all the elements. If you manage to actually damage a breakbar with this skill, you're probably anticipating the breakbar or just very lucky. A few better ideas imo would be for tailored victory to temporally splash it's unique buffs to allies. Or even better, deal harmful conditions for every element you've gathered (burning, chilled, vulnerability and bleeding). This skill already sees play in condition builds (fire gives 20% condition damage) so why not. I really want this skill to see more play because it's one of the more unique skills in the game with a lot of potential. Also I'm so done with fiery greatsword :P. Thank you if you've read my wall of text and let me know what you think in the comments! tldr: Change toughness to damage reduction, maybe change boon duration and movement speed and replace float with something more useful (in pve atleast)."
50,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Buff and Nerfs for Power Reaper+Necro for balance,1,9r9bs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9r9bs7/buff_and_nerfs_for_power_reapernecro_for_balance/,2018-10-25 22:15:15,Reduce cast time of GS auto attacks skills to 1/2s casts and reduce its damage by 15%. [Death's Embrace](URL \- change this trait: remove the damage increase while in downed state. Increase damage by 10% against vulnerable enemies instead. So necros in pvp and pve won't rely on down state but rely on real combat. [Decimate Defenses](URL \- Reduce the critical hit chance per stack of vulnerability from 2% to 1% to balance it a bit. I know they still cap crit even without fury even with this nerf but have like over 140% crit chance with berserker armor is really too much. Those are just small changes to make reaper at least 32-32.5k bench and will be more used for raiding.

Also shroud 5 is dps lose because of huge cast uptime. The only classes I can think of helping him are chronos with well of recall and druids with axe 3. Not sure about the others."
52,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Elementalist traits for the current state of the game,1,9sud57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9sud57/elementalist_traits_for_the_current_state_of_the/,2018-10-31 12:39:22,"# **Fire**: Improves sustained damage through power and burns, buffs power and condition dmg through might. &amp;nbsp; * Minor Adept: Empowering Flame - Gain power **and condition damage** (150 @ lvl80) while attuned to fire. * Major Adept: Burning Precision - Critical hits have a chance to cause burning, and burning lasts longer. * Major Adept: Blinding Ashes - Blind foes that you burn (5s ICD per target). * Major Adept: Burning Fire - Cast Lesser Cleansing Fire when you have a number of conditions on you. * Minor Master: Sunspot - Inflict damage **and burning** at your location when you attune to fire and gain a fire aura. * Major Master: Pyromancer's Training - Reduces recharge on all fire weapon skills. Each skill you use while attuned to fire grants you might. * Major Master: Powerful Auras - Auras you apply give might. Fire auras you apply last longer pulse resistance (1s every second). * Major Master: Power Overwhelming - Gain condition damage based on your power. **When you gain fire aura, burn nearby foes.** * Minor Grandmaster: Burning Rage - Deal more damage to burning foes. * Major Grandmaster: Persisting Flames - Executing blast finishers on fire fields **grant fire aura to you**. Fire fields last longer. Create a lava font when you go down. * Major Grandmaster: Pyromancer's Puissance - Gain 10% damage **and condition damage bonus** while attuned to fire * Major Grandmaster: Conjure utilities skills recharge faster. **Conjure weapon provide higher bonuses** and conjure abilities have reduced recharge. &amp;nbsp; &gt; This changes try to increase the hybrid dmg of fire line. It gives you choices as in: If you change attunements often, than maybe the bonus dmg in fire is not as useful as lasting fire fields, while if you stay longer in fire you can build more might and have increased dmg and condi dmg. Or you can trait more defensively with blinds and condi cleanse to make sure you can stay in fire longer to deliver the dmg (instead of having to swap to a defensive attunement) &amp;nbsp; # **Air**: Improves mobility, burst and critical damage and crowd control. &amp;nbsp; * Minor Adept: Ferocious Winds - Gain ferocity and precision (150 @ lvl80) while attuned to air. * Major Adept: Zephyr's Boon - Grant boons to allies you grant auras to. Glyphs apply boons based on your attunement. * Major Adept: One with Air - Move faster while attuned to air and gain superspeed when attuning to air. * Major Adept: Piercing Lightening - vulnerability you apply last 33% longer. You have increased critical chance to vulnerable foes (2% per stack) while attuned to air. * Minor Master: Electric Discharge - Strike your target with a bolt of lightning when attuning to air. * Major Master: Zephyr speed - Static auras you apply give superspeed (3s). Apply quickness (3s) when you apply superspeed. * Major Master: Aeromancer's Training - Gain ferocity based on your precision. Reduces recharge on all air weapon skills. * Major Master: Tempest Defense - Cast Shocking Aura when disabled. Deal increased damage to stunned or knocked-down foes. * Minor Grandmaster: Raging Storm - Critically striking a foe grants fury. Gain ferocity while under the effects of fury. * Major Grandmaster: Bolt to the Heart - Deal more damage when your foe's health drops below the threshold. * Major Grandmaster: Fresh Air - Recharge air attunement on a critical hit. Gain a ferocity boost when attuning to air. * Major Grandmaster: Lightning Rod - Cast Lightning Rod when you disable a foe. Electric Discharge hits twice against disabled foes. &amp;nbsp; &gt; These changes create the opportunity for air to be the go-to element for a power dmg burst (sustained burst with FA, higher CC burst with lightening rod or finishing bursts with BttH), but also opens the possibility for a fresh-air tempest to constantly buff its group offensively with fury and quickness by sharing shock auras. It also opens up synergy with weavers _elemental pursuit_ with adding quickness on superspeed (proposed _zephyrs speed_) at the cost of _tempest defense_ &gt; Eles that focus on air burst, can also use piercing lightening to improve their crit chance, opening up viability for valkirie and cavaliers stats, making the burst air ele (that does not have stealth or lots of invuls) more survivable at the expense of having lower crit chance when not in air or against foes without vulnerability &amp;nbsp; # **Earth**: is about codition dmg (with bleeds) and defense through reducing dmg, condition dmg and applying weakness and cripple to opponents. &amp;nbsp; * Minor Adept: Stone Flesh - Gain toughness and expertise (150 @ lvl80) while attuned to earth. * Major Adept: Earth's Embrace - Gain Armor of Earth whenever your health drops below the threshold. (Armor of Earth now pulses stability -1s- and protection -1s- for the duration) * Major Adept: Serrated Stones - Bleeds you apply last longer; deal more damage to bleeding foes. * Major Adept: Rock Solid - Gain stability when attuning to earth. * Minor Master: Earthen Blast - Bleed foes and cripple them for 3 seconds when attuning to earth. * Major Master: Geomancer's Defense - **_Protection reduces condition damage done to you and stability removes movement impairing conditions on you_**. * Major Master: Elemental Shielding - Grant protection when applying an aura to yourself or an ally. **_Protection you apply have improved damage reduction_**. * Major Master: Geomancer's Training - You recover more quickly from **_slow_**, crippling, immobilizing, and chilling. Reduces recharge on all earth weapon skills. * Minor Grandmaster: Strength of Stone - Gain expertise based on your toughness. * Major Grandmaster: Diamond Skin - Remove conditions when struck while your health is above the threshold (50%). * Major Grandmaster: Written in Stone - Maintain the passive effects of signets when you activate them. Reduce recharge of signets. * Major Grandmaster: Stone Heart - Enemies that critically hit you receive weakness. You cannot be critically hit while attuned to earth. &amp;nbsp; &gt; The changes try to give _stone heart_ a bit of a use outside of earth to be a viable trait if you are not camping earth while also improving the aura trait on earth. By making _rock solid_ a selfish trait, it can be moved down to adept and be a good option to _earthen embrace_ (constant stability or a burst at 50%hp). The change to _diamond skin_ aims to make synergies with traits like _earthen embrace_, _bolstered elements, and _final shielding_ &amp;nbsp; # **Water**: is about cleanse and healing. Its the go-to sustain traitline for ele. &amp;nbsp; * Minor Adept: Aquatic Benevolence - Improved Vitality and Healing Power while attuned to Water. * Major Adept: Soothing Ice - Gain frost aura when critically hit. Frost auras you apply give regeneration (3s). * Major Adept: Latent Stamina - Apply vigor in a radius when attuning to water. Granting vigor to allies also restores a portion of endurance. * Major Adept: Soothing Disruption - Cantrips grant you regeneration and vigor; reduce recharge on cantrips. * Minor Master: Healing Ripple - Heal nearby allies when attuning to water. * Major Master: Invigorating torrents - Auras you apply also grant regeneration and vigor. * Major Master: Soothing recovery - Cast geyser when reviving an ally. Geyser revive allies. You have improved revive speed, and give frost aura to you when reviving an ally, and frost aura to allies you revive. * Major Master: Aquamancer's Training - You regenerate health while you are attuned to water (Soothing mist). Reduces recharge on all water weapon skills. * Minor Grandmaster: Aquatic Benevolence - 10% healing effectiveness. * Major Grandmaster: Cleansing Water - Remove a condition when granting regeneration to yourself or an ally. * Major Grandmaster: Cleansing Wave - Recharges water attunement when using a heal skill. Remove a condition from you and your allies when attuning to water. * Major Grandmaster: Soothing Power - Soothing Mist has increased effects and apply to 10 people. &amp;nbsp; &gt; This changes make 3 clear options on the water line: improving auras (auras can give regen and vigor, frost auras able to give regen twice, being a great combo for group cleanse combo with _cleansing water_), giving heals and cleanses when going into water, and refreshing water attunement faster at the expense of your heal skill, or to be a full healer staying longer in water attunement and improving your _soothing mist_ and water cooldowns. &gt; The proposed change to _soothing mist_ and _soothing power_, make it more efficient and the effect also helps the ele using his healing skills and combos, but only effect the ele. But if the ele takes _soothing power_ this will make this trait not only improve the regen you apply, but also buff other players own healing, making a great choice for a healing ele that is not focused on auras. The soothing mist effect also lasts for a while, even when you leave water, threfore can be used by an ele that stays in water longer or one that jumps in water for burst heals... &amp;nbsp; # **Arcane**: is about fast swaping attunements, giving short buffs to each and all attunment on swap and about arcane skills. &amp;nbsp; * Minor Adept: Elemental Attunement - When attuning to an element, you and nearby allies gain a boon. * Major Adept: Arcane Precision - Skills have a chance to apply a condition on critical hits. * Major Adept: Renewing Stamina - Gain vigor when you deliver a critical hit. * Major Adept: Arcane Abatement - Reduce fall damage you receive; cast a spell based on your attunement when you receive fall damage. Swapping attunements restores health. * Minor Master: Elemental Fury - Gain Leaser Elemental Power (Arcane skill: You do critical damage with your next 2 attacks. grants bonus ferocity.) when swapping attunements. * Major Master: Lingering Elements - Attunement bonuses (from minor traits) linger longer (5s) after leaving an attunement. * Major Master: Elemental Contingency - Gain a boon when you are struck, based on your current attunement. * Major Master: Final Shielding - Create an Lesser Arcane Shield when your health drops below the threshold. Arcane shield is now an aura. * Minor Grandmaster: Elemental Enchantment - Gain concentration and your attunements gain reduced recharge. * Major Grandmaster: Evasive Arcana - Create an attunement-based spell after dodging. * Major Grandmaster: Elemental Surge - Based on your attunement, arcane skills inflict a condition on foes. Gain more ferocity when you use an arcane skill. Arcane skills recharge faster. * Major Grandmaster: Bountiful Power - Gain increased effects for each boon on you based on attunement: fire: 1% dmg, 1% condi dmg; aird: 1% dmg, 1% crit dmg; water: 1% healing, 1% outgoing healing; earth: 1% dmg reduction, 1% incoming condi duration reduction &amp;nbsp; # **Tempest**: is about staying longer in attunements and overloading them for greater effects. It relies on caster centered AoEs and group support. &amp;nbsp; * Minor Proficiency: Warhorn Proficiency - You can wield the warhorn weapon. * Minor Adept: Singularity - Attain elemental singularity by remaining in an attunement for a period of time. Upon attaining singularity, you may overload the attunement to your vicinity. * Major Adept: Gale Song - Trigger ""Eye of the Storm!"" when a foe attempts to control you by stun, daze, knockback, pull, knockdown, sink, float, fear, taunt, or launch. * Major Adept: Effective Conduit - Using skills from an attunement reduces the recharge of its overload. * Major Adept: Unstable Conduit - Overloading an attunement grants an aura based on the element you're attuned to when the ability is completed. * Minor Master: Speedy Conduit - Gain swiftness when overloading an attunement. * Major Master: Tempestuous Aria - Allies affected by your shouts gain a boom and Enemies are affected by a condition based on shout. Shouts have reduced CD. * Major Master: Elemental Bastion - Auras you apply heal allies. * Major Master: Harmonious Conduit - Gain stability when beginning an overload. Upon successfully completing an overload, gain a buff based on overload (fire 5% dmg and condi dmg, air 10% crit dmg, earth -10% dmg and condi dmg reduction, water 10% healing effectiveness) for a period of time. * Minor Grandmaster: Hardy Conduit - Gain protection and barrier while overloading an attunement. * Major Grandmaster: Imbued Melodies - Gain increased concentration when wielding a warhorn. Use Sand Squall when struck while below the health threshold. * Major Grandmaster: Lucid Singularity - Remove and gain massive resistance to movement-impeding conditions while overloading your attunements. * Major Grandmaster: Tempestuous Auras - When you apply an aura to yourself, apply the same aura to 10 allies. &amp;nbsp; &gt; This gives the tempest the option to buff allies by sharing auras, improving shouts or being more selfish and focusing on its own overloads to complete them successfully and frequently. The reduced recharge on overloads could be a flat percentage but seems more interesting giving it a reduced recharge per skill use, making that weapons with faster casting times (scepter, dagger) can overload faster than slow ones (staff). The changes try to combine well with the options on each traitline and lets the tempest (by moving aura share from water) becomes a full offensive (fire/air/tempest) or defensive (water/earth/tempest) support or even a mix of those. Tempest can also focus on being more selfish and versatile by focusing on overloading more frequent and successfully at the cost of sharing auras and heals. &amp;nbsp; # **Weaver**: is about combining attunements and using dual skills. It gives the ele options for a bit of mobility, barrier and vitality to use its melee range (with sword) more reliable or provides bonus for swaping to diferent attunements and combinations. &amp;nbsp; * Minor Proficiency: Sword Proficiency - You can wield swords in your main hand. * Minor Adept: Weaver - Your active attunement is now applied to your main hand, with the old attunement moving to your off hand. Attunement recharges are reduced. Gain access to Dual Attack and the Stance utility types. * Major Adept: Superior Elements - Dual Attack skills weaken enemies. Attacks against weakened foes have increased critical chance. * Major Adept: Elemental Pursuit - Gain superspeed when inflicting inhibiting conditions on enemies. * Major Adept: Master's Fortitude - Gain increased vitality when wielding a sword. Gain bonus vitality based on a portion of your power and condition damage. * Minor Master: Elemental Refreshment - Gain barrier when using Dual Attack abilities. * Major Master: Weaver's Prowess - Gain increased condition damage and duration for a period of time after attuning to a different element. * Major Master: Swift Revenge - Gain swiftness when using a Dual Attack. Deal extra damage to enemies while under the effects of swiftness or superspeed. * Major Master: Bolstered Elements - Gain stability when activating a stance. Activate Lesser Stone Resonance when struck while below the health threshold. * Minor Grandmaster: Elemental Polyphony - Gain attributes based on your current attunement. When dual attuned, gain both benefits. * Major Grandmaster: Elements of Rage - Gain a 10% damage and 10% critical dmg bonus for a period of time when attuned to a single element. * Major Grandmaster: Woven Stride - Gain swiftness when you are inflicted with inhibiting conditions. When gaining either superspeed or swiftness, also gain regeneration. Swiftness has increased effectiveness. * Major Grandmaster: Invigorating Strikes - Gain vigor when using a Dual Attack. Vigor has increased effectiveness. Dodge rolling grants a barrier. &amp;nbsp; &gt; With the changes to air (superspeed can give quickness) there are a lot of synergy with weaver traits. Removing the ferocity bonus from elements of rage, and making it a flat crit bonus when attuning to a single element, makes it more limited in use, but a great synergy with bonus on dps oriented attunments that also provide bonus while at the attunement. &gt; "
53,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Should the amount of Condis/Boons per class be normalized?,1,9ttqvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9ttqvf/should_the_amount_of_condisboons_per_class_be/,2018-11-03 23:37:31," Hey there! I was thinking more and more about the amount of effects we have in game and it's huge. Now don't get me wrong, I love that we have many to choose from. For me, the problem lies in the amount of conditions and boons each class has access too. This leads to some serious issues and very flat gameplay mechanics. Let's take for example **""Shake it off!""** (&lt;-Warrior's Shout) and **""Soothing Stone""** (&lt;- Revenant's Jalis' Heal) \[I WILL SKIP SOME CHANGES FOR THE SAKE OF BREVITY\] ***CONDITIONS*** Now, I'll provide some examples of adding conditions to class (or its weapons) in order to make it functional. It's because other classes already had so many conditions (or condi cleanse) that some other felt underwhelming because of it. So, let's add some condis, shall we? **Temporal Rift (Revenant Axe 5 Skill):** \- 2015 - Inflicts 3 stacks of Torment \- 2017 - (add.) Inflicts 3 stacks of Confusion \- Further changes on Confusion inflicted by this skill **Signet of Shadows (Thief's Utility Skill):** \- 2012 - On use inflicts 5s of Blindness to nearby enemies \- 2017 - (add.) Inflicts Weakness and 10 stacks of Vulnerability **Ghastly Breach (Scourge's Skill):** \- (Under specific circumstanecs) Inflicts: Torment, Cripple, Burning, Slow and Might **Voice of Truth (Firebrand's Skill):** \- Inflicts Vulnerability, Immobilize, Weakness and Blindness **Echo of Truth (Firebrand's Skill):** \- Inflicts Cripple, Weakness and Blindness Let's take for example **""Shake it off!""** (&lt;-Warrior's Shout) and **""Soothing Stone""** (&lt;- Revenant's Jalis' Heal). The need of flat-condi removal for the sake of ""healthy"" gameplay. **""Shake it off!"":** \- 2012 - Breaks stun, \- 2013 - (add.) Removes 2 conditions \- March 2018 - Removes 3 conditions in PvP/WvW \- July 2018 - Removes 6 conditions (2 charges (1 per 50s) in PvP WvW **""Soothing Stone"":** \- 2015 - Removes 3 conditions, grants 2s Retaliation for each condition removed &lt;---- Kind of a fun mechanic \- 2018 - Removes 5 conditions (no longer split between game-modes) + 5 flat seconds of Retaliation &lt;------ Flat gameplay What I mean here is that these 2 skills had to adapt to the amount of conditions applied by other classes (Or themselves). Ammunition mechanic is a great idea but here, we can see that it's used to flat-cleanse a packet of condis that somoene inflicted. ***BOONS*** While more and more conditions are added to each classes there has to be some counterplay to it. So, what happens here is that we have tons of boons application and boon removal. The need of boon application in order to counter the amount of conditions other apply is increasing. Guardian: * Hallowed Ground - applies Stability * Contemplation of Purity - converts conditions into Boons * ""Hold the Line!"" - applies Protection and Regeneration * ""Retreat!"" - applies Aegis and Swiftness * ""Save Yourselves!"" - grants Fury, Might, Protection, Regeneration, Resistance, Retaliation, Swiftness and Vigor * ""Stand Your Ground!"" - grants Stability and Retaliation \*Firebrand: * Azure Sun - grants Vigor, Regeneration and Swiftness Ranger (Soulbeast): Dolyak Stance (6s): Prevent movement-impeding conditions from being inflicted on you. * grants Retaliation and Stability * removes Immobilize, Chill, Cripple * Breaks Stun Moa Stance: Increase the duration of boons by 66% * grants Protection, Swiftness, Fury and Regeneration This is the kind of mechanic that makes sense in terms of skill usage but still - there are tools designed specifically for boon removal because sometiems there is no way to get through the number of boons some classes have. I'm not trying to hate on any class, just trying to make a point that this is what happens when we have so much stuff going on in single skills. Revenant: * Banish Enchantment - removes 2 boons from your target and applies Confusion This is the amount of buffs and conditions that some classes have. What I'd love to know is - would you like this amount to be normalized per class? Do you think that the Condition Application/Removal and Boon Application/Removal mechanics should be updated or reworked? Share your thoughts! Thanks for your time :)"
54,vulnerability,Guildwars2,What profession/elite spec to play/Rant?,1,9vbo45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9vbo45/what_professionelite_spec_to_playrant/,2018-11-09 03:52:38,"TL:DR - I really enjoy playing tanks in almost all the games I play (Soulsbourne series, Wildstar(Warrior, Engineer, Stalker), WoW (prot paladin - was generally #2 gear/ranked for my server back in the day #humblebrag), LoL(Rammus, Braum, Malphite, Old Maokai, Old Morde), Torchlight, etc). My current main is a guardian (made back at Launch, stopped playing after I hit 80 because I felt there was nothing to do (probably because I was a huge raider in WoW), and I have recently came back after my many year hiatus). I own both expansions. Is there any satisfying class/spec combo that fills the role of being the guy who protects the group, does a lot of cc break, and is generally a hard MF to kill? &amp;#x200B; Rant: So I know when I first started playing GW2 at launch, their big point they made was the removal the ""Holy Trinity"" system. So basically everyone was a DPS. Now you could ""play"" what ever you wanted in open world (whether it was satisfying or not was up to the player), but dungeons and fractals pretty much was for DPS only. Since everyone took care of themselves for heals and some buffs. Since I've come back about a year ago, I noticed they added raids and such. It seems though that the only ""tank"" is Chrono. Which is not necessarily my ""idea"" of a tank (I'm not trying to say my idea is more right or anything, just outlining my preferential playstyle). Not that I wouldn't play it, but I'd be much more interested in playing something like a Warrior or Guardian tank. Engineer or Necro tank sounds interesting too. Revenant tank seemed interesting at first, but I feel like the playstyle suffers from a real lack of cohesiveness. It always feels the weapon abilities are at odds with each other. With the introduction of raids, it seems like this ""Holy Trinity"" that they were vehemently against has come into GW2 as a bastardized form of a ""Holy Duo"" (DPS &amp; Support). I was hoping there would be some wiggle room in High level fractals/raids for other ""tanky/support"" specs other than chrono, but I feel like the community (maybe ANET too) is completely against anything other than super duper top tier, must kill everything immediately meta. This mentality seems to spread from the high echelon raiders down to many facets of the game making playing anything outside it, even for fun's sake, an out right blasphemy. Now I will say, a few months back I remember reading a post where someone made a really good point against tanks and ""aggro"" being a thing. To hopefully and correctly paraphrase, he stated, ""If I was a monster or a boss why should I care about the heavy armor guy who is tough to kill and does ""no"" damage? Why would I not target the person blasting me super heavy damage (DPS)? Or maybe the Healer/support if trying to kill the DPS is thwarted by them?"" I thought (and still generally think) that is a fair point. I guess here is the point where offering a suggestion to how I think a good way to introduce a tank into GW2, while preserving some/most of the current system, and staying in line the train of thought outlined above. Instead of thinking about a tank who is hard to kill and does no damage as a threat arbitrarily (like WoW or how the guys above sort of stated) Let his threat come organically from the play style and abilities. To fit inline with the above thought process, If I were the monster I agree killing the DPS is priority, but sometimes you can't do A without doing B. To me that threat would come from the fact that while the tank is doing little damage, he IS performing moves and abilities that prevent me from ever getting to or attacking the DPS (e.g. Stuns, cripples, weakness, slows, protection/aegis for the group, maybe vulnerability, etc). So to incorporate this and fit within the GW2 combat mechanics, my idea is the support provides a lot of offensive buffs, some minor defensive/healing buffs and damage/cc to fit. DPS would provide the damage (burst or overtime) minor to moderate cc, some to little buffs (to party). Finally, tank would provide heavy amounts of CC/debuffs to boss, defensive buffs(not necessarily healing buffs) for group, with little damage. I'm also not saying their needs to be a threat meter or to make it like WoW. Right now my main character is a DH Guardian with 20K HP 100% crit (w/ fury &amp; retal) full power using GS and scepter/focus. \[Tangent, why does focus provide better defensive capabilities than a shield? Weird?!\] &amp;#x200B; Sorry if it sounds like I don't know what I am talking about, its probably the case considering I've only just got back into the game and I am sure I missing a lot of history and details. Also I am fully aware of Snowcrows, Dulfy, and Metabattle. There is probably more I could say, but I already felt bad about this long of post. I'm sure most won't read it. Thanks for reading. I genuinely look forward to your comments. "
55,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[Concept &amp; Artwork] Elementalist Specialization: Spellslinger + Complete Elementalist Overhaul,1,9vqhxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9vqhxj/concept_artwork_elementalist_specialization/,2018-11-10 12:54:48,"For years have I been a fan of the Guild Wars Franchise yet lately I have felt that the game is lacking variety in builds and class gameplay. So I've decided to use my love for brainstorming and customizing things to rework the Elementalist and Tempest Traits with the main focus on fun, independance and making ""must have traits"" minor traits. And as a bonus I came up with a concept for the Spellslinger Elite Specialization. **Be warned for a lot of text.** --------------- #Elite Specialization Spellslinger --------------- * The Spellslinger plays around the idea of a mage class, wielding the **Torch** as their weapon. * Torch weapon for the Spellslinger acts as a **2 handed weapon slot**. *Torch weapon skills are the same regardless of attunement, their effects, damage, boons and conditions do change however.* * You can **weapon swap** between ranged torch skills and melee torch skills. * Gain access to **Mantra's**. * Build up mana during combat and unleash it for a **Mana Rush**, granting bonuses. (Comparable with necromancer Life Force) --------------- ###Torch Weapon skills --------------- Instead of writing down a list of skills, I have made icons and in game related text as if they were ""Screenshots"" to showcase these new skills instead. **You can find the images following this link to Imgur:** URL --------------- ###Spellslinger Traits --------------- Traits are more difficult to showcase visually so hopefully the text version will do. Do keep in mind that I'm no balance expert, so take these numbers with a grain of salt. **Tier 1** * **Incantations**: Casting a utility skill lowers the remaining cooldown of your weapon skills by 10%. Elite skills lowers the remaining cooldown of your weapon skills by 50%. * **Magic Attuned**: Combo fields you generate have their radius increased by 20% and their duration by 1 second. Barriers you receive are 33% stronger and Boon duration is increased by 10%. * **Mana Addict**: Increased passive mana regeneration in combat. Gain Might when reaching the following mana thresholds: 25% Mana (1 might) 50% (2 might). 75% (3 might) **Tier 2** * **Magic Resistance**: When activating Mana Rush, gain Resistance (3 sec), Stability(3 sec) and Protection. (3 sec). Cleanse 1 condition every 7 seconds. * **Frostfire's Pact**: Applying burning to a target will also apply chill and vice versa. Burning damage is increased by 10% on chilled targets. (Burning -&gt; Chill cooldown 6 seconds). Burning and Chill duration increased by 10%. * **Critical Fury**: For every consecutive critical strike against a single target, increase your ferocity by ""50"". Stacking up to 5 times. (Lasts 5 seconds.) This bonus gets removed when failing to land a critical strike or when it's duration runs out. (Failing a critical strike will apply a cooldown for 1 second) Fury Duration is increased by 20%. - [minor] **Mana Infused**: Your affinity for magic has influenced your endurance, increasing your total amount of endurance to 150 but reducing your natural endurance regeneration by 20%. (This penalty is nullified while under the effects of vigor) **Tier 3** * **Where there is Fire, there is Smoke**: Expiring Fire Fields leave behind a smoke field for 2 seconds. * **Toxic Fumes**: While attuned to earth, your burning condition's damaging intervals also apply poison. Poison deals 10% increased damage to burning targets. Poison duration increased by 20%. * **Spell Penetration**: Your damaging abilities deal 50% increased damage to barriers and the ""Protection"" boon has a 50% reduced efficiency against your damaging effects. (33% -&gt; 17.5%) Tempest Protection: (40% -&gt; 20%) - [minor] **A Dance of Fire and Smoke**: Replaces your roll with a quick but equally ranged teleport.

56,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[Idea] New Elementalist Elite - Shaman,0,9f2b69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9f2b69/idea_new_elementalist_elite_shaman/,2018-09-12 09:04:48,"I've considered the Elementalist to be a very Shaman-like class for GW2, even though it was missing one key element. Totems. I've thought for a while how cool it would be if the elemental summons acted similar to totems, but considered that it would take an entire rework of their mechanics. Recently I thought about what if each attunement summoned a totem that represented the element, but quickly realized how clumsy that mechanic would be considering attunement swap is part of the ele's rotation. So I thought about if they were just able to summon one totem that shared their attunement. Now obviously this is nothing near what I would consider a fine tuned class idea, it's more of a general idea of what it would function as. That being ""totems"" behaving as enhanced warrior banners. Here is what I imagined it working similar to. **Elementalist Elite  Shaman** Channel the power of your elemental attunement into Totems that share bonuses with nearby allies. Gain access to powerful Mantras that provide powerful offensive and defensive powers. **Proficiency- New Weapon  Shortbow** Attack your enemies with elementally enhanced arrows that unleash devastating attacks and provide boons to your allies. **Totems** Gain the ability to summon an elemental totem that provides bonuses to nearby allies.

Charges: 3 ***Utility Mantras*** * Mantra of the Flame: Unleash a wave of fire in front of you that damages and burns enemies. (Charges 2) * Mantra of the Air: Gain Quickness and Superspeed. (Charges 2) * Mantra of the Earth: Grant Aegis and Stability to nearby allies. (Stun Break) (Charges 2) * Mantra of the Arcane: Grant Aegis to nearby allies and cause their next attack to critically hit. (Charges 2) ***Elite Mantra*** * Mantra of Devastation: Create an elemental attack based on your active attunement at your location. (Charges 1) Range: 480 1. Fire  The ground erupts in front of you heavily damaging enemies in its path and creating a fire field 2. Water  Freeze the ground in front of you chilling enemies while they remain in its wake, creating an Ice Field. 3. Air  Create a line of storms in front of you, hitting enemies in its field with lightning bolts, creating a lightning field. 4. Earth  Shatter the ground in front of you, knocking down enemies and bleeding them. **Traits** ***Adept*** *Minor*: Gain the ability to summon Totems that provide bonuses to nearby allies based on your active attunement. *Major:* ** Precise Fury- Increased critical chance while under the effects of Quickness.

Especially scourge was a great pick, since the passive barrier helps a lot in bad gear. Mirage had the highest dps of all condi classes and replaced the second holo we initially had on Dhuum, due to the rather tight dps check.

Defiance bars tend to be reserved for champion or legendary enemies, and in particular the non-replenishing bars which give **complete immunity to all forms of crowd control with no drawback or vulnerability,** are only found, *usually,* on particularly special enemies. Ordinary grunt mooks obviously do not fall into that category. There are other enemies in the game that function this way - being vulnerable to CC as normal when not using some special ability, but able to be broken while casting a special attack - so it's obviously possible. Awakened Soldiers could possibly also be changed the same way, for consistency, gaining a defiance bar when using their smash attack."
59,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Skritt Raid Boss,18,9g227r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9g227r/skritt_raid_boss/,2018-09-16 00:55:08,"So while guildies and I were bored on discord, we came up with a raid boss. &amp;#x200B; Caffeinated Skritt called Ginger. &amp;#x200B; Fight would look something like this: &amp;#x200B; You enter a Caffeinated Skritt arena. &amp;#x200B; Skritt is sleeping in the middle (it's morning) &amp;#x200B; To start the fight, you interact with the coffee. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Phase 1: 100%-66% &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Ginger Starts talking towards the coffee. Ginger takes reduced damage. On other side of arena you have a BIG golden weapon. Person who picks up the golden weapon get's special action skill called Taunt and a stacking condition called fatigue (because weapon is huge). This condition would be similar to SH fight. Using Taunt makes Ginger temporarily forget about the coffee and go for the golden weapon (because Ginger love shinies). When taunted Ginger would get speed boost, he would take normal damage. When he would reach the person holding the sword he would stun the person and take the weapon and do a massive damage AoE with it. Because shiny weapon is big, and skritt are clumsy, he would drop it upon usage and start going towards the coffee again. 2nd tank would then pick up the golden weapon because 1st tank is still fatigued. Ginger would attack with AoE melee while walking, swinging erratically with arms holding broken bottle inflicting lots of damage, bleed and poison (who knows what was in the bottle) to foes in areas of attack. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Phase 2: 66%-33% &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Ginger would be in a caffeine withdraw. He forgets about the shiny and gets fixated on random player (like sloth fight). He get's a ranged attack throwing things around, gets a leap attack where he jumps on the fixated player and starts attacking with pound attack (like Samarog during CC phase) and retains his melee from phase one. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Phase 3: 33%-0% &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; In this phase, she would just go full blown mental. She would take very reduced damage. Tanking mechanic would be similar to phase 1, but this time you need to pick up his coffee that he so desires. Person holding her coffee mug would be tanking and he would get a special action skill called Sip. Using the special action button would annoy Ginger for sipping her coffee making her leap on to the tank. When tank uses Sip, several things happen, Ginger would leap on the tank (otherwise she would be walking) knocking him down. Tank and Ginger would take increased damage (Ginger would take normal damage+extra) and Ginger would attack faster. This would last a short duration, like 5 seconds. But because player characters are mere mortals and cant take a lot of skritt coffee, Sip has a very long cool down , so tank would have to give the mug to another player making them the tank. this would put several players into the tank role, not just the usual chrono (or 2 in case of SH) In phase 3 she still has melee AoE attack from phase 1 and ranged attack from phase 2. Because of her ranged attack starting in phase 2, place where tank would be standing while he gets attacked by her ranged attack (hes throwing bottles) gets covered in broken glass inflicting damage, poison, bleeding, vulnerability and weakness. &amp;#x200B; Ginger, person who inspired us to make this up also suggested that boss would throw around molotov cocktails. Not sure what this says about Ginger herself,....xD But i didnt know if this would be thematically fitting. &amp;#x200B; This was put together very fast so i'm sorry for some spelling mistakes (she/he, originally i wrote as if the enemy is male but then we renamed it to Ginger to ''honour'' our guildie). &amp;#x200B; What do you guys think? &amp;#x200B; Also, any similarities between Ginger boss and Ginger person are pure coincidence. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"
60,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[Idea] The Spectacle - Mesmer Elite Spec,27,9g7hpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9g7hpy/idea_the_spectacle_mesmer_elite_spec/,2018-09-16 13:15:20,"\*Sigh\* This is the kind of shite I get up to when I'm bored. Sorry, but not sorry. The Spectacle is a mesmer elite specialization inspired by pro wrestlers, matadors, and luchadores. They specialize in making hand-to-hand combat as showy as possible, always fighting as if they have an audience to entertain. It doesn't fill a new role in the party, but who cares, this is just for kicks. Their weapon is the warhorn. Skills undecided - just toot out some fanfares for boons, or whatever nonsense gets them attention. The ascended skin could have a big red cloth draping from it, like a hybrid of a medieval trumpet and a muleta, (or maybe give it a dazzling print on the cloth? or the cloth is illusory? meh, not important right now). Slot skills are shouts. Throw in some WWE-style theatrical one-liners. Rap lyrics would also be acceptable, (""Mama Said Knock You Out""). Collectible armor piece is some sort of mask, of course. Probably sparkly, with rhinestones or a glittery effect--because they're a mesmer, dammit, and if you stop looking at them for one second, they will literally die of shame and loneliness. Mechanic is unarmed combat, as a modification to weapon swapping. When you swap weapons, you first put your old weapons away, then fight unarmed for a short while, then pull out your new weapons. Each unarmed skill can be used once per cycle. Unarmed skills 3-5 are determined directly by your selected adept, master, and grandmaster traits. *Unarmed fighting is basically a customizable weapon.* Traits being taken up to select them means these skills pack a lot of punch. Each row of traits has a different theme to it, but all the skills they grant share one thing in common: they are performed with a spectacular flourish, often including illusory special effects to amp up the drama, possibly while yelling something absurd. The top trait row gives skills that let you fight sort of like a matador. 3) Slam into target with your shoulder, gaining retaliation. 4) Taunt the target with an illusory target, inflicting weakness. 5) Defend yourself with an illusory cape that turns glancing blows into healing. The middle row utilizes a more direct, blunt fighting style. 3) Backhand your target, gaining fury. 4) Headbutt your target, inflicting vulnerability. 5) Uppercut your target, knocking them down. The bottom row ""uses the ring"", utilizing positioning and movement. 3) Strike your target with your knee, then cloak yourself and teleport behind them. 4) Kick your target with both legs, knocking them away from you. 5) Leap toward your target and bodyslam them, inflicting critical damage. These probably don't mix &amp; match well enough, but I don't really give a flying leap about that right now."

Only base game weapon attacks not HoT or PoF new weapon attacks. Like for example the mesmer will wield swords all floaty like he does the great sword and besides inflicting vulnerability he inflicts slow on the final attack. Think its be pretty cool to freshen up the game across the board and really shake builds up.

63,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"Unorthodox fractal/raid/group content team comp: ""Generosity""",1,9l5q7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9l5q7r/unorthodox_fractalraidgroup_content_team_comp/,2018-10-04 07:49:23,"# ""Generosity"" Team Overview This teamcomp is designed as a fractal team for T4/CM fractals, but should also work as a raid subgroup (especially for raids with short DPS phases), maybe with a few slight alterations. The basic premise isn't really unusual--venom sharing is a well-known, effective DPS tactic for thieves. What's less known is that most classes actually have some form of ""venom"", condition sharing, or condition buffing available, often quite powerful in its effects. These effects are often not meta picks due to sacrificing some personal DPS, but when combined the results are surprisingly effective. Yesterday's patch significantly buffed some of the things this team uses, and makes the Firebrand's job in particular much easier. In conjunction with the Chrono nerfs, I think this team comp might be a lot closer to meta-level capabilities than it was prior to the patch. Plus, it's a fun theme. ## Build Links [Firebrand](URL [Renegade](URL [Daredevil](URL [Soulbeast](URL [Weaver](URL ## Build Overviews All of these builds bring some serious shared effects to the table. Some are more support-focused, some are more damage-focused, but all of them bring some form of support or buff sharing and some form of damage. The Firebrand is hands-down the most unusual of these builds, making use of some often-overlooked mechanics, so I'll start with its breakdown since it's fairly key to making this theme work. ### Firebrand - support, healing, defense, minor shared effects By far the lowest on the damage chart, the Firebrand carries its own weight by acting as both a defensive and offensive support, fully or nearly-fully handling every necessary offensive party boon except alacrity, plus a few unique buffs. It provides permanent 25 might, slightly less than permanent fury, permanent quickness, a unique +216 condition damage buff with near-permanent uptime, high protection uptime, a unique incoming damage reduction buff, a large amount of aegis, strong trickle healing, and very strong burst healing, with handy side effects. I'm going to explain the mechanics and usage of this build in-depth, because there's some very non-obvious mechanics behind some of the choices I made in constructing this build. To preempt the inevitable: yes, this role could be taken by a Druid. Yes, the Druid would probably heal better. But if you have a Druid you want a Chrono since a Renegade can't bring quickness, and Chrono doesn't bring shared condition damage effects, which are what I'm going for with this build. Plus, if I'm going to bring a ranger, I'd far rather have it be a Soulbeast for the stance share, given the team's theme and some of the neat interactions of One Wolf Pack. Notable Mechanics: * Might comes from a variety of sources, and requires at least some alacrity to maintain easily. It can, however, be supplemented by several of the other classes in the group. With some alacrity, the maintainable sources of might are: Empower (12 stacks), Potent Haste (5 stacks), Empowering Might (up to 13 stacks with the latest patch, with a larger radius!), and Runes of Altruism (3 stacks). Empowering Might takes time to get rolling in combat, but at the start of combat Potent Haste can be double-cast to pre-stack quickness and get 10 stacks of might instead of just 5, giving you 10 seconds to crit a few times for Empowering Might stacks. With any alacrity at all, the margins become a lot more comfortable. Fortunately, our renegade provides a fair bit of uptime on alacrity. * Signet of Wrath's passive is handy. With Perfect Inscriptions, it's handy for everyone. With the Wrath of Justice trait, it's handy for everyone all the time. Start combat with Tome of Justice's 5 skill and 2 casts of Potent Haste to set up boons and 4 Ashes of the Just procs, then use the 3 skill to cluster enemies, immobilizing one and casting Lesser Signet of Wrath. For 10 seconds, both you and your allies will get +216 condition damage, and once the 10s are up you can cast the signet to share the buff out again. By the time the passive share from that is gone, Wrath of Justice is off cooldown and ready to use again--and if anything has died in the 20 seconds or so since combat started, so is Tome of Justice. If nothing has died you'll have a short cooldown remaining before Tome of Justice is available again. * Signet of Judgment is a fairly loaded skill that can be used as a stunbreak, grant retaliation to allies, burn enemies, and massively reduce damage to allies. Use it to stunbreak for yourself or mitigate burst for allies. If you don't need a stunbreak and your allies don't need the extra defense, swap it out for Bane Signet for the extra CC and power damage boost for allies. Handily enough, if used for breakbars Bane Signet's power boost for allies will nicely coincide with the DPS phase you usually get from breaking said breakbar. That being said, with the Daredevil's Basilisk Venom you'll rarely be called on to apply much hard CC with this build, and when you are you have Tome of Justice 3, shield 5, and the two Signet of Wrath immobilizes available, not to mention the staff 5 wall. Don't swap to Bane Signet just for CC; do it when your team is having no trouble surviving and you don't need a stunbreak. * This build is a fairly strong healer, but is not purely optimized for healing. If you find yourself lacking on healing or personal survivability, swap the Honor grandmaster trait to Force of Will for some extra outgoing healing modifier and vitality. Keeping protection rolling (mace 3/shield 4/Tome of Courage 5), using aegis to block major hits, and using Signet of Judgment to mitigate large numbers of smaller hits is enough to keep everyone healthy, in conjunction with your healing output. * Don't try too hard to deal damage directly outside of Tome of Justice. Ashes of the Just is your primary damage mechanism; use the ToJ 5 and apply quickness/aegis as frequently as possible for your damage output. Use all your ToJ charges quickly, and drop back into your weapons. Staff heals allies and keeps up your might stacks, mace/shield keeps them from taking damage and can heal quite a bit over time with its symbol. Neither set is going to deal significant damage. Your symbols and ToJ skills will deal damage and apply shared on-hit effects just fine; trying to finish autoattack chains or position yourself for attacks at the expense of group support isn't worth it. Make sure you're positioned to apply as many boons (both offensive and defensive) to allies as possible. At the same time, you want to land at least one damage packet per second for Empowering Might, so try to position symbols to hit enemies as well as allies, and autoattack when you don't have any support skills to use. * If you find you don't really need the defense and healing from mace, you can try axe as an additional grouping tool. Don't fall into the trap of spending too much time using the axe for damage, though; you really need to rotate back to the staff frequently for healing bursts and mightstacking anyway, plus triggering the concentration sigil for extra duration on quickness and fury application. You're the group's primary mightstacker, and it's really the only thing you have to put effort towards in terms of boons. * Your heal skill is an aegis proc for allies, not a heal skill. Use it to block attacks, grant allies quickness, and apply Ashes of the Just, not to heal yourself--your healing comes from elsewhere. * Signet of Courage is nearly unbearable to cast by default, but with Firebrand it becomes at least somewhat usable. Instant on-demand aegis from Mantra of Solace and quickness from Mantra of Potence serve to speed up and cover the cast. Interestingly, while the active heals for around 50,000 health, the passive is just as important: when applied to allies via Perfect Inscriptions, this causes up to 5 nearby allies to heal once every 3 seconds around themselves for 437 per tick. With 4 allies (assuming the Soulbeast is merged with their pet), assuming max stacks of Invigorated Bulwark, this will heal clustered/stacked allies for around 2,200 per pulse for 3 pulses. Coming right after a full heal, this doesn't sound very useful, but fractals often have continuing pressure, and the initial Signet of Courage cast can be neutralized by agony. Giving Signet of Courage some significant lasting effects for 10 seconds after the cast goes a long way towards making this relatively useless skill more palatable. That said, if you still can't stomach it or you need frequent stability more than healing for a fight, use Mantra of Liberation instead. In raids, Signet of Courage has the nice benefit of being able to apply healing from the shared passive to up to 25 targets, though the passive healing on each target would be lowered. * Start in mace/shield and swap to staff just before buffing allies at the start of combat to take advantage of the Sigil of Concentration. It's technically possible to maintain all of your buffs without it, but it's a heck of a lot easier with it. * Due to packing both a shield and Tome of Courage, you have a *lot* of AoE projectile defenses. This is very valuable in many encounters, and can trivialize some surprising things. For instance, the Uncategorized fractal has that staircase with laser beams sliding down it. As it turns out, those are projectiles. Tome of Courage's projectile block, cast 3/4 of the way up the staircase, will get you most of the way up the staircase, and the shield can pick up the rest. The entire group can follow the Firebrand, completely ignoring the whole mechanic. ### Renegade - Support, damage, shared effects, some healing Renegade, as usual, brings strong condition damage and the very useful effects from Kalla stance. Orders from Above will maintain about 70% alacrity uptime, which isn't ideal, but you don't have to bring a relatively low-damage chrono, and the alacrity from Renegade is quite a bit more mobile than the alacrity from a Chrono, since it follows the player, and can thus follow the stack. Reasonable CC, handy grouping of enemies with the axe, fire fields on both the mace and shortbow, and a handy blast finisher on the mace round out this build's utility. Notable Mechanics: * Soulcleave's Summit applies once per damage packet, with no ICD. That's an additional 443 damage per damage packet. Interestingly, the Soulbeast's One Wolf Pack stance, when shared, applies an extra damage packet for every strike you make with a quarter-second ICD, so if each character was to land 4 attacks per second for the 6-second duration of One Wolf Pack's shared effect, that's 120 extra packets of Soulcleave's Summit damage, for 53,160 armor-ignoring lifesteal damage. Completely ignoring the healing applied by this, that's a lotta damage! Obviously taking full advantage of this is impossible, but half of that damage amount is still pretty overwhelming. Try to start every fight with Soulcleave's Summit, since you can be sure the Soulbeast will be starting every fight with One Wolf Pack. Additionally, keeping Soulcleave's Summit up whenever possible is a consistent, strong source of trickle healing for the group. * Razorclaw's Rage is a very, very potent skill, even with its 1-second ICD. It'll apply around 750 bleed damage per second per ally, which over the 10 seconds of its lifetime adds up to 37,500 damage. ### Daredevil - Damage, shared effects, CC The Daredevil brings a pretty standard venomshare-oriented condi build. Nothing particularly unexpected or unusual here, though it does trade the usual Devourer Venom + Panic Strike synergy for Skale Venom, helping the group cap vulnerability and providing a lot of additional torment. Still, it's fairly straightforward, and uses the meta condi Daredevil rotation--dodging a lot, using venoms for burst damage, and using Basilisk Venom to snap breakbars like twigs. While most of the time using nothing but dagger/dagger is preferable, I've included shortbow as both a ranged option and for utility, since Infiltrator's Arrow enables a lot of time- and effort-saving tricks, especially on fractals like Cliffside. This is a decision that's up to the Daredevil player, though. ### Soulbeast - Damage, shared effects The Soulbeast is notable due to its shared stances and Sun Spirit. Since this teamcomp is entirely condition-based, Sun Spirit is used to its fullest extent possible, since it's one of the few shared effects that doesn't use the sharer's condition stats. The stances will likely be heavily used by all allies (potentially excepting the Firebrand). Interestingly, One Wolf Pack's effect procs on-hit applications with its followup strike. This is especially noticeable with effects like the Renegade's Soulcleave's Summit, but it also halves the number of strikes necessary to get conditions stacked from things like the Daredevil's venoms and Firebrand's Ashes of the Just, in addition to helping saturate the tiny ICD of Vulture Stance. There's nothing more to note particularly with this build; it's a strong, but fairly straightforward condition damage build whose shared effects play beautifully with the other builds in this teamcomp. Enter combat with One Wolf Pack and Vulture Stance to synergize with the Renegade casting Soulcleave's Summit. ### Weaver - Damage, fields, shared effects Weaver isn't an obvious pick for this team; at first I tried a Berserker build, then a Scourge (which is also a very valuable addition if you take Epidemic), but in the end I settled on Weaver. Scourge's fields are nothing to write home about, and several classes in this team can make good use of finishers. The Berserker provides plenty of fields, but its shared effects are limited to small amounts of stat boosts via banners (which are fairly clunky to manage in the mobile fights and short, spread-out encounters common in fractals) and fire fields. Weaver, on the other hand, brings a single shared effect that actually ends up with the highest damage potential of any shared effect in the team, along with providing a number of fire fields, helping to fill in the Firebrand's slightly-less-than-permanent fury uptime, and putting out very strong personal damage. Notable Mechanics: * Arcane isn't the obvious choice for this build as a traitline--the usual ""meta"" traitline is Earth, by my understanding--but it enables an extraordinarily powerful shared effect in the form of Arcane Power. Arcane Power, applied to 5 targets (including yourself) while in fire attunement, will apply a total of 12 stacks of burning for 8 seconds. Ignoring the attacks used to apply the Arcane Power procs entirely, this applies a grand total of just under 62,500 burning damage over 8 seconds, and with One Wolf Pack's shared effect takes only two hits from the elementalist and a single attack from allies to fully apply the burning. This is one of the most powerful damage effects of any of the shared team effects. * Arcane Power lets all allies crit two attacks. Since the Renegade, Daredevil, and Weaver all have conditions applied on-crit, this nearly guarantees rapid application of their on-crit effects during the first moments of combat. * I chose Master's Fortitude instead of Superior Elements in the Weaver's traitline, which is debatable. Personally, I find sword/dagger Weaver unbearably squishy without some extra vitality, and the Weaver has little to gain from pursuing crit chance too zealously. That being said, crit chance lets it deal more power damage. This one's up to the player's preference. * The weaver probably does the most power-based damage of any build in this team, and sits at nearly 3200 power with a high crit chance. Elemental Surge's ferocity buff, then, is hardly wasted on it, even with its relative lack of crit damage from gear. ## Overall Strategy Every member of the team should share out as many relevant team-wide damage and defense effects as possible at the start of combat. That shows up as follows over the first few strikes of combat (assuming a 2-second time window, with a couple of seconds taken prior to combat for boon and buff stacking): * Firebrand: 25 might, fury, quickness, aegis, unique +216 condition damage buff, 4 stacks of Ashes of the Just for a grand total of 33,300 damage. * Renegade: alacrity, Razorclaw's Rage (assuming 2 procs per party member over the first 2 seconds of combat, approximately 6,000 damage), Soulcleave's Summit (assuming a total of 6 packets of damage per party member over the first 2 seconds of combat--entirely reasonable with One Wolf Pack active--13,290 damage). * Daredevil: Spider Venom (just under 62,000 damage given 6 attacks from 5 allies), Skale Venom (just under 32,000 damage given 4 attacks from 5 allies, assuming a stationary target due to Firebrand's immobilization effect). * Soulbeast: Vulture Stance (assuming 2 strikes per second over 2 seconds due to ICD/skill speed mismatch issues, totalling 4 applications each over 5 allies, for 33,760 damage), Sun Spirit (assuming one proc per ally, 23,850 damage), One Wolf Pack (applies a second strike of damage with on-hit effects; damage not calculated due to complexity) * Weaver: Arcane Power (assuming Weaver's Prowess from a recent attunement change to fire, 12 burning applications for just under 62,500 damage) In total, we get 33,300 + 5,700 + 13,290 + 62,000 + 32,000 + 33,760 + 23,850 + 62,500 damage, for a grand total of 266,400 condition damage applied to an enemy within the first 2 seconds of combat from shared effects alone (not counting weapon or damaging skills used to apply the shared effects). The group thus averages 26,640 damage applied to the target per second within the first two seconds, with shared effects alone. Obviously this levels out over time, but it does provide one heck of a burst to start fights, making conditions far more bursty and usable in an average fractal encounter. The shared effect damage will tick over the course of 8 seconds, meaning the Firebrand's first shared Signet of Wrath passive will have just expired when the last damage tick takes place. Obviously this is an idealized scenario, and is neither required nor likely to occur in its entirety during an average fight with trash mobs. That being said, the preconditions for this damage output are minimal, involving about 2-3 seconds of buffing before a fight, and are fairly realistic for bossfights. All of the classes except the Firebrand (and potentially the Renegade) are minor variations on existing condi DPS builds, and should be able to put out meta-level or near-meta-level DPS individually. Assuming the presence of a healer of some sort for T4/CM fractals, this means you really don't lose much in terms of personal damage output in order to bring these effects, which is nice. You can also get away with what's essentially a DPS Renegade bringing alacrity, rather than a Chrono, since the Firebrand takes on the burden of quickness, defensive support, and healing in a single package."
64,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Whirl finisher should be changed to AoE pulsing instead of throwing random projectiles (which never hits anything?),1,9myt52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9myt52/whirl_finisher_should_be_changed_to_aoe_pulsing/,2018-10-10 23:00:11,"The only way to make whirl finishers effective at the moment is to stand on top of your target and whirl them so that the projectiles are catched by the hitbox. But this seems more like a workaround rather than an effective design. In my years of playing, this particular finisher is like 99% of the time totally random and barely hits anything. I think it should be streamlined and reworked so that it pulses AoE effects instead of random projectiles. For example, if you whirl in a lightning field, you pulse AoE X stacks of vulnerability per second to 5 targets around you. This would make it much more useful and manageable. "

Gain access to **stealth attacks** and the **deception** utility type. *Branded Veil:* Pulses every second, burning and chilling foes. *(Combo field: Smoke.* *Burning: 2 seconds* *Chill: 1.5 seconds)* --- &gt; (The core trait of the Miststalker grants the Elementalist access to [smoke fields](URL across all weapon sets (you always have a fire field, e.g. [Lava Font](URL [Flamewall](URL This allows stealthing, with a delay. The delay is not too long, because of the duration reduction of the fields. This reduction is the major trade-off of the specialisation.) (Persisting flames will first increase the fire field duration by 2 seconds, then the duration is halved. Thus, it adds 1 second to the fire field, in turn adding 1 second to the *Branded Veil*) (The durations of fields of new skills (further below) are the already reduced durations) --- * **Master - Predator:** Your dodge rolls are replaced with *Pounce*. * *Pounce:* Leap into an area, dealing damage to enemies. *(Combat only. Radius: 180. Number of targets: 5. Combo finisher: Leap.)* --- &gt; (The damage is there to apply the leap finisher if it would affect an enemy. The damage is low, but has good scaling. Stealth will be applied after the damage is done when dodging through a smoke field.) --- * **Grandmaster - Shadow Dance:** When you blind a foe, gain vigor. *(Vigor: 3 seconds. Cooldown: 5 seconds)* Vigor has increased effectiveness. *(Effectiveness increased: 50%)* --- &gt; (Projectile finishers through smoke fields cause blindness. On top of that, elementalists have many blinds already.) #### MAJOR TRAITS &gt;These are defintely not final, but they are just some ideas on what the playstyle options for a smoke-field elementalist would be --- **ADEPT** --- **1. Eyeball Collection:** When you blind a foe, gain Might. Gain increased critical-hit chance while in a smoke field. *(Might: 2 stacks, 12 seconds. Crit chance increase: 20%.)* **2. Call of the Void:** While wielding a torch, stealth last longer. Your smoke fields lasts longer. *(Duration increased: 1 second)* &gt;(Duration of stealth from finishers is also increased.) **3. Enduring Fire:** Auras grant vigor when applied. Fire auras grant endurance when you are hit. *(Vigor: 5 seconds. Endurance gained: 10.)* &gt;(Dodging through a fire field grants you fire aura, an ice field grants frost aura. Attuning to fire grants a fire aura when you have the fire trait line.) --- **MASTER** --- **1. No Smoke Without Fire:** The cooldown of fire attunement is reduced. *(reduction: 50%)* &gt;(Could be more, 75%?) **2. Gift of the Void:** Branded Veil applies regeneration and heals allies every pulse. Your water fields leave a Branded Veil for half their duration. *(Regen: 1 second. Healing: on the level of Geyser)* &gt;(water fields dont last half as long) **3. True Predator:** Chilling a foe applies vulnerability. *(vulnerability: 2 stacks, 10 seconds)* --- **GRANDMASTER** --- **1. Deceptive Agility:** When entering stealth or using a deception, you gain quickness for 3 seconds. Stealth attacks do 20% more damage. While revealed, deal 10% more damage. &gt; (Allows you to do very fast burst at the cost of stealth duration. E.g. get a really fast meteor shower or a fresh air/phoenix burst from stealth). **2. Drained Will:** Gain vigor and reduce the duration of damaging conditions while in a smoke field. Branded veil slows enemies every pulse. *(Vigor: 1 second. Duration reduced: 20%. Slow: 1 second. Damaging conditions include; Burning, Bleeding, Torment, Poison and Confusion)* **3. Crippling Anguish:** Applying chill or burning also applies torment. *(Torment: 1 stack, 6 seconds, Cooldown: 1s)*. Might gives extra condition damage *(Condition damage: +10 per stack)* ### DECEPTIONS &gt;This is mostly unfinished, but there are some ideas already. If you have any cool ideas for Elementalist deceptions, let me know! There should at least be 1 or 2 that grant stealth regardless of fields. --- **HEALING** --- * **Healing Mist:** Disappear in a cloud of healing mist, stealthing yourself. The healing mist grants boons to allies. *(Stealth: 5s. Combo field: Water. Field duration: 3 seconds. Boons: Vigor: 2 seconds)* --- **UTILITY** --- * Create a Branded Veil (radius: 300) for 5 seconds and refill endurance (Breaks stun). * Shadowstep to target area (range: 900). Can be recast to return to your starting location, creating a blast finisher. * Stealth yourself for 5 seconds, and ... * ... &gt;There's no need for a fire or ice field, as fire fields could also be created by [Conjure Flame Axe](URL and [Conjure Fiery Greatsword](URL --- **ELITE** --- * **Ravage Reality:** PBAoE expanding ice/fire field. Duration: 8 seconds: First creates a 300 radius ice field *(4 seconds)*. After 1 second, the air crystallizes, dealing heavy damage and forming large and small ice crystals. The crystals crash down at random positions over the next 6 seconds (also in the leftover Branded Veil). Large crystals cause blast finishers, small crystals cause whirl finishers. After 2 seconds, a wall of flames *(4 seconds)* forms around the ice field, heavily burning foes that pass through it *(Circular fire field, radius 300-450, can not be evaded)* ### TORCH SKILLS --- **FIRE** --- **4. Dragon Bomb:** Fire a large projectile that causes a violent explosion in the target area. *(combo finisher: blast.)* **5. Obscuring Flames:** Disappear in a small radius fire field, blinding nearby foes and stealthing yourself for 5 seconds. The fire field lasts for 3 seconds and burns foes every second. *(cast time: , cooldown: 25)* --- **AIR** --- **4. Soaring Crash:** Fly up in the air *(evade:  second)*, then crash to the target area, dealing heavy damage to foes *(combo finisher: leap)*. **5. Whirlwind:** Spin around, leaving a small tornado that foes can not move through. *(Duration: 4 seconds. Combo finisher: whirl. Cooldown: 30)* &gt;(Whirl finisher every second and knocks back enemies like Unsteady Ground does.) --- **WATER** --- **4. Armor of Mist:** Gain protection, swiftness and quickness for 4 seconds. **5. Winters Embrace:** Evade backward, leaving a Branded Veil for 4 seconds. --- **EARTH** --- **4. Ragged Earth:** Pull up shards of stone from the earth, *(cripple, combo finisher: whirl)* then send out the shards in all directions. *(bleeding, combo finisher: physical projectile (20%))* **5. Touch Off:** Erupt the earth beneath you to send yourself flying to the target location. Both the eruption and the landing damage foes in an area. Foes hit by the initial impact are blinded. Foes hit by the final impact are dazed for  second. *(Combo finisher: Leap. Cooldown: 40)* &gt;(Can be used point-blank for high burst) ### STEALTH ATTACKS &gt;(While stealthed, skill 1 is temporarily replaced. Ongoing damaging effects do not reveal you; only effects from skills used after stealthing. (Otherwise elementalists would just be revealed instantly all the time.) Using a stealth skill reveals you OR incurs a global (over all attunements) 3-second cooldown to prevent abuse. Not sure what would be best balance-wise.) --- **STAFF** --- **Fire - Meteor:** Call down a meteor on your target that damages, knocks down and burns foes at their position. *(knockdown: 2s, burning: 10s)* &gt; (~0.75-second cast time; The indicator appears at the start of the cast time; the meteor strikes down at the end of the cast time.) **Air - Thunderclap:** Calls down a lightning strike on the target foe, which will hit in a small AoE around them after a 0.25s delay, damaging and blinding them. &gt; (see Thunderclap [lightning hammer](URL skill) **Water - Hoarfrost:** Flash-freeze the target area, chilling foes and inflicting torment on them. Allies in the area are healed. &gt; (High coefficients to burst heal allies or deal high damage to foes.) **Earth - Ebon Hawk:** Pull a boulder from the earth, then shatter it in a direction, firing stone shards in a cone, applying bleeding. Foes hit by multiple shards are knocked down. *(pierces)* &gt;(long cast time, like [Pile Driver](URL (casts like [Ice bow 3](URL --- **SCEPTER** --- **Fire - Double Dragon:** 2 torrents of fire circle in target area, dealing high damage 3 times per second. *(Duration: 3 seconds. Combo field: Fire)* &gt;(deals huge, fast DoT like [Procession of Blades](URL **Air - Static Charge:** Strike your target with a bolt of lightning. Deals double damage to vulnerable foes. &gt;(damage between [Electric Discharge](URL and [Lightning Strike](URL For a Fresh Air stealth burst playstyle) **Water - Ice Spear:** Throw a fast-moving Ice Spear that deals high damage. Gain Vigor for 4 seconds if it hits. *(combo finisher: physical projectile)* &gt;(high damage to combo with [Piercing Shards](URL **Earth - Stone Splinters:** Fire 5 [stone shards](URL at your foe. *(Bleeding: 5 stacks, 6 seconds. Combo finisher: physical projectile (20%))* --- **DAGGER** --- **Fire - Starburst:** Deal 3 bursts of fire to foes around you. The 3rd burst deals increased damage and applies burning. *(Duration: 1 second. Burning: 3 stacks, 5 seconds. Radius: 240.)* &gt;(All 3 bursts deal the same base damage, but the final burst has high power scaling. The final burst applies a lot of burning for a short duration.) **Air - Energizing Strike:** Fire bolts of lightning in a cone in front of you. Give yourself quickness for each foe hit. *(Number of targets: 3. Quickness: 3 seconds. Range: 300)* **Water - Winters Embrace:** Damage foes with a ring of ice *(Vulnerability: 5 stacks, 10 seconds)*, chilling foes that pass through it *(Chill: 3 seconds)*. Allies in the area are healed every second. *(Duration: 3 seconds. Combo field: Ice. Radius: 240)* **Earth - Crystal shield:** Deal minor damage and cripple foes around you *(Cripple: 4 seconds)*. If you hit a foe, gain 25% damage reduction for a few seconds and gain Magnetic Aura. *(combo finisher: blast. Duration: 4 seconds)* --- ### Summary This is probably a lot to take in, as I've spent waaaay too much time thinking about every little detail. I just hope ANet will one day use an idea like this to create an elementalist elite spec with smoke fields, because it opens up a very different playstyle in a pretty simplistic way. For now, let me know what you think; if it's way to over or under powered or wouldn't work in any way or if you have other ideas for utilities, traits, a weapon proficiency or stealth skills! **TL;DR:** This is an elementalist elite speculation whose core mechanic is halving the duration of fire and ice fields, and leaving a smoke field for the remaining duration, which grants elementalists the ability to stealth. They also gain stealth attacks and deceptions as a utility type. "
66,vulnerability,Guildwars2,The Fractal Initiative's Guide for Fractal and Raid Builds,6,98dewl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/98dewl/the_fractal_initiatives_guide_for_fractal_and/,2018-08-19 03:36:14,"*Let me preface this by saying I've been working on this post for a couple days and finished it today so now I'm posting it. I don't want any of the current benchmark/build drama to bleed in here - this is purely a guide post intended to help players* #Introduction Hey all, Its ya boi back at it again with a giant wall of text about Raid and Fractal builds! But seriously though, I recently made/compiled a list of builds for my Fractal guild, The Fractal Initiative [FotM], and decided it would be best to share them with all of you. Right now theres not really any builds out there designed specifically for easy swapping between Raids/Fractals and also newly-meta Fractal classes (specifically Warrior and Soulbeast). Ive developed and/or listed here this set of power builds for Weaver, Soulbeast, Banner Warrior, Holosmith, Deadeye, and Dragonhunter that are either newly optimized for Fractals, serve as excellent meta options, or allow for near seamless transitions between running that class in Fractals and Raids. A few things before we start: * These builds are optimized for more experienced players. This means that they are built around a Chrono/War/3DPS party composition in Fractals, which does not include Spotter that a Druid would provide. If your party decides to bring a Druid, you can reduce your precision from your gear or change food, depending on your class, if you care enough to continue min-maxing your damage output. * No Fractal builds list sigils. It is up to you how much you want to invest in different sigil sets. If youre going to be casual you should at least be using Force/Impact - if youre bringing your Raid Accuracy Sigil set into Fractals then why are you even reading this post? If you want to tryhard you should have Force/Impact/Krait/Night sets to cover all bases. If you want to extra super duper tryhard you can add slaying sigils on top of that. * All builds assume you have 150+ AR and at least the [Infinite Mist Offensive Potion.](URL Certain builds have higher AR requirements in order to gain extra precision from your Infinite Offensive Potion - the AR requirements will be listed where this is necessary. * Condition based builds are excluded as when it comes to efficiently clearing Fractals, power and burst are the king and queen. * All builds run full Mighty Infusions unless otherwise stated (Raid Optimized Soulbeast) * Chrono builds are not included (yet). There are an insane amount of Chrono builds you can run in Fractals that are dependent on anything from your DPS classes, presence of a Druid, do you want to invest in a healing set or infusions, and even which Fractal youre doing. If people are interested I can make another post in the future that includes a couple Chrono builds but there are literally thousands/millions depending on what your exact goals are. Now to the builds themselves! #Builds ##Weaver ###Fractals and Raids Weaver, due to its insane burst, cleave, and offensive support capabilities ([Might](URL is still an excellent choice for a Fractal DPS class. Theres nothing really new here as their gear hasnt been affected since the Spotter change in May (but they really werent even affected then). You have more than enough precision from your potions and critical chance from [Superior Elements](URL that you do not need to worry about the loss of Spotter in Fractals. It is the same build that you should have already if youve played DPS Weaver before in PvE. Im just including it for the sake of completeness. **Note: Healing/Defensive Arcane traits selected for better survivability/Scholar uptime, but choose what you like.** [Raid/Fractal Weaver](URL If you still want to play this build in Raids the build is the same but with your standard Force/Air setup provided Spotter. ##Power Soulbeast ###Fractals Power Soulbeast (pSB) got some great buffs in recent patches and serves as an excellent option for Fractals (and Raids). It has incredible burst DPS and offers offensive and defensive support through Frost Spirit, One Wolf Pack, and Water Spirit (should you choose to bring it over Heal as One). This optimized build requires 164 AR to fully cap on critical chance. This is easily done with +9 or +7 Mighty Infusions and Account AR. A full tryhard build can replace the Assassin Amulet in this build with a Berserker Amulet and increase their AR to 196 for a 1.2% increase in EP. [Fractal Soulbeast](URL Soulbeast has the option of bringing warhorn for single target fights where burst phases are incredibly short, such as Skorvald or Siax. Should you want to do this, a Severance Sigil is a nice choice for the warhorn, so you can cast WH4 -&gt; F2 to proc Severance (and help break) -&gt; Swap to S/A for burst for a free 250 Ferocity for your entire burst. Still doing testing whenever I have the chance to play it in order to find the best possible damage combos for Soulbeast and if I or anyone else finds anything better I will update here. ###Raids If you are interested in playing pSB in both Fractals and Raids and dont care about 100% pure optimization, you can take that exact Fractal build into raids for a very minimal damage loss. It does however require an Accuracy Sigil on each weapon set and Spotter. This build is 99.9% the EP of the pure optimal raid build. [Raid/Fractal Soulbeast](URL If you really want to spend the effort and gold into optimizing your Raid pSB, run the following build. It is slightly more optimized than the current build SC has on their site. Note: it is hard to distinguish infusions without hovering over all of them on the GW2Skills site, but this build is full Berserker except for Assassin Legs and 14 Mighty/4 Precise Infusions. [Raid Optimized Soulbeast](URL ##Warrior - Base and Spellbreaker For the Base Warrior and Spellbreaker builds listed, Tins of Fruitcake (or Sharpening Stone equivalents) are slightly more optimal for Base Warrior and Furious Sharpening Stones are slightly more optimal for Spellbreaker. Use whatever you want in Fractals as youll probably be switching back and forth a couple times between Base/Spb in a given day. ###Fractals This entire post has been sort of a continuation of my [previous post about Warrior builds for Raids and Fractals.](URL My goal for Warrior was the same - create builds that have the same EP as listed meta builds while being both cheaper and easier to bring into Fractals. The Fractal builds are, like Soulbeast, centered around 164 AR to cap critical chance from the Infinite Offensive Mist Potion. Like my last post, the food again is Curry Butternut Soup, which makes this build significantly cheaper to play in Fractals (and Raids). If a Druid joins your Fractal group, you can swap to Sweet and Spicy Butternut to remain optimal. [Banner Base Warrior](URL [Banner Spellbreaker](URL ###Raids The Raid builds are nearly identical as they need to make up 246 precision from the 164 AR in Fractals and that is done simply by adding an Accuracy Sigil (effectively 147 precision) and Spotter. If you are not getting Spotter, then for both builds just swap your Backpiece, one Accessory, and one Ring from Berserkers to Assassins to make up the 100 precision. You also only run Banner Spellbreaker on Dhuum, where you can run A/A GS. ##Holosmith ###Fractals and Raids Like Weaver, Holosmith uses the same standard build in Fractals as it does in Raids, as you significantly overcap on precision from your [Hematic Focus](URL and [High Caliber](URL traits. Again I am including for the sake of completeness. Holosmith is a solid, but not always meta, choice due to pretty high burst, solid vulnerability uptime, and access to CCs. It can also provide utility in the form of blasting for might/stealth, Stealth Gyro upon swapping to Scrapper, and easy skips with Rifle 5. Fractal sigils use your own judgment, Raid sigils use Force/Air. [Standard Holosmith Raid/Fractal Build](URL ##Deadeye and Dragonhunter Deadeye and Dragonhunter are reasonably good choices for a Fractal class, but I dont believe they can be classified as meta. They both use the same exact current Raid meta builds, but again I am including them for reddit-post-completeness. I do not play either of these in Fractals, so please write in the comments below or message me if you spot errors/know of important tips to share about playing these classes effectively in Fractals. Deadeye (and for that matter, Daredevil too) has solid DPS and can contribute a lot to breakbars, but its burst potential is lacking. If you choose to play Deadeye, since you only use one weapon set, utilize the second set as a complement to the first (Impact) set - i.e. for Skorvald, use your Force/Impact set when hes broken and swap to Force/Air when hes not. [Raid/Fractal Deadeye](URL Dragonhunter (or Base Guardian) has solid burst but is simply outdone by what Weaver and Soulbeast can provide in terms of DPS/support. Whats optimal in terms of traits will change depending on the boss and how well you can maintain Aegis if you take Virtues over DH or Zeal. You cannot, however, really go wrong with the current Raid meta standard Full Berserkers Radiance/Zeal/DH build. It is suggested that you bump your AR to 157+ while running this build so that you will cap on critical chance even if you [lose Retaliation.](URL [Raid/Fractal Dragonhunter](URL #Concluding Remarks Like I mentioned before - if you see errors anywhere or want me to add certain tips that I have left out, please comment/message me and I will fix whats necessary. Hopefully some of you were able to gain something from this post; it started out as just the new Soulbeast and Warrior builds, but quickly got out of hand and just turned into a list of appropriate high level power builds for Fractals (and Raids).

67,vulnerability,Guildwars2,SpellBlaster: An Elementalist Pistol Elite Specialisation,62,99dpnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/99dpnb/spellblaster_an_elementalist_pistol_elite/,2018-08-23 00:17:20,"For too long, Elementalists have asked for a reliable single-target, fast-casting, long-ranged weapon. Whilst staff is an amazing AoE long-ranged, slow-casting weapon, it isn't very viable in situations in which you want to react quickly to a single strong opponent. Therefor I want to suggest a new elite specialisation that will handle long-ranged single target opponents: the Spellblaster. Spellblasters have an intricate history. Initially respected as a secret, top-ranking order of assassin mages due to their volatile and dangerous use of the elements, they were frequently used by important political figures in high-level operations in which certain individuals had to be murdered. They became extremely popular due to how deadly and precise they were, and when they weren't assassins they often had a respectable position in society of their own. Their unique skill allows them to create bullets out of the elements themselves, leaving behind murders that were untraceable. After a whistleblower publicly betrayed their secret existence, they were quickly shunned and banned by everyone as nobody wanted to have any affiliation with them. Having lived on the edge of society, they are masters of improvisations and are able to quickly adapt to any environment by using their elemental knowledge. These rare mages are not typically found in large cities and are shy of large crowds, often preferring to be on their own. &amp;#x200B; **Weapon:** Main-hand Pistol - The idea behind the pistol skills is that they use conditions in order to deal heavy direct damage. The aim here isn't to create a condi-heavy class, but rather a class that deals more damage if certain specific criteria have been fulfilled. These criteria can be fulfilled using already existing skills that Elementalists already possess, or by the new weapon skills themselves. This makes sure that Pistol-gameplay isn't simply unloading all your weapon skills, but thinking tactfully when to use which skill in which scenario. |Element|*Fire*|*Water*|*Air*|*Earth*| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Skill 1|**Infernal Kiss**: Fire a bullet of concentrated heat, burning your target.|**Frozen Taste**: Fire a frigid bullet that makes your target vulnerable. If your target is below 50% health, apply a second stack of vulnerability.|**Vacuum Shot**: Blast a shot of vacuum, dealing more damage depending on how much armor your target has. |**Edged Bullet**: Fire a shot of sharp rock, bleeding your foe. Additional stacks of bleeding are applied the further your target is.| |Skill 2|**Burning Wisdom**: Fire a shot that deals more damage the more burn stacks your target has.|**Wintertide**: Freeze the skies with sub-zero shots, creating an area that pulses damage. If your target is Chilled, it will deal additional damage.|**Blinding Bullet**: Blind your target by shooting a lightning infused bullet. If they're already blinded, deal additional damage and cripple them. |**Petrifying Shot**: Immobilize your target by shooting the ground at their feet. If your target faces you, deal additional damage and gain might.| |Skill 3|**Heat stroke**: Blast intense heat out of your pistol, creating a heat wave that destroys projectiles and grants Fire Shield. Burn the target and gain might for any burnt projectile.|**Arctic Touch**: Shoot your target with a frozen bullet that sticks on them for 5 seconds. If your target moves whilst carrying this bullet, it explodes dealing heavy damage and Chilling them.|**Squall**: Fire in quick succession, creating an airflow that pushes targets away from you. If this attack misses, blind your target.|**Magnetic Demeanour**: Shoot a magnetic shot that taunts your target. Gain protection.| **Utilities:** Tricks - It made the most sense to give a Spellblaster tricks as their utilities. Tricks are a known utility type skill for thieves and are focused on maneuvers, making sure the user is quickly out of a situation in a better state than before. &amp;#x200B; |*Heal*|*Utility*|*Elite*| |:-|:-|:-| |**Quibble**: Blink backwards and heal. Enemies in your vicinity get a condition based on your attunement.|**Distraction:** (Ammo: 3) Taunt your target.

Gain stealth for 3 seconds.|| ||**Rejection:** Blind your target and gain Fury, Might and Vigor.|| ||**Dispatch:** (Ammo: 2) Cleanse 3 conditions. Apply Burning, Blind and Chilled if you have no conditions on you.|| **Profession Mechanic:** Spellblasters get an F5 called ""**Elemental Blast**"" that changes based on your attunement. This F5 skill will help you by surviving certain conditions. Since Spellblasters will do a lot of damage at the expense of being very fragile, the utility given by their F5 should help them survive when facing tougher opponents. &amp;#x200B; |*F5: Fire*|*F5: Water*|*F5: Air*|*F5: Earth*| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Flame Blast:** Concentrate your elemental energies into firing a blast of incredible heat, burning targets around you and giving you vigor and might.|**Frost Blast**: Freeze the area around you, chilling enemies and granting you regeneration.

Gain swiftness.|**Sand Blast:** Excite the ground around you and blind nearby foes. Gain Magnetic Aura.| &amp;#x200B; **Traits:** These traits are designed to offer either more damage, more evasion or changing your F5 skills. &amp;#x200B; |Pistol Proficiency: You can wield a Pistol in your main hand.|*Adept*|*Master*|*Grandmaster*| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Minor|**Slinger Of Spells**: Gain access to Elemental Blast and Trick skills.|**Elements of Might:** When you change attunement, you gain Might.|**Will Of The Pistol:** Gain a stacking ferocity effect whenever you evade an attack.| |Major 1|**Primordial Bullets:** Using Pistol skills gives you +75 expertise and +75 concentration.

68,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Mesmer Elite Spec Concept - Dreamreaver,23,99x0ke,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/99x0ke/mesmer_elite_spec_concept_dreamreaver/,2018-08-24 22:32:26," #**Elite Specialization Idea - Dreamreaver** **Base class**: Mesmer **New skills**: Minds Eye, Dreams, Nightmares, Sleep **Roles**: Direct DPS, Crowd Control **Summary**: Dreamreavers are psychic assassins. Rather than summoning long lasting clones, their illusions are used to manipulate minds and incapacitate foes. Most notable is their ability to put their enemies to **Sleep**. Once their opponents are locked down and vulnerable, Dreamreavers can then use their daggers to unleash devastating attacks. Among their ethereal arsenal are **Dreams** and **Nightmares**. These skills allow the Dreamreaver to further defend themselves and control the battlefield. &amp;nbsp; --- ###**New Condition**: **Sleep** Sleep is a hard CC like Stun that renders a target unable to move or perform skills. Damaging skills against targets that are asleep will deal an instance of bonus damage (ICD: 1 second). Each time this bonus damage is triggered, Sleeps duration is reduced by 1 second. * Enemies with breakbars will still be able to freely move and use skills for Sleeps duration. The bonus damage will prioritize damaging the breakbar first before damaging the healthbar * Sleep does not stack in duration * Sleep is considered both a Control Effect and a Condition for the purposes of Stun Breaks and Condition Cleanse &amp;nbsp; --- ###**New Mechanic**: **Minds Eye, Dreamer's Touch, and Nightmare's Reach** Shatter skills are replaced with the ***Minds Eye*** gauge. The gauge is charged using illusion summoning skills and traits. When fully charged, cast ***Dreamers Touch*** to put a target to Sleep. ***Nightmares Reach*** is a separate skill that can be casted if the opponent targeted is movement impaired or under a control effect * **Clones**  Clones will no longer persist in the open world. Clone skills will instead contribute 20% to the Minds Eye gauge * *Skills and Traits that originally use Clones will change to assist with charging the gauge, while retaining a similar function. These changes will remain so long as the Dreamreaver Elite is selected. List of changes are at the very end* * **Phantasms**  Phantasms will appear and perform their normal attack. As they disappear, they will contribute 20% to the Minds Eye gauge &amp;nbsp; ######***F1  Dreamers Touch*** Launch powerful magic at a target, putting them to Sleep * Duration: 6 seconds * Cost: 100% of the Minds Eye gauge * *Dreamers Touch has no CD, only requiring that you have the gauge filled* &amp;nbsp; ######***F2  Nightmares Reach*** Deal a powerful attack based on your main hand weapon * Cooldown: 15 seconds * *Nightmares Reach can only be casted if the target is under a movement impairing condition or a control effect* * **Greatsword**  Create a line shockwave that damages everything in its path * **Staff**  Cast a spreading wave of chaos magic, inflicting damaging conditions on foes and boons on allies * **Sword**  Slash foes, damaging and crippling them, then stab them dealing damage. The stab has increased critical damage against movement impaired foes * **Scepter**  Create a magical explosion that damages, blinds, and briefly dazes foes * **Dagger**  Deal heavy damage to a single target. This damage is increased against targets with low health * **Spear**  Hurl your spear at a target, dealing damage and pulling them towards you * **Trident**  Slow nearby enemies and grant Quickness to allies &amp;nbsp; --- ###**New Weapon: Daggers** ######***Dagger 1*** Fast, 3 hit auto attack chain. The final attack deals bonus damage based on how many unique control conditions are on the target * The time window to use the third attack is paused by using other skills ######***Dagger 2*** Multiple stabs in rapid succession in front of you. Each hit charges your Minds Eye. This skill does increased damage and has a lower cooldown if your Minds Eye is fully charged * You can move while casting this skill ######***Dagger 3*** Dash forward up to two times, dodging attacks and damaging foes you pass through ######***Dagger 4*** Strike a target. If you strike them from their front, deal high damage and summon a Phantasmal Rogue behind them. If you strike them from behind, deal moderate damage and inflict Sleep * Sleep Duration: 2 seconds ######***Dagger 5*** Slash multiple enemies twice in an arc in front of you.

69,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Herald Facet of Nature - Timing and other Legends,56,9cnxhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9cnxhz/herald_facet_of_nature_timing_and_other_legends/,2018-09-04 04:31:10,"Hey there! We've been working with u/BackIsBachus on finding out what's going on with the new Facet of Nature. We've looked into [how FoN - Glint works](URL and here is more on the entire skill. # More on FoN - Glint First of all, we found out some more stuff on how FoN - Glint works. We've done some more testing in order to find out whether the boon duration the buff gives was additive or multiplicative with the source's boon duration. In order to test, we had a Mesmer with about 50% boon duration and a Herald who had FoN - Glint active. The objective was to share Might through the use of Signet of Inspiration (SoI). As the base duration is 20 sec, with 50% boon duration, the duration of the SoI might share is 30 sec. We ended up with 34 sec shared which pointed to an additive buff (as a multiplicative would have given 36 sec). &amp;#x200B; This is probably linked to the reason that makes this buff limited by the 100% boon duration cap that we noted in our previous research. &amp;#x200B; Then, we wanted to test the timing between Facets when they're applied. To understand completely what we did here's a quick sum up of how facets work : * When you activate a Facet, you instantly share its buff. * Every 3 sec, ALL of your Facets share their buff. The timing for this is every 3 seconds since the first Facet was activated. So now, what I was interested in was to understand in which order facets are applied when they're supposed to simultaneously share their buff. To give some context, if I had to classify myself as a player, I would say I'm a WvW player and there you usually have buffs that overflow (not even counting Draconic Echo). So if someone new gets your buffs, I wanted to know if they'd get the 20% bonus or not upon receiving the buff. In order to test, I used a target that would receive the buffs, activate my facets (FoN and FoStrength) from out of range and then move into range, noting the duration of the applied buff. &amp;#x200B; I could not get any consistent results. In some cases, the FoN buff would be applied before and I would see 16sec might stacks, in some cases, the FoN buff would be applied after and I would see 13sec might stacks. &amp;#x200B; I've tried many scenarii : * Activating FoN before FoS * Activating FoS before FoN * Being in combat * Being out of combat * Being in different instances (Aerodrome's training zone, Aerodrome, WvW, Open world maps) * Being naked or with armor/weapons No matter what, I could not figure out what caused the results to change. Maybe it's random, maybe it depends on internet speed, maybe it's God's doing. Your guess is as good as mine. &amp;#x200B; # True Nature - Ventari and Shiro I'm not going to spend too much time on those as they turned out to be pretty classic skills. The FoN numbers have been worked out by u/MajesticNoodle [here.](URL I just wanted to know whether these skills would remove buffs/condis according to a priority list or the last one applied. Turns out for both, they remove the last 2 buffs or condis applied. So nothing special really. &amp;#x200B; # FoN - Mallyx Here again, I was interested in finding out if the condi pull was ordered or if it pulled only the last condi applied. In order to work that out, I used the preview golem in the Training Area (I then made sure the results were the same on player characters). The condis are pulled in the following order : 1. Frost 2. Blind 3. Slow 4. Torment 5. Burn 6. Fear 7. Immobile 8. Confusion 9. Weakness 10. Cripple 11. Poison 12. Bleed and Vulnerability N.B. 1 : I couldn't test with taunt as it is not available on the golem. N.B. 2 : Bleed and Vulnerability have the same priority ranking, so if they're the only two condis that you can pull, you'll get the last one that was applied. &amp;#x200B; # TN - Mallyx Here as well, I wanted to know whether the condi transfered were following a priority list or if the two last condi applied were transfered. I ended up finding that the skill actually works in two separate parts : 1. It copies 2 condis onto nearby enemies following a priority list 2. It removes the 2 last condis that were applied to you What that means is that you might apply condis that you are not removing from yourself. Also, even if there are no ennemies nearby, you'll still remove 2 condis from you. For the 1st part, I pulled all the condis I could from the Training Area Golem (using FoN - Mallyx). I then used TN onto the ennemy golem. Then restarted without one of the two condis I had applied. I looped always removing the condi higher in the priority list. I ended up with this priority list (once again, I couldn't test with taunt) : 1. Fear and Weakness (If you have these two condis, you'll always copy those, I couldn't order these two) 2. Frost 3. Blind 4. Cripple 5. Slow 6. Torment 7. Immobile 8. Vulnerability 9. Burn 10. Confusion 11. Poison 12. Bleed It happens that this seems to be the same priority list Plague Signet uses to transfer conditions. I might be wrong, since I did not run extensive research on Plague Signet, but trying a few times seemed to confirm this theory. # # Conclusion - TL;DR There's still a lot I'm not sure about and I'd love to run some more research, but alas, the week-end has come to an end. What we do know, though, is that FoN - Glint works in some mysterious ways to give 20% additive (to the source's boon duration) boon duration, FoN - Mallyx pulls condis according to a priority list (the same as Plague signet it seems), and TN - Mallyx has two components : 1 - it copies condis according to a priority list (again it seems to be the same as Plague Signet) and 2 - it removes the two most recently applied condis. If you have any idea on why FoN - Glint seems to synchronize randomly, or anything to answers the remaining questions, I'd love to hear about it ;) Still, I personnally feel like this was rolled out before they could actually finish it. The uninformative tooltips, the skills that feel like other skills weirdly stitched up together,... It all feels like they rushed in this rework for some reason, which I think is a shame. But anyway, thank you for reading, I hope this was useful to you in some way, or at least interesting :)"

Any other time and control effects will have no effect and simply be wasted. * Soft Crowd Control Effects are: Fear, Taunt, Immobile, Slow, Chill, Blind, Weakness, Crippled provide Damage Over Time (D.O.T.) to the Defiance Bar. * Hard Crowd Control Effects are: Daze, Stun, Knockback, Knockdown, Pull, Float, Sink and inflict damage directly to the Defiance Bar.

It is then up to you to make the best of those skills to suit the situation. For those that have trouble with their rotations, break them down in to smaller segments and where possible try to find a natural rhythm to them, if they have one, as not all do. Some skills are situational or should be saved, like those used for CC - Crowd Control, so they can be used to the greatest effect. &amp;nbsp; **Rotation by Weapon** ######Power Staff Rotation &gt; Air Attunement * Tempest Only - Overload Air * Glyph of Storms: Lightning Storm * Weaver Only - Pile Driver &gt; Fire Attunement * Weaver Only - Plasma Blast * Lava Font * Weaver Only - Fire * Flame Burst * Meteor Shower * Fireball * Lava Font + Arcane Wave / Arcane Brilliance * Tempest Only - Overload Fire * Conjure Fiery Greatsword * Fiery Eruption * Fiery Rush * Firestorm * Lava Font &gt; Earth Attunement * Eruption * Weaver Only - Pyroclastic Blast * Weaver Only - Earth + Fire * Shockwave * Fireball * Lava Font &gt; Fire Attunement * Fireball * Flame Burst &amp;nbsp; **Rotation by Profession** ######Weaver Sword + Dagger Rotation &gt; Air Attunement * Glyph of Storms: Lightning Storm * Ride the Lightning. * Polaric Leap * Quantum Strike * Updraft (if you need CC or target uses Immobs / Knockdowns) &gt; Fire Attunement * Flame Uprising * Pyro Vortex * Fire Strike - Fire Swipe - Searing Slash &gt; Earth Attunement * Lava Skin * Ring of Fire * Fire Grab + Arcane Wave / Arcane Brilliance * Earthen Vortex &gt; Fire Attunement * Flame Uprising * Earthquake * Churning Earth * Fire Strike - Fire Swipe - Searing Slash ######Dual Dagger Condition Rotation &gt; Air Attunement * Signet of Fire (if foes are already closely grouped) * Ride the Lightning * Shocking Aura &gt; Fire Attunement * Burning Speed (only engage while Air skills are on cooldown or to escape AoE) * Glyph of Elemental Power * Drakes Breath * Ring of Fire * Fire Grab + Arcane Wave &gt; Water Attunement (if quick enough, otherwise skip straight to earth) * Frozen Burst (for multiple targets) * Arcane Brilliance + Arcane Wave (only use if health is low otherwise skip to Earth) &gt; Earth Attunement * Magnetic Grasp (only for single target and for when foe tries to run out of your aoe) * Earthquake * Churning Earth + Arcane Wave * Ring of Earth &gt; Fire Attunement * Fiery Greatsword * Fiery Rush * Fiery Whirl * Fiery Eruption * Firestorm --- ###Power Builds### &gt; Damage is dealt directly and takes effect immediately. &amp;nbsp; **[Staff Scholar Elementalist / Tempest / Weaver]( URL **Variants** * [Staff Elementalist with Arcane](URL * [Staff Tempest](URL - with [Arcane](URL * [Staff Weaver](URL - with [Arcane](URL Vulnerability (25) - Air: Glyph of Storms - Lightning Storm Might (12-16) + Fury by blasting Lava Font with Arcane Brilliance + Arcane Wave.

It is then up to you to make the best of those skills to suit the situation. For those that have trouble with their rotations, break them down in to smaller segments and where possible try to find a natural rhythm to them, if they have one, as not all do. Some skills are situational or should be saved, like those used for CC - Crowd Control, so they can be used to the greatest effect. &amp;nbsp; **Rotation by Weapon** ######Rifle * Jump Shot - use at point blank range to damage foes on both the leap and landing. * Only with Stability - Net Shot &gt; Overcharged Shot * Blunderbuss ######Rifle Turret * Surprise Shot (Toolbelt) ######Pistols * Incendiary Ammo (only if strong single target) * Poison Dart Volley * Incendiary Ammo (only if multiple targets) * Static Shot * Rocket Kick * Blow Torch ######Grenade Kit * Shrapnel Grenade * Grenade ######Bomb Kit * Big ol Bomb (Toolbelt) * Fire Bomb * Bomb * Supply Crate (if equipped) ######Flamethrower * Napalm * Air Blast (only if target is back against wall or in a corner) * Flame Blast + Detonate Flame Blast * Flame Jet ######Elite Mortar Kit * Use the Mortar Kit while out of range for other skills as you close the gap for some initial bleed and vulnerability stacks. * Poison Gas Shell * Mortar Shot &amp;nbsp; ######Power Rifle Rotation For ranged fights equip the Grenade Kit, for melee range bring the Bomb Kit.

74,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Oddball general PvE/fractal/open world build: Breakbar Burst Beast,19,8xfmdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8xfmdb/oddball_general_pvefractalopen_world_build/,2018-07-10 06:07:34,"# [Full Build](URL ----- ### Preface One day, I decided that I was tired of playing my ranger as a healer or condi build, and decided to experiment with power options. The obvious choice here is sword/axe or sword/warhorn, but I had a really shiny greatsword skin I wanted to use. Since we're all Skritt here anyway, this obviously was the most important factor to build around. Greatsword's autoattack DPS is on the low side of acceptable, and its other skills provide so little damage output that there was really only one option left: Maul. ----- ### What it does This build focuses on quickly stacking up damage multipliers, unleashing a devastating series of burst attacks, then maintaining moderate DPS and staying alive until another burst attack series is available. At its peak, you can reach a roughly 14x damage multiplier on several major hits of the burst combo. However, it's not just damage: the amount of CC in the burst combo is obscene, and will snap most breakbars immediately. This can be repeated every 20s, and additional CC is available in between the bursts. The build also brings Frost Spirit, reasonable block and evade abilities, permanent weak regeneration and swiftness for allies, a decent variety of field finishers (leap/projectile/one blast), an AoE stunbreak for allies, and very solid vulnerability application. ----- ### Burst Rotation (assumes 25 might, 25 vulnerability, otherwise self buffs only) * With a **Frost Spirit** in play (5% damage boost)... * Enter **Beast Mode** with your Ferocious pet to gain +200 power/+100 ferocity, +80 power/precision/toughness/vitality, and +150 ferocity from Beastmastery minor traits and your pet's merge stats. * Use **""Sic 'Em!""** for a 40% damage boost. * Use **Charge (Rock Gazelle)** or **Takedown (Smokescale)**. If your target has a breakbar, no timing is required; else time the attack so that this skill interrupts your foe in order to get an Attack of Opportunity (50% damage boost), Twice as Vicious proc (5% damage boost), and Sigil of Severance proc (+250 precision/ferocity). This will ideally drop your foe's health percentage to below yours, picking up Oppressive Superiority (10% damage), and if you're above 90% health, 10% from the Scholar runes. * Use **""Strength of the Pack!""** if available for a 7% damage boost from fury via Furious Strength. Also applies Remorseless (25% damage boost) by gaining fury, and ensures your burst will not be interrupted via stability If not available, use **""We heal as one!""** to refresh fury on yourself, for a similar effect. * Use **Worldly Impact** for massive damage (approximately 53,500 with all modifiers rolling). * Use **Maul** for massive damage (approximately 28k due to Moment of Clarity ICD, all other modifiers in effect due to reapplication of fury from Worldly Impact) * **Autoattack** or use **Counterattack** to block until Maul is off cooldown) * Use **""Protect Me!""** to taunt and interrupt your nearby foes, replenishing Attack of Opportunity (3s ICD will certainly be available since the timer was started when you first landed Charge/Takedown). * Use **Maul, Hilt Bash, and Maul again**. The last Maul won't get the Moment of Clarity damage boost, but your duration on ""Sic 'Em!"" is running out, and you want to get as much burst in as possible before that drops off. * Exit **Beast Mode** and take advantage of your normal pet skills, greatsword and longbow abilities, and pet swap at will for about 20 seconds before starting another burst. ----- ### What the Rotation Means Essentially, when ""Sic 'Em"" is available, you want to merge with your pet and use CC skills once every 3 seconds just before a major burst skill (Worldly Impact/Maul), with preference towards Worldly Impact. This will cause your major burst skills to skyrocket in damage. When your burst buffs wear off, you exit Beast Mode to let your pet buffs and abilities go into full effect and play defensively, still dealing damage with the GS/LB while preparing to drop another burst in about 20 seconds. It may be worth turning off autoattacks on the greatsword in order to maintain control over your Attacks of Opportunity, since that's one of the larger damage boosts. You definitely want to use that boost on a Maul or Worldly Impact whenever possible. Since your normal burst rotation involves at least 4 skills with heavy CC, you don't need to significantly change your rotation or stop dealing damage in order to tear through breakbars. When the burst rotation is over, your pet skills contain hard CC, and the GS and longbow both have hard CC available to help snap breakbars. Finally, Maul will provide 10 stacks of vulnerability on every use, every reapplication of fury will provide 5 stacks, longbow 2 applies 10 stacks, and the Rock Gazelle provides a few stacks, so in combination with the Frost Spirit you'll be able to buff allies nicely. The Smokescale and Rock Gazelle were chosen because they both provide similar capabilities that play into the build's strengths: hard CC and Ferocious (thus providing Worldly Impact). I would treat the Rock Gazelle as the preferred pet due to its mobility, but the Smokescale definitely has utility too due to its smoke field and Smoke Assault, which gives you another defensive tool (great for being able to sustain melee engagements). ----- Probably not the most competitive build in the world, but there's something to be said for building up extremely quickly to a devastating burst that integrates a significant amount of hard CC. Worldly Impact can one-shot anything smaller than a Veteran, and for that matter a fair few Veterans too. Plus, it's just fun!"
75,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"With each balance patch, another Focus wielding class losses their projectile animation.",133,8y01me,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8y01me/with_each_balance_patch_another_focus_wielding/,2018-07-12 00:28:36,"More precisely, each balance patch that involves foci changes which changes foci skills to no longer have a projectile. The newest victim was Guardian's Ray of Judgment. URL Changed from a projectile to now being a targeted skill. Although I will admit that smiting your enemies with a ray of light from the sky is awesome (even if it's just recycled animation of Light's Judgment from DH), we have lost yet another skill with a projectile animation. Arguably, the old Ray of Judgement was quite pathetic and extremely niche (Condi cleanse on bounce was quite unreliable but I suppose people utilized the blind). The new guardian foci now has damage and utility to boot so that's a positive. During a previous balance patch, the last victim was Mesmer's Phantasmal Warden which immobilized enemies after a projectile hit then summoned a warden. Mesmer players have argued that, while the new iteration does more reliable damage, has less utility than it previously had. I myself prefer the older version not only because it had a projectile but because having the phantasm immobilize targets after being pulled by Temporal Curtain combo'd wonderfully with the immobilize then cleave. Moreover, it is currently the only weapon phantasm skill that does NOT have an attack from the mesmer attached to it. I thought the balance team was trying to change this? It's almost completely reverted to its original state save for increased damage. URL The last remaining survivor is Necromancer's Reaper's Touch. Precisely because this skill, at its current state, is quite useless because Necro having a plethora of alternative sources for vulnerability and regen. I foresee that this skill will be next on the list. Elementalist has no projectiles associated with Focus. Very unfortunate. I bring this topic to light because I made the Binding of Ipos which has a simple yet elegant projectile animation. However with each balance patch, the balance team is gradually removing opportunities to let me enjoy it's projectile animation. I am all for improving niche skills, but is it possible that they leave those skills as projectiles? The alternative of course is allowing off-hand weapons to overwrite non-legendary main-hand weapon skills and profession skills but I'm certain due to coding reasons, that is not a viable option (as we all know from Engineer's kits and Citadel Bombardment with legendary axes As for Minstrel users, I pray that one day, you will all at least get a projectile animation in the future."
76,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"I really hope the next expansion delivers some meta-competitive alternatives to the current support classes, mainly Chrono and Druid",101,8y3m9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8y3m9l/i_really_hope_the_next_expansion_delivers_some/,2018-07-12 07:26:33,"**TL;DR** Midnight rant, hopefully we get support classes that can compete with Chrono and Druid for those roles (yes all classes are viable and can clear all content). First of all, yes, I am aware that you can clear harder content like raids, CM fractals with non-meta comps/classes, and after the druid changes you can easily run a non-druid 2nd healer. However for people that prefer to optimize their runs a bit, running the (pug) meta comp (Chrono,Druid,BS,2xDPS) feels kinda mandatory. The trio of support classes condense almost all of the most important damage buffs, utilities and boons, and able to handle a lot of the mechanics, allowing your DPS players to continue their rotation unhindered. As far as I can tell, the success of Chrono and Druid lies, in a large part, due to being designed from the bottom to fill/create these roles. Chrono is able to comfortably maintain 100% quickness and alacrity partly thanks to its wells, shatter effects, and the ability to cast these skills twice, along with the base mesmer skills. This is why I'm talking about the next expansion in the title, as, at this point, I'm not sure it can be achieved by existing spec tweaks. Similarly, Druid gained access to healing focused skills, along with great utility from glyphs and base ranger skils. While there was an attempt to provide alternatives, like quickness Firebrand and Alacrity/+healer Renegade, those weren't really adopted by the part of the community that chooses to run meta comps (I am aware of attempts like a Sabetha record with the alternative comp, its a long talk as to why it wasn't adopted, and not the point of my post) since, as I said above, the meta supports condense a lot of utility very efficiently. This means that the choices for a buffer and primary healer, especially in 5-man groups is extremely limited. Thus, I really hope that ArenaNet designs some classes that can compete with the current meta supports, not by throwing boons anywhere and seeing if anything sticks ( Ventari alacrity I'm looking at you), but by taking the time to actually look at what Chrono and Druid are really providing, and trying to reproduce that while still maintaining different flavour and gameplay (not an easy task for sure). Not by 1-uppping the current support classes and introducing more powercreep, but by offering alternatives that can perform equally well. I know that part of the playerbase is pitted against the current boonspam, and the relatively ease of its maintenance; I'm not advocating for or against it, but wherever we move, either down the same path, or having boons like quickness sparse and saved to be used during critical moments like burn phases, I hope that more competitive, *not simply viable* as those already exist, specs are introduced. In short, some of the important utilities that Chrono and Druid provide: * 100% quickness and alacrity most importantly, permanent uptime of ~10 boons for % damage modifiers per boon class traits * 25 stacks of might on 10 people * upwards of 2k breakbar damage from a single Chrono if Moa is used during CS, plus a significant amount from Druid (varies with pets, utilities) * flat 5% damage increase, % damage increase through vulnerability stacking, damage increase through burning * a variety of utilities such as pushes, pulls, projectile reflect/destruction, weakness, long immobilize, AoE stability/stunbreak, condi cleanses, boon removal, portals, damage mitigation while tanking, AoE rezzes and downstate ally pulls. Those are big shoes to fill, but a lot of those utilities already exists on classes like Guardian. For things like ranger spirits, I would like to see their effects copied/replicated on other classes as well, without stacking of course, to finally remove the need to always have a Druid, or at least Soulbeast ( this is more towards 5-man content, as it already happens in raids). I know this is a controversial suggestion, as it does make the effects kinda bland, however I think it would make healer players free to play whatever healing class they feel like, or at least dictated by the fight itself instead of always needing a Druid ( I say this as someone with over 2k hours on my Druid, having done all raids and raid achievements, fractal CMs with it). You wouldn't really run a raid with a Tempest and Renegade healer for example (obviously its totally doable/viable), or you would at least need a Soulbeast, making them abandon their utilities and potentially taking a dps unsuitable to the fight. If you've made it this far down, wow! Thanks for reading."
77,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"[Lore Theory] The Nature of the Elder Dragons, their spheres and their unique weaknesses - a ""small"" update",17,8jwirh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8jwirh/lore_theory_the_nature_of_the_elder_dragons_their/,2018-05-17 02:56:19,"I figured to create an update for my last theory, which I posted [here](URL to maybe have a bit more thought out, decisive theory on the sphere of the Elder Dragons. If you don't want to read it, here is a quick summary of my theory at the time: * Each Elder Dragon has two spheres. Their primary sphere act as their way of utilizing magic, their secondary sphere is their unique aspect, their nature, their way of handling things. In this secondary sphere lies their weakness and it was something we had to specifically overcome. * A list of what I thought were their spheres and a motivation for each of them. I was incredibly certain about Steve and not at all about Primordus. * Jormag and Primordus went to sleep due to an excess of magic, which made them start hibernating again. An overflow of magic would kill them. It wasn't that Fire went against Ice and vice versa, it was kinda like shoving food down someone's throat to the point that they can't breathe anymore. * I also had a small secondary theory that not only are there 3 pairs of 2, but also 2 pairs of 3, where each side would also represent something physical or mental. Overall, the small theory wasn't precise enough. I'd rather call the ""mental"" more the ""unobservable"", ""abstract"" or ""intangible"", since Mind kinda seems to cover most of the mental. Also, I'd like to say about the secondary sphere that I kinda let go of the specific ""having to overcome it"" thing, because it was kinda a given. It was their greatest strength, as said by numerous characters, but also housed their one weakness, so *of course* you have to overcome it. So, without further ado, here are the updates / refinements of the theory. Obligatory ""holy smokes, Batman, look at that wall of text!"" ------------------------------------- **Kralkatorrik's true secondary sphere** I was a tad wrong about Kralkatorrik, plain and simple. As is revealed during [The Way Forward](URL his weakness is the resonance he shares with his creations. Basically, his greatest asset is to crystalize objects, and this crystalization is powerful. I was right up until that part. The reason he is weak against his own magic is not because his own magic is just that powerful, it is that there is a specific resonance that interacts with each other. This explains why Aurene could be used by a beam by Balthazar: he harnessed that resonance and weaponised it. This means that Kralkatorrik's second sphere is Resonance. ---------------------------------------------- **A different look at the secondary sphere** This means that Body has just opened up. It may or may not be applicable at all, but if we look at connections between the two opposites: Mordremoth and Zhaitan are complete opposites through their primary sphere, which is Life (well technically, Plants, but it acts as ""creating life"", as is numerously stated by characters (I think)) and Death respectively. But their secondary sphere is not at all different, in fact one could argue they are the same, or at least are applicable in similar ways: Mind and Shadow respectively. Both are representations of oneself, either physical or more abstract. Through this, we could argue that the secondary sphere doesn't show a complete opposite, but rather something that also connects these two different Elder Dragons. I am still very certain that Jormag's secondary sphere is something like **Soul** (which terminology is not complete, since Zhaitan corrupts physical souls as well, such as the Eyes of Zhaitan). Let's for a moment give Primordus **Body**, since it isn't too great of a leap for him to have this sphere (I wanted to give him this earlier as well but at the time I had given it to Kralkatorrik). Soul and Body are not at all very different. They are, similar to Mind and Shadow, representations of oneself, but rather than less abstract, they are defining traits. Ones body creates true physical limitations or advantages, ones soul is the true, intangible versions of oneself. Both are the primary essences of a person. This duality would solidify Primordus' secondary sphere as Body. Other than that, Primordus is the only one, besides Mordremoth, who creates his minions by hand. The difference is that Mordremoth grants them intelligence and thus life, whereas Primordus' minions are mostly completely mindless, just pure husks. Bodies. A body shapes a shadow. Likewise, the soul shapes a mind. This does not mean mind and shadow are lesser forms, rather they are different forms. We can understand ones soul if we know ones mind. Likewise, we can predict ones mind if we know ones soul. The same goes for body and shadow. They are simply different, and yet have the same basis. Primordus and Jormag have the primary essence, Zhaitan and Mordremoth the represenation. In this, I assume for shadow to be a more physical thing, to hide in the shadow of a corner, although Zhaitan *has* used stealth moreso than other Dragons (such as when the Risen Wraiths appeared during [What the Eye Beholds](URL and during [The Battle for Claw Island](URL amongst others, sometimes using magic, sometimes not). ----------------------------------------------- **The recurring problem of Kralkatorrik and Steve** Which brings me back to Kralkatorrik and Steve. Perhaps, in a way, I was right with my earlier statement of the mental and physical, just not in the way I thought at that time. Rather, instead of seperating the physical and mental, we seperate the observable and unobservable. The direct with the more abstract. However, we have a problem. At the time, I thought of Kralkatorrik as something physical, and was very certain of Steve being mental in the form of Fear. However, this does not work at this point. Kralkatorrik has the secondary sphere of Resonance. Fear has nothing to do with Resonance. In addition, we could argue that Resonance is much more abstract than it is physical. -------------------------------------- **Sidebar: another possiblity** Let's look at that vision of the [Eternal Alchemy](URL one more time to maybe find some answers. But as we can see instantly, the pairings don't seem right. Mordremoth and Zhaitan are opposites, yes, but Jormag and Primordus aren't. Jormag seems to be linked to Steve, Primordus to Kralkatorrik. This seems strange. Zhaitan and Mordremoth clearly have first and foremost their primary sphere as opposite: Life and Death. Although we could argue that Kralkatorrik has Crystal, which could turn into glass by Fire or something like that, what is a greater opposite to Fire than Ice, or even Water? Perhaps we can say that Ice is opposite of Water, since it freezes the same way Ice would melt against Fire. In that sense, pairing Jormag with Steve seems plausible. And we could make a case for the Resonance of Kralkatorrik against the solidity of Primordus. In this sense, a linking of this *could* work, no doubt. However, it goes against the one thing we do know, which is the opposite of the primary sphere, of Life and Death, the one thing that we can say with 100% certainty, and the idea that the secondary spheres are not what creates the opposition. In this, Kralkatorrik and Primordus are not opposites through their primary sphere, and the basis of their opposition through their second sphere, resonance and solidity, would be the near same basis for the opposition of Steve and Jormag, being fluidity (ice) and solidity (water). Which would make sense if Zhaitan and Mordremoth had something similar, but they don't. And so, as this is a (very true) possiblity, I'm not a big fan, but thought it'd be worth mentioning anyway. -------------------------------------------------- **Steve** With that out of the way, as it turns out, the Dragon we know the least of, ends up having the most difficult secondary sphere to guess. Shocker. Fear is not remotely related enough to Resonance compared to the other pairings. However, the primary spheres of Kralkatorrik and Steve seem to be great opposites: Crystal and Water, aka solid vs fluid. Kralkatorrik's Crystal is tough, but Water erodes. Again, their first opposites match perfectly. But the second sphere of Steve is hard to find. Fear is no longer an option. We must look closely at Kralkatorrik's secondary sphere in order to find Steve's. Kralkatorrik's Resonance can be argued as both a physical object (as the shadow or body) or a more abstract one (as the mind or soul). Is it a physical resonance? Or is it abstract, untangible, as it is shared with its minions? Personally, I lean a bit more towards the physical, giving a different meaning to the word ""sharing"", but a good case for both sides could be made. However, we can agree that Resonance is perhaps the most abstract form of something physical. What we can then say is that Steve has a similar secondary sphere, one that pushes the border between physical and abstract. If Kralkatorrik's Resonance is a little more physical, Steve's sphere should be a little more abstract. Of course, if you think Kralkatorrik's sphere is a bit more abstract, than Steve's sphere should be a bit more physical. But since I personally feel Resonance to be a bit more physical (only a tiny bit though), I'll go with that. The four other spheres represent aspects of oneself. Body and Soul are seemingly the most direct, soul being your ""true"" self and body being your literal, observable self. Shadow and Mind are reflections of yourself, but both aren't really your ""true"" self. So what is ones Resonance? Sounds a little pseudo-scienceish. More importantly, what does it depict? Perhaps it is the magical imprint of a person or of an object. As it is now, I feel like I don't have enough information on either Resonance or Steve. One thing I do want to mention, though, are the [Krait Obelisks](URL made from an unknown material long ago. The shards also ""thrum"" with a *resonant energy*. Sound familiar? Exactly. No idea what to make out of it though. Could be a clue, but, again, we don't have information on this to make too much out of it. I will make a bold claim though. Since Fear felt incredibly appropriate to Steve in the first place, I will try and think of a secondary sphere for Steve that harnesses this in some way. I will try to use this theory the best I can to give arguments for it, but there is only so much I can say. I will give Steve the secondary sphere of Memories. Memories could be seen as relatively physical, especially as it could become real through hallucinations, such as we have seen with for example the Toxic Alliance, which was build in a place that housed Obelisk Shards (hey, there they are!). Similar to Resonance, it could be seen as the imprint of someone, although it is more psychological rather than magical (which could be seen as both physical or something more abstract). Through Memories, fear could still be spread (although Mordremoth could do something similar through the Mind, probably, though his hallucinations were never real up until we went into his mind, and Steve could actively recreate true fears as real manifestations through ones memory, whereas Mordremoth could all but guess at what would play on someones weakness - what didn't quite work as effectively at some point) and it can be utilised to create paranoia. This idea of facing your fear by facing your past would also be a perfect way to tie up the franchise, especially considering the direction of the plot and the main characters Problems with this are apparent, though, as it could be seen as a little *too* close to Mordremoth. And what about the [Blue Orb](URL I mean, maybe it isn't connected to Steve in any way, but if it is, why does it work the way it works? Does it induce paranoia among the Risen? Does it make them aware of the horrors they've become by showing them their past lives, granting them fear and making them flee aimlessly? Well, that would be a stretch. And if the Blue Orb worked like that, why doesn't it work like that on the Pact soldiers? And of course I've based this secondary sphere on absolutely nothing. ------------------------------------------------ **TL;DR** So those were my refinements on the Dragons. Weaknesses are mostly mentioned either in my other post (for four of the Dragons) or seem obvious (Primordus). There probably are a few things missing, or perhaps too many leaps. Again, can't say too much about Steve. If you read this far, I love you. If you skipped to the tl;dr, I understand completely. As a final summary here is the list of the Dragons and their spheres, according to my theory: * Zhaitan, Elder Dragon of Death and Shadow (weakness: cripple his army to drive him out of the shadows to take away his strength). * Mordremoth, Elder Dragon of Plants and Mind (weakness: go into his mind, as its his only vulnerability, and destroy it so he can't regrow). * Primordus, Elder Dragon of Fire and Body (weakness: crush him to death probably). * Jormag, Elder Dragon of Ice and Soul (have an immovable conviction to force your hand). * Kralkatorrik, Elder Dragon of Crystal and Resonance (use something of his own corruption, and use that resonance to kill him). * Steve, Elder Dragon of Water and Memories / Fear / Whatever batshit thing we can come up with (face your fears?). -------------------------------------------------------- Don't worry, I won't post another update on this, it'd get real boring real quick (for you guys)."

First thing I gathered was that the health bar wasn't going down fast enough, and that there was a narrow window of vulnerability where the defiance bar would be open to attack. A couple minutes in and I turn on my Mentor tag and direct more players to the fight in chat. I'm fighting like garbage and forgetting to save my CC on occasion. We haven't got the Defiance bar down once and it was beginning to look like a lost battle. However, the last 30 seconds, the tide was turning. ""We can win this"". 20 seconds left, it's health was just a chunk. 10 seconds, just a sliver. With just 3 seconds to spare, the final blow was laid. That final packet of data was the straw that broke my air cooled 4.6 GHz FX-4300's pipeline, and the game froze. I froze with it. An eternity later, the screen blackens. Suddenly glorious frames!

80,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[dT] Balance Patch 05/08 - Fractal Meta Changes,253,8kdu89,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8kdu89/dt_balance_patch_0508_fractal_meta_changes/,2018-05-19 01:03:46,"Hi everyone! We updated our website to reflect the recent balance changes introduced with the [05/08 patch](URL I'll discuss the relevant fractal meta changes and our findings below. **Link: [URL --- ## General Let's start with the changes that affected all builds. - [Empower Allies](URL (Warrior): 150 Power -&gt; 100 Power - [Pinpoint Distribution](URL (Engineer): 150 Condition Damage -&gt; 100 Condition Damage - [Assassin's Presence](URL (Revenant): 225 Ferocity -&gt; 150 Ferocity - [Spotter](URL (Ranger): 150 Precision -&gt; 100 Precision - [Frost Spirit](URL (Ranger): Previously granted a 75% chance to deal 10% bonus damage on hit, now grants a 100% chance to deal 5% bonus damage. Basically a nerf from 7.5% bonus power DPS to 5%. - [Sun Spirit](URL (Ranger): Reduced applied burning duration from 3 seconds to 2.5 seconds (Chance now 100% instead of 75% on hit, cooldown still 8 seconds, still 2 stacks applied) Overall, the nerfs result in a 6-7% DPS loss for power builds and a 3-4% DPS loss for condition builds. The changes to Spotter also led to new optimal gearsets for builds that require Assassin's items to hit 100% critical chance. While you can optimize for the presence of Spotter and use [Curry Butternut Squash Soup](URL when you don't have a Druid in your party, the main problem remains that you need different gearsets for fractals and raids due to the precision gained from the [Infinite Mist Omnipotion](URL Note that we updated our [Gear Optimizer](URL to reflect the recent changes, please use it to determine the optimal equipment for your personal agony resistance level. --- ## Mesmer - [Continuum Split](URL (Chronomancer Special Skill): Cooldown increased from 90 seconds to 105 seconds - [Signet of the Ether](URL (Healing Skill): Cooldown reduced from 35 seconds to 30 second - [Compounding Power](URL (Trait, Illusions): Bonus damage reduced from 3% to 2% per stack (max. 10%) - [Restorative Illusions](URL (Trait, Inspiration): Worse base healing, better scaling with Healing Power **Support Chronomancer** received a small nerf in form of the Continuum Split cooldown increase. The most annoying consequence for fractals is that you won't have CS ready for the defiance bar at Ensolyss with 66% health, not even for the second one if you're too fast. Apart from that, nothing really changed in terms of boon uptime - you just have to make sure not to waste internal SoIs. With the changes to Tempest Defense (Elementalist Air Trait) you will want to run the Boon/Chaos variant 99% of the time to feed your hungry Arcane Weavers. Hybrid Chronomancer remains the meta pick for groups with no Arcane Weavers and a Druid. ### Healing Variant We added a healing variant to the Boon Chronomancer guide, as more and more people are trying out the triple DPS team composition now - more on that later. As the Chaos variant really doesn't do much DPS with offensive gear either, you can think about swapping when your party has trouble with those **wonderful** random instabilities. ### DPS Chronomancer The **DPS Chronomancer** received a 5% damage nerf with the changes to Compounding Power. The buffs to Signet of the Ether and Continuum Shift result in a bit smoother rotation, as you just fit in four Phantasms-Signet-Combos in between the CS phases. Overall the build is still a decent pick in fractals with all the usual mesmer utilities, tons of CC and high Vulnerability output. #### Guides: - [Boon Chronomancer Guide](URL (Rating: Meta) - [Hybrid Chronomancer Guide](URL (Rating: Meta) - [Power Chronomancer Guide](URL (Rating: Great) --- ## Warrior - [Crushing Blow](URL (Mace 4): Now applies 15 stacks Vulnerability for 6 seconds (instead of 10 stacks for 10 seconds) plus 25% increased damage - [Tremor](URL (Mace 5): Knockdown duration increase from 2 seconds to 3 seconds With the changes to Empower Allies, the question arose whether its still worth to run Tactics instead of Discipline as a Banner Warrior. The short answer is yes - as long as your party is running a power-focused composition, it is about ~3-4k additional group DPS in fractals. ### Banner Warrior Below is a short overview of the current Banner Warrior build options: | | Enemy Boons | Traits | EA | Weapons 1 | Weapons 2 | CC | Damage | Vulnerability | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | | #1 | Yes | Disc/Spb | No | Dagger/Axe | Axe/Dagger | 250 | 93% | Medium-High | | **#2** | **Yes** | **Tact/Spb** | **Yes** | **Dagger/Axe** | **Greatsword** | **250** | **81%** | **Medium** | | **#3** | **No** | **Disc/Tact** | **Yes** | **Axe/Axe** | **Mace/Mace** | **940** | **84%** | **Medium-Very High** | | #4 | No | Disc/Tact | Yes | Axe/Axe | Greatsword | 150 | 86% | High | | #5 | No | Disc/Spb | No | Mace/Axe | Axe/Dagger | 350 | 100% | Medium-High | | #6 | No | Tact/Spb | Yes | Axe/Axe | Greatsword | 150 | 82% | High | With enemy boons present (-&gt; [Mistlock Instability: No Pain, No Gain](URL you will want to run the **Spellbreaker/Tactics Dagger+Axe/Greatsword variant (#2)** with EA. Without, the **Base Warrior variant with a secondary Mace/Mace set (#3)** shines with massive CC, EA and high damage. ### DPS Spellbreaker The **DPS Spellbreaker** build is now the best DPS build for small hitboxes, making it an excellent choice for damage dealers in fractals. It has access to high CC with mainhand Mace, Kick and Bull's Charge. Warrior is in a very good position now, nearly all Trait lines can be played with competitive but not overpowered DPS numbers. #### Guides: - [Banner Warrior Guide](URL (Rating: Meta) - [Power Spellbreaker Guide](URL (Rating: Great) --- ## Elementalist - [Meteor Shower](URL (Fire, Staff 5): Initial damage increased by 23%, damage will now decline by 10% for each subsequent hit with a minimum equal to 10% of the initial impacts damage (the diminishing return is separate per target) - [Tempest Defense](URL (Trait, Air): Reduced the damage increase from 20% to 10% against disabled foes - [Glyph of Storms](URL (Skill, Utility): Recharge time of storms is now based on player's attunement The nerf to Tempest Defense hit Air Weavers hard, making Arcane the better choice in nearly all scenarios now. Even without a Chaos Chronomancer you can give yourself quite some Vigor and Protection to strengthen Arcane's trait [Bountiful Power](URL - Air is only worth considering in fights with a near 100% broken defiance bar like Ensolyss. The Meteor Shower change led to some speculations about canceling it being better than finishing the cast or taking three conjured weapons, in reality nothing changes at all. Taking a third weapon stays niche for fights like MAMA, you might want to think about swapping Lightning Hammer with Icebow though if you have three Weavers and can't make use of the second weapon charge (e.g. Ensolyss). #### Guides: - [Power Weaver Guide](URL (Rating: Meta) --- ## Ranger - Healing of all [Celestial Avatar](URL skills reduced by 30-40% - [Grace of the Land](URL (Trait, Druid): Increased the duration of might granted by this trait from 8 seconds to 12 seconds, decreased the stacks granted from 3 to 2 - [Healing Spring](URL (Healing Skill): Conditions removed per tick increased from 1 to 2 - [Call of the Wild](URL (Warhorn 5): Reduced the durations of fury, swiftness and might granted from 15 seconds to 10 seconds. Might stacks granted increased from 3 to 6 - [Lightning Assault](URL (Wyvern Pet Special): Can't hit more than one time on the same target anymore Druid's healing output was overpowered before the patch, now it is more in line with other healing builds. In condition-heavy scenarios (-&gt; [Mistlock Instability: Afflicted](URL Healing Spring is even better now, especially if combined with [Trapper's Expertise](URL The changes to Spotter and the offensive spirits had a much higher impact, as it cripples your group's damage output even further if you insist on running a Druid instead of a third DPS character. Nonetheless Boon Druid is still the best choice if you desperately need a dedicated healer in your group. The changes to Might generation are a small buff for Fractal content, as the slower ramp-up time is compensated by pre-stacking there. Combined with the buff to Call of the Wild, Power Druid should have no problems keeping up Might - it just doesn't heal much anymore :-) Keep in mind that the fix to the Wyvern pet is a huge hit to your defiance bar damage, for the moment Iboga (meme) and Rock Gazelle (CC) are the best pet options. Jacaranda (Vulnerability) and Black/Pink Moa (CC) are the second best choices once Iboga is fixed. #### Guides: - [Boon Druid Guide](URL (Rating: Meta) - [Power Druid Guide](URL (Rating: Great) --- ## Other professions **Power Holosmith** received minuscule rifle cooldown reductions, it's still a good alternative DPS for fractals due to high CC, very high Vulnerability output and multiple Stealth options. **Power Dragonhunter** received buffs for Greatsword 3 and 5 but its damage remains behind other options. Core guardian has less utility and relies too heavily on [Unscathed Contender](URL which is difficult to maintain in fractals. The changes to **Deadeye** didn't do anything, while it's easier to generate Malice now, the problems with missing burst and general scaling still exist. Thief remains an awkward, below average DPS build. #### Guides: - [Power Holosmith Guide](URL (Rating: Great) - [Power Dragonhunter Guide](URL (Rating: Great) - [Condition Reaper Guide](URL (Rating: Good) --- ## Team Compositions With the nerfs to offensive group buffs you will want to reduce the amount of support characters in your party as much as possible. The **optimal offensive** team composition remains **Boon Chronomancer**, **Base Banner Warrior** and triple **Arcane Weaver**. This setup ensures 25x Might, Banners, EA and 9-12 boons on average with access to high CC and reflects. Vulnerability is only an issue in longer fights, if your Warrior is too lazy to watch out for missing stacks (and use [Counterblow](URL Blow](URL accordingly) you are free to run a **DPS Chronomancer**, **Holosmith** or **Dragonhunter** instead of the third Weaver for more consistency. The same applies if you are having trouble with defiance bar damage (e.g. if the Warrior has to run Spellbreaker for boon removal). If you prefer a more **defensive** group setup, the Chronomancer can swap to a healing variant providing strong burst heals, frequent condition cleanses and Regeneration. Keep in mind that fast resurrecting and rallying is the highest priority in all group content. Should the healing still not be enough for you, the Boon Druid comes to rescue. A Power Druid can remove conditions at the same speed but struggles to heal up a full party. --- ## Website We are happy to announce the conversion to **static HTML pages** with this release.

81,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Idea: Deadeye Changing how malice is spent,0,8l25u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8l25u3/idea_deadeye_changing_how_malice_is_spent/,2018-05-22 02:33:25,"I somewhat like the new changes to Deadeye is seems with the new malicious attacks it makes the older weapon sets have some kind of new synergy with malice, even as small as it is. But with builds with limited stealth access it makes it hard to spend that initiative, IE dodging with rifles for stealth is dumb not to mention repetitive as daredevil already has dodges in its rotation and it works there so why do it again. To deal with this I thought up a few ideas: * 1- Keep everything as is but change how stealth is gained as a Deadeye. Any attack that would give malice stacks grant stealth if malice is full, 10 second CD resets if malice is spent. This while not particularly helping anything with fast access to stealth (anything with offhand dagger) it helps other weapon sets like p/p, rifle, sword and shortbow get into stealth to dump malice easily. * 2- Remove the stealth requirement entirely and have a new system more like warrior adrenaline, (yes I know people want something unique but this mechanic is in the game and does work). So what happens is Deadeye marks the target and starts building malice like usual, however when the malice reaches full Deadeye's mark becomes 'Malicious Attack' (not sure how this would effect traits attached to F1 perhaps make it an F3 skill). This attack would change depending on what main hand weapon is currently equipped: * Rifle - Death's Judgement (duh) * Dagger - Malicious Stab - A backstab like attack dealing heavy damage and possibly bleeding and/or poison. * Pistol - Malicious Barrage - A rapid fire attack similar to the sneak attack stacking Bleed and Vulnerability. * Sword - Malicious Assault - Basically the thieves version of Unrelenting Assault from Revenant, quickly shadowstep around the target evading attacks while striking from multiple sides. * Shortbow - Malicious Volley - A raining aoe attack akin to Rangers Barrage, raining down arrows for AoE Bleeding and Torment. * Spear - Malicious Thrust - A charging attack where the Deadeye launches spear first into/through the enemy for high damage, evading attacks. * Harpoon Gun - Malicious Bolts - A rapid fire attack where the Deadeyte rapidly shoots bolts at the target similar to deluge, poisoning and bleeding the target."
82,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Kitty's PVE healer engineer build (aka. all dem boons!),0,8lnume,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8lnume/kittys_pve_healer_engineer_build_aka_all_dem_boons/,2018-05-24 09:09:41,"Kitty already posted about healengi half a year ago and now that it got some revamps, it's time for the updated, upgraded version. So, here's ze basic version of the build that can be modified according to encounter's requirements. URL How to play it? -Spam toolbelt skills unless you need to save a bit for stunbreak or well-timed condicleanse. -Spam mortar 5 and elixir gun 4+5 off-CD unless you need to save them a few secs for burst healing. (Don't use elixir gun 4 in tight, dangerous places like Sloth's lair or when tanking Deimos.) -Spam shield skills off-CD for protection unless you'll need them soon to block, CC, pushback or for blast finishing. -Spam med kit 2 and 5 off-CD. -Spam med kit auto-attack when everything above is on CD. -Use med kit 3 if you need to condicleanse ppls. -Place your turrets in a spot with best coverage for best boon output (near the center of the fighting stage at most bosses). -Read the modifications list below for boss-specific extras. Some examples of modifications: -If druid brings Spirit of Stone, you can replace Thumper Turret with Rifle turret for better (read: excessive) fury output. If you can trust chaos chronos to bring most of the fury, you can take Rocket Turret to provide retaliation for DHs and +1 boon count for weebers. -At Cairn, you can replace a turret with Elixir B to provide stability for no-green strat. -At Sam, you can replace a turret with Personal Battering Ram to become a heavy CC-bot. Also works for throwing in Rigom (if shield 4 isn't enough). -At Deimos, you can tank or oil-kite by replacing a turret with tool kit to block pizzas with TK 4 and mind crush with shield 5. (Extra tip: sylvaris get extra block from Grasping Vines's toolbelt skill which can also double as immob for prides) In these roles, make sure to take Power Wrench in Tools-spec to have TK 4 recharge fast enough between pizzas. -At Sloth, Matt, Deimos and Xera, you can replace a turret with Elixir R to use toolbelt skill ""Toss Elixir R"" to AoE ress groups of downed people or to safely ress an important person in dangerous area. -At Sloth, use Thumper Turret for AoE stunbreak from toolbelt skill. -At Gorseval, you can use off-hand pistol instead of shield as a makeshift entangle for the spirits. -If you need to replace both turrets with other utilities, you can take Soothing Detonation for extra heals. -If you need lots of condicleanse, you can replace Medical Dispersion Field with Anticorrosion Plating for more cleanse and you can also use Comeback Cure (instead of Backpack Regenerator) to give regen for every condicleanse. -Alchemy and Inventions are the main trait lines of healengi, but you can choose 3rd spec according to what is needed and a bit on preference. 1. Tools provides faster toolbelt skill recharges which helps at triggering Runes of Altruism more often and more regen+might from elixir gun tool belt. The selectable traits are mainly up to preference. 1-3-X gives a tiny bit of DPS while 2-1-X can be used for utility uses (like immobing stuff by equipping Elixir Gun with Streamlined Kits). You can choose Kinetic Battery to fill possible gaps in quickness for better Med Blaster heals or Adrenal Implant to evade more stuff (as healers often are good at healing others but not so much on self...curse that outgoing heals modifier) 2. Explosives give a bit more might output from blast finishing anything and a bit of damage. Also applies some vulnerability. 3. Firearms can be taken for Pinpoint Distribution but otherwise it's an useless spec for heal-engi. 4. At Sam, Holosmith is an actual option for a tiny bit of extra CC from forge 5. 5. Scrapper can be used for extra 33% direct damage mitigation with about 40% uptime from Bulwark Gyro and extra cleanses from Purge Gyro. However, taking gyros means not taking turrets which means noticeably lower boon output. Scrapper also allows ranged resses and it has some direct self-damage mitigation from barriers as well as a tiny bit of extra passive heals from Rapid Regeneration (half of which gets shared to allies with Medical Dispersion Field. So in short, Kitty would mainly recommend Tools for best boon output and self-survival thru evasions. Scrapper's the second option with in some ways better utility but slightly weaker boon output than other options. And a short FAQ about heal-engi in case previous texts didn't clarify enough. What's a heal-engineer? - It's an engineer build that heals and showers squadies with boons. It's a very versatile support build. Does it heal well? -Yes it does. One of the best healers atm actually. It shares self-heals, throws heal-fields, showers people with Med Blaster and does insane amounts of condicleanse. It's also capable of AoE ressing peoples with Elixir R's toolbelt skill with 62,5 second cooldown. (similar to necro's Transfusion and Well of Blood ress but a lot stronger) Does it boon well? -One of the best mightbot healers atm, provides various boons with turrets (a selection of might, fury, swiftness, retaliation or protection), tons of might from elixir skills, decent fury from runes of altruism (excessive fury for sub with rifle turret), lots of protection from shield skills and high swiftness+vigor+regen from med kit. But druid is better, right? -Well, offensively yes. Druid does bring some extra crit% with spotter and also unique frost and sun spirit boons. However, boonbot druid is equal or weaker when it comes to common boon output. Due to Celestial Avatar nerfs, it also has rather low heal output now which might not be an issue for skilled players, but mightn't be enough to keep some pugs alive. And druid has almost non-existent condicleanse compared to heal-engi. CC-wise heal-engi and druid are about equal. So if you really want SoF, SS and your squad does well with lesser heals, druid is obviously a better option. But if you want safety, heal-engineer is quite a viable option these days. By the way, heal-engi is a really fun and engaging build to play. Can it do any special roles? -It's excellent for them. It can flak-kite at Sab without much effect to boon output and heals (due to long ranges and radiuses), it can oil-kite easily at Deimos, it can tank ranged Deimos without moving an inch while throwing lots of boons and heals at the squad. It's also excellent for greens at VG and all those condicleanses and Elixir R's ress are lifesavers at Sloth and Matt. Kitty hasn't tested but it might also be able to push orb at KC by taking flamethrower instead of a turret. And since video examples are always nice, Kitty's recorded a few.

I'm talking about which class potentially has the highest dps when it is left alone, with no other team buffs / team boons, etc. A coordinate perfect group is ideal and all, but I would like to know which class /setup has the potential highest dps when alone so it'd be optimal even in uncoordinated type of gameplay. My first guess is probably Weaver, but I think Weaver's rotation overall is too complicated for my liking so doesn't want to dig in at all. Soulbeast and Deadeye got some pretty good dps with alot of access to self quickness/ 25 might/ fury so I'm thinking about it too. Is there any sites testing something like that, not using any outside boons and estimate the dps of each class/ each spec to its maximum potential? (Adding 25 vulnerability on the Golem is ok cuz everyone is hitting it so 25 stacks of vulnerability is pretty much a given) I hope people can share some of their thought/ testing, or link someone who tested those, be it power or condition.

84,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"Destroying the Deadeye Fantasy, Part 2: Malice",51,8mz7fg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8mz7fg/destroying_the_deadeye_fantasy_part_2_malice/,2018-05-29 23:45:25,"**TL;DR** Current Malice generation and expenditure is inefficient and cumbersome, as well as having no incentive to generate max stacks unless traited so. Consuming Malice provides no additional power using rifle than it did before the rework. Instead, Deadeye lost a significant damage modifier and some of its innate utility in exchange for a near-useless smoke field. In my first post, [Why the Deadeye rework destroyed the class fantasy](URL I discussed the changes to malice and the addition of stealth on dodge. This post will go more in depth on the changes to Malice, and how that system is both inefficient, and not as impactful as it was previously. Malice was originally passively acquired, which could be accelerated by attacking the target, and additional stacks could be generated when attacking from stealth. These stacks would influence your stolen skills, abilities, and slotted skills, amplifying damage by a % per stack or increasing the duration of effects. While this lead to some frustrating experiences in WvW, in PvE it lead to the feeling of marking your target, biding your time, and executing them with a high damage shot at the right moment. While it wasn't the most interactive gameplay, there was skill required to properly mark your target so you would hit max stacks at a key moment of vulnerability some time later. In addition to this, hitting max Malice *felt* impactful when reached, being able to pump all of that Malice-infused damage into a target through Death's Judgment. The Malice rework did away with the passive generation and continuous damage amp, instead opting for initiative consuming skills to build Malice, and stealth attacks to expend it. While a seemingly more interactive approach to the mechanic, it lost its damage ramp on all abilities, resulting in a 5-11% damage amplifier loss and boons provided by Perfectionist, and instead sought to focus Malice's power into the skills that would consume it: stealth attacks. For rifle, the focus came with no additional benefits: Death's Judgment was moved to a stealth attack, removing Cursed Bullet, while being provided no extra damage either on DJ or new utility on the skill to take its place on Kneel 4. Even without taking how new Malice worked into account, Deadeye's damage and utility had already been nerfed by providing zero compensation for using Malice with a rifle. It also made it horribly inefficient to get max malice stacks consistently, with again, no additional reason for doing so. Malice is capped at an odd number of stacks, and abilities will almost always generate two stack per use (one for the attack, and one when it crits, which with Deadeye, should always happen). This poses a problem: spend additional time and initiative executing an additional ability to achieve max stacks (wasting a stack of generated malice), or expend the stacks without reaching the malice cap. Either way, there would be waste present in the Deadeye rotation and a buff largely ignored, neither of which would be something that a desert hardened mercenary would do. More importantly, the rework to turn Malice into a 'pump and dump' system created a mechanic that need not be actively thought about while using. The rework provided no additional incentive to achieve max stacks, leaving the mechanic to be something of an afterthought. Where as before, you had to be conscious of when Perfectionist would proc (as it would only occur once every 20-25 seconds), the new rework pumps and dumps Malice so quickly that there is not enough time to feel like Malice has become an important buff, because unless you have Maleficent Seven, there is no good reason to acquire max stacks except to add an additional 20% damage to one attack. While for WvW, it provided a frustrating experience for Deadeye's to one shot people from stealth unawares, but from a thematic standpoint, *that is how it should be able to be played*. In any game mode, a Deadeye should be able to select its target, and be able to wait for the opportunity to strike. The rework of Malice removed that possibility, as utilizing the profession mechanic forces one to reveal itself to the target, gun blazing, to utilize the reason to trait a thief into Deadeye."

The eles used triple conjure everywhere to get high burst in each phase of the bosses. Especially at Siax and Ensolyss this worked really well, at MAMA however rotations have to be slightly more improvised sometimes. MAMA: Since we did not have a Holosmith / Guardian / Druid, the eles had to help with cc at some breakbars. We decided to run arcane simply so that the phase from 75 to 50% was slightly faster. In casual runs however, air remains the optimal choice. Siax: To provide 25 stacks of vulnerability in every phase, the eles split their glyph of storms. That way we had one glyph at the start of every phase. We were the air traitline as siax has the stunned buff for a huge portion of the fight, making the extra 10% dps gain from Tempest Defense really good.

86,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Herald Rework: More Diversity and Power,7,8o3h3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8o3h3u/herald_rework_more_diversity_and_power/,2018-06-03 06:46:39,"Ever since Heart of Thorns came out, I have played a lot of Revenant. I'll admit I was sucked in by the flashy animations (I like pretty things okay) and lore of the class, but now I play it for the unique gameplay it provides (and okay, yeah, still the pretty animations) However, the Herald elite specialization has always irked me in a few different ways. Countless balance patches have come and gone and I keep sitting quietly waiting for changes to come but sadly they never do, so I took it upon myself to lay out a few changes that would make Herald builds have more choice and buff up its power DPS a bit. Before I begin, **this was done with only PvE in mind** and so any potential PvP or WvW ramifications of these changes have not been considered. Also, this was mostly for fun and flavor, so don't take the specific numbers of anything that seriously. Anyways, let's begin! **Traits** **Herald** The Herald specialization has a few issues with identity and clunkiness. Despite being centered around boons and defense through its shield, it lacks traits that reflect that accurately. Most of the time, builds will take Elders Force regardless of if they are looking to support, be a DPS role, or want extra defense simply because the other two options are lackluster and functionally uninteresting. Soothing Bastion in theory would be the choice for players looking for added boon support, however the Crystal Hibernation that you are forced into by this trait locks you out of actions at critical moments. Further, the increase of boon duration by 2 seconds (which extends duration of current boons, not increasing duration of future applications) is also a strange mechanical choice. Enhanced Bulwark may be useful in some CC heavy situations, but is incredibly weak for a grandmaster trait. I chose to slightly buff Elders Force to aid DPS builds, but mainly focused on making Soothing Bastion and Enhanced Bulwark more interesting and viable choices when looking to fill a role other than DPS. **Major Masters:** *Bolster Fortifications* * Currently: grant 2 seconds of protection to nearby allies when using a heal skill * Rework to: increase protection duration to 2 and  seconds *Shared Empowerment* * Currently: grant 1 stack of might for 8 seconds to allies when you apply a boon to them (1 second cooldown) * Rework to: Increase might duration to 10 seconds **Major Grandmasters:** *Elders Force* * Currently: +2% damage per boon on you * Rework to: +3% damage per boon on you *Soothing Bastion* * Currently: activate Crystal Hibernation when struck below 25% health, shield skills increase duration of boons on allies by 2 seconds * Rework to: reduce recharge of shield skills by 20%, gain +200 concentration. Shield skills cleanse 1 condition from nearby allies. *Enhanced Bulwark* * Currently: gain an extra stack of stability (5 seconds) when stability is applied to you (1 second cooldown) * Rework to: Leave old effect but also gain barrier when stability is applied to you. Increase cooldown to 2 seconds and stability duration to 6 seconds. * Bonus: give it its own icon, currently shares one with Crystal Harbinger. **Invocation** **Adept Masters** *Forceful Persistence* * Currently: 7% Increased damage while an upkeep skill is active, 2% for Herald facets. Herald facet buff stacks. * Rework to: Increase Herald facet damage increase to 3%. **Utility Skills** The biggest change in here is towards Facet of Strength, which sadly cannot maintain much might even with 100% might duration and Shared Empowerment. Also, the active skills that you can use after placing a facet on yourself are lackluster and boring sometimes, so I sought a few tweaks on those as well. *Facet of Strength* * Currently: grant 1 stack of might for 12 seconds to nearby allies every 3 seconds. 2 upkeep cost * Rework to: change might application to 2 stacks of might for 10 seconds. Increase upkeep cost to 3. *Burst of Strength* * Currently: strikes foes twice, inflicting 10 stacks of vulnerability for 6 seconds and dealing damage. 15 second cooldown * Rework to: Increase damage of strikes slightly and have each strike inflict 2 seconds of weakness on struck foes. *Gaze of Darkness* * Currently: Reveal and blind enemies around you. Breaks stun. 20 second cooldown. * Rework to: Reduce cooldown to 15 seconds. Also inflict 3 seconds of crippled on affected foes. *Impossible Odds* * Currently: Your attacks inflict an additional strike and you gain superspeed each second. 10 energy cost + 8 upkeep cost * Rework to: Reduce energy cost to 5. **Weapon Skills** **Shield** With the changes to Soothing Bastion meaning it would no longer give the player additional Crystal Hibernation usage, I gave the shield skill a bit of a buff. Envoy of Exuberance seems to work quite well as currently implemented and the extra condition cleanse given by selecting Soothing Bastion already increases its effectiveness, so I left it as is. *Crystal Hibernation* * Currently: channel a shield, blocking attacks and doing 4 pulses of healing to yourself. 20 energy cost, 25 second cooldown, 3 second cast * Rework to: Reduce energy cost to 15, cleanse a condition with each pulse.

Our Weavers went Air for Skorvald due to the boss being perma-broken from 100-0, blasts (Arcane Brilliance) and Phalanx Strength (PS) were taken for Might uptime. Vulnerability wasn't an issue with Lightning Storm being ready each phase. On Artsariiv we actually ignore all three Anomalies, nuking the boss before the 1st doom goes off, using the Mistlock Singularity for the 2nd one and having the 3rd doomed person do `/gg`. For Arkk our Weavers were precasting on the platform while the Warrior activated the boss, resulting in a slightly faster start.

Ensolyss is actually a record time, we used triple Arcane Weaver and CC'ed immediately at 100% to force a bubble afterwards - which is better than him charging across the platform if you break it slowly.

The run is obviously a record time, though it can easily be improved as well without a Norn, Last Laugh, a better first rooftop-Sandbinder and proper Amala DPS. Nevertheless it shows all the various skips and should be a good starting point for the future. Again we took a Holosmith for the Vulnerability after each phase transition and smaller hitboxes. We're not 100% sure about Norn being the reason the Warrior can't move when we `/gg` at the first Amala, though he got it every time and noone else did. An additional test on another Norn had the same result. Didn't test Charr though. The entire run took us 6m 50s. Note that Amala takes double the time of the longest CM boss.

[SC] (and [up]) are in the same situation with one Fractal God per group, though the current status is not really satisfying - how should we define the ruleset for fractal records? Since some [SC] members are in [dT] as well, we started talking and came to the conclusion that we should allow **Strength boosters** for the **augment levels 1 and 2** in future record runs to compensate for Fractal God. | Mist Attunement | Strength Booster allowed | Total bonus damage | | -- | -- | -- | | Fractal Savant - Level 1 (+1%) | **Yes** | 6% | | Fractal Prodigy - Level 2 (+2%) | **Yes** | 7% | | Fractal Champion - Level 3 (+4%) | No | 4% | | Fractal God - Level 4 (+7%) | No | 7% | We're aware that this is not an ideal solution either, but it brings the modifiers closer together until Anet gives us an option to disable augments for record runs.

88,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Normalizing (unique) Buffs - A way to break the META mold,0,8oa6xr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8oa6xr/normalizing_unique_buffs_a_way_to_break_the_meta/,2018-06-04 03:38:13,"*TL;DR at the bottom* For over 2,5 years now (In Raids at least), the holy trinity of Druid, Warrior and Chronomancer has dominated the META level in PvE. Many threads have discussed this topic in the past with the same conclusion: It is not that other classes do not work for the content or are unable to do the content at all but there is little to no reason to play them in favor of the ""big three"". My Goal in this thread is not to make these classes useless but to offer a wider variety of choice for the endgame PvE experience. ***Reminder:*** This thread will focus on Ranger and Warrior. Chronomancer and its supremacy in PvE is another issue altogether and one I am afraid is not that easily solved, at least not in this thread. ____________________________________ So what is this about you might ask? Currently, Ranger's Spirits and Warrior's Banners are powerful tools for PvE Content, too powerful, in fact. There is no denying that the availability of their auras has a noticeable impact on the group/squad DPS. This leads to the problem that Warriors are often reduced to mere ""Banner Sluts"" (as the community named them after the change from 5 to 10 targets) and other healers, even if their heal output and support capability beat Druid in certain areas, cannot compete with spotter and spirits. I present a solution to this which I recall was at least mentioned before: **Normalize the auras** The outcome would be that we would not ask for spirits and banners but now could ask for buffs. This would require a redesign of these skills *and* making them unique. Furthermore, and I know this request may sound strange, add Necromancer's Minions to the mix as well to both increase their support power as well as spreading out the availability of these buffs. Now, numbers are the biggest problem here. Just looking at two of the ""offensive"" buff options we have: _________________ &gt;[Frostspirit](URL &gt; + 100% chance to grant +5% bonus damage on hit &gt; + grants might with [Nature's Vengeance]( URL around the spirit _________________ &gt;[Banner of Strength]( URL &gt; + +170 Power and Condition Damage &gt; + grants regeneration with [Inspiring Battle Standard](URL and increases the effect for the Warrior by 50% ______________________ Now to unite these buffs: **Frost Spirit/Banner of Strength** + 200 Power and Condition Damage + 3 stacks of Might every three seconds (when traited) ___________________________ The +30 in stats would hardly offset the loss of 5% bonus damage applied via Frost Spirit before this change but would allow one of the two (Ranger or Warrior) to forgo the corresponding skill for another, better suited skill. If a Warrior can grant these buffs you won't need a Druid for them and now you would be able to take another Healer/Supporter for specific fights or keep the Druid so You may can drop the Warrior banners for better skill or ~~stack yet another Necro for your epi bouncing shenanigans~~ ***ahem***. This is where the Necromancer comes into play: The class has quite the identity crisis. It lacks proper DPS builds, its support is *lackluster* and its biggest strength is being stackable for Epidemic bouncing, certainly a mechanic worth discussing in another Thread. Currently, Minions lack utility. We all know the Minionmaster builds but they are hardly competitive in any gamemode besides the odd meme in PvP. Only Blood Fiend and Flesh Golem see any sort of play besides taking Shadow Fiend for DPS and lifeforce generation. Adding these unique buffs to Minios would both make a Minionmancer support build interesting as well as adding identity as a support for the class. Meanwhile, all three classes (Ranger, Warrior and Necromancer) would keep flavour for their skills. + Spirits have the shortest cooldown between set ups and have helpful ""explodes"" but can be damaged and are otherwise stationary. + Banners have the longest cooldown between set ups and are completely invulnerable but need to be picked up for repositioning (DPS loss). + Minions follow the Necromancer around and add personal DPS as well as helpful ""sacrifice"" effects but are easily slain by AoE attacks. to keep this long post a bit shorter I will just list the buffs and corresponding skills: _______________ ***Frost/Strength/Bone Fiend*** + +200 Power and Condition Damage + Grants 3 stacks of Might every three seconds (when traited) ***Sun/Discipline/Bone Minion(s)*** + +200 Precision and 150 Ferocity*** + 100% chance to inflict burning (8 seconds recharge) + Grants 1 second of Vigor every three seconds (when traited) ***Stone/Defense/Flesh Worm*** + +150 Vitality and Toughness + Grants 1 second of Protection every three seconds (when traited) ***Air/Tactics/Shadow Fiend*** + +150 Healing Power and Concentration + 100% chance to apply vulnerability on hit + Grants 3 seconds of Swiftness every 3 seconds (when traited) All these buffs would be ***unique*** and impossible to stack with one another. &gt;I.E. No Frost, Strength and Bone for +9 might every three seconds but Frost, Discipline and Flesh Worm would each grant their buff to the squad. ***Attention:*** *I do not wish to change the heal skills (Blood Fiend and Water Spirit) as well as the elite version of these skills (Warbanner, Nature's Spirit and Flesh Golem). Similarly, these numbers are just an example of what they could look like.* _________________________ Keep in mind that a change like this would require rebalancing certain traits for all three classes I am aware that normalizing and opening up these buffs could certainly lead to a mastercomp to beat all others (and having all four effects active all the time is another thing in itself) but the current state of the PvE endgame is less than ideal for the longest time now. __________________ ***TL;DR:*** + Normalize Buffs of Spirits and Banners + give these auras to Necromancer Minions to increase class diversity in raids. + ***M i n i o n M a n c e r S u p p o r t*** "

91,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Revenant player? Whats your build coming for SPvP?,0,8qn8pl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8qn8pl/revenant_player_whats_your_build_coming_for_spvp/,2018-06-13 08:22:45,"Hey guys, so I've been playing Revenant in the preseason and struggling. I love the class and the in combat mobility with S/S 5, and Legendary Assassin 8 skills. I like the CC provided by the staff 5 and Legendary Dragon 0 Knockbacks. I like how I can heal, buff, and support my allies while I have the ability to stack vulnerability and dish out burst in short windows. This build is called Power Shiro build, and I'm struggling to find footing. I deal about 200K damage and have 200K heals per game which usually means I top heals depending on our cheesed comp. What build do you run? What's your success so far? I do best against Elementalists, Rangers, and some guardians."
92,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Call of the Deep - Theorycrafting an underwater expansion,81,8g4e3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8g4e3s/call_of_the_deep_theorycrafting_an_underwater/,2018-05-01 10:36:35,"So, back on April Fools day, [this page](URL appeared, linked on the main Anet/gw2 site. This captured my attention because I've always liked the thought of aquatic content. However, I think we all know that aquatic combat needs a weapons-grade rework before it will be viable for endgame PvE content (let alone any content at all). I also know based on [this post](URL that this is likely a divisive topic. Presumably, such an expansion would include aquatic elite specs in addition to a combat rework and a new mastery line and story. Here's my take. Full disclosure, I've played 6/9 of the professions so my knowledge of thief, engi, and guardian is nonexistent and my knowledge of warrior is lacking. I make no claims that this is 'balanced' but I wanted to give a feel for how it might play. Tl;dr - I got bored and had some ideas about underwater combat. Thought it might be fun to see the idea through even though I know it will never come to anything. **Story** &gt; The roar of the sea dragon has awoken the domain of the deep. The old magics have been banished form the waters. With the other dragons dead of sleeping, rogue storms of [Bubbles'] magic threaten all of Tyria. Now that we have learned how to isolate each dragon's magic, we move under the waves to finally seal each one away. **Mechanics** * Each class can access a new aquatic elite spec * Old elite specs are not accessible while submerged until the correct masteries have been gained (more info later) * Hero tab now shows 4 lines, 4th is aquatic elite spec. 4th line is active submerged, 3 line is active on land. * New aquatic 2 hand weapon type discovered - ""Singularity"" (think 2 hand focus) * Underwater movement slightly simplified: Hotkey(default is TAB)+W/S rapidly changes depth up/down (after mastery is leveled) *Underwater combat reworked* * All AoE spells with selectable target now snap to targets. (previously, all spells were automatically targeted at the default target) * Combo field mechanic extended to aquatic combat by 'Imbuements': New boon bar above existing UI. Each type of combo field now charges allies and enemies with energy known as as imbuement. * Spells now imbue targets in their AoE with the appropriate type of magic (think - if you would be standing in a combo field on the ground, you will be imbued by the spell. Fire combo field = fire imbuement, etc.) * Can target AoE damage spells on allies to center the effect there. Does not damage allies. * Blast finishers used *on* an imbued target cause AoE conditions * Projectile finishers used *by* an imbued character cause single target conditions * Spin/Leap finishers used *by an imbued character cause AoE boons * Heal blast finishers used *on* an imbued target cause AoE boons **Masteries** *Combat* * Gain access to aquatic elite specs [1 point] * Gain the ability to use non-aquatic (elite) spec in third row while standing on the sea floor * Gain the ability to briefly (e.g. for 20 sec every 2 min) use non-aquatic (elite) spec in third row while swimming [depth changing disabled for duration, either by hotkey or camera movement) * Gain the ability to choose/use 'legacy' aquatic abilities in open world PvE only * Gain the ability to use aquatic elite specs on land *Movement* * Gain the ability to float/sink at will [1 point] * Increase the speed of float/sink ability * Gain the ability to ride underwater currents (think, thermal tubes) *Mounts* (player becomes the mount, rather than riding) * Adapt the raptor for aquatic travel (Shark Mount available - dash forward in the direction of motion) * Adapt the springer for aquatic travel (Sea Turtle available - change depth up/down VERY rapidly) * Adapt the jackal for aquatic travel (Dolphin Mount available - same as jackal ability, but with bubbles) * Adapt the ... skimmer for aquatic travel? (Skimmer mount available on the surface has speed GREATLY increased over deep water) * Adapt the griffon for aquatic travel (Sailfish/marlin mount available - charge to build up sustained speed) **Elite Specs** *Necromancer - Wight: Spear/Singularity* &gt; The necromancers of the south sea have learned how to become one with the waves and call on the power locked in the sunken depths. Calling on the singularity allows the Wight to connect their Life Force to the water and access three new shroud forms. * Steam shroud - become an AoE that applies dps/burning to enemies; might/alacrity to allies; fire imbuement to all * Aqua shroud - become an AoE that applies vulnerability/poison to enemies; heal/regen to allies; water imbuement to all * Ice shroud - become an AoE that applies chill/dps to enemies; protection/retaliation to allies; ice imbuement to all Utility skills are Forces *Mesmer - Siren: Trident/Singularity* &gt; Peering into the singularity of dragon magic, the Mesmer finds ... music? The Siren can now harnes acoustic energies to project its power in even the darkest corners of the deep. * Clones and Phantasms are now both replaced by Projections. Limit of 3 removed, but projections are randomply placed in the water and stationary. Continuum split replaced by the ability to jump to a target projection and shatter it causing dmg/boons/condis Utility skills are Songs *Elementalist - Survivor: Trident/Singularity* &gt; The first elementalists into the water found their connections to the four traditional elements drowned by a call to the water. Though they retain the ability to surge their elements, the survivor unleashes the rage of the water to great effect. * Weapon swapping now permitted * Only weapon skill 5 changes element on attune swap * Swapping attunement powers up water weapon spells for a time. * Fire - burning, bonus condition damage * Water - bonus damage (unique boon), lifesteal * Air - ministun, quickness * Earth - bleed, expertise Utility skills are Outbursts *Ranger - Predator: Spear/Harpoon Gun* &gt; Although rangers have always had the ability to bond with the beasts around them, the raging water only amplified their calls. The Predator commands many creatures at once, multiplying their abilities and swarming all who could stand in their way. There's safety in numbers. * Now travels with 3 pets out, with the ability to swap to a separate group of 3 or to cycle through (1 out 1 in). * Can use &gt;1 of the same animal, only need to tame a single juvenile * New pet commands for simultaneous/sequential attack * Bonuses to weapon skills when more than one of the same animal is currently out, depending on animal. Utility skills are Calls *Thief - Corsair: Harpoon Gun/Singularity* &gt; Thievery on the high seas is quite a bit different from your run of the mill crime. Thieves on the water have banded together into bands of roving pirates. Unwilling to give up on being every bit as slippery as they were on land, corsairs trained in the art of evasion for so long, they can now share their dodges with friends. * Skill F1 replaced with taunt. Enemies in a fairly large AoE will aggro on the player. * Each time F1 is used on the same enemy (as long as 1 of the taunted enemies survives between casts), gain toughness, stability, and a charge on F2/F3/F4 * F2 - Sleight, gain dodge frames while stationary, restore 1 dodge-worth of endurance, dark imbue self * F3 - Ink bomb, dark imbue AoE, give dodge frames to allies in AoE (not self) * F4 - Drink up! - Take one down, pass it around; spread buffs to allies (including self) Utility skills are Piracy *Engineer - Salvager: Trident/Harpoon Gun* &gt; Long before the engineer made it to the ocean, mariners were plying the saves, and resting beneath it with untold riches. Then the salvagers came around to give it a second life - preferably ending the lives of their enemies, but having a bit of fun while theyre at it isnt exactly a drawback. * Bomb kit becomes torpedo kit * All weapon skills now generate Salvaged Parts tracked on the UI * Gain access to new abilities:Augment, Fortify, Demolish * Augment spends a small number of parts to boost the effectiveness of the next utility skill used * Fortify spends a medium number of parts to spawn an automaton that shields the player (shown as non-decaying barrier on health), and shares a random AoE boon for every damage instance - cannot be healed, does not stack with barrier * Demolish spends all parts currently held to do direct damage to the target enemy based on the number of parts Utility skills are Torpedoes *Warrior - Maelstrom: Spear/Trident* &gt; During the first few battles for control of the water, the warriors found that their adrenaline had been corrupted, the sea dragons fury speaks to them and flows inside of them. It calls to be unleashed upon their foes. * Adrenaline bar now has 5 levels. Adrenaline to fill each level: 10/20/30/40/50 * Effect of F2 changes based on number of bars filled * Level 1 - Call the dragons magic and gain quickness * Level 2 - The dragons roar dazes your enemy * Level 3 - Spread the corruption to allies - unique damage/condi increase buff * Level 4 - Charge your weapon with magic - adrenaline fills more quickly for a short time * Level 5 - The dragon consumes you - The following effects exist until you go below 30 adrenaline - F2 becomes Vent Magic, adrenaline no longer generates, F1 bust becomes Release regardless of equipped weapon. * Vent magic consumes 10 adrenaline, creates a whirlpool at the enemys location. Each one imbues a random element while a unit stands in it (disappears if the unit leaves the AoE). * Release triggers a burst finisher centered on each whirlpool, and does direct damage to the enemy based on the number of AoEs it is in. Utilities are Channels *Revenant - Admiral: Spear/Trident* &gt; In order to gain mastery of the ocean, the revenant summoned forth the legendary admiral ______ from the mists. Unfortunately, the Admiral came with a friend - The soul of the legendary leviathan known as the Tooth of [Bubbles] was intertwined with her preys. Now merged with the leviathan, the revenant must resist the growing madness. * Can no longer channel legends other than the Admiral and Leviathan * Channeling the leviathan creates a control meter above the profession energy that starts at 100% * Every leviathan utility skill drains the control meter, if it reaches 0 prior to channeling the Admiral once again, Automatically channel Enraged Leviathan - gain quickness, alacrity, all weapon skills gain increased effectiveness. Also received unpurgeable confusion, torment, and burning for the duration. * During Enraged leviathan, the control meter slowly increases, utility skills decrease the meter. * Channel Legendary Admiral becomes available at 25% control. * Cooldown of Channel Leviathan is shortened if you swap to Admiral with higher % control. Utility skills are based on the legend you are channeling. *Guardian - Cartographer: Spear/singularity* &gt; Between virtues and tomes, those who have taken on the guardian profession have always had an affinity for knowledge. It came as little surprise, then, that the guardians naturally took to mapping the alien shores and the secrets hidden beneath them. Thus emerged the cartographer. * Virtues become Cartographers virtues, passives remain the same, active imbues self and target * Research Justice - Imbue self and target Light and Fire * Research Resolve - Imbue self and target Stone and Water * Research Courage - Imbue self and target Lightning and Ice * New abilities F4 and F5 * F4 - Record of Virtue - Remove all imbuements on self and store them on a magical map * F5 - Record of Vice - Remove all imbuements on target and store them on a magical map * After using F4 or F5 to record, it becomes Proclaim - target a unit, deal damage/conditions to enemies and healing/boons to allies in the AoE based on the number/type of imbuements stored on the map Utility skills are Studies "

Health Insurance trait in Alchemy has a flat 10% outgoing healing effectiveness and when you equip Medkit, you receive another 10% outgoing heal. Med Kit: This kit has been reworked: Med Blaster: Increased the healing-power multiplier by 500% on the blaster's base heal. Increased the healing-power multiplier by 80% on its heals per boon. Base healing has been decreased by 33%. Throw Bandages: This skill has been replaced with Bandage Blast, which fires 5 bandages in an arc ahead of the player, healing and granting regeneration to any allies they strike. Throw Stimulant: This skill has been replaced with Cleansing Field, which creates a temporary water combo field and removes conditions every second that allies are within the field. Throw Accelerant: This skill has been replaced with Vital Burst, which heals allies in an area around the player.

Med4 is a good burst heal in the case of like getting hit by green (Doing No Greens on VG). Med5 which is a targeting skill that tosses a bomb which is a combo blast finisher along with some nifty boons.

Illusions are are summoned as normal, but are shattered as sacrifices to bestow greater power to the mesmer. Traits that modify Shatter skills, such as Rending Shatter or Maim the Disillusioned, continue to work as normal, but also affect the caster, and at a shorter duration. This forces the player to choose wisely which shatter to use and when, and also effectively making the mesmer a sort of Corruption Necromancer. Each Shatter works as normal, yet the effects are based on the player's current health, rather than the number of summoned illusions. The lower the heathpool, the lower the damage. (Think of the Warlock's health as a Necromancer's Life Force.) A fifth Shatter skill is added and titled Warlock's Wish, and is treated like a Shroud itself, but Illusions cannot be summoned and non-weapon skills cannot be used. It will grant 25 seconds of Retaliation, Regeneration, and also heal the Warlock a small amount with every successful attack, and will also have a heavy cooldown. Corruption skills are as follows: heal skill fully heals but immobilizes the player for a few seconds, elite skill transfers any and all conditions to a target but self-inflicts Vulnerability and Slow. Corruption Utility skills: AoE fear(2s) and Confusion (3 stacks, 8s) and self-inflict Confusion/ Illusions are invulnerable for 10 seconds and inflict Vulnerability on targets (5 stacks) - self-inflict Warlock with Poison/ AoE Might and Fury and self-inflict Weakness/ Enemy boons are converted to conditions and self-inflict Cripple/ Create a field that inflicts Weakness and Chills enemies while granting Swiftness to allies. Dagger skills: Auto-attack deals moderate damage and 1 stack of bleeding/ Skill 2: Summon a phantasm that inflicts Poison and Slow on enemies/ Skill 3: Throw your dagger at a target to inflict Cripple and Poison. Spec traits: Adept 1. Gain access to main-hand daggers and the use of Corruption skills. (1) Distortion revives up to 3 nearby allies. (2) Dagger skills have reduced recharge when above the health threshold (75%), and grant Swiftness when used (6s). (3) Take less damage from Poisoned foes. Master 2. Illusions siphon health from enemies and transfer it to you. (1) Gain Protection (4s) when you summon a Phantasm. (2) Reduced recharge on Corruption skills while wielding a dagger. (3) Diversion inflicts Cripple and grants Resistance. Grandmaster 3. Increases critical-hit chance for each condition on your foe. Gain Toughness based on your Precision. (1) Gain additional Toughness and Healing Power for each summoned Illusion. Illusions spawn with Might. (2) A percentage of your condition damage heals you. While Warlock's Wish is active it prevents incoming healing from other sources, yet the boons it grants have increased durations (additional 10s, up to 35s total). (3) Inflict Confusion and Torment (both 6s) when below the health threshold (50%), and refresh all Shatter skills (Trait has 20s cooldown). I drank a ton of coffee while coming up with this. If you can help me improve it, I will be extremely thankful. Be gentle with your criticisms. "

What builds will we use?"" ""Uhm.. play core Guardian?"" Dear Arenanet Team, 1. **_Stop. Nerfing. Every. Build. You. Make. Us. Pay. For._** 2. Stop trying to revive skills that nobody uses. You are tuning down damage and jacking up defence overall. 3. Players are not raid bosses: the theory of less damage= longer fights= more people in-game for a longer time= more selling power at shareholder meetings is missing one little point: players are **_living beings_** that have a limit in how long they can carry a fight. Unless profoundly patient and skilled to an insane level. I want to meet those guys, if they exist. Teach me, _Si-Fu_! 8. DEBUG every new thing you put out there BEFORE you launch it. I had to start restart restart restart restart restart -you like this repetition? No? It's what your update has been giving me, enjoy: restart, restart, restart,.. 9. DEBUG the BASE CODE and UPGRADE YOUR SERVER SPEED AND CAPACITY INSTEAD OF THROWING OUT NEW MAPS TO APPEASE THE GODS OF BOREDOM. 10. Tyria proper is DYING. I haven't touched the original maps in forever, and only to farm. You have made your own startup promise nightmares come true. 11. _**Invest in WvW**_. If you have servers strong and fast enough to carry WvW full squad fights with all the tinsel costumes in full glitter, you can carry everything and everyone else. 12. I am never buying another expansion again, unless the story is insanely good and people are crying or laughing their hearts out, and that only up to whatever blockbuster movie ticket costs. You will only nerf the builds in less than six months of their release. 13. Oh, and don't stream WvW in public unless you want to be wiped. You throw out something new, and, people, being powerfully imaginative and opportunistic beings, find ways to use them to the maximum, which goes beyond what your team draughted in their meeting rooms. 'Noo!' you say. 'Let's make life more interesting by making fights last longer.' Er, note: an opposing player is not a raid boss. Patience and life schedules can only carry so much, and short, sharp fights are no less interesting a lesson in the way of the Tyrian. If your idea is to keep people playing by making fights longer via decreasing damage, I will play less because it is more of a _grind_. Without the lusciousness. Unless I am out scouting and need to troll other players by keeping them busy 1vs5.

99,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Open World PVE Builds - March 2018,409,889tv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/889tv3/open_world_pve_builds_march_2018/,2018-03-30 23:03:53,"First and foremost I would like to thank the Reddit community for their continued support, interest and feedback for the PvE Open World Builds as it has been truly inspirational. My last update was back in [December 2017](URL and I will continue to cover the Professions from the Core Game, HoT and PoF focusing on Power, Condition and Hybrid builds (where possible) with stat choices for gear presuming that you have access to all previous content. **Note:** The /u/gayest_charr_ever continues to provide some great power build options (including rotation examples) for open world pve that you can find out more about [here](URL WARNING: Wall of text ahead! **Build Criteria** I have decided to try a slightly different format this time, so please do let me know if you like it or if you prefer the original. Enjoy! **Boons** * Might + Fury - Every build provides its own Might and Fury (where possible) so that it is self sufficient through Sigils, Runes, Traits and Consumables. * Swiftness / Mobility skills for smoother transition in / out of combat are referred to within each profession. The Sigil of Speed and Sigil of Agility are also worthwhile considerations for those that are interested. **Conditions** * Vulnerability - Most of the builds now provide most, if not all of their own Vulnerability. * Weakness - This has been included where possible to help with survivability. **Stats** * Power - Berserker / Marauder with Runes of Strength and Sigils of Strength + Force * Conditions - Sinister / Viper / Trailblazer with Runes of the Aristocracy and Sigils of Strength + Bursting **Sigils** * Sigils of Bloodlust can be used in place of / cheaper option for Sigils of Force. * Sigils of Corruption can be used in place of / cheaper option for Sigils of Bursting. **Crowd Control (CC)** The only time an enemy with a break bar is susceptible to crowd control skills is when the break bar is a teal colour. Any other time and control effects will have no effect and simply be wasted. * Soft Crowd Control Effects are: Fear, Taunt, Immobile, Slow, Chill, Blind, Weakness, Crippled provide Damage Over Time (D.O.T.) to the Defiance Bar. * Hard Crowd Control Effects are: Daze, Stun, Knockback, Knockdown, Pull, Float, Sink and inflict damage directly to the Defiance Bar. Hard CC is the go to choice for bosses that only have a small window of opportunity. For more information check out the Wiki pages for [Control Effects](URL and [Defiance Bars](URL **Consumables** There is no requirement to use Consumables as all builds work effectively enough without them and have been included for completeness. For a full list please take a look at the [wiki page](URL * Fried Golden Dumplings can be replaced with Plate of Roasted Cactus (better suits strong Crit Dmg profs like Ele or Thief). * Bowl of Sweet and Spicy Butternut Squash Soup can be replaced with any other Power Food like Plate of Truffle Steak or Plate of Steak and Asparagus. * Rare Veggie Pizza can be swapped for Koi Cakes, Super Veggie Pizza, Garlic and Kale Sautee or Red-Lentil Saobosa. * Bowl of Fire Meat Chilli can be changed for Bowl of Spicy Meat Chilli. * Dragon's Breath Bun is a cheap alternative to Plate of Truffle Steak Dinner and Plate of Steak and Asparagus Dinner * With Utility foods like Stones, Oils or Crystals: * Maintenance Oil can be replaced with Peppermint Oil. * Focusing Crystals can be replaced with a Tuning Icicle. * Sharpening Stones can be replaced with a Tin of Fruitcake. *** ###ELEMENTALIST### *** &gt; Swiftness / Movement Skills &gt; * Attuned to Air - Zephyr's Speed (Minor Air Trait) provides a 25% movement speed increase. &gt; * Attuned to Air - Heal: Glyph of Elemental Harmony + Trait: Inscription (Maj Air) &gt; * Attuned to Air - Staff 5 - Static Field + Heal: Arcane Brilliance / Arcane Wave &gt; * Signet of Air for a 25% bonus to movement speed. &gt; * Staff 4 - Windbourne Speed &gt; * Lightning Flash &gt; * Tempest - Speedy Conduit Trait grants Swiftness on Overloads. &gt; * Weaver - Sword 2: Fire - Flame Uprising / Air - Polaric Leap *** [Power Staff DPS Fire + Air](URL Start in Air to make use of Lightning Storm from Glyph of Storms before switching to Fire.

100,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Question on PvE dps requirements.,0,8ay5e1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8ay5e1/question_on_pve_dps_requirements/,2018-04-09 22:48:31,"So recently I switched classes to be a bit more useful damage wise in pve. I am currently playing s/d weaver and been mostly learning what skills do what in pvp. I never had been to the aerodome before yesterday and when I when I was getting about 12k/dps average without any buffs boons or vulnerability. When I added everything I was getting average about 33k dps. I don't quite understand, are the bench marks done with all the buffs on? If so why? this seems super unrealistic does it not? I haven't had any experience in raids mostly just fractals. up to t3."
101,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Necromancer Elite spec Idea: The demonologist/occultist,0,8b1idf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8b1idf/necromancer_elite_spec_idea_the/,2018-04-10 06:04:45,"The basic Idea behind this spec would be to remove the necromancers current minions from the game and bring them back as an entire spec; Focusing on dark spells which not only make the user lean toward a demonic power but as well offer a small army of their own to control. The user would be pulling power right out of the realm of torment/the underworld and using the dark forces of both to decimate foes. Weapon: Main hand focus Basics of the spec: Summon demons from the realm of torment to aid in your fight against your enemies, or harness the dark powers of the realms of darkness as your own personal play thing and devour the souls of your enemies. Skills for the Main hand focus: skill 1: Baleful Slash Baleful slash is a four part attack which lashes out with dark claws and fangs to rip and tear at your enemies, Each struck applies vulnerability and climbs in speed as the user continues too attack. The attack speed of this basic attack should be quick and easily maintainable. Skill 2: Decimate. Open a rift through the reality of the world and summon small bat like creatures for 5s, the bats will fly at the target doing constant damage and feasting on their conditions causing the user to heal for a percentage of the damage they deal and receive benefits depending on the conditions consumed. ( Real good for team fights.) skill 3: Soul shatter Focus your power and grasp an enemy within the visage of your demonic shadow, rooting them in place and causing them to suffer constant damage for 3s. The damage heals you and siphons life force from the enemy, activate again to cause the binds to explode on your enemy causing them to be flung back and granted five stacks of vulnerability. Death shroud form: Demon form Take on the form of a demon and obliterate your enemies with your demonic power, offering defenses and burst damage to the user as well group utility for the part. Skill 1: Gnashing Claws Harness your hatred and lash out at enemies with fire and brimstone as your claws hurl unholy slashes through the air, cleaving the opponent for a sizable chunk of health as you siphon health from their wounds. Skill 2: Devour the Weak Latch onto an enemy with your unholy energy and feed upon their weakness, for each stack of vulnerability on your enemy do increased damage of 5% while also healing yourself for 10% more than you would on enemies without vulnerability. At the end of the leeching effect send out a rippling explosion of cascading darkness which runs down the tether and knocks the enemy down. skill 3: Oblivion Strike the ground with a terrifying howl and cause your enemies to be flung aside, the explosion will do a massive amount of burst cleave and leave enemies with a stack of burning and two of vulnerability. Skill 4: Devestation Teleport to a targeted enemies location and strike at them from behind, upon activation if the enemy was preparing to cast a spell you will interrupt them and force them to take 5% of their damage in true damage. This effect will knock them down and cause them to have vulnerability applied to them, Activate this skill again within 3s to teleport back to the location you cast the spell as long as you are within 100 ft. Skill 5: Visage of terror Roar outward with your distorted demonic voice; Fearing all enemies within 50ft for 5s and apply stacks of vulnerability to them. Utility Skills: Your utility skills should be primarily minion spells as it could cause them to get a proper rework and make them valuable where as now they are ignorable, and somewhat lack luster. This would make them not undead minions but demonic hosts which focus on aiding the spell caster and defending their masters unto death, perhaps even offering some form of interesting side effects for group play. Healing Utility: Devour Send out shadow tendrils in a 360 degree area that last for 10s, for each enemy hit you will regain 10% health every 2s. The healing of this ability is increased if the enemy or enemies have a stack of vulnerability by 1% for a maximum of 25% extra healing. Should the enemy be fully stacked with vulnerability than the healing received would be 35% every 2s. Utility 1: Summon shadow nightmare Summon a shadowy beast who assaults the enemy with teleportation physical attacks, The shadow beast causes vulnerability and is extremely hard to hit its whispers sometimes causing enemies to suffer extra vulnerability. Activate this skill again upon summoning the shadow beast to force it to teleport to an enemy location and interrupt their casting, the shadow beast offers health back to the caster as it does damage. URL Utility 2: Summon Rain of Terror Summon A rain of terror who assaults enemies with nightmarish visages of their own demise, The terror will lash out at enemies from a distance with its unholy power. This minion Debuffs foes and feeds upon their conditions granting increased life leech for every condition on the foe; Activate this skill again upon summoning to force the Terror to turn its gaze onto your desired target. The Terror will fear the enemy and cause them to flee. URL Utility 3 : Summon The hunger Summon The hunger who relentlessly will pursue your foes in exchange for their flesh, this minion constantly applies blindness on its attacks as it feasts on the sight of your foes just as it did kormir long ago. The hunger offers a morale boost for your minions as well constantly buffs you with regeneration and might, the beast feeds on the vulnerability of your feeble enemies and heals you for 5% of the damage done based on how many stacks of vulnerability your enemy has. Activate this skill again upon summoning to cause the hunger to send out a deafening howl that knocks enemies down; The howl provides further increases to the boons of your minions and yourself. Utility 4: Dimensional Rift Rip open a hole in space and time thus causing our realm to become connected to the realms of darkness for 20s, In this time vast arrays of demons will pour forth to aid you in your plight as well will the rift occasionally launch AoE pulses of sustained damage. While standing within the rift your attacks will deal increased damage and you will gain extra stacks of ""Demonic Fortitude"" , In this time your Demon form will become stronger as will your minions and their life leech will be doubled. Activate again within the 20s of use to close the rift and pull all of the enemies caught in the area straight to the center, causing them to be knocked down and suffer from five stacks of burning,vulnerability and torment. Spec specific buff (Similar to Kalla's fervor.): Demonic fortitude Demonic fortitude is a passive spec buff that is not effected by boon-strip as it is not really a boon, As you fight and deal damage to enemies you build up demonic power which fortifies your tissues and body to withstand more punishment. The longer the battle the more powerful you become as you feed upon the suffering of you enemies; Demonic Foritidue increases your health,toughness and power while also increasing crit chance and damage by 5% per stack. The buff can stack 15 times Minor Trait 1: Fueled by death Anytime something dies near you, you will regain health and life force as well gain a stack of demonic fortitude. Minor Trait 2: Demon lord Your minions will grant stacks of demonic fortitude when reactivated to use their utility skills, for each minion you have activated at a time you will gain 10% more toughness and health. Minor trait 3: Fallen one Your demon form gains a passive AoE aura that does small damage ticks to all who are within the immediate range of you, ( 10- 20 feet) As well periodically will reflect damage back to the caster while you are in your demon form. Trait Line one: The top row of traits will be primarily focused around Demonic Fortitude and increasing its effects to be more potent, Increasing is longevity while being out of combat and even causing it to decrease cast times on specific skills. Each one would be focused primarily on making you more capable of taking damage while redirecting it back at the attacker, thus making you the living incarnation of Torment. major Trait 1: Defiling aura Your demonic fortitude now increases your resistances to conditions as well their longevity upon you, At fifteen stacks of demonic fortitude you will begin to redirect conditions back to their casters. This can only proc once even 20s, but in that time all conditions will be sent back to the original caster for the duration remaining on their timers as well feed into your life leech. Major Trait 2: Corruption Incarnate When entering demon form consume all conditions upon you and regain health based upon the amount of conditions consumed, Demonic fortitude will begin to proc stacks of torment upon attackers as they apply conditions to you. When you loose demon form send all conditions cast upon you back to the caster with increased damage, as well received five stacks of regeneration. Major trait 3: ""Not even death can save you from me"" Upon death your demonic fortitude will explode and splinter to each enemy nearby, if no enemy is nearby then all the splinters will strike at the one who killed you and haunt them with your visage. After a 10 -20 delay the demonic power will explode upon your foe, doing a decent amount of damage (A rough 10% base) With increased damage for each condition on you, as well putting each condition you had upon you on them for the remainder of their timer. Trait line 2: This trait line should be focused entirely around the minions and their capabilities in combat, this paired with death magic and soul reaping would make you an extremely viable minion master with their capabilities augmented to make them that much stronger. Major Trait 1: Hounds of hell Your minions gain increased movement and attack speed, and share in your demonic fortitude stacks thus making them more powerful than before. They as well will feed upon YOUR conditions that you currently have on you and heal you for each condition consumed off of you, this cannot proc more than once every 10S but each minion can consume a stack of conditions and heal you based on what they consume.( Vulnerability of course will heal for more.) Major trait 2: Show no mercy Your minions become enraged when you go below the health threshold causing them to do more damage in defense of their master, their attacks become AoE cleaves and do 15% more damage increasing to a maximum of 20% more when you fall lower in health. Their life leech is increased by the same amount as they attempt to save you from death, but should you fall your minions will explode alongside you for a damage blast of 10% health for each minion who died. Major trait 3: Legion Upon attacking an enemy you have a chance to summon additional minions to fight for you; These minions consist of anything from small shambling horrors to minor margonites , These minions are effected by the same buffs your regular minions are as well will ""Show No mercy"" proc upon them. They last 15s and each one has a potential to be a ranged or melee fighter, they have less health but have the potential to offer harder hits than your normal minions. URL , URL Trait line 3: This line of traits is all about Demon form and the power it wields; This trait line makes you more of a demon than a summoner of demons and creates opportunities to potentially stay in demon form for the entire encounter if used properly. Major Trait 1:Demonic blood Demon form offers more damaging effects from its skills with each applying stacks of varying conditions on-top of its normal damage, these conditions range from burning, poison, torment, chill and bleeding. Additionally each of your minions begin to spread conditions of varying degrees ( Example is that your shadow beast will apply chill and bleeding as well as vulnerability.) You as well have increased crit chance as well a larger pool of life force to play with 20% increase on both. Major trait 2: Mist born When entering demon form you and your minions will now become stealthed for a small duration (10s), and receive five stacks of stability. Upon gaining stealth you gain a new spec buff called ""Ambush"", your first strike will always critically hit and apply five stacks of bleeding, vulnerability and burning. Your minions also gain ""Ambush"" But do not apply the stacks of conditions, and instead can knock the enemy down should they be sent for them. You loose stealth once they attack. Major trait 3: Upon black wings While in demon form you gain increased movement and attack speed, the cool-downs of your skills are halved and you are able to use more abilities to your leisure. Your utility bar becomes active within demon form while traited with this ability giving you access to all of your utilities, As well your Dimensional rift now lasts 30s and has increased damage. Minions spawned from the rift have increased up-time and get the benefits of your regular minions, Should your close the rift the damage will now be increased by 5%. thank you for reading, Please feel free to share your thoughts.. Im sorry it's so long."
102,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Quality of life suggestion for PvP: Cleansing Conditions,0,7xgafe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7xgafe/quality_of_life_suggestion_for_pvp_cleansing/,2018-02-14 18:06:39,"RNG has no place in PvP, yet one of the more important mechanics (Condi clense) is random. If you're fighting a Guardian and have 8 stacks of burning and 1 stack of Vulnerability, an ability that removes a single condi has a 50% chance of removing the more important condition (15k Burning damage vs 2% vulnerability). Getting bad RNG with Condi Cleanse can be the difference between living or dying. And the % of getting the right condition on the first try goes way down especially when theres more than 2 Conditions on you. This ultimately creates a pretty annoying situation, in the above example, theres a 50% chance you have a fighting chance vs the Guardian (Clensing the burning), and a 50% chance you'll straight up burn to death. I feel Cleanses should have a priority system, affecting 'Damaging Conditions' first when available, and then non-damaging conditions. I wouldn't go as far to ask the game to determine which condition is doing the most damage and cleanse that one, but getting poor RNG and cleansing off a vulnerability or slow versus 15 stacks of Torment or 8stacks of burning, can just be the difference in a teamfight. TL;DR - Condi Cleanse should prioritize damaging conditions over non-damaging ones to avoid getting trucked over by bad RNG. "
103,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Massive Revenant Rework (Fan concept) (Copied form GW2 forums),0,7xswsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7xswsv/massive_revenant_rework_fan_concept_copied_form/,2018-02-16 06:38:30,"The revenant; a fun class, an interesting class, but not a perfect class. It has problems, and even now, so long after it was released, some of its core issues remain. We still have only one weapon for underwater combat (in spite of being able to weapon swap for no reason), we still have only two legends to swap between in the same environment, our land based weapons are still very narrowly focused on specific roles, and build diversity is still hardly a thing. To this end there has been rampant speculation and discussion of ways to improve the class, and it seems like people have been calling for this or that feature to be reworked since the class was in beta. I've had many ideas myself, but now after giving it proper thought I think I've finally come up with a solution. But to be clear; this isn't going to happen. For one it would be a MASSIVE amount of work on the development team, but beyond that the idea causes ever more troubling balance issues the more elite specs the class gets. Still, I'll outline my idea anyway. I think this will get some positive feedback; it returns the class (a bit) to what Arena Net originally wanted for it, echoes back to something players had in the original Guild Wars, and gives current players something we've been asking for since literally the game's earliest days post-announcement. So without further delay.... Change number one; no more weapon swapping. That's right; ditch it. The feature was only added (after much fan complaint) as a bandaid solution the class' other problems. Problems I feel I've solved. As such this feature is no longer required, the class can go back to as Arena Net intended, and we no long have that annoying issue with our underwater weapon. This isn't really improving the class, just removing something that will no longer be needed. Not much to say beyond that. Change number two, the BIG one; freely selectable WEAPON skills. Fans have been asking for this forever, and really the tech needed is already in the game. It can cause balance issues, and requires a bit of a change to how revenants unlock skills, but done right it can give the class the same build diversity as the others, as well as solves the problem of weapons being too strictly tied to specific roles and play styles. But anyone can just type that out, the real meat of the idea is how to go about doing this. And to that there are really two ways I can see. I dub these the ""attunment method"" and the ""infusion method."" The attunment method: Following suit from the Elementalist, each weapon is now reworked to have at core five different skill sets. As with the ele these sets are all recognizable as suited to that weapon (a staff is a staff and it does staff things), but there are somewhat modified versions of these weapons suited to each legend. For example we've all seen how Jalis uses a hammer, but what about Shiro? I'll circle back to why we start with five skills sets when we have only four legends later, but for now the point is we unlock new versions of our weapon skills as we level, much like an elementalist unlocking attunments. Only where their skills come pre-packaged based on attunment, we get to mix and match them as we see fit. The problem with his is obvious; too many skills in the long run. With each new elite we get not only a new weapon (needing five core skill sets for it), but also a new legend that would demand a new set for all core weapons AND the new one. You could mitigate this slightly by having the new legend barred from the core weapons, only effecting its own while the core legends can also effect it, but that is only slightly better. It is basically like giving elementalists an entirely new attunement they can use alongside their core ones. That might work once, but would get way too complicated way too fast. The Infusion method: This one is a bit harder to explain, but also more doable in the long run. Also a bit less....impressive. In effect all our skills are reworked to include empty ""effect slots"" that are filled by infusing each skill with the power of a given legend. As an example our current mace 1, Misery Swipe, is a basic melee swing that causes torment. After this rework the skill would instead be a basic melee swing with an empty slot, no condition. Likewise mace 2, Searing Fissure, leaves a fire field to be exploited. Under this idea it would have a blank field slot. From here we fill these slots with the power of our legends. As each legend would have a defined set of effects that go into these slots. Every one having their own lore, role, or theme based effect, boon, condition, control, and combo field. As an example let's build Jalis again. He's our melee warlord tank spec, so he would be tough and in-your-face. He's from the Shiverpeak mountains, and was the way Arena Net gave the game the taunt effect. Finally through traits this legend weakens foes. Thus we have his build; effect would be block, boon would stability, condition would be weaken, control would be taunt, and combo field would be ice. Using the skills above by ""infusing"" Misery Swipe with Jalis it would cause weakness, while Searing Fissure would drop an ice field. Sword 3's Unrelenting Assault would block instead of evade, and staff 2's Debilitating Slam would taunt instead of daze. Now let's try Mallyx; effect would be condi transfer, boon would be resistance, condition would be torment, control would be cripple, and combo field would be poison or dark. Fill in the blanks and Misery Swipe causes torment, Searing Fissure would drop poison field, Unrelenting Assault would spread conditions around (great since sword 1 would now cause torment instead of vulnerability), and Debilitating Slam would cripple. And the core of all this would be that we can feely infuse each skill with whatever legend we want. You could have Jalis on your auto attack, Mallyx on your 5 skill, couple of Shiro infused secondary weapon skills, and a Ventari infused skill in your back pocket as an emergency support skill. Elite specs are just as easy to do; go down the list and pick effects that suit them. Being elite you could even break some of the rules a bit and give revenants crazy stuff they couldn't normally get. Maybe Glint (whom I consider to be a bit mesmer like in the lore) gives us the clone effect, while Kalla allows us to use stealth. So many possibilities.... Of course now we come to how we unlock this stuff. I think the best way to go would be to have our legend locked utility skills unlock on their own as we level, rather than needing to be unlocked with hero points. Instead we use hero points to unlock ""weapon mastery"" within each legend. So instead of the unlocking Jalis' healing skill first off, we unlock his auto-attack mastery, and from then on can use his version of any weapon's auto attack. This is why I listed five core types under the attunment method; you need a basic version for players to use before they hit level 5 and start getting hero points. Likewise under the infusion method you need a basic skill to actually infuse these legends into. Another benefit to this would be the ability to use any legend under water, even if you can't use it under water. For example; you might not be able to channel Ventari under water, but you could still infuse skills with his properties or use his versions of them on your spear. Well that about covers it. Feedback is welcomed, but please try to keep it civil."

WAHOOOOOO!!! () Since [the last time I've published my Engi sheets](URL almost a year ago, a lot of patches and releases have passed and I've been silently updating my sheets for myself, patch by patch, piece by piece. Then, the [Holosmith](URL has been released and I suddenly recieved a huge amount of (HYPE!) new skills and values to work with. I also realized that it was time for a change... It was at this point I decided to rework my whole spreadsheet, to create a new, practical, **100% precise spreadsheet**, with the ability to adapt quickly, for all the future patches to come. I started to replace tooltip values with formulas, **I've recorded every single skill and counted the frames to elaborate its exact cast time**, I retested every CC skill to find it's exact CC value, heck, I even added healing values! I was and still am very happy to have my good friend **[ok] Cat | /u/towelcat** to help me especially with the hidden values, such as the [weapon strength](URL of the [Photon Forge](URL and what not. I started to socialize a lot more with **[SC] Hintkei | /u/hintkei** from [Snow Crows](URL (more than just talking with him in his YouTube comments 3) a very good Engineer and now friend of mine about the meta, party setups, gear, rotations, realistic buffs or conditions (on the enemy for the [Modified Ammunition](URL trait) and so he also had some sort of ""early access"" through me to the ""Holosmith - Skill Spreadsheet"" to give you the optimized Raid rotations. I am **very happy** to finally publish my work again. However this time it might be a bit overwhelming to look at (Nothing for [Arithmophobes](URL as the spreadsheet has grown quite a lot since a year ago. But worry not! **I will try to answer every single question** you ask here and help you understand everything! But I also have a **very unhappy** announcement to make... This time it's ""only"" the Power Holosmith spreadsheet. **The Condi Engineer is currently in such a bad state, that not even I - an Engineer loving player since release (15k hours) - am able to consider it a viable build for Raids anymore.** Dear **/u/GaileGray**, the Condi Engineer has an amazing and unique playstyle. It musn't die and really needs some help. I'd like to offer you my assistance for figuring out good changes. I have plenty of ideas how to bring the Condi Engineer back to life and I can exactly tell you what change will affect it's Raid DpS by what value. I also have plans on becoming a Game Designer myself in the future, so it's not just about buffing it as much as I can, I want to balance the Condi Engineer. :) I'd love to hear from you, thanks! And all of the sudden - Wall'O'Text, sry 'bout that. :x --- #Skill Spreadsheets [**Power Holosmith**](URL ~~[**Condi Engineer**](URL A bit too much for you? **I will try to answer every single question** you ask here and help you understand everything! --- #What am I looking at? A complete skill spreadsheet with all relevant abilities the Engineer has to offer. There's currently ""only"" one for the **Power Holosmith (Rifle variant!)**, but I hope that I can add one for the Condi Engineer once again. :) All cast times have been elaborated by recording each skill and counting it's frames. The damage numbers are also very detailed, they include procs from [Shrapnel](URL and [Sharpshooter](URL aswell. As for the full and/or part time [Scrappers](URL among us, I've added the hammer skills (and Gyros) aswell. Their damage include the modifier traits [Perfectly Weighted](URL and [Laser's Edge](URL [Laser's Edge](URL will not be aviable if you play [Scrapper](URL but it's required in the list to compare the skills to other ones. **Top left:** The unbuffed and **realistic** buffed stats (including [Infusions](URL you will have. The term ""Modifier"" adds the value of all %-damage increasing traits, sigils and runes and [Spirit of Frost](URL There is also information about the damage and duration of Conditions aswell as the healing output of Regeneration plus the healing modifiers. Below that, you can see all the **realistic** modifiers you'll have in Raids, for example 80% [Scholar](URL uptime, 100% [Empower Allies](URL uptime, etc. **Bottom left:** All the skills of the Engineer sorted by: * 2-Handed Weapons * 1-Handed Weapons * Offhands * Heal Skills of all types * [Exceeds](URL * [Gyros](URL (whoops [here](URL the correct link!) * [Kits](URL * [Turrets](URL * [Gadgets](URL * Elite Skills * Gear and Traits. You can also see less important **base values**, such as what stands in the tooltip, Power, Condition and total damage, in- and outgoing healing, **hard** CC, cast time and cooldown. **Top right:** Lots of side info such as the **Estimated Meta DpS** (atm around 34k, which shows how precise this spreadsheet is), the duration of a full rotation, the number of procs of the trait [Shrapnel](URL while performing either the optimized rifle or sword rotation, weapon strengths of all the weapons, Kits, Utilities, Traits, Toolbelts, Sigils and Runes and a key to the color scheme of the actual spreadsheet. Below all those side infos there's **an important wide mini spreadsheet**. These are all weapon, utility and elite skills with their total contribution to your DpS **for a realistic rotation**! So for example if you happen to replace the [Laser Disk](URL (2142 DpS) with the [Elixir Gun](URL (1631 DpS) to cleanse Sloth's fear of all your allies, you'd only lose 2142-1631=**511 DpS**. These numbers are based on the rifle variant and thus on the bomb auto attack. Therefore I could not include exact values for the sword in this table without immense calculations. **Bottom right:** All skills organized by DpiSCT (Damage per invested Second Cast Time / burst priority) in descending order. **This is the actual Skill Spreadsheet!** All skills the meta **rifle** build uses, are marked with colors in the list: * Blue: 30'000+ DpiSCT * Green: 25'000-29'999 DpiSCT * Yellow: 20'000-24'999 DpiSCT * Orange: 10'000-19'999 DpiSCT * Red: 1-9'999 DpiSCT * Grey: 0 DpiSCT / Utility * Purple: Sigil / Rune / Trait / Other --- #Recommended / Meta Builds and Rotation Videos: **The Rifle Holosmith** is currently the best build/rotation for Holosmith in Raids.

You can swap to sword/shield for 350 additional CC damage, at the cost of approximately 500 DpS. * [Video](URL * [Build](URL **Sword Tools Holosmith** is an alternate build/rotation for Holosmith in Raids. The no-kits, Tools variant is around 6% (2'000) DpS lower than the optimal rifle or sword/pistol builds with Explosives and kits. However this variant is a lot easier to play and is especially good for parties with insufficient Quickness, as it partially sustains Quickness itself.

For example, a skill which deals 5000 damage and has 0.5s cast time has a DpiSCT of 10000. If you have another skill with 20000 damage output, but a cast time of 4s, itd have a DpiSCT of 5000 and makes it a worse skill to use. Youd be dealing more DpS with the first one (as long as we ignore the Cooldown / as long as you use other skills too, at least auto attacks, ofc). **&lt;- incl.

105,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Necromancer build for healing/damage/revives (PVP),2,7yos29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7yos29/necromancer_build_for_healingdamagerevives_pvp/,2018-02-20 05:24:18,"Link to build: URL Hi everyone, I just wanted to share my build since I haven't seen it used very often (maybe never?) but it's been very fun to play with. I've seen really mixed opinions on necromancers healing, with most builds revolving around minions. I entered into GW2 playing as mesmer but really fell in love with the necromancer. I wanted a playstyle that allowed me to be quite tanky, with hard hits but a lot of that damage/tankiness coming from leeching spells. I also really wanted to be able to revive allies quickly and this definitely achieves that. Anyways I've been playing like this off/on for 2 years and it's stood up well in that time. (some tweaks here or there, I used to use the Plaguelands skill which transformed me into a cloud of conditions but they removed the transform effect and replaced it with one single AOE mark.) It revolves around keeping some distance when using staff, providing damage/support with the AOE wells. Mark of Blood also provides regeneration to allies while bleeding enemies. When an ally starts to go down I will pop into shroud and use skill 4. Because of Transfusion, I also heal everyone around me tons. If an ally is downed it also teleports them to me, so sometimes I will run up on a point that has several downed allies and I can teleport them away from it. The Healing Power + Ritual of Life passive that summons a well of blood provides very fast healing and if enemies can't down the person/down me within a few seconds usually I have no problem with revives. Part of that is because of Last Rites, allies don't bleed out as long as I'm nearby and not downed. My healing power also increases based on my health so if I do start to get attacked more while reviving, the well increases in healing power to help me out plus it boosts the rate at which I res. So usually I can get an ally up, and they can jump into the fight to take some of the heat off of me. (Life From Death also heals/partially revives players when leaving shroud) Dagger/focus is usually what I switch to when I know I'll be able to effectively hold a point against one enemy or to finish someone off after using marks via staff. It has some strong support skills for needing to escape/generally provide help to allies as well. There's an immobilizing skill and Reapers Touch bounces between allies/enemies providing Regen/Vulnerability. Life Siphon also provides another healing skill that does decent damage. I chose Well of Darkness for the blinding since that's just very useful, and Well of Blood is obviously the AOE heal mark. It seemed the obvious choice for someone trying to heal the team and not just myself. I use Well of Suffering for the damage especially to use as an AOE while still using dagger/focus. I used to use Well of Corruption to convert boons on enemies into conditions, which is very useful for crowd control and keeping points, but found that I just wasn't putting out enough damage/it wasn't as useful in 1v1. I use Signet of the Locust for the 25% run speed (It makes a difference in being able to get to someone downed faster) and the extra heal while I'm waiting for other heals to refresh, especially while using dagger/focus. I think that Signet of Undeath would be very useful too, since it regenerates life force passively (always good) and allows you to do an instant AOE revive from far away. I solved this problem by just teleporting players to me but it would definitely be good in certain situations/if your playstyle suits it more! I use Lich Form since the cloud form just isn't a thing anymore, and it allows more vitality, precision, and generally extends the time I'm alive. (It has an extra heal skill as well that steals life from enemies.) Anyways I think that's about it. I know that this build has definitely been a game changer at times simply cause the enemy can't keep us/get us down. Even while downed, this build is great with Life Leech. It provides good healing and damage to the enemy and in situations where enemies can't immediately finish me off because a battle is still going on I can provide damage while healing myself. Anyways that's about it, I can upload a video if anyone is interested in seeing this in combat. I'm not stating it's ""better"" than any other build or anything, but definitely is a lot of fun and provides tons of support/crowd control!"

Link: **[URL --- ## What is new We still have our three main sections: **Mechanics**, **Builds** (previously *Classes*) and **Fractals**. Those sections contain guides overviews, some special sections (benchmarks/records) and the actual guide. ### [Mechanics](URL The mechanics section didn't change that much, we updated everything for PoF (finally) and extended a few guides like [Blast Stacking](URL This section will most likely grow in the future, with small guides on fractal rewards, farming and more! ### [Fractals](URL Now the Fractal guides underwent a major update! The most prominent feature is probably the **new images** thanks to our member /u/Acopone. We also **updated all guides for the current balance patch**, reviewed mistlock instabilities, potion and sigil data and added **multiple PoVs** for the current record video. Following the last Fractal patch we updated the [Molten Boss Fractal](URL and [Captain Mai Trin Boss Fractal](URL guides, thanks to /u/Amerika-jinn we also have a brand new guide for the [Twilight Oasis Fractal](URL You'll notice that the daily fractals are highlighted on the overview page, making it really easy to estimate the time needed for a full run. ### [Builds](URL We decided to categorize builds into **Meta**, **Great** and **Good Builds**. The meta tier is obviously the recommended choice for speed runs, providing the fastest clearing times overall. The remaining tiers contain other viable builds perfectly capable of clearing all content, just not as fast :) Every build page contains a list of **perks** from that specific build, like key skills (e.g. Portal Entre), traits (Banners), boons, conditions and effects. There is also the new [Benchmarks](URL page, though we don't do official ""dT benchmarks"" yet and rather rely on community videos (thanks to SC obviously). Note that we want to offer a separate *team compositions* section in the future, with a tool similar to the [WoW MMO-Champion RaidComp](URL one. Which brings me to the next point.. --- ## Fractal Meta Changes With the changes to Alacrity and Mesmer, the fastest team composition for most of the fractals is now **1x [Boon Chronomancer](URL **1x [Hybrid Spellbreaker](URL and **3x [Arcane Power Weaver](URL The Chrono is able to provide 10-12 boons permanently to the team, which has great synergy with the Spellbreaker's [Empowered](URL trait and the Weaver's [Bountiful Power](URL 25x Might is covered by the Mesmer and 1-2 Arcane Weavers with [Elemental Attunement](URL the only things you loose from a Druid is Glyph of Empowerement, Frost Spirit, Spotter (redundant for Weavers with [Superior Elements](URL some CC and some Vulnerability. In return you gain one more DPS which greatly speeds up long fights and doesn't suffer from unavailable breakbars (Artsariiv during marbles, Arkk..). There are still fights where CC is king (MAMA, Ensolyss), in those fights 1-2 Weavers can spec Air for a slight damage increase. You can replace one Weaver with a Power Druid for more CC and burst modifiers. Please note that this setup is only recommended if you were previously playing without a Heal Druid already, as the comp is naturally more fragile and depends on a good chrono. Especially in condition-heavy environments (Volcanic endboss, Cliffside) a Druid still makes things easier if you're not 100% focused. *Edit:* We're aware this might be hard to follow without videos, it's now our priority 1 to do some until next weekend - strongly recommend to try it out on your own though if you're confident enough to play without a healer! --- ## Call to action - How to contribute All our guide sources are now available in a [public repository](URL - everyone can contribute! The actual guides are written in extended *[Markdown](URL with custom components, making it easy for everyone to write something - even for people without a coding background. Take for example the [raw Snowblind Fractal guide source](URL it should be really simple to understand. We even went one step further and built a **[custom WYSIWYG markdown editor](URL - just paste the snowblind source markdown there and see what happens.. awesome, right? :) So if you find a mistake or want to create something new and helpful for the community, all you need is a GitHub account. Either [create an issue](URL describing the problem or [create a pull request](URL with your own solution. --- ## Other notes Apart from the things already online, we're working on a few other features and hope to publish them soon: - Team Composition tool (mentioned above) - Build Editor (~70% done) - [GW2 Raidar](URL data integration - Integration of [GatsbyJS](URL for static HTML pages and better searching I want to thank everyone contributing to our community, especially /u/DxCx66 for helping me out with modern JS whenever needed. Hopefully we can unite the few GW2 theorycrafting people left even more in the future! As always, our [Discord](URL server is usually the best place for immediate support, feel free to join our discussions. Our ingame guild is at about 100 members, consider [joining us](URL if you meet the requirements. See you in daily fractals :)"
107,vulnerability,Guildwars2,PvE Open World Builds - March 2018,664,81yacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/81yacs/pve_open_world_builds_march_2018/,2018-03-05 02:30:28,"Hello and welcome to this wall of text! For quite a while now, I have developed and maintained a list of builds intended specifically for open world PvE play. So far, I have only posted them to /r/GuildWars2Builds, and the people there seem to genuinely appreciate them. It is my hope that by sharing this with the main subreddit, it would reach more people who are looking for suggestions or inspiration for one or more of their characters. This could especially be valuable to players revisiting the game for *A Bug in the System.* The bulk of this post will be a direct copy-paste of the [original](URL with some minor edits, including this expository introduction. While I do not intend to funnel the discussion from here back to the original post, I will be editing only the original if it is influenced by balance changes within the next few months. Due to the high volume of posts here, this version will be swiftly buried; but the original will remain visible on the main page of /r/GuildWars2Builds for quite some time. **Readers in the future, if you believe this post is out of date, check the [original](URL for updates!** I am aware that this subject is typically dismissed in this subreddit; the standard response I see is ""anything works in open world, just play whatever."" Consider this post as my response to that statement. I do not mean to suggest that I am attempting to describe an open world *meta,* but I will proceed to outline goals which I believe make the experience smoother and more enjoyable, and show performance rankings in different areas. This entire post is subjective. Decide for yourself what matters to you. --- --- #Build Goals I'd like to take the time to state for you my personal goals for engaging in open world content, and what strategy I take when constructing builds. Feel free to disagree - most of these are not hard requirements, not even for myself! But in general, I tend to follow these preferences, in this order from most important to least important. Sometimes one or more priorities conflict with each other, and so I choose them in the order they are listed. **1) Emphasize Direct Damage** Open world is full of encounters where you are fighting mobs with relatively low health - tens of thousands, compared to bosses with millions. The fastest way to do a million damage is not always so favored toward direct damage; however, the fastest way to do ten to fifty thousand damage is almost always direct damage on every class. Basically, direct damage makes you kill trash mobs faster than condition damage. In general, this is true; though as a matter of playstyle, you may prefer the tools available to condition builds, such as range or AoE, and accept the sacrifice of trash mob kill speed. This is a good strategy, it's just not my preferred strategy. I want trash mobs dead, and I want them dead now. This can include prioritizing offensive boon application, such as Might, Fury, Quickness, and any boon with traits that give a bonus damage modifier, like Retaliation on Dragonhunter. It also means Berserker stats, Scholar runes, and Force sigils in most cases. **2) Minimize Defensive Stats** Things like Vitality, Toughness, and Healing Power. These don't really have synergy with direct damage builds, since ideally you'd want to play for killing everything as fast as possible. The only good stat combos for adding defensive stats to direct damage builds are Marauder and Valkyrie. Marauder is good on classes which need additional crit chance, such as Spellbreaker, Chronomancer, and Weaver. Valkyrie is good on classes with enormous amounts of crit chance from traits, such as Reaper and Guardian. However, in general, I will attempt to minimize these stats as much as possible, unless taking them provides some sort of direct offensive benefit, such as Rune of the Ice in my Reaper build. **3) Carry a Decent Ranged Weapon** Open world is full of melee hate, and having to run all the way up to your enemies means that they get to start moving and attacking sooner in the engagement. Having range allows you to kite mobs, deal damage before mobs even notice you, and get out of melee-hate scenarios at boss fights. Sometimes, depending on the assets and strength of a ranged weapon, I will feature range as my primary weapon in the set; other times, weaker but still decent ranged weapons are ready on swap when needed. I personally define ranged combat beginning at 900 range from your target, and so 900 range weapons are skirmishing right at the lower bound; however, when searching for a ranged option, I will search from the higest ranged options first, and move in closer as I discard poor weapon choices. This is why, for instance, I do not use a Longbow on my Dragonhunter, because I believe Longbow to be a poor weapon choice. It is also why I choose to play Rifle on my Deadeye instead of Pistol/Pistol, since Rifle is good and has a much higher range, even though Pistol/Pistol may do more damage. While the first two priorities are universal across all my builds, this one is not. I do not include a ranged weapon for my Holosmith or Spellbreaker because all their ranged alternatives are poor with regard to their build archetypes and other qualities I wish to preserve. **4) Have Strong AoE on Low Cooldown** Whether in the form of cleave or ground-targeted AoE, this is fairly important. It can be an autoattack or some other skill with relatively low cooldown that serves as your bread-and-butter method of tackling waves of trash. There are builds with high sustained DPS on bosses, but which struggle to fight normal trash mobs, because their skills which cause high DPS have lengthy cooldowns. You need either a lot of these skills that you can stagger out between pulls, or a few with low cooldowns of about 6 seconds or less. **5) Strive for 100% Crit Chance** In open world, you usually don't have allies providing offensive buffs like you do in organized instances; the biggest effect this has on your experience is with regard to your crit reliability. Having reliable crits means your big important attacks aren't duds, which lets mobs live longer and deal more damage to you, and can sometimes even cost you your life when tackling a particularly difficult encounter. In other words, the best defense is a good offense, and a good offense is one which has consistent, reliable damage presence. You get consistent, reliable damage presence in direct damage builds by aiming for 100% crit chance. Most of my builds have some way of increasing their crit chance to 100% for the greater majority of the time. This may include Fury application, Accuracy sigils, Precise Infusions, some amount of Assassin stats, Precision signets, and crit chance traits. The primary exception to this rule is my Chronomancer, which reaches 95% crit chance; this is consistent enough, and adding on the additional 5% through Precision only would force out other important parts of the build. (It has to be Precision because Phantasms do not copy flat crit chance bonuses, such as Accuracy sigils.) This is most important on builds with slow, single damage events with high power scaling. Think Gravedigger on Reaper, or Death's Judgment on Deadeye. These skills are the most vulnerable to bad crit RNG and have a dramatic negative effect on your outgoing damage if they don't crit reliably. **6) Utilize High-Value Active Defense** Stunbreaks, condition cleansing, heals, blocks and invulnerability, and so forth. If a build has access to a powerful defensive skill, and does not sacrifice much damage to do so, I'll generally take it. Skills I tend to pick up are ones which have low cooldown, *very* strong effects, synergize with traits or other skills I already take, do damage as part of their defensive effect, or are more powerful than competing damage options. For example, Natural Healing on my Spellbreaker build provides an enormous emergency burst heal, 60% of your maximum HP, while also cleansing 7 conditions, on a 25-second cooldown; the loss of all boons in the process is not so bad, as those can be regained fairly quickly. The full reset almost always gives you an advantage because your enemies will have lower health, but you just reset to a fully healthy state. The defensive mantras on my Chronomancer have loads of value; they're instant cast so they don't interrupt your damaging abilities, they provide very strong effects on use, and there aren't very many good damage choices to compete with them. A skill like Twist of Fate on Weaver does not have very high value because it has a long cooldown per charge, locks you into an extra animation, and gives no persisting or bonus effects afterward. It also has no alternative way of using it while casting to protect something like Meteor Shower, for instance; but this is exactly what Arcane Shield does, while also being able to explode for high damage in AoE, and synergizes with existing traits. **7) Remove Unnecessary Complexity** If there's a much easier way to play a build that only sacrifices a little damage, I'll generally do that instead. This is most prominently visible on my Spellbreaker, where I've stacked Signets and avoided the Strength trait line, which is full of damage modifiers you have to constantly maintain in order for it to be worth it. Arms gives very nice passive damage modifiers instead. It's also apparent on my Holosmith, where I prefer the simplicity of having no kits and mostly passive traits; and much of my Soulbeast build was influenced by attempting to lower its complexity. This is my least important priority, but it is still influential in determining the types of builds I tend to seek out. **Final Note** Theme and fashion are not strictly priorities, but they do play a role in shaping how I feel about a build. When skills fit together nicely in combos that feel good, or there's a cool synergy throughout the build, or the weapon and skill choices are good for fashion options, it makes the build more satisfying to me. Sometimes this influences my decision when faced with a choice between two builds which are essentially identical under my priority list. However, I do not consider this to be a rigorous concept that I can define and defend. --- --- #The Builds This time, I have trimmed each profession back to one build each, focusing on the primary build I'm using on that profession that fits within my priorities. The profession with the biggest room for multiple variants is the Reaper, but I feel that it's been thoroughly discussed, and most of its variants (minions, wells, Valkyrie) are nearly common knowledge at this point. Due to popular request, I've included short descriptions of each build's sustained DPS rotations or priority lists. When you see skills separated by commas "","" that refers to casting skills in that specific sequence, from left to right. For example, when looking at my Chronomancer build rotation, you should cast the skills in the exact order they are written. When you see skills separated by a greater-than sign ""&gt;"" that refers to a priority order where you pick which skills to cast based on how far left it is in the order. For example, if you're playing my Spellbreaker build, and Axe 2 and Dagger 5 are both available, you should cast Axe 2 first. --- ###Elementalist [Weaver, Staff, Arcane Variant](URL This build was not affected by the February 6th patch. I dropped the Air variant because I felt it was too situational. Sword still unfortunately lacks anything that makes it worth the risk of being locked into melee 100% of the time. Significant buffs to autoattacks in Fire and Air, and cooldown reduction on dual skills and skills 2 and 3 in Fire and Air, would invite me to reconsider Sword in open world. **DPS Rotation** For sustained DPS, try to stick to [this attunement pattern.](URL Once you memorize this pattern, the rest is simple: Whenever you double attune to Fire, cast Lava Font, then Meteor Shower; if Lava Font isn't ready, cast Meteor Shower, then Lava Font. Whenever you attune to Air or Earth, cast skill 3, then skill 2, and autoattack until Fire is ready. Whenever you attune to Fire, cast Lava Font, then autoattack. Arcane Wave usage: Blast yourself Fury in the beginning using Arcane Wave on Lava Font. Use Arcane Wave again when your Ferocity buff wears off, but make sure you cast it in one of your Fire fields. Over a very long rotation, cast it once before Meteor Shower to ensure that you have Fury and the bonus Ferocity for Meteor Shower's duration. If it is unavailable before Meteor Shower for any reason, sacrifice Arcane Brilliance instead. --- ###Engineer [Holosmith, Sword/Shield, No Kits](URL This build was not changed by the February 6th patch; most of the changes were aimed at Alchemy, Inventions, and Scrapper, trait lines I don't use. Sword got a tiny damage buff. Functionality changes due to PvP may occur in the upcoming balance patch, so keep an eye out for changes here. **DPS Priorities** Initial build to 50 Heat: When just starting combat at 0 Heat, enter Photon Forge and cast 3, 5, 4 in that order. 50-149 Heat: Photon Forge. Cast 3, 4 on cooldown, with 3 taking absolute priority over all else. Don't use 2 or 5 as part of a DPS rotation. Cooling Down: Sword 3 above 100 Heat, autoattack until 3 gets refreshed. Repeat until you reach 50 Heat, then reenter Photon Forge. Utilities: Cast all damaging utilities and toolbelt skills in Photon Forge above 50 Heat. Remember, Forge 3 takes absolute priority. Prime Light Beam, Laser Disk, Hard Light Arena: Cast these when they would finish pulsing while you're still in Photon Forge. Easiest is to cast them when you first enter Forge, after Forge 3. --- ###Guardian [Dragonhunter, Scepter/Greatsword](URL The reduction to Sword of Justice's cooldown between charge casts now allows it to be stacked during a burst opener for a lot of additional damage. I now prefer to take it over Bane Signet. Otherwise, the build remained largely the same. **DPS Rotation** Start Scepter/Focus. Focus 5\*, F1, Scepter 2, Dragon's Maw\*, Procession of Blades, swap to Greatsword, Greatsword 2, autoattack until GS2 is almost ready again. Greatsword 4, Greatsword 2, swap to Scepter, Scepter 2, autoattack until F1 is ready. ^*Does ^not ^line ^up ^with ^rotation ^neatly. ^Include ^in ^rotation ^when ^possible. Sword of Justice: Use whenever you're just autoattacking to keep up your DPS and Vulnerability. Hallowed Ground: Cast after Focus 5, but before F1. ""Stand Your Ground!"": Cast when you drop Scepter 2. --- ###Mesmer [Chronomancer, Greatsword/Swords](URL This profession was completely overhauled; Phantasms are no longer persistent summons, but rather perform an attack once, and then turn into clones. This rework was met with a whole bunch of changes to adjust Mesmer's damage output with respect to these new Phantasm skills. A much more detailed post for this build can be found [here.](URL **DPS Rotation** Precast Mantra of Pain and Sword 5 at range, swap to Greatsword before you enter combat. Step 1: Greatsword 4, Signet of the Ether, Greatsword 4, Greatsword 2, swap to Sword, Sword 5, Sword 2, autoattack. Step 2: Sword 5, swap to Greatsword, Greatsword 4, Greatsword 2, autoattack. When Greatsword 4 and Signet of the Ether are ready, repeat from step 1. Additionally: Cast Mantra of Pain at 2 charges. Use Mind Wrack when you reach 3 clones. Use Cry of Frustration when you reach 3 clones and Mind Wrack won't be available for a while. Note: Do not commit to finishing your autoattacks with this build. They don't do a lot of damage, are very slow, and delaying a Phantasm severely reduces your DPS. --- ###Necromancer [Reaper, No Minions, Ice Runes](URL Scourge builds took a major hit when Shade skills got a 0.5-second delay added on. This prevents multiple Shade skills from being cast simultaneously for a large burst of damage, which was crucial to power Scourge play. Some of the defensive utility of Shade skills was also lowered, which further reduces the appeal of power Scourge. In light of this, I no longer support power Scourge, but I have a new Reaper build to share with you all. A more detailed discussion of this build can be found [here.](URL **DPS Priorities** Boss has Chill and 25 Vulnerability already: Above 50% HP: Shroud 4 &gt; Greatsword 4 &gt; Greatsword 2 &gt; Greatsword autoattacks. Below 50% HP: Shroud 5 &gt; Shroud 4 &gt; Greatsword 4 &gt; Greatsword 2. Boss has neither Chill nor Vulnerability: Same as above, but now just before you enter Shroud, swap to Axe and cast Focus 5, Focus 4 for Chill and Vulnerability as needed. Stay in Shroud for 8-9 seconds each time, and swap back to Greatsword upon exiting. When in Greatsword, cast everything on cooldown. Axe abilities are only to be used if you need to retreat to range. --- ###Ranger [Soulbeast, Longbow/Greatsword](URL This build did not change much with respect to the February 6th patch. Bird Beastmode mobility skill Swoop got changed, but it still doesn't feel that great to use, in my opinion. However, the pets you use are largely up to you, as long as you camp any Ferocious pet in Beastmode most of the time. **DPS Priorities** Always be in Beastmode. Boon stacking rotation - each step occurs every 25-ish seconds: Moa Stance, Quickening Zephyr, F3, ""Strength of the Pack!"" Moa Stance, F3. Moa Stance, Quickening Zephyr, F3. Moa Stance, F3, ""Strength of the Pack!"" Moa Stance, Quickening Zephyr, F3. Moa Stance, F3. Repeat. Damage priority - per-weapon basis, no strict rotation: Longbow: Longbow 5 &gt; Longbow 2 &gt; Longbow autoattacks. Greatsword: Greatsword 2 &gt; Greatsword 5 &gt; Greatsword autoattacks. --- ###Revenant [Herald, Swords/Hammer, Glint/Shiro](URL Impossible Odds was changed to no longer grant Quickness, but rather cause a secondary strike on hit. This removed a lot of out-of-combat utility of the Revenant, such as gathering and other channeled interactions; but combat stayed roughly the same. I actually prefer it this way because your attack speed is consistent throughout your rotation now, and the upkeep cost reduction means you can cast weapon skills more often. Also, they made it so that the game remembers which facets you were using before you mount, and turns them on automatically when you dismount. **DPS Rotation** The idea is that you want to spend exactly 50 energy in the 10 seconds it takes for legend swap to cool down. While in Glint, you have 25 spare energy at most, and while in Shiro, you have 15 spare energy at most. (These have an extra 5 energy tacked on because when you hit 0 energy, there is a short delay before channeled abilities turn off.) Here's the setup: While in Glint: Activate Facets of Nature, Light, Darkness, Elements, and Strength. Spend 25 energy on weapon skills. Do not leave Glint until all Facets have deactivated! While in Shiro: Activate Impossible Odds. Spend 15 energy on weapon skills. Spend your extra energy on weapon skills however you like, depending on what you need for the situation. --- ###Thief [Deadeye, Rifle, Be Quick or Be Killed](URL Kneel skills got large buffs in PvE, and Mark was changed so that you could simply refresh its duration when recasting it on the same target; this means you no longer have to rebuild Malice every 25 seconds against bosses, and it drastically increases your sustained DPS. Now you want to cast Mark on cooldown against bosses, and constantly spam Death's Judgment after initially building Malice stacks. The general run-and-gun playstyle with standing skills didn't change at all. **DPS Rotation** The new Rifle rotation is very simple, with only one buildup period: Mark your target and Kneel. Cast Rifle 1 and 3 during the Quickness duration. Autoattack while building Malice; if you reach max Initiative, cast Rifle 3. When you reach max Malice, use Haste and dump all initiative into Rifle 4, autoattack while building initiative. Cast Mark and Haste on cooldown, keep spamming Rifle 4 and autoattacks until the boss dies. If you ever need to stand up, that's okay. Just save your initiative until you can Kneel again. --- ###Warrior [Spellbreaker, Signets, Arms/Discipline](URL The fundamental playstyle of this build didn't change much, but it received numerous damage buffs that make it more powerful now. There are a great variety of good weapon combinations, but I recommend that one set be Axe/Dagger for strong Fury uptime and to proc the healing part of Sun and Moon Style. Taking Strength instead of Arms, and Physical skills instead of Signets, is also an option, though it requires a lot more micromanagement than I prefer, so I've stopped playing Strength variants. **DPS Priorities** This build is nice and simple to play. Just throw out the abilities that hit hard when they come off cooldown. Axe/Dagger: Axe 2 (if no Fury) &gt; Dagger 4 (not attacking) &gt; F1 &gt; Axe 2 &gt; Dagger 5 &gt; Axe 3 (under 50%) &gt; Autoattacks Dagger/Axe: Axe 4 &gt; Axe 5 &gt; F1 &gt; Dagger 3 (attacking) &gt; Autoattacks This set has a stun-burst combo with Axe 4, Dagger 3, Axe 5 that is effective outside the normal priority. Don't linger in this set. Once you cast the hard-hitting abilities, go back to Axe/Dagger. --- --- #Performance Rankings In this section, I'd like to highlight nine different areas of importance in open world, and show how each build performs in each area. The areas are listed in no particular order; each area is situationally important. The images use the elite specialization's icon to represent the build; however, please note that these tables do *not* represent the elite specializations in general. I decided to drop F tier because six ranks for nine builds is a little excessive; I can get my point across with just the five. The goals of this section are to give people an idea of the builds' strengths and weaknesses with respect to one another, and to demonstrate the amount of variety between the builds. This will hopefully help influence people's decisions as to whether or not they use a specific build. [**Burst Damage**](URL This primarily refers to the amount of damage the build can put out during the short window after a boss has been stunned, or how quickly they can kill veteran and elite mobs. This area is dominated by the Dragonhunter and Chronomancer, with short burst combos that consistently deal enormous amounts of damage. I don't include Weaver in S tier because its burst takes a bit too long to complete without Quickness, and the amount of damage it does is highly variable. [**Sustained DPS**](URL This area focuses on how each build performs in long duration boss fights. While I always avoid posting world boss benchmarks for each class, because it can be misleading and sustained DPS is not as important as it is in other PvE content, I feel that showing this DPS ranking can still be valuable. Only self-generated boons and buffs are taken into account for this ranking, and hitbox size and conditions on the boss are largely irrelevant factors in determining each build's position - that is to say, a Weaver against a small hitbox still belongs in S tier. Also, just because a build is low on this list does not mean that it is bad. A decently played Reaper or Soulbeast will still outperform the vast majority of players at bosses, and sustained DPS scenarios are not widespread. [**Ranged Damage**](URL The builds fall into a wide spectrum in this area. The takeaway from this should be that the builds in S and A tier can function well with range as their primary goal, while Holosmith and Spellbreaker have no ranged capabilities whatsoever. The range of the weapon itself, as well as synergy with the rest of the build, is also taken into account when ordering the builds in this area. This is why Soulbeast outranks Dragonhunter despite the latter doing more raw damage; Dragonhunter's Scepter is only 900 range, and traps require standing in melee, whereas Soulbeast's Longbow is 1500+ range, and it can self-buff at any range. [**Cleave**](URL The builds are fairly well-balanced in this area. Most of them have great cleave on the majority of their abilities, while Deadeye lags behind, but Sword/Pistol keeps it out of C tier. Staff Weaver dominates cleave scenarios with its many ranged AoE abilities, allowing it to influence the greatest total area of a battlefield. Note that this area is not necessarily the same as ""tagging,"" which requires a specific kind of fast-acting cleave; while Weaver is at the top of cleaving in general, it is not always the best at ""tagging"" groups of weak enemies, because most of its skills are slow to begin dealing damage. [**Killing Spree**](URL This area references the build's ability to rapidly move from one mob to the next in an open field scenario, like going on a killing spree. Ability cooldowns are the largest influence on this ranking, and the three scholar professions suffer from weaker autoattacks and relatively long cooldowns on their hard-hitting abilities. Classes in A tier have strong autoattacks and/or low-cooldown spammable abilities, with Soulbeast ranking high because of its range, which allows it to start dealing damage to a mob earlier than any other build can. The dominant builds in this area are Dragonhunter and Deadeye. Both of these builds actively benefit from a killing spree environment because their F1 abilities provide significant damage bonuses and refresh when they kill their target, in addition to having reliable ranged weapons. This removes any waiting period between targets. [**Control Effects**](URL Otherwise known as Crowd Control or CC, this area tracks each build's capability to break a defiance bar, interrupt enemies, group them together, or lock them down for a time. Chronomancer specifically dominates defiance bar breaking with Signet of Humility and Diversion in addition to Greatsword 5 and Sword 4. Holosmith and Herald excel at controlling crowds of mobs, literally Crowd Control. Dragonhunter and Reaper sit in A tier because their otherwise phenomenal CC skills have lengthy cooldowns. [**Avoidance Tools**](URL This area summarizes each build's ability to avoid or mitigate incoming attacks. It includes blocks, invulnerability, evasion outside of standard dodges, Blinding enemies, Stability, damage reduction, and other methods of preventing a hit from affecting you or reducing its effect. Every class has at least decent capability in this area. [**Recovery Tools**](URL This area shows each build's ability to recover from being hit by abilities. It includes healing, health sustain over time, stunbreaks, and condition cleansing, and the relative value of these abilities. For instance, Dragonhunter's healing trap provides an enormous heal on a decently low cooldown, *and* it also Blinds enemies to mitigate their next attack, so the Dragonhunter generally keeps its health for a little bit. Herald and Deadeye, with the exact builds I've listed, generally do not have many decent ways of recovering from control effects, many conditions, or large bursts of damage. However, it is important to remember that they are at the top of the Avoidance Tools ranking, so they're definitely not hopelessly vulnerable. Deadeye can take Invigorating Precision to immediately jump to A tier. [**Simplicity**](URL Last but not least, here's how the builds stand with regard to their simplicity, or how easy they are to get consistent results with. For a lot of builds, the playstyle is straightforward; you just press the buttons that do the things you want, and you don't have to worry about managing anything else. But for Holosmith, careful management of Heat adds a dimension of constant pressure, not only to avoid overheating but also to avoid overcooling, and is thus forced into a rigid clock which can be inconvenient depending on the scenario. Weaver operates on memorizing dozens of weapon skills and knowing when and how best to use each one, because whiffing an important ability with a long cooldown is severely punishing, but not using it at all can just as easily get you killed. --- --- Thank you to everyone who has reached out to me to let me know my efforts are valued, and thank you to the great discussions that open up and evolve when I make these kinds of posts in /r/GuildWars2Builds.

I am generally satisfied with these builds as they are, and I present them as ""finished"" for other players to reference. However, if you'd like to make a small suggestion you believe would benefit a particular build, drop a comment below. If you have a build which you enjoy in open world, share it in the comments as well, especially if you have a different set of goals in mind."
108,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Budget Viper's Gear Setup,11,7rbgfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7rbgfi/budget_vipers_gear_setup/,2018-01-19 04:47:09,"Hello everyone. I was wondering if anyone had put together a budget viper's gear setup for the different meta builds. Spending the money on exotic Viper's gear does not seem worth it since you cannot swap it around between characters and it is quite expensive (~10g per item). I was thinking of what a budget viper setup might be to get started with raiding/fractals if you wanted to run condi. As an example I threw together a budget Firebrand build. For the actual build I swapped out the ascended weapons/armor for exotic because budget. You can use ascended weapons if you would like and the comparison still holds. The only non budget parts of the build are the sigils. I also used Ascended Trinkets because those should be easy enough to get for everyone. Let me know what you think and if you have some tips to improve the budget build(s) further or submit you own for the other condi builds: Warrior, Necro, etc. **Firebrand build from Snow Crows (no food/utility) (~80g):** URL URL **Budget build (Viper's Weapons w/ Some Sinister Armor) (~40g):** URL *Sinister and Viper Pieces:* URL *Carrion Armor Pieces:* URL **Budget build (No Viper's Weapons w/ Some Sinister) (~21g):** URL *Weapons:* Axe: URL Scepter: URL Torch: URL FYI: I didn't include the cost of the sigils in the prices mentioned above. The first budget build, I know, is not extremely cheap but if you sacrifice some damage by replacing the Viper's weapons with Rampager or Carrion (last build above) you can save about 19g bringing the cost down to 21g which isn't bad. Also, if you have a Berserker you can use the helmet from that because it has Sinister stats and save about 5g that way. EDIT: I chose Firebrand because it's the condi build with the most limited set of conditions. Most others have poison, bleeding, chill, torment etc. but Firebrand is mainly just burning with some vulnerability. What this means is you can use things that increase burning duration only and achieve good results as opposed to relying on condition duration (expertise). What this also means is you can use Balthazar runes instead of using trapper/nightmare runes to get good burning duration. EDIT 2: As mentioned by some others, you can use Rabid gear instead of Carrion as long as higher toughness isn't an issue. Precision scales better with condi builds compared to power. You can even swap some of the sinister pieces out for rabid/carrion but I wouldn't go too crazy gutting power because, while it doesn't scale the best for condi builds, it does still add some to damage."
109,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[LN] - Sabetha 10man Off Meta Comp - 5:28 Left,72,7s0uq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7s0uq1/ln_sabetha_10man_off_meta_comp_528_left/,2018-01-22 08:53:42,"Hey Guys, after our recent 5-Man Sabetha we wanted to test the viability of a similar composition in a 10-Man scenario, which resulted in this kill. The early stages were a bit rough, since people had to adjust their positioning around Firebrand and Renegade skills. We decided to swap a druid for a warrior and tested if it would reach similar results. So if you still want to run a similar composition, you can swap to a druid instead of a warrior, but that also resulted in slightly less dps. Be mindfull though you have no dedicated healer and rely solely on the renegade and your own ability to divert hard hitting mechanics, making it a learn to play issue making us default back to our initial composition: * 2x Warriors (1x cannon jumper) * 2x Necros (one as a kite, second to bounce epidemic) * 2x Firebrands * 2x Revenants * 1x Holosmith * 1x Soulbeast (cannon jumper) After some practice and coordination, we made progress and hit competitive numbers. which is a good showcase that this composition is on equal terms to the current standard meta. We could've pushed it even further and grinded a faster time, but we felt this was not the point. Here some small changes we also made compared to our 5-Man: * Banner of Tactics - To ensure buffs would be more consistent overall * Frost replaced Storm Spirit - Vulnerability wasnt as much of an issue in the 10 man scenario * Holosmith - For buffing the condi classes with pinpoint. * EA and Phalanx (cannon jumper) * Burning Arrows and Powerful Synergie (platform warrior) [In case you havent seen it yet, our 5-Man Post](URL _man_sabetha_kill_no_druid_or/?sort=confidence&amp;sh=a4112cef&amp;st=jc98ns1k )) PoVs: * [Support Firebrand (Reni) ](URL * [Kite Scourge (Reema)](URL * [Support Renegade (Sofn)](URL * [Support Renegade (Trollpatsch)](URL * [DPS Holosmith (Flaschor)](URL * [Soulbeast (Timson)](URL * [DPS Scourge (Farbstoff)](URL greets Farbstoff "

111,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Boon/Condition Conversion Speculation,0,7thcjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7thcjx/booncondition_conversion_speculation/,2018-01-28 12:58:03,"Hello all, I thought it would be interesting to discuss the possible changes we might see on the coming february 6th update. There will be changes in the way boons convert to conditions and vice versa, so it might be cool to see what will be changed. We also know that regeneration will be prioritized, but I'm not sure what that will mean. Regardless, below is the current conversion table, boons to conditions and vice versa: Boon|Condition :--|:-- Aegis|1 Burning 3s Fury|1 Blind 5s Might|1 Weakness 10s Protection|3 Vulnerability 10s Quickness|1 Slow 3s Regeneration|1 Poison 10s Resistance|1 Chilled 3s Retaliation|3 Confusion 5s Stability|1 Fear 1s Swiftness|1 Crippled 10s Vigor|3 Bleeding 10s Condition|Boon :--|:-- Bleeding|1 Vigor 10s Burning|1 Aegis 5s Confusion|1 Retaliation 5s Poison|1 Regeneration 5s Torment|1 Might 10s Blind|1 Fury 5s Chilled|1 Resistance 2s Crippled|1 Swiftness 10s Fear|1 Stability 3s Immobilized|1 Swiftness 10s Slow|1 Quickness 3s Taunt|1 Resistance 2s Weakness|1 Might 10s Vulnerability|1 Protection 3s Now, what I think they'll do is make the following changes. 1. Alacrity will become a boon: This only makes sense. Not only does it make classes like the Chronomancer less all-encompassing when it comes to group buffing, but it also buffs the Revenant and other future elite specialisations that will make use of Alacrity. Alacrity is too powerful to be given to only 2 classes, and it makes sense to make this effect boon-sharable similar to how Quickness was changed a few years ago. If they don't do this now, then I expect them to do it later down the line. 2. Conditions to Boons will receive a major overhaul: Currently, you can have a SHIT TON of conditions on you, and the boons you'll get are abysmal in comparison. Having 20 stacks of bleeding on you should not convert to a meagre 10 seconds of vigor... The amount of damage you clean off of yourself should be equal in the amount of buffing you recieve. I'm not sure how they'll do this, but I'm confident we'll see the ability to get a significant amount of boons from proper cleansing. 3. Regeneration will become stackable: This has so many applications that it is ridiculous. It could create a LOT more viable sustained healing builds, as there are a lot of professions that can share a large amount of regeneration. I think it makes a lot of sense in the current game, and I'm surprised we haven't seen it yet. To make up for this, base regeneration will probably heal less than it currently does. So, what are your thoughts? What will change exactly in your opinion? "
112,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[Suggestion] New specialization Necromancer Tyrant,0,7ttjo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7ttjo7/suggestion_new_specialization_necromancer_tyrant/,2018-01-30 03:41:12,"With the ANnet expansion team hard at work I figured I would drop in my two cents on a new necro spec. It is a buff/healer spec utilizing minions as mobile damage/banners. **The Tyrant As the battle wanes, their power waxes** The Tyrant is a necromancer specialization that leads an ever growing army of skeletal minions into battle. They wield a focus in their main hand and shield in their off. They use orders to enhance their minions and allies. Profession Mechanic: Minions Life Force is no longer used to power death shroud instead it is used to power the creation of the Tyrants new minions. A Tyrant will automatically summon one new passive minion every five seconds as long as they have the life force to control it. A Tyrant can control a number of minions equal to their current life force/2250 rounded down. At 0 life force a Tyrant will have no minions. The Tyrants first minion will appear at 2250 Life Force. While out of combat a Tyrants life force will drain rapidly. **Profession Mechanic** The Necromancers death shroud F1 skill is replaced by a series of minion commands. * Melee (F1): Send one minion to attack an enemy in melee. Prioritizes passive minions then melee minions not attacking your target then ranged minions finally channeling minions * Ranged (F2): Send one minion to attack and enemy at ranged. Prioritizes passive minions then ranged minions not attacking your target then melee minions finally channeling minions * Channel (F3): Target a ground location, a minion moves to that location and begins channeling. Any allies near (900 range) will gain the effects of the tyrants order skills (affects up to 10 targets). * Return (F4): Returns a minion to passive state. * Detonate (F5): Detonate one of your active minions dealing damage to all surrounding enemies. Serves as a blast finisher also triggers all death shroud traits. Consumes 4500 life force. Minion Skills: * Melee: Deals damage and cripples target * Ranged: deals damage and cripples target * Channel: Causes Order skills to be copied to Allies. Passive minions are invincible, cannot be detonated and will follow the Tyrant if possible. Passive minions are the first to dissipate when the tyrants life force pool drops below the requirement for the number of minions they have in play. Current minions will benefit from the traits **Weapon Skills** * Focus (Main-Hand) * Splintering Spirit Light: Cone Skill damages and bleeds enemies, heals allies. Hits 3 targets. Healing is doubled if you are in range of a channeling minion. * Ghost Mirror: Ground Target. Heals Allies in the area when your minions attack. * Vengeful Circle of Warding: Heal and give retaliation and Agis to yourself and nearby allies in a circle around you (hits 3 targets + yourself) * Shield (Off-Hand) * Horrifying Adrenaline: Create a bubble that fears enemies and grants alacrity to allies. * Wall of Tar: Create a barrier that absorbs enemy projectiles and causes allys ranged attacks that pass through it to cause slow. **Utility Skills: Orders** * Order of the Vampire: Healing Skill. Your minions attacks drain life from their target healing you each time they attack. You lose life force each time you are healed. * Order of Pain: Your minions gain retaliation each time they attack. You lose life force each time a minion gains might. * Order of Rage: Your minions gain fury each time they attack. You lose life force each time a minion gains fury. * Order of Undeath: Your minions attacks no longer cripple their target but, you gain life force each time they attack. * Order of Hunger: Your minions gain quickness each time they attack. You lose life force each time a minion gains quickness. * Order of Apostasy: Your minions strip one boon each time they attack. You lose life force each time a boon is stripped. **Traits** * Minor Proficiency: You can wield main hand Focus and off-hand Shield items * Adept Traits * **Minor Trait** * Tyrant of The Void: You gain access to the Minion Summon ability which allows you to use life force to create an army of minions. * **Major Traits** * Boon of Creation: You gain +25 healing power for each minion you have * Empowerment: You gain +30 concentration for each minion you have. * Explosive Growth: When you summon a minion deal damage to 5 foes near that minion * Master Traits * **Minor Trait** * Your Orders also cause minions to gain might when they attack * **Major Traits** * Shelter: Your Minions set to channel grant barrier every three seconds to an ally below 50% health. * Ritual Lord: Boons you apply last 20% longer. * Clamor of Souls: Minion Attacks deal damage to target and adjacent enemies. Order Skills cause minion attacks to inflict vulnerability. * Grandmaster Traits * **Minor Trait** * Minions that die copy their boons to all surrounding allies. * **Major Traits** * Restoration: Setting a minion to channel causes them to heal allies every 3 seconds (healing also effects downed players) * Ghostly Haste: Order skills also apply alacrity to allies when they attack * Destruction: Your Order Skills cause damage to enemies adjacent to them.

113,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Idea for next Mesmer elite spec,0,7ueh1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7ueh1q/idea_for_next_mesmer_elite_spec/,2018-02-01 10:52:41,"Hello, I am main Mesmer and love to play mesmer. Enjoyed Chronomancer and enjoying Mirage so far. So I have been thinking about next mesmer elite spec, what can be done for it. We have support mesmer elite which is Chrono, we have now condi dps elite spec Mirage. What I wanna do now is between these 2, something like Firebrand. Can support (quickness) and can do damage (burn) at the same time. So here is the idea: - Spec name: Eidolon - Description: Eidolon is an elite specialization for the mesmer that focuses on glyph skills and allows them to swap between yin and yang state. It also allows the mesmer to use hammer. List of Eidolon Skills: Profession Mechanic: Mesmer can now swap between Yin and Yang state by pressing F5 (icon above dodge bar like Beastmode, when in Yin so icon will be light purple color, indication to swap to yang (bright) state and if yang icon will be dark purple, indication to swap to yin (dark) state. Swapping between two state will have cooldown of 25 seconds.) Hammer Skills: (When Yin) - [1] 1/2 sec casting time 0 sec cooldown - Bash your foe [1] 1/2 sec casting time 0 sec cooldown - Bash your foe again and apply vulnerability. [1] 1/4 sec casting time and 0 sec cooldown - Greater bash that knock your foe down for 1 second. - [2] 3/4 sec casting time 10 secs cooldown - Spin around and damage foes, reflect projectiles - [3] 1 sec casting time 12 secs cooldown - Clone Skill - Throws hammer at your foe, upon hitting apply 1/2 seconds of mini stun i.e. interrupt any casting and create clone at the target location. - [4] 3/4 sec casting time 20 secs cooldown - Phastasm Skill - Throws hammer and damage your foe with critical strike, if it hits it create Phantasm Hammer Smasher. Phastasm will give 3 stacks of might every 10 seconds to you. - [5] 1 sec casting time 25 secs cooldown - Throws hammer at your target location that will create a ring of 400 radius, all boons will be ripped off from the foes and will be transfered to you. (When Yang) - [1] 1/2 sec casting time 0 sec cooldown - Bash your foe (will be 30% lesser damage than yin hammer damage) and heal your allies for the amount of damage done within 300 radius [1] 1/4 sec casting time 0 sec cooldown - Bash your foe again (will be 30% lesser damage than yin hammer damage) and heal your allies for the amount of damage done within 500 radius [1] 1(1/4) sec casting time and 0 sec cooldown - Greater bash (will be 30% lesser damage than yin hammer damage) that heals your allies within 600 radius and remove 1 random condition. - [2] 3/4 sec casting time 14 secs cooldown - Teleport to your target location leaving mark on your previous location, you can return to your previous location within 5 seconds or else mark will disappear. - [3] 1 sec casting time 20 secs cooldown - Clone Skill - Throws hammer at your foe (will be 30% lesser damage than yin hammer damage), upon hitting create a clone at target location that will execute the yang hammer chain attack. - [4] 3/4 sec casting time 25 secs cooldown - Phantasm Skill - Throws hammer and damage your foe, if it hits it create Phantasm Hammer Warden. Phastasm will give Protection every 15 seconds to you and allies within 400 radius. - [5] 1 sec casting time 30 secs cooldown - Create a ring around you of 400 radius, that gives aegis to you and allies every pulse. Pulses: 3, Pulse Interval: 6 seconds. Slot Skills: - Healing Skill: 1 Sec casting time 25 secs cooldown (When Yin) Heal yourself for 7000 healing and gain 5 stacks of might (when Yang) Heal you and allies around in 300 radius for 5000 healing. You and allies also gain protection. - Ultility Skills: Most of the utilities I thought are already in game either for druid or guardian. Well I can leave this to you guys then :p - Elite Skill: 1/2 secs casting time 75 secs cooldown (When Yin) Increase your power damage by 200 for 6 seconds. (When Yang) Increase your healing power by 200 for 6 seconds. Eidolon Trats: Minor Proficiency - You can weild Hammer. Minor Adept - Gain access to glyphs. You can switch between Yin/Yang. Major Adept - Swapping Yin/Yang state removes conditions from you. Major Adept - Shattering Phantasm will deal extra damage and you are healed 200 x number of phastasm shattered. Major Adept - Glyphs gain reduced recharge. Minor Master - Boons on you last longer while wielding hammer (Boon duration increased: 5%). Major Master - Reduces the duration of movement-impairing conditions. Your movement speed is increased by 33% as long as you have none of the movement-impairing conditions. Major Master - Gain Concentration 100 x Number of active boons. Major Master - Gain Toughness 100 x Number of active illusions. Minor Grandmaster (10 secs Recharge Time) - Whenever you gain boon, you share with your allies within 600 radius. Major Grandmaster - Critical hits will heal you and allies for 150 health points. Major Grandmaster - Reduce recharge on Hammer skills. Hammer skills will do 3% more damage. Major Grandmaster (20 secs Recharge Time) - Shattering Illusions will grant buff based on state. If Yin you gain Power 100 x Number of Illusions shattered or if Yang you gain Healing Power 100 x Number of Illusions shattered for 5 seconds."
114,vulnerability,Guildwars2,A trait idea to help Power Mesmer (and possibly even Power Mirage) actually be able to become a thing post-revamp,14,7uxkr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7uxkr7/a_trait_idea_to_help_power_mesmer_and_possibly/,2018-02-03 16:45:31,"The idea is a Major trait mechanic that works as follows: When you apply Vulnerability to a target who's currently at 25/max stacks, you inflict damage to that target based on the amount of Vulnerability stacks you would have otherwise applied. (Damage per vulnerability stack: # ) So, against a fully-condi'd raid boss, not only would your own sword autos be dealing just a little bit more damage in general, but this would also allow your sword clones to technically deal power damage (though not as much as 3 swordsman, but I think being able to use Mind Wrack actually makes up for that loss quite a bit), since the first two atks of sword auto inflict vulni (they could also allow sword clones to inflict 3x vulni on the third atk against foes with no boons, since the player's own 3rd sword auto has a similar mechanic where it deals bonus damage to foes with no boons). You could put this trait somewhere in the Domination line, since that spec deals a lot with vulni and interruption, along with power damage in general. Maybe replace Furious Interruption with it (seeing as how nobody really ever uses that trait lol). URL This could work for sustained damage not only because of Mesmer's sources of vulnerability on their own, but also because both the Domination trait line and Mantra of Pain reward the player for striking their target at specific times (inflict vulni when you interrupt + inflict vulni when you target is not attacking/activating skills). There's actually some level of skill involved in getting the most damage you can do this way, due to the synergy this trait would have with all your situational sources of Vulnerability. Now... most people don't really know this about Mirage, but the Sword Ambush skill, Mirage Thrust, not only has an interrupt (1/4sec) but also generates a clone at your starting position. So not only do you have a consistent, low-CD source of clone generation with this ambush skill, but you also have access to consistent, low-CD interrupts from yourself AND all 3 of your clones. Now think about how that synergizes with the rest of the Domination trait line and you'll realize just how strong that could be. So just for simplicity's sake, and perhaps as some sort of ""tl;dr"", here's a relatively simple example of what this kind of Major trait could look like: ---------------------------------- **=Mind Fracture=** *Applying Vulnerability to a foe that exceeds the threshold deals damage to that foe based on the number of Stacks that would have been inflicted.* *Vulnerability Threshold:* 25 *Damage per Stack:* ### ----------------------------------- A utility skill setup with this trait in mind would go as follows: Mantra of Pain, Mantra of Distraction, and either Mirror Images or Signet of Illusions."

Numbers are subject to change; none of this includes the PvP version of Traits/Skills etc. This is probably a mess.** This is not intended to be about only buffing people - since Chronomancers already cover the best buffs in the game - but instead is more of a Battle Bard approach. One of the smaller themes behind this was Duality, given the Lyssa shoutout. **Weapon:** OH Sceptre - ""Tuning Chime"" &gt; ""Lyssa's Song"" * 4 - Aria of Harmony &gt; Aria of Dischord (Grant yourself and allies around you Fury and Quickness &gt; Inflict enemies in a cone in front of you with Vulnerability and Weakness - already Weakened enemies are instead Dazed.) * 5 - Crescendo (Deal damage around you and grant nearby allies Alacrity.

118,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Healing is the Bomb 2: Cleansing Boon-galoo,46,7vxpqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7vxpqk/healing_is_the_bomb_2_cleansing_boongaloo/,2018-02-08 04:25:43,"Hey all! A while back I posted a silly guide on why Healing Engineers can potentially be the greatest healing class in the game which you can [check out here](URL With the new balance patch, Engineers have received a bunch of changes to traits - including the two core trait lines for a healing engineer. These changes are actually ridiculously strong (in certain condition heavy cases)! With the update, Engineer has cemented itself as the ultimate condition cleansing/converting machine. Its an incredibly niche concept considering for it to succeed you need to be getting bombarded with conditions. It might have a niche place in PvE scenarios with heavy condition output, but potentially shine in PvP and WvW where conditions are thrown around like nobodies business. As a result of it revolving around condition conversion, boon duration is now vital to making the build work. Therefore a full build of Harriers gear would be best suited to achieve 100% boon duration in PvE and something much tankier for something like WvW. This build will have less raw healing than the previous one, however that does not matter at all because there will be boons (including a butt load of Regeneration) flying all over the place! [Here is a quick link to what the build would look like with 100% boon duration](URL but with old traits - I will go into detail regarding the new changes that make the build. When the site updates, I will update this link! Please know that any values shown in the screenshots are based on 100% boon duration. Since this build has you not hitting enemies, I believe that the second Transference sigil is worth a lot more than the extra small healing you get from a Water sigil. Also the numerical values on heals might vary as I did not factor in the +250 Healing Power gained when you have Regeneration on you in some of the screenshots or use food. This build revolves all around cleansing conditions and triggering the new meme trait [Purity of Purpose](URL - ArenaNet the absolute madmen. However, what might seem like a joke is now what makes this build so strong. The build revolves around removing conditions from allies and providing loads of boons in the process. So from here on out - bare in mind that when I say Condition Cleanse, it actually means Boon Generating based on that list. First up, the one and only Healing Turret. Already a fantastic skill, the new trait synergy puts Healing Turret in overdrive! With the new traits [Reconstruction Closure](URL [Cleansing Synergy](URL and [Anticorrosion Plating](URL - Healing Turret now heals ~7000 raw health, cleanses 3 conditions, grants 5 seconds of Protection and 16 seconds of Regeneration to 5 allies on a 15 second cooldown. But wait, there's more! With [Comeback Cure](URL by removing conditions your Regeneration duration is now 24 seconds with every Healing Turret use! That's about 7000 extra healing over the course of those 24 seconds. With [Over Shield](URL the pre-existing trait that grants Protection on Shield skill use, you have an additional 2 additional Condition Cleanses that provides 6 seconds of Protection. By triggering Anticorrosion Plating with a Shield skill, you also trigger Comeback Cure! So now your shield skills also grant 7.75 seconds of Regeneration giving ~2300 healing as well. With Healing Turret and the 2 Shield Skills, you have 17-18 seconds of Protection uptime with cooldowns of 15/20/24 seconds to maintain them. That's 100% Protection Uptime with Alacrity (and almost 100% without), provided you don't detonate your Healing Turret! You can probably see the pattern here - any time you remove Vulnerability from an ally, you also apply Protection, which means you remove an additional condition/generate another boon from you ally which means you also trigger an additional stack of regeneration! If you somehow get lucky and keep removing Vulnerability with the condition cleanse you gain from granting Protection, you will keep removing conditions and therefore stack hours of regeneration on you allies. Next, we take Elixir Gun. Elixir Gun 3 and 5 are condition cleanses - [Fumigate](URL in particular cleansing 5 different conditions from 5 targets over its duration. As you can imagine, this gets really really strong when combined with situations involving a condition being applied rapidly over and over again - lets say for example oh I don't know, chill from an ice field. If your target stands in an ice field and gets 5 stacks of chill applied to him that you remove 5 times, you are granting that person 30 SECONDS OF ALACRITY. If there are 5 other people standing in that ice field and you are hitting them with Fumigate, that is 150 seconds of outgoing Alacrity. In theory that sounds amazing and gamebreaking and you may as well just delete your Chronos now, especially since Fumigate is on a 12 second cooldown. Imagine the Regeneration gain from a poison cloud, aegis spam from a fire field, protection out the wazoo from stuff like Air Glyph of Storms! Unfortunately in my testing, there has to be perfect timing on the Engineer's behalf to always trigger the condition cleanse the instant after the condition is reapplied so that it does not miss an instance of the condition. During my brief test it was more like ~12 seconds for alacrity from an ice field because Fumigate would trigger the next cleanse too quickly for the field to reapply it and therefore wasting precious boon generation. With [Super Elixir](URL (EG Skill 5) you also get a strong heal that you can blast for an additional condition cleanse and conversion, which is handy because [Acid Bomb](URL (EG Skill 4) is a blast finisher! The final skill that is vital to the build is maybe not one you'd expect - Elixir C. Elixir C is a pretty neat skill already that converts every condition you have on you into a boon, following of course the same rules as Purity of Purpose. Except there's one little thing that I hope, I pray to ArenaNet hope, is not a bug. **Elixir C (and Toss Elixir C) stacks with Purity of Purpose - the boons generated from converting a condition has double the duration/stacks - effectively 200% duration boons!** So every boon listed above gets applied twice - for example cleansing 1 stack of Chill can give 11.5 seconds of Alacrity! Cleansing Bleeding will grant the recipient 39 seconds of Vigor! Removing Immobilise grants 8 seconds of Resistance! Getting rid of Weakness or Torment gives 6 stacks of Might, Et cetera et cetera you can see the numbers there and hopefully work out how ridiculous it is to have some of those duration boons. Sadly your only way of triggering it on allies is through Toss Elixir C which only cleanses 3 conditions. But it is on a 20 second cooldown, meaning with Alacrity it goes down to 15 seconds. In the incredibly unlikely scenario where it cleanses Slow, Chill and Blind, you have the potential to generate 12 seconds of Alacrity, 12 seconds of Quickness and 20 seconds of Fury. The rest of the build is pretty flexible - you have some pretty good options from each trait line as well as options for a free utility and elite skills. Explosives gives you access to [Blasting Zone](URL which isn't a great trait but this build does have a lot of blast finishers so spamming 40 second duration (single) stacks of might isn't terrible. Combined with Big Boomer you get an a little bit extra umpth behind your feeble damage output. Shrapnel would be the most likely alternative for the final trait. Firearms allows you to take Pinpoint Distribution to buff your Condi focused allies which is handy buff to have in group content. With Harrier gear you're not going to be doing much condition damage yourself so the other traits don't necessarily benefit you that much. Scrapper would be amazing in the same situations that I highlighted in the last post - when you have allies that die a lot. Combine Function Gyro, Bulwark Gyro and Toss Elixir R and nobody should be dying on your watch. The new barrier traits also give you a bit more suvivability which is handy since you have very little to protect yourself with. Toolkit for the block could also serve the same purpose. Holosmith would be neat since it'd give you an actually okay main-hand power weapon to use along side your shield and the Spectrum Shield/Hard Light Arena and Photon Wall could have some decent synergy with a support playstyle as well as improve your ability to survive, however I have yet to test this myself (but I will definitely check out soon). But sadly... its probably too niche. I love this build. It is very silly and I love the idea of seeing my friends running around with a full bar of boons because I cleansed them. It has the potential to be absolutely amazing and overpowered but it is just so niche and requires such precise conditions (heh) to succeed at what it is amazing at. In PvE, it is trapped between the Might generation of a Druid and the Alacrity generation of a Renegade. It could potentially replace Healing Elementalists, since it provides a crazy amount of passive healing with all the different sources of Regeneration it puts out in exchange for the healing that you get from autoattacking in Water. In certain Dungeons and Fractals were conditions are an absolute pain it could really shine. In raids, maybe against Matthias, Slothasor, Xera and Soulless Horror? The number of situations this build would be beneficial over a current meta build is very small. In PvP and WvW where the condition spam is real, this could be really strong. Yet despite the numerous avenues of triggering Purity of Purpose, I am doubtful that it could realistically keep up with the sheer amount of conditions flying around in large group fights on a borderlands. And then there's the biggest problem of them all, someone else removing the conditions you want to convert! Most people have some form of cleanse available and will most certainly use them to stay alive which is not good for you. Also, removing conditions with some of the skills listed can be finicky - Fumigate and Toss Elixir C can be completely wiffed if you aim them incorrectly or people don't line up for them. I hope Anet doesn't remove/nerf the interaction between Elixir C and PoP (surely they realised it in testing and it isn't an unintended bug?) because I am having a lot of fun running around giving everyone boons, and I hope you potentially give this build a try even without the 100% boon duration. Thanks for reading! TL;DR - Engineers have niche heal/support build based on converting conditions into boons however whether it will work remains to be seen."
119,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Chrono after change,3,7kac89,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7kac89/chrono_after_change/,2017-12-17 10:22:39,So now that we share aegis instead of blur. I was wondering. Is illusions and chaos superior to domination now or are they all kind of equal? Ive always loved the crazy amounts of boons you can Pump out with chaos. And of course illusions is better for phantasm damage. But I feel like domination still yields useful perks and has the benefit of basically an extra 12% damage on most bosses with vulnerability 
120,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[SC] Updated Benchmarks 12.12.2017,381,7kda0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7kda0q/sc_updated_benchmarks_12122017/,2017-12-17 22:09:17,"####Hello everyone, This patch didnt have major balance changes. However, the main changes this patch were: Vulnerability, Distortion and some adjustments to Condition Damage. You can see most of the class changes below that we felt were important to highlight in this recent patch. While capping Vulnerability is still easily achievable on almost all encounters it is not as easy as before. #**Distortion** Inspiring Distortion now shares Aegis without internal cooldown instead of distortion. This is a buff and nerf at the same time depending on the encounter. The main issue with this is at Vale Guardian, however with Stone Spirit and a Harrier Druid you can easily out-heal the green explosion. Gorseval remains unchanged as Aegis happily replaces the distortion to prevent the KD from his slam and you can even have a better rotation as chrono now allowing you to distort eggs. As for Deimos, this encounter has changed a little as you just need to make sure you are only inside one of the pizza slices during his KD attack. This goes on for every old boss where distortion used to be a thing and we have the more specific changes on the mesmer guide. #Class Specific Changes ###**Ranger** **Condition Druid** Changes to torch skills that impacted its burst potential, shifted the meta from Quickdraw to Light on your Feet. Ramp up time is much faster and due to the burst potential it has, makes Quickdraw redundant in every iteration of condition-based build. **Power Druid** Buffs to GS skills merely leveled the playing field, and made it a competitive choice in longer fights where extra CA is generated via multiple glyph procs. Due to the low burst nature, and extremely slow CA generation in low pressure fights, this is not a recommended weapon for every encounter, but it can be used as a niche pick. Changes to vulnerability in this patch shifted FoTM meta towards Power-based builds, and Storm Spirit became mandatory which resulted in more CC for Druids overall. **Condition Soulbeast** We can finally cap Bleeding via 3 Spiteful Infusions. Rotation remained the same, ramp up time is slightly longer, but overall DPS didnt change. **Power Soulbeast** Dont get too excited just yet. While a lot of Druids seem to be thriving because of the Power-based build meta, were sorry to say that Bearbow will not be visiting PvE just yet. While these buffs are showing a great future for Power Soulbeast, well have to wait for another patch before we start using this build. Outside of the initial burst, this build doesnt have that much to offer, and is falling behind other Power builds by not so marginal difference. ###**Elementalist** **Power Weaver** Most notable patch change is the removal of Weak Spot which hurt our vulnerability application outside of Glyph of Storms, Frost Volley and Primordial Stance. This doesnt affect Raids at all though, its mostly in Fractals where it matters. Other non recent patch changes are improvements to the same build such as Ice Bow and Lightning Hammer appear to be mostly equal to each other, with Lightning Hammer having a higher damage potential but more RNG and Ice Bow having a more consistent damage output especially on bigger hitboxes compared to Lightning Hammer. The question of Lightning Hammer vs Ice Bow comes down to rotational problems with one of the 2 conjures, the previously mentioned vuln application (for example on KC) and shifts in enemy toughness as seen on VG. ###**Guardian** **Power Dragonhunter** Nothing changed. **Condition Firebrand** They only changed that your axe auto-attack is slightly faster now and buffed Purging Flames. This patch does not change anything big dps wise for Firebrand, so you can reach the exactly same numbers as pre patch. Also the axe auto attack changes does not change your rotation at all. But you are able to min max your Build now, with using 3 Spiteful Infusions to cap Burning Duration. ###**Revenant** **Condition Renegade** Nothing changed for Condition Renegade on this Patch. We just added Invocation Benchmarks and Benchmarks for Big Hitboxes. We compared 18 Malign vs 18 Spiteful Infusions on Golem and also 9 Malign and 9 Spiteful Infusions, but we ended up with the same DPS on each variant. So it doesnt matter which setup your are running. ###**Mesmer** **Power Chronomancer** With the introduction of Mystical Infusions Chronomancers optimal raid gear changed. This affects personal DPS by around 2%. Also with changing distortion share to give Aegis and not distortion, Domination/Inspiration is not the go to build on every boss it used to be before. This specific change makes especially Vale Guardian a more druid related fight since you cant distort the green anymore but it can be outheal. **Condition Mirage** The axe ambush got buffed and brought the mirage back to being a dps spec. The clone build is now again the better of the 2 builds. The change in condition ramp up didn't affect mirage at all. With the new Spiteful infusions it's now possible to cap condi duration but also makes it a nightmare to gear up a mirage since 18 spiteful infusion are needed on clone mirage but not phantasm mirage. ###**Engineer** **Condition Engineer** With the possible Spiteful infusion and the changes to Tools, condition engineers dps got a slight buff. The condition rump up changes only affected 2 skills which in the end didnt change much. **Power Holosmith** It received a power option in its Firearms trait granting extra Ferocity. This change increased Holosmiths solo dps at the cost of Pinpoint Distribution. ###**Thief** **Condition Thief** Condi Thief remains unchanged and continues to excel on bosses it was previously taken for. **Power Thief** Power Thief, while not receiving a buff, is considerably less clunky to play due to the change to Weakening Charge. As it now no longer moves through the target, it can be used with target and without the need to constantly face downward with the camera. #Benchmarks For a full list, see [SC Benchmark](URL ###**Big Hitbox** Profession|Build|Top Number|Average DPS :-:|:-:|:-:|:-: [Weaver](URL Staff LH|[45.715](URL [Weaver](URL Staff LH|[45.029](URL [Weaver](URL Staff Ice Bow|[44.409](URL [Weaver](URL Staff Ice Bow|[43.305](URL [Renegade](URL with allies|[37.300](URL [Renegade](URL with allies|[33.500](URL [Dragonhunter](URL Radiance|[33.146](URL [Dragonhunter](URL Radiance|[31.797](URL ###**Small Hitbox** Profession|Build|Top Number|Average DPS :-:|:-:|:-:|:-: [Weaver](URL Staff|[37.169](URL [Weaver](URL Staff|[36.568](URL [Firebrand](URL UC|[35.900](URL [Mirage](URL build|[35.644](URL [Firebrand](URL Master of Consecrations|[34.300](URL [Soulbeast](URL Stance Share|[34.250](URL [Mirage](URL build|[34.158](URL [Holosmith](URL No Scope|[34.129](URL [Renegade](URL with allies|[33.500](URL [Holosmith](URL Pin Point|[33.190](URL [Engineer](URL [Renegade](URL with allies|[32.305](URL [Daredevil](URL with allies|[32.000](URL [Daredevil](URL Staff|[31.000](URL [Berserker](URL with Shattering Blow|[30.700](URL [Dragonhunter](URL Radiance|[30.676](URL [Scourge](URL Renegade|[30.400](URL Reaper|Condition Renegade|[30.300](URL [Berserker](URL without Shattering Blow|27.000| [Daredevil](URL without allies|25.000| [Renegade](URL rotation||[24k](URL [Druid](URL Wilderness Survival||[18.500](URL [Chronomancer](URL - Illusions||[14.216](URL [Chronomancer](URL - Illusions||[11.968](URL [Chronomancer](URL - Inspiration||[11.102](URL [Chronomancer](URL - Inspiration||[10.158](URL #SnowCrows.com We are currently working on our Wing 5 guides, but clearly these take time to figure out the optimal tactics for each encounter.

As before, I will be covering all of the professions from the Core Game, HoT and PoF focusing on both Power and Condition builds (where possible) with stat choices for gear presuming that you have access to all previous content. **Note:** If you would like more options for Power based builds then take a look [here](URL courtesy of /u/gayest_charr_ever WARNING: Wall of text ahead! **Build Criteria** I have set some basic criteria for the builds that I have tried to adhere as closely as possible to throughout: * Damage - Must be good or close to maximum where possible to fast clear mobs so as to avoid becoming un-necessarily bogged down. * Utility - This is limited to only a handful of builds and might include additional Vigor, Auras, Survivability or some group friendly support options. * Might - I have endeavored to make every build provide it's own Might so that it is self sufficient through Sigils, Runes, Fried Golden Dumplings and Traits. * Fury - Options were limited for this. * Vulnerability - Some builds were extremely limited in being able to do this effectively themselves and a Sigil of Frailty could be used for those that want to further supplement this. * Swiftness / Mobility for smoother transition in / out of combat and also to facilitate quicker disengages for mounting up. * Sigils of Bloodlust can be used in place of / cheaper option for Sigils of Force. * Sigils of Corruption can be used in place of / cheaper option for Sigils of Bursting. *** **Stats:** For those who don't have access to Sinister stat gear you can use Rabid stats to tide you over. Viper Gear can in most cases be replaced with a Trailblazer gear for a bit more survivability and a small DPS loss. *** **Consumables:** When it comes down to which consumables to use, there is no requirement as all builds work effectively without. I would also like to suggest some worthwhile alternatives, for a full list take a look at the wiki page **[here](URL * Fried Golden Dumplings can be replaced with Plate of Roasted Cactus (better suits strong Crit Dmg profs like Ele or Thief). * Bowl of Sweet and Spicy Butternut Squash Soup can be replaced with any other Power Food like Plate of Truffle Steak or Plate of Steak and Asparagus. * Rare Veggie Pizza can be swapped for Koi Cakes, Super Veggie Pizza, Garlic and Kale Sautee.

124,vulnerability,Guildwars2,With all the Open World PvE guides I've decided to share my Vamp Warrior Build! Gameplay included,53,7ogykg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7ogykg/with_all_the_open_world_pve_guides_ive_decided_to/,2018-01-06 15:10:56,"This build was invented for the reason that I just like Vamp/Life Steal mechanic, and that was the starting point in making this build. As the progress went, the build was upgraded, until I hit the final version. This version has high sustain, high damage, high defense, high CC, high mobility, high condition removal, a high number of stun break skills, and two most important factors: It is very cheap to build, and very fun to play! I will tell you my reasons for everything I did, this will come like a nice guide for you! Let's start with the build itself: URL **Gear**: Full Berserker, Exotic is absolutely fine, and if you do have Ascended gear it is even better! We want damage, and this gear is the best choice for us. For Open World PvE you do want to kill things fast, a defense will come in other forms! **Runes**: 4x Superior Rune of Vampirism, 2x Superior Rune of Scavenging If you didn't know, the (2) piece bonus from both runes stacks with each other! These runes are very fun, and they just further help in our sustain and armor-ignoring vamp (life steal) damage! You do lose +100 Power with this rune setup that is true, but I do not find it a big deal, this build has other ways to boost damage and get Power, and I am just too stubborn, I want my Vamp build! It is just natural I will do a weird thing like this! **Food**: Sharpening Stone and Omnomberry Ghost. Ofc, another way to steal life and to boost our damage. This isn't 100% needed, even I don't always use food when I am doing Open World PvE, but it is always good to know that these exist and that they will boost your damage and sustain. **Weapons and Sigils**: **Axe/Dagger** (Superior Sigil of Leeching and Superior Sigil of Bloodlust) - I went with this weapon setup because this setup gives you the greatest amount of AoE Vulnerability stacks. Vulnerability = more damage! Axe has the strongest Autoattack damage and this setup is mainly to boost your DPS. *Sigil of Leeching* is one more source of life stealing (armor-ignoring damage and sustain) and *Sigil of Bloodlust* is just too awesome to pass - it boosts your Power with each stack (+250 power at 25 stacks), and we all know there are many mobs to kill! :) **Mace/Axe** (Superior Sigil of Draining and Superior Sigil of Leeching) - I feel that Mace is just needed. PoF has many mobs with Defiance Bar and Boons like *Protection*. Interrupts are needed. **If you break Defiance Bar** that enemy will be stunned for few seconds and will take **50% additional damage for 5 seconds**. That is a very large boost in the damage! It is really important to abuse this mechanic while fighting Veteran, Elite or even Champion mobs! Mace will help you get rid of all those annoying boons and by destroying defiance bar, unlock your potential to do even more damage! Axe is there to give you Burst damage with (4) while also provide you with Quickness boon to increase your attack speed. Mace has strong auto attacks, its 3rd AA is a crazy burst damage! But it is a very slow weapon. *Axe (4)* will remove that nuisance and you will finally be able to auto attack with Mace in style! *Axe (5)* is very strong AoE damage, it is best used when you are surrounded by 3+ enemies. protip: use Kick before using Axe (5), it will greatly boost your dmg output! Mace has many interrupts, that is the reason for a *Sigil of Draining*, it just works with it! As you can see, this setup also has *Sigil of Leeching*, yes, we want Life Steal on every weapon swap! Another reason for these weapon setups is because of how mobs in PoF work (even HoT). There are many AoE attacks, many ground targeted skills which you want to avoid. If you haven't yet realized, every weapon setup has mobility boost included. *Axe (5)* boosts your mobility, and *Dagger (5)* also. In Video section you will see the importance of having mobility while fighting mobs. It is much easier to avoid damage if you have the constant mobility to dance around the danger. **Traits:** **Strength:** **Peak Performance** - it gives you a large boost in the dmg output, *[Kick]* will be your source of physical skill. Use *[Kick]* before using *Axe (4)* and *Axe (5)*. And before using *[Eviscerate]* and *Dagger (4)*. **Body Blow** - when having many ways to interrupt, you do want to make the best out of them! With this trait, you will put Weakness condition on your target, even if you do not interrupt them! Only using skills like Mace (3), Mace (Burst) and [Kick] is enough! I will come back to this to explain it further. **Might Makes Right** - I don't even care about Endurance so much, it is all about the healing! :D Great when combined with *[Eviscerate]* and *[Magebane Tether]* trait! We are talking about 3k healing when you use *[Eviscerate]*. This trait, combined with all the sigils, runes, food and other traits, will keep your health up! You will have crazy sustain. **Defense:** **Cull the Weak** - *[Body Blow]* is your source of applying Weakness condition when using CC skills, and this trait will boost your dmg by *7%* on targets with a Weakness condition. These 2 traits are a great synergy! **Armored Attack** - anything that boosts our Power is welcomed! **Rousing Resilience** - when you break out of stun, you heal for 2,5 health and you get 1000 toughness. Powerful trait, it improves your sustain, boosts your defense and when combined with *[Armored Attack]* it also boosts your Power! Another synergy! **Spellbreaker:** **Pure Strike** - boosts your critical damage, with Mace and *[Kick]* included, you will make sure that your target do not have any boons! We are talking about 7-14% boost in critical damage! **Sun and Moon Style** - another trait for sustain when you are sitting in your Axe/Dagger weapon set! **Magebane Tether** - probably the greatest trait ever! It gives you so much Power (Might stacks), it is just crazy! With this trait, you have a very easy time having 25 stacks of might! Other traits worth mentioning: **Attacker's Insight** - synergy with Mace's CCs and *[Kick]*, gives you even more boost in damage. **Dispelling Force** - this trait is the reason why you are able to remove Boons when using Mace's CC skills and *[Kick]*, also, another synergy with *AI* trait! **Adrenal Health** - when using Burst, even more sustain! **Pinnacle of Strength** - with easy 25 might stacks, you easily get 250 more power! As you can see, this build has crazy synergy between every Trait and Weapon. Every Trait is useful in this build, we are talking about 100% usability/effectiveness! Not a single Trait is wasted! **Utility skills:** **[Kick]** - it is obvious by now, boost your damage for your next hard hitting skill! **[Shake it Off!]** - a stun breaker, condition removal. It is needed. Synergy with *Rousing Resilience* and *Armored Attack*. **[Featherfoot Grace]** - a stun breaker, resistance, and mobility. It is needed. Synergy with *Rousing Resilience* and *Armored Attack*. **[Signet of Rage]** - mobility, might stacks, fury, healing and endurance gain [because of *Might Makes Right*] **[Mending]** - healing, condition removal, low cooldown! With *Rune of Vamp*, you get 1k more healing and dmg boost on your next attack every time you use it! Yes, you need to have 2 stun breaks. **Videos:** I am sorry for any lag! This was my first time recording videos :) * Never again be afraid of Hydras! Notice the importance of having 2 stun break skills. And the importance of having mobility. I made many mistakes here in this fight, but even then I was able to overcome this challenge. Sustain and healing is just great, and so is mobility to avoid many of AoEs which were very dangerous. I did dance like a beginner here, but I am sure I had some good moments! :) URL * AoE, Mobility and Boon removal Video to show you how quickly you can kill a large group of mobs while sustaining your health in a first fight. 2nd fight is against Veteran mobs, watch how my mobility I've put in weapon sets helps me avoiding circles! Also, how my Mace and [Kick] easily remove Protection boon from Veteran mobs! URL * With this build, you can solo group events. No problem at all! Yeah, you can do stuff like this. This video is 10 minutes long (2 parts each 5 minutes) and shows you every aspect of this build. Great burst damage against trash mobs, great sustain, and healing overall (in few moments I was very low on hp, but because I have ""Vamp"" build I was able to heal myself up!). This video will also show you my evading skills, using dodge itself, but also mobility using weapon skills and [Eviscerate] to dodge big hits (proud of this one) while also using a block from *Mace (2)*! I hope this video will entertain you! :) part 1: URL part 2: URL TLDR: high sustain, high damage, high defense, high CC, high mobility, high condition removal, a high number of stun break skills, and two most important factors: It is very cheap to build and very fun to play! And I believe, a unique build :) URL I am here for any questions! If anyone finds fun with this build, or a similar to it, I will be very glad :)"

(this would allow for even the healing to be able to crit) * Arcane Sigils empower you and nearby allies who stand in them. (this would turn the sigils into mini banners, with lingering effects for as long as they're active; for example: Sigil of Power could increase Power by 100, Sigil of Healing could increase Healing Power by 100 etc) * Arcane Sigils now gain reduced recharge, and if they are activated below 50% health, they grant Fury and Protection. Of course, this is just my idea and any constructive feedback is welcome. :)"
126,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[LN] - Restricted 5 Man Sabetha Kill (No Druid or Chrono) - Off Meta Comp,104,7pgecv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7pgecv/ln_restricted_5_man_sabetha_kill_no_druid_or/,2018-01-11 02:47:14,"Hey Guys, We took upon ourselves the challenge to make a restricted 5 Man Sabetha kill. We started out with a pretty much the known standard meta setup: 1x Chrono, 1x Druid 1x Soulbeast 1x Warrior 1x Dps Slot (in our case a Necro) We were testing around with this for quite a while. Condi/power druid, necro or a soulbeast kiter. Even toggling the kite role between cannon jumpers and the current kite etc. All of those tries ended up with the same bittersweet result. The druid and the chrono were providing essential buffs, but unfortunately were also huge sinks in terms of dps and wouldve made a kill really hard or almost impossible to achieve. After a few rounds of theorycrafting, testing and given the latest changes to GotL, we tried to fit in a support Revenant paired with a Chrono focussed on quickness and a PS Warrior, allowing to skip the druid entirely. We hoped to gain a lot of momentum and pressure on the boss due to the higher damage potential, but the altered Chrono fell short on dps. So we replaced the chrono with a quickness firebrand and the results were without comparison. Suddenly we gained more dps than the standard meta composition, even without having permanent buffs. So our line-up for the kill consisted of: 1x Quickness/Support Firebrand 1x Support Revenant 1x PS Warrior (1 cannon) 1x Soulbeast (2 cannons) 1x Necro (Kiter) **1. Quickness/Support Firebrand** This started off as a pure quickness buffer with a semi high damage output and developed itself into one of the key members within the group due to the general utility the Firebrand kit brought to the fight. The Firebrand was able to relieve a lot of the pressure with the added utility. Next to aegis, protection, fury, stability, a bit of might, he distributed quickness.We chose to run sword/scepter for fury and might, next to the safety range option. The tome of resolve gave a needed healing modifier, which synergized pretty well with Revenant heals.The tome of courage negated projectiles with Valiant Bulwark, gave on demand protection and stability for the trash mobs. **2.Support Revenant** Similar to the Firebrand, the Revenant gave first and foremost access to alacrity, but assisted the group in a similar fashion. Both the Revenant and the Firebrand turned the support into dps slots since both of them permanently stayed on the plattform. Due to issues with flak in the beginning of our journey and cannon aoes overlapping, staying full melee was rough and incoming damage was hard to avoid. The solution to this was running a shortbow as a second weapon set, which resulted to be less of a dps loss than expected and also provided some extra cc for Knuckles, even though it saw rarely play within our runs. Further add-control due to Darkrazors Daring wasnt needed, since the necro took care of it for the most part. **3. PS Warrior** Seems pretty old fashioned to run a Warrior with Phalanx Strength after the changes to druid and Grace of the Land, but we only needed might for five party members. We decided that the Warrior should take one cannon, since its one of the better classes to do this with and the combination of Revenant, Firebrand and Necro would also generate some might in the meantime. So our might distribution in the end was 10 Warrior, 4-5 Firebrand, 5 Necro and 5-6 Revenant, which would result in overall in 25 might stacks and allowed the Warrior to still run renegade runes. Oh and banners of course. **4. Soulbeast** Since we ditched the druid, we still wanted access to spirits and the soulbeast was our main cannon jumper. The soulbeast ran both sun and storm spirit, at the start even a water spirit, but . was ditched for a more reliable personal heal after a bit. The added burning and vulnerability were needed to increase the group dps. Both cannon jumpers tried to toggle the aggro of the red bombs between each other, so the melee members didnt have to deal with this. **5. Necro** The general idea at first was to cut the Mesmer focus pull and let the Necro handle the trash mobs and add some needed extra pressure on Sabetha and the three minibosses. In the process it turned out the necro was as an excellent choice for kiting Sabethas flak shots. While losing the least amount of dps, drawing aggro, disabling and killing the continuously spawning adds minimizing the stress for the other members. Toggling the aggro between those on cannon duty and the necro was crucial, since we needed to reduce the cooldown of epidemic with alacrity from the revenant and allow the necro to go into melee range more often. We also chose to run a dagger offhand next to the torch, to continuously bounce burning stacks from the flak shots onto Sabetha, which added up with the length of the fight. **General Gameplan:** The moment we found our group composition, we had to go through a lot of trial and error to balance the plattform health, Sabethas health and the needed pressure for the minibosses. We decided to leave up different cannons throughout the fight to avoid less optimal phase timings. Leaving up the east cannon and doing south instead, while Knuckles was crucial, so we had full five members to bring him down as fast as possible. A potential third breakbar wouldve been an issue and this strategy worked for us. This composition heavily relies on stacking properly to gain the optimal amount of buffs, which at times was rough due to cannon aoes overlapping, heavy bombs, flak and the overall pressure from the trash mobs. In hindsight the platform was pretty healthy, maybe too healthy and we could have optimized it even more to get a faster kill as a result, but in the end we are happy with how it turned out overall. Despite the still bugged healing mantra of the Firebrand, most of the mechanics were handled pretty well, even though the uptimes and rotations could be further improved, providing a even faster and smooth kill. [Actual Kill Log](URL To take this even further, we want to release a 10 Man kill within a week with a similar composition for MO and Sabetha, which should do even more dps due to epidemic bounce, pinpoint, banner distribution etc... The 10 Man composition could look like this: Sabetha: * 2x Warriors (1x cannon jumper) * 2x Necros (one as a kite, to bounce epidemic) * 2x Firebrands * 2x Revenants * 1x Holosmith * 1x Soulbeast (cannons jumper) Mursaat Overseer: * 2x Warrior * 2x Holosmith * 2x Firebrands * 2x Revenants * 1x Condi Thief * 1x Soulbeast **PoVs:** * Light Lawliet (Firebrand): [YT-Link](URL * Reni (PS Warrior) : [YT-Link](URL * Timson (Soulbeast): [YT-Link](URL * Sofn (Revenant): [YT-Link](URL * Farbstoff (Necro): [YT-Link](URL greets Farbstoff "

Deal +10% damage to foes with no boons* (Alternative version is called **""Merciless Feast""**, which casts a lesser version of **Unholy Feast** instead of **Spinal Shivers**); [Rolling together the damage boost from focus trait and the boon hating properties of **""Chill of Death""** has fitting flavor and gives us a fair bit of an edge against raid bosses, that don't tend to have any boons to begin with, resulting in a flat damage boost. ""Merciless Feast"" is suggested for the better flat damage output, but it can result in slight PvP powercreep. This trait is also supposed to switch places with **""Spiteful Renewal""**, so we can take the new **""Awaken the Pain""** along with it] **Sould Reaping** traitline **Strength of Undeath**: *+15% maximum life force. While above 25% life force, deal 5% more damage. While above 50% life force, deal 10% more damage.* [Alternatively, you could switch places for damage modifiers, to make it a tiny bit more challenging for necro players by making them manage their lifeforce between 25% and 50% to maximize their damage.] **Reaper** traitline **Decimate Defenses**: *Deal 0.5% more damage for each stack of vulnerability on your target.* [Essentially give it the same functionality as the **""Fragility""** trait in mesmer's **""Domination""** traitline. This, I think, is the perfect idea for this trait. Not only will it improve the DPS values, it also forces us to take precision gear instead of valkyrie, reducing our passive defense, making it more acceptable for us to be DPS] **Shouts** **""Suffer!""**: *Damage foes around you and chill them. Targets hit with this skill are affected with ""Suffer!"" debuff for 6 seconds: ""When you are struck while under the effect of ""Suffer!"", you are dealt 300 base damage (without any power)"":*[This debuff has a 1 second ICD, so you can basically deal 5 packs of damage with it. The name of the skill implies some heavily offensive nature, which just isnt there. I suggest removing condi transfer and adding some offensive functionality to the skill in order to enhance it's flavor and provide usefullness in dealing damage. I didn't want to add some unique nonsense modifier, like banners or spirits, so I ended up with a debuff that has a hard cap on how much damage it can deal, making it easy to balance and also staying more or less true to the ""sellfish"" nature of reaper. Also I really want that garbage tier corruption well to be replaced by something of value.] These suggestions should be more or less enough to bring power reaper's damage values to the level of other DPS classes. P.S. I also wanted to suggest some changes to **Gravedigger**'s functionality to encourage more active play when the boss is below 50% health, but I don't think I can get the numbers right to not mess up the benchmark completely, so I decided to skip that aspect in my suggestions list."

129,vulnerability,Guildwars2,How to make power reaper raid-viable in one change,205,7efj6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7efj6z/how_to_make_power_reaper_raidviable_in_one_change/,2017-11-21 16:31:56,"Currently, power reaper benchmarks at [nearly 27,000 DPS](URL and probably above 27,000 with blood magic traits in a group. That means it needs a roughly 15 percent damage buff to be above 30,000 DPS, which would be generally raid-viable  meaning it does significantly more DPS than support classes  even if it's not raid-optimal. There's an easy way to get to this point without affecting PvP and WvW almost at all: Make Decimate Defenses also cause each stack of vulnerability to give an additional 0.5 percent or 0.6 percent more damage. Or if Decimate Defenses isn't a good option (since the trait is great as is), then this could be put on another trait  like Death's Embrace (in Spite) or one of the first-tier major traits in Reaper. This would put power reaper above 30,000 DPS, and it would be good in raids. And since it would require full vulnerability to be significant, it would have little effect in PvP and WvW, where cleanses and resistance are common."
130,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[T4 Twilight Oasis] Boss Solo Attempt (12% hp remaining) - Condi Reaper,19,7hqatb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7hqatb/t4_twilight_oasis_boss_solo_attempt_12_hp/,2017-12-06 02:17:37,"Attempt here: URL Been trying to solo this for the past couple of days, figured I'd share here so that I might ask for some feedback on how I'm approaching the fight. I'll also put a summary of some of my tactics below: Edit: Doing another round of attempts now, got her down to 5% and got wiped by the vets protecting the priestess of Balthazar :S --- PHASE TACTICS: Given the cluster of conditions that the first phase of the fight causes, I didn't initially think soloing this boss would be possible (at least by me/a Condi Reaper). Then I started noticing that most of the ""forms"" that makes up the phases have some kind of weakness/tactic to use. Lyssa: After getting her down to 95%, as long as no allied units are within around 800 units of Amala she will neither teleport nor create more clones (hence the shuffle you see me doing throughout this phase). You can also dodge her attacks because she ""predicts"" where you would be with her staff auto, so if you shuffle you cause it to miss. Melandru: A lot of her attacks can just be walked out of, and you can use the Champ Golem she spawns to gain hp back quickly using Parasitic Contagion Dwayna: Once again, many attacks can be walked out of (just makes sure you're strafing (not walking backward) for the lightning attack. Grenth: This is where it starts getting difficult. Provided you dodge the stuns and insta downs you just need to shuffle like in the Lyssa phase to avoid the wurm attacks (Epi is a must here, just makes sure you don't leave any wurms in an enraged state). Balthazar: The phase I've progressed to for now. Can't offer much in the way of advice beyond don't get hit by the elaborate pattern aoes, and make sure you jump the shockwaves. --- BREAKBAR TACTICS: I try to only spawn the flesh golem at about x6% (where x is 8,6,4, or 2) so it doesn't get killed by Amala's attacks, and also try to do so at the outer edge of the arena. This is so you get both the knockdown and the launch CC for a large CC bonus (which gives you more skills to use on the priests up top). Other than that, use spectral grasp, Grasping Darkness, and shroud CC as needed. --- Build Used: URL The idea behind running spite here is to basically get a bunch of passive might in the second half of the fight when things start getting more difficult, as well as getting free vulnerability from my chills. --- Hopefully I've inspired some other people to try themselves, and thanks in advance for any feedback!

131,vulnerability,Guildwars2,A quickstart guide to the Dragonhunter,0,7j2qcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7j2qcy/a_quickstart_guide_to_the_dragonhunter/,2017-12-12 02:06:49,"The Dragonhunter is the Specialisation of the Guardian introduced to the game within the HoT expansion. Unlike the Firebrand, the Dragonhunter is quite a simple Spec. It is completely Power focused leaving it with little to almost no space of messing around with different types of damage. Of course can Dragonhunter be played with Conditiondamage but it is not really making that much sense since your power damage is just insane better. Nevertheless, Dragonhunter is still fun and interesting to play, especially when you want a lot of selfsustain or either Damage. Selfsustain? Yes. Actually Dragonhunter cannot only fart out ****tons of Damage but is also very good for keeping you alive. (Of course at the cost of sacrificing Damage) So lets take a closer Look. Starting with the Virtues. **F1** You throw a !piercing! spear at target enemy. Can connect several times if the enemies are standing in line. **F2 ** Jumping somewhere else. Healing a bit and most importantly removing Immobilised. Which is actally quite important to keep in mind. **F3** Creating a shield in front of you. Blocks Projectiles. Is supposed to only block them in front of you but sometimes it feels like randomly it blocks other directions too. Still wouldnt count on it. **The Traitline** The trailine is focused on offering buffs to pretty much everything that the Dragonhunter can do. CD reduction for traps. Upgrades for every virtue, and many more. This offers you the possibility to specialize this Spec even more in the direction you want it to be. This is quite different from the Firebrand who can be at any time everything you want him to be. (Makes it understandable why!) **The Weapon** The Longbow is quite a weird weapon. It is absolutely counterintuitive to what the Dragonhunter is doing with his traps. The Damage is okisch-decent. Except for healing, this weapon has pretty much everything. But somehow it still does not turn out to be useful. I still use it from time to time in open world when I feel lazy. Because it enables you to sit back and deal damage from a very safe distance. Something guarding was lacking. **The builds** URL This is just a super duper easy burst build. As you can see, when checking out the traitlines, everything is having pretty strong interactions. First connect your F1. This will lead to movement impairment which will lead to 10% more damage. Then drop the traps. If you know you will have time till you reenter battle just drop all 3 of them. But try to activate the Test of Faith last. It has no casting time, therefore it can be cast the same time as another one. Since you have retaliation due to Your F1 your damage is even further increased. Use your GS 4 for some more retaliation and the GS 2 for some more burst. Most of the things are done by then. Otherwise switch to Scepter / torch. Run backwards till the burst is up again and then burst again. The rotation in fractals is pretty much the same. Except for you to wait with your burst till the boss is vulnerable. Normally I just walk around damaging the boss with all I got. When I am within a half a minute range of the vulnerability I save up and then go for the full burst. URL This is another burst orientated build. Notice the difference in the traitlines. This one is less retaliation orientated. Thus making the window of burst even smaller. Though through the symbol traitline ( Zeal) Your damage is even higher in that window. Playing this way makes it important to hit the symbols. Especially your Scepter 2. As concerning quantify both builds are pretty close in DPS. If you rotate perfectly fine you will hit about 40k or so. If you want to go for 20k follow this easy rules: F1 always off cooldown. BUT check first if your burst is coming off cooldown as well. Then safe it up for the burst since it is an huge damage increase. Same goes for your symbols (GS 4, SC 2). Always cast your Gs 4 before Gs2. Use your BaneSignet only for important breakbars. It is really a huge breaker eating 1/3 of the breakbar on most bosses. Though keep in mind that all traps will also break bar. Ignore the torch 5 skill. Use the torch 4 skill off cd. Use the heal together with traps and burst. **ATTENTION** You are really super squishy. Therefore positioning is quite important. GS3 can help you closing gaps to the mob. F2 is helping you get away again. If something is throwing anything at you do not refrain from using F3 to block it. If you want to trait in some more defensive lines that is always possible. But keep in mind. You will always lose damage. **Examples:** If you have problems with being cced take in stand your ground for test of faith. You can also always take in shelter for more blocks. The honor traitline is always possible if you want more group support. Valor for more selfsustain, though I really would not recommend that. **The Dragonhunter in WvW ** (I know I will get a lot of hate for this but still) Dragonhunter was experimented with a lot in the earlier stages of HoT but was pretty fast dropped for the Vanilla Guardian. This is right, since Vanilla guardian and Firebrand offer so much more to the group (support). This is why they are needed most. But still I think it is wrong to completely abandon Dragonhunter for WvW since there are quite some fun things to do with it. Dragonhunter is (within the Zerg) the most selfsufficent class right now. This makes him just perfect for learning wvw. No other class makes running around in the Zerg so easy. Not even the Warrior with his stances. Therefore: URL **How to play this:** Actually pretty easy. ou just run with the zerg. When coming in 1200 range just use the staff 3 and 5 when the comm tells you to do so. Staff 5 is a pretty strong CC (your comm will be calling for it). Staff 3 will be used for stacking speed and dealing some damage. (speed ofc ooc). It also is good for healing infight. Combining any kind of Buff emigration with your altruistic healing is something to learn. Something to really learn. Very important (I think I made that clear now). For condi remove you have your f2, which will also relocate you. Which will mostly get you out of a lot of bad situations if you did something wrong. Also Purging flames. Dealing a lot of damage. Reducing condiduration. This is a skill to learn. Plan ahead when using it. But you cannot use it only defensivly but also offensive. Fragments of faith is just a plain Oh shit button. Use it for stunbreak and stability. Do not use your F1 unless you are focusing someone. Just leave it be. Since it is not instant cast you cannot do anything else while casting. Really just worth it when chasing someone. Your F3 is one of the most important skills in this setup. It is a huge block, since we traited it. On top it will remove 5 conditions at max. That isnt that much but hey, take it or leave it. What you really need to know is, that this will block Sandshades and Arrowcarts. Especially the sandshade part is making it a really powerful tool when pushing in. Better than the dome even, since it is moving with you. It is really hilarious to watch all the blocks pop up while not receiving any damage. Other than that this build is really simple. GS for Damage. Staff for healing and poking. (Use your Staff 2 twice since it will proc some more effects). **If you want to learn how to lead or just started with wvw or frontline, I strongly recommend you this build. You can even trait in the extra auto stunbreak trap if you feel like it. This build makes leading and learning super easy and you can focus on learning the leading / fighting mechanics in a zerg. I did this several times with guildmates, some of them never played Guardian in WvW before, already. After a month or so they were able to swap to firebrand and take it to the next lvl.** "
132,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Twilight Oasis Fractal Guide - Amala summary,47,7jqevz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7jqevz/twilight_oasis_fractal_guide_amala_summary/,2017-12-14 19:49:44,"In light of the feedback thread, a common point I'm seeing is that a lot of players are struggling with the large number of mechanics/aoe abilities in tandem with skills overlapping the indicators of those skills. As such, I figured I'd do a write up of the attacks/mechanics that Amala uses in each of her respective phases, and how to deal with each. This guide will be focused on the T4 version of Amala, lower tiers will exclude some of these attacks. You can see visual examples of the attacks in each phase with limited visiual noise in my solo run here: URL (I'll be adding gifs of each attack at the point they're mentioned in the guide, but this will be a slow process so I'll upload the guide first and add the gifs in afterward). --- Special Action Skill: Enhanced Reflexes -- With the recent patch the evade time for this skill was doubled, so it's very much your emergency dodge if you've run out of endurance; especially as it only has a 5 second cooldown. If you're focused on dealing damage, try to avoid using it if you still have a dodge as you lose more time ""dodging"" due to flying up in the air. Throughout the guide I'll be referring to this as SAK (Special Action Key). --- Breakbars: -- When Amala hits 85,65,45, and 25% hp remaining; she will stop whatever she is doing and teleport to the middle of the area and start charging a devastating attack. You need to break her bar to stop her from doing this, as well as making the Priestess of the god she is currently channeling vulnerable to attack. Not a huge issue for this fractal, as five forms of soft CC and three forms of hard CC (stuff like stuns, pulls or fears) are the bare minimum to break her bar in time. If you're low on Hard CC try saving your soft CC skills you may have and unloading them when Amala hits 86%,66%,46%, or 26% hp respectively. If you fail to break this bar your group will be hit with a large burst of damage (that can be survived) and Amala will regain 3% of her hp (so if she was at 85% hp she'd go back up to 88%. --- Priestesses: -- After successfully breaking her bar, you will be able to attempt to kill one of the five god Priestesses, and ""kill"" the form Amala was channeling. The priestess will cast some kind of hazard between herself and Amala, and use their own set of attacks to prevent you killing them. You need to run over to the alcove the Priestess is in and use your SAK to jump up to them. If you fail to eliminate them within 30 seconds Amala will regain control of her previous god form, regain 1% of her hp and force you off of the platform the Priestess is on. If this happens you need to repeat the breakbar and try again (the Priestess will not regain any hp they have lost). As an added tip, lightning will connect Amala and the alcove of the Priestess you need to kill next during the breakbar to help you know which way to go. Also, if you're playing Necromancer don't run Plague Signet. When the timer for the Priestesses expires they become allies. This means you can ""steal"" your team's conditions from the Priestess. --- Attacks and counter measures: (Note: I will be updating the attack names once I actually double check the proper names, for now I'll be using placeholders) -- All Phases: -- * **Gravedigger:** Small aoe around her that knocks you back if you're hit by it. A short windup with an equally small aoe that isn't too hard to miss. * **Melee combo:** Each phase of Amala has a 9 part melee combo that is only used when someone is in melee range. This is the source of the large number of AoEs you see in this fight, and most can be avoided by trying to stay behind her as she uses them. Each phase's AoEs have different effects, and I'll go over each as I go through each phase. Just be aware that the patterns for these attack will always be the same, but the direction Amala is facing can rotationally affect their positioning. Also, if Amala does not continue her combo due to no-one being in melee range she will eventually ""reset"" and start her combo from the beginning. (This may not be true, and warrants further observation). * **Energy Wave:** This attack is telegraphed by a small AoE on the ground, which then erupts into a large shock wave after 2.5 seconds. This can be avoided by either dodging or using SAK (which grants an achievement if done consecutively), and will cause 5 stacks of confusion and cripple. --- **Lyssa Phase:** -- * **Clones:** The first thing you need to deal with when the fight starts. Because both Amala and her clones use the Mesmer staff auto attack, leaving them alone can lead to a lot of conditions being thrown onto your team. Taking a moment to establish which one is real and then culling the spares makes this phase easier to deal with. Be aware that there are multiple ways to spot Amala among the fakes. She will almost always have protection, the Moa Signet will appear above here head when she uses it, the clones will have higher levels the farther away they are from her (in the first configuration), and she will use a gravedigger attack if someone gets within melee range of her. When she starts teleporting around, use the same tactics. Figure out which is real and target her, then kill her clones if you can't handle the condi spam. Using target swapping will automatically make you select her if you can see her in your PoV. * **Moa Signet:** Targets a player, and an expanding AoE appears under their feet. When it goes off anyone within the AoE is turned into a moa. If you're targetted, try to move away from your team (treat this attack like a flux bomb). If you are transformed into a Moa, remember that your 5th skill is an evade as well as your SAK (which can still be used as a Moa). * **Portals:** Upon touching these, your character will be teleported up in the air and slowly fall back down in addition to being inflicted with 10 stacks of confusion. If you do touch a portal focus on making sure you don't end up in a multi-part cycle of falling and porting again to avoid taking unnecessary confusion damage. There are typically gaps between the portals you can run through, but you cannot dodge through them. The patterns will change every 12 seconds after Amala hits 96% hp. By the way, don't jump as you get ported upward or [this happens](URL --- Priestess of Lyssa:[Example seen here](URL -- The priestess will cast portals on the ground between herself and Amala, so don't rush to getting to the Priestess if it's just going to get you portal'd. This Priestess will also use the Moa Signet, and will teleport every 25% hp she loses whilst leaving a clone behind. Both she and her clones will also use the Mesmer staff auto attack, and can be quite damaging if enraged. Be sure to either burst her down quickly or make sure someone eliminates her clones to avoid taking high enrage damage. --- **Melandru:** [Timestamp in video](URL -- * **Earth Elemental:** Amala will summon this at the start of the phase. This elemental will fixate on a random player periodically, and will both follow and focus its attacks on the fixated player. I would advise that if you're not trying to speed clear that the fixated player move away from allies to avoid them being caught up in collateral. This Earth Elemental can throw boulders at range that cause knockdown in an AoE on the targeted area and a small distance behind it (the boulder bounces), use a cleaving auto attack, and cone knockback in melee range, and a large AoE that causes knockdown in its center and knockback in the rectangle AoEs that extend from its edges. * **Melee Combo:** In this phase Amala's AoEs from this combo will apply a small knockback, but many of them don't hit if you're stacking on Amala directly (though you will still be hit by Amala herself). Album of the 9 melee patterns for Melandru here: URL * **Expanding Rings:** These expand outward from Amala, much like the attack the Sandbinders do. Each ring will apply a knockdown and 3 stacks of bleed. * **Eruption:** This skill is a delayed AoE that appears under random players, and will causes a knockback and 3 stacks of bleed when it finishes its animation --- Priestess of Melandru: [Example seen here](URL -- The Priestess will cast more of the rectangular aoes from the Melandru Amala melee combo. Avoid running over them so they don't knock you away from the Priestess' alcove. The Priestess will also use Avatar of Melandru, and summon two Earth Elementals to defend herself. In this form she will periodically gain Stability, and also use a stomp attack to inflict Immobilize on surrounding targets. --- **Dwayna:** [Timestamp in video](URL -- Amala will periodically gain 4 boons (Swiftness, Aegis, Protection, and 10 stacks of might) throughout this phase, with one application every 10 seconds. Additionally, at this stage of the fight all members of the party are given the Determination Buff. Should you slay the Priestess of Dwayna, all party members will be revived. * **Melee Combo:** Not quite as bad in this phase as Melandru in terms of CC, but deals slightly more damage. Each AoE applies a daze and a stack of bleed. * **Lightning Strikes:** This attack is telegraphed by Amala stopping all movement, then reaching toward the ground and then raising her hand into the air. Much like the attack the final Sandbinder uses, Amala will call down lightning strikes that follow all players. Split apart from your allies to avoid catching them in your AoEs, and strafing sideways will allow maintain enough speed to avoid the lightning (assuming you aren't bogged down by Hamstrung). Each strike applies a daze, as well as a stack of torment, blind, weaknesses and 5 stacks of vulnerability. * **Lightning Arrows:** This attack is telegraphed by an orange AoE that is surrounded by arrows pointing outward. After a short delay blue flame trails (same as the ones cast by the Sunspear Defenders) will extend from the arrows, and anyone inside the circular AoE will take heavy damage. These flame trails will persist for a short time and deal minor damage if you're standing on them. * **Lightning Storm:** This attack often occurs after the Lightning Arrows attack. A large amount of AoE circles will appear around Amala, as well as an expanding red AoE under Amala herself. These AoEs will expand in size twice, and deal condition damage every time they expand. When they reach max size a large lightning shockwave will extend outward and apply conditions to all players that don't dodge (this shockwave is essentially invisible, so just dodge toward Amala when the AoEs reach max size and you'll avoid it). * **Wings of Rage: Dwayna version** There will be two patterns in a roughly wing shaped set that extend outward from Amala, you can avoid this by walking backward. Each individual ""section"" of this attack will apply 5 stacks of torment to those inside when they go off. * **Tornadoes:** Amala will summon these when she reaches 60.5% hp. Much like the ones summoned by the Sandbinders, they will draw your character toward their center, and apply damage and blind to those inside of their AoE. Unlike the Sandbinders however, Amala will summon five of them. --- **Priestess of Dwayna:** [Example Seen here](URL - This Priestess only has one attack, and it cannot be interrupted with hard CC, a different iteration of the Lightning Strikes attack. Unlike Amala's, these strikes will land randomly, so the best way to deal with them is to remain near the edge of the alcove where you're less likely to be hit (due to ""taking up"" less space on her platform. While some strikes will occur between Amala and the alcove the vast majority occur up where the Priestess is standing. Also be aware that when first engaged she gains Retaliation, Protection and Regeneration. The retaliation only lasts for 8 seconds, but the other boons will last for the entire time you fight her if they are not removed. --- **Grenth:** [Timestamp in video](URL - Amala will periodically gain 2 boons (Swiftness and 15 stacks of might) throughout this phase, with one application every 10 seconds. * **Melee Combo:** In the Grenth phase, this combo will spawn two kinds of AoEs: Chilblains marks that apply a stack of Poison and Chill, and Sand Swells that apply 2 stacks of Torment and Chill. The melee strikes can also apply varying effects such as knockdowns and 3 stacks of bleed based on the part of the combo she is in. * **Executioner's Scythe/Soul Spiral:** Amala will use her own variety of the Condi Reaper shroud combo, with some augmentations. A large circle indicator will appear in front of her as she raises her Scythe in the air. After 1 second she will strike, stunning anyone still inside of the AoE and leaving an Ice field behind. She will then spin inside of the ice field and send chilling bolts in random direction, each applying a short chill. Additionally, being close enough to be hit by her Soul Spiral will cause moderate damage and a stack of Poison per ""tick"" of her spiral you're hit by. * **""Rise!"":** A large expanding AoE will appear centered around Amala, and when it finishes Amala will summon a number of Shambling Horrors. At base she will summon 10, and an additional 5 spawn per TARGET hit (I am not aware of an upper limit to this, but I'd imagine the maximum amount that can spawn is 35 total). She will also temporarily get a buff that (I think, I haven't properly read this tool tip recently) reduces the damage she takes for 5 seconds. She will also get a secondary buff that increases her toughness: Flesh of the Master. Unlike the Death Magic trait Necromancers have, Amala will gain 1 stack at base and an additional 3 stacks per target hit by rise, and she will lose 1 stack every time one of her minions dies. * **Doom:** (Note that this attack doesn't have a name per se, due to not dealing any damage to trigger a combat log entry; as such I got creative :D) This attack takes the form of a small AoE circle, with the borders similar to the large AoE used by Virastraa in the Shattered Observatory fractal after her clone split phase. It will spawn under a random player, and if you are hit by it you will immediately be downed. **Be aware that this attack IGNORES your Mistlock singularity buff**. It is imperative that you dodge this attack above all others, and be ware it can easily be obscured by certain abilities (like the Reaper's GS 4 skill Nightfall). * **Spectral Walls:** When Amala hits 40.5% hp she will summon an arrangement of Spectral Walls that box you in to the middle. Touching these walls will fear you away from Amala, and will go through any applications of Stability. The only way to pass the walls is to jump over them with your SAK. * **Flesh Wurms:** After Amala summons her Spectral Walls, she will also summon 6 Flesh Wurms in the outer sections of the Spectral Walls. Each Wurm will shoot projectiles at random players, and these can do a lot of damage if they hit. These projectiles will also not extend past the location of their target when it is fired, so if you're taking fire from the Wurms the best way to deal with them is to run in a circle around the area. The predictive targeting the Wurms use will cause the projectile to miss, and the limitations on their range will mean they won't extend far enough to hit you. Also, should a Wurm enrage it is advised to focus it down rather than allow it to deal its explosive enrage damage. When there are Flesh Wurms active, Amala may teleport to one at random, killing it and giving herself 5 stacks of Toughness and Protection, as well as causing her to use... * **Necrotic Grasp:** Much like the Necromancer staff auto-attack, Amala will send out a dark hand to pierce in a line. Unlike the Necro skill however, this attack does not use predictive targeting, so kiting side to side will allow you to avoid being hit. Additionally using reflects/projectile destruction will mitigate this (as well as the attacks of any wurms in the area). --- **Priestess of Grenth:** [Example seen here](URL -- The Priestess will cast a pattern of both Chilblain marks and Sand Swells between herself and Amala. Additionally, she will assume a Lich form which causes her to pulse stability on herself, and use powerful piercing auto attacks. She will be protected by 6 jagged horrors (which cause bleeding on hit) and two flesh golems (which cause cripple on hit, and true to classic Necromancer form may occasionally decide not to attack you XD). Finally, the side walls of her alcove will be covered by a large and continuous Grasping Dead effect, which will apply bleeding and cripple to you if you are too close. --- **Balthazar:** [Timestamp in video](URL -- Amala will periodically gain 3 boons (Protection, Swiftness and 10 stacks of might) throughout this phase, with one application every 10 seconds. * **Melee Combo:** In this phase the AoEs from Amala's melee combo will apply burning, as well as small knock-backs from the circle AoEs that knock away from their center, and larger knock-backs from the cone shaped AoEs that knock you away from Amala. * **Flurry of Flames:** Amala will sequentially spawn cone shaped AoEs surrounding her, which will each go off after 1 second. Each individual cone will deal a moderate amount of damage, knock you back, and apply burning. Be aware that each subsequent cone is larger than the last, as is the gap between each cone. * **Fire Arrows:** Much like the Lightning Arrows attack from the Dwayna phase, Amala will spawn a circle AoE indicator on herself, with arrow markers extending outward. Being in the circle when this attack activates will cause large amounts of damage, and while the flame trails left behind by this skill down last as long, they do more damage. * **Fire Strike:** Amala will target a player, creating a circle AoE indicator at their location. After 1.5 seconds Amala will jump to that location, dealing moderate damage in that area and sending out a shock wave that knocks back those hit and applies 2 stacks of burning. To deal with this attack, either be ready to jump over the shock wave if you're not in the blast zone, or dodge toward its center just before it hits to dodge both the impact and the subsequent shock wave. * **Meteor Strike:** Effectively a more powerful Fire Strike, Amala will call upon a meteor to trike at the location of a random player. This is telegraphed by a large expanding circle AoE, which when expired deal a huge amount of damage to anyone still in the area, and sends out a shock wave from its center. At the same time, Amala will spawn a large number of the knock back circle attacks starting from herself and spawning outward. These can be difficult to see if the smoke from the meteor strike has not yet cleared so dodge toward Amala if you're unsure. * **Wings of Rage: Balthazar version** Unlike the Dwayna version, there is only one pattern for this skill. However, this attack does devastating damage to anyone caught in it, has a more elaborate pattern, and each section takes slightly longer to activate. Your best bet is to either get behind Amala or find a gap in the pattern as soon as you can. * **Fire Tornadoes:** After Amala hits 18.5% hp, she will summon two Fire Tornadoes that will rotate around the outside of the area. One will be very large, and move in a large circle, while the other is smaller and will move in an [Epitrochoid](URL pattern around the outside of the area. These will both draw you in, and deal increased damage the closer you are to their center in addition to Burning and Weakness. --- **Priestess of Balthazar:** [Example seen here (sped up slightly due to spanning multiple ""attempts"")](URL The priestess herself doesn't do much outside of calling down small meteors which stun and applying Burning and Weakness on impact. Instead, her life is tied to the four Veteran Sunspear Warriors that flank her. She is invulnerable, and will not die until all four have been slain. Each Warrior can buff allies (giving them 10 stacks of might), as well as using a shield bash skill that can stun you for a short time. I advise making sure you have blinds and or hard cc at the ready to prevent them hitting you, as they can do a lot of damage (especially when enraged). You can also damage them freely from below provided you have skills that can hit them (pulling them toward the edge can also help with this. --- **""Perish With me Traitors!""** -- For the final 5%, Amala will continue to use all of the attacks she used during her Balthazar phase, but will also cause more small meteor strikes to occur around the area. Finish the job and strike her down! --- As I mentioned earlier, there will be some areas of this guide that are incorrect presumably (ability names, specific effects, etc.). Feel free to offer any corrections in the comments below, and I will also be making alterations as I go back and confirm specific information. All in all, this fractal is a fairly good one in my eyes. The pre-events help to familiarize you with several key mechanics/attacks of the Amala fight (tornadoes, flame trails, SAK, etc.), and I believe once the community a large gets a feel of the attacks she uses the success rate of groups should increase. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments below, and I hope this guide helps push your groups over the edge to victory!

133,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Scourge Test Post-Patch: Reason to Celebrate,42,774ax0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/774ax0/scourge_test_postpatch_reason_to_celebrate/,2017-10-18 15:29:12,"**TL;DR** The Scourge shade mechanic is almost completely polished now outside of balance. Only one new bug was found in testing; the F5/Desert Shroud will not apply its initial cast effect from Manifest Sand Shade (torment, cripple, burn, and/or vulnerability) to foes near you if that foe is also not near any of your shades. Otherwise, several bugs were fixed that are detailed below. **F1/Manifest Sand Shade (MSS)**  MSS should only apply 1 stack of torment and cripple on foes near you and/or your shades. Using F2-5 abilities should also only apply 1 stack of torment and cripple on foes near you and/or your shades in addition to their main effects. * Bug Fix: Foes near you and/or your shades will now only received 1 capped torment+cripple from MSS when you use F1-5 abilities. * **Possible Bug**: Foes near your shades receive the MSS torment+cripple when you use F5/Desert Shroud, but foes near you and not near your shades will not receive the MSS torment+cripple when you use F5/Desert Shroud. * Bug Fix: MSS torment+cripple is now consistently capped with Sand Savants greater shade. **Dhuumfire** - MSS should apply only 1 stack of burn on foes near you and/or your shades in addition to its main effect. * Bug Fix: Dhuumfire no longer applies burn per pulse of F5/Desert Shroud. * **Possible Bug**: Foes near your shades receive the MSS burn when you use F5/Desert Shroud, but foes near you and not near your shades will not receive the MSS burn when you use F5/Desert Shroud. * Note: Dhuumfire was not bugged prior to the latest patch with stacking burn per shade. **Unyielding Blast** - MSS should apply only 2 stacks of vulnerability on foes near you and/or your shades in addition to its main effect. * Bug Fix: Unyielding Blast no longer applies vulnerability per pulse of F5/Desert Shroud. * **Possible Bug**: Foes near your shades receive the MSS vulnerability when you use F5/Desert Shroud, but foes near you and not near your shades will not receive the MSS vulnerability when you use F5/Desert Shroud. * Bug Fix: Unyielding Blast no longer stacks additional vulnerability on foes near multiple shades. **Reapers Might**  MSS should apply 1 stack of might to you in addition to its main effect. * Note: MSS might is only applied when using F1/Manifest Sand Shade, but MSS might is not applied when using F2-5 abilities. This is also how the trait functioned prior to the latest patch. This may be a bug due to its application inconsistency in comparison to the Dhuumfire and Unyielding Blast traits, but it may not be a bug due to its application of a boon, rather than a condition, to yourself, rather than affecting allies near you and/or your shades. **F5/Desert Shroud**  Pulse out only 2 stacks of torment on foes near you and/or your shades. * Bug Fix: Desert Shroud no longer stacks additional torment per pulse on foes near multiple shades. * Bug Fix: Desert Shroud will now apply the full 2 stacks of torment per pulse on foes near your shades whether or not they are near you. * Bug Fix: MSS now only applies torment+cripple (along with Dhuumfires burn and/or Unyielding Blasts vulnerability) to the initial cast of Desert Shroud rather than applying these conditions per pulse of Desert Shroud. Now we can use Desert Shroud from far range with only 1 shade up on each foe to achieve its full condition damage (rather than being in melee range while blowing out cooldowns for all 3 shades at only one location). After this damage gets balanced (buffed) the Scourge will be in a great place with its more user-friendly shade mechanic. This post is a follow-up to my Scourge test post detailing shade bugs prior to the latest patch. The pre-patch post can be accessed using the link below.

134,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Elite Spec Concept - The Dancer,90,78c7ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/78c7ko/elite_spec_concept_the_dancer/,2017-10-24 11:38:43,"URL Just a fan elite spec concept I made. Wanted to share it. **Mesmer Elite Spec - Dancer** *The dancer weaves through the battlefield with their Phantasmal Doppelganger to strike foes with elegant and enchanting yet deadly manuevers. Their syncronized choreography and hidden daggers strike foes in unison when they least expect it.* **Elite Spec Mechanic - Phantasmal Doppelganger** The Phantasmal Doppelganger is a much stronger illusion than regular Phantasms or clones. It deals as much damage as the Mesmer and mimics the moves that they do but delayed by a second. (Includes movement and dodging) Thus, having the Phantasmal Doppelganger removes illusions and replaces regular shatters with dances. Additionally Phantasmal attacks become regular attacks that mimic the effect of the Phantasm that was supposed to be summoned. (ie Phantasmal Berserker becomes like Warrior's Whirlwind Attack) The Doppelganger inherits clone and Phantasm traits, Killing it will render it stunned for 5 seconds, in which it will be resummoned on the Mesmer's location afterwards. Instead of gaining an illusion like usual, you gain a Reality Charge which allows your illusion count based traits to affect the Mesmer like usual. (Duration 10 seconds) **New Shatters: Dances** The new shatters inherit the same traits as the base Mesmer shatters. Using a dance would interrupt your doppelganger. First Dance: Sharp Mind: The dancer and doppelganger spin around in unison, dealing heavy AoE damage over time. The dance becomes stronger with more Reality Charges you have. Inherits traits affecting Mind Wrack. Second Dance: Return to Me!: The Doppelganger runs toward the dancer with superspeed, ignoring terrain, Confusing and Crippling foes passed through by the doppelganger. Intensity of conditions applied depends on the number of Reality Charges you have. Inherits traits that affect Cry of Frustration. Third Dance: Dazzle: The Doppleganger blinks toward a location, dazing foes around. Length of daze depends on the number of Reality charges. Inherits traits that affect Diversion. Fourth Dance: Crystallize: The Doppelganger turns into a solid crystal that grants the Mesmer distortion. It is rendered useless for 5 seconds. Inherits traits that affect Distortion. **Traits:** Minor Profienciency: Dagger Proficiency: (Melee long/short bow could work too like a Chakram) The Dancer gains the ability to wield two daggers in both hands, allowing to weave in and out of the battlefield with gracious and elegant manuevers. Dagger 1: Autoattack&gt; gains more damage with Reality Charges on final hit. Dagger 2: Dagger Throw&gt;Mind Rip: Throws a dagger to a target, if it connects cripple the target, gain a Reality charge and allows you to cast Mind Rip. Casting Mind Rip blinks you and your doppelganger behind your foe dealing damage and vulnerability. Dagger 3: Fan of Blades: Slice your dagger infront while spinning away gracefully. Deals moderate damage while evading. Dagger 4: Phantasmal Dancer: Perform an elegant dance summons and throws phantasmal daggers around you. (think 20~ daggers that seek targets for the whole duration). Dagger 5: Blank Thoughts: Daze a target, when hit from behind stun and rip a boon instead. Deals small damage. Minor Adept: Phantasmal Doppelganger Major Adept 1: Tireless Partner: Your doppelganger has 30%~ more health Major Adept 2: Imaginary Stance: Whenever you activate a stance gain a reality charge. Major Adept 3: Dancing with Daggers: 20% CDR on dagger skills, Dagger projectiles now bounce to an additional target. Minor Master: Sturdier Glass: gain 75 power and condition damage per Reality Charge. Major Master 1: Doppelwalk: The doppelganger resets its position to yours every 5 seconds. (i don't know if this trait would be good or not lol) Major Master 2: Realist: Reality Charges lasts 10 more seconds. Major Master 3: Evasive Dancer: Gain 2 seconds of quickness everytime you dodge an attack. (10 seconds ICD) Minor Grandmaster: Elegant Performance: Gain swiftness when doing a dance, 5% more damage when under the effects of swiftness. Major Grandmaster 1: Unison Raid: Doppelgangers now mimics the same moves at the exact time. Major Grandmaster 2: Ideal Reality: You can gain two more reality charges at a time. Major Grandmaster 3: Jaded Audience: Your and your doppelganger's dances taunt enemies affected by the dance for 2 seconds, gain protection on use. (20 second ICD) Utility Skills: Stances (subject to change) Wave Stance (Heal): Synchronize with your doppelganger and provide a healing aura around you two. Tag-along: Swap with your doppelganger's position. Evading Tango: Break stun and evade skills while dashing forward. (charge, 20 seconds per charge, 5 second cooldown) Quick Step: You and your doppelganger gains quickness and stability over the duration. Mimicry: You and your doppelganger come together and confuse enemies. You will be randomly placed next to each other and for a 3 second duration your doppelganger isn't delayed for a second. Breaks enemy targetting. Waltzing Daggers(Elite): You and your doppelganger come together and waltz, summoning falling daggers around an area as you perform the dance with your partner. (think of Meteor shower but much weaker). The theme of the spec is all about micromanagement and deceiving your opponents with your Phantasmal Doppelganger. I made the concept as such so that it takes into account old shatter traits and illusion traits as well. Let me know your thoughts"
135,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Magebane Tether doesn't apply vulnerability per second as per tool tip.,40,79b0et,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/79b0et/magebane_tether_doesnt_apply_vulnerability_per/,2017-10-29 03:26:16,[Literally unplayable.](URL It's been bugged since the PoF previews.
136,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Epidemic Rework Proposal,0,7a1tna,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7a1tna/epidemic_rework_proposal/,2017-11-01 17:09:34,"Place vulnerability and an Epidemic status effect on a target foe for 10 seconds. If the foe dies while under the effect of Epidemic, then spread conditions from target to nearby foes via the current, slow-moving projectiles. This also continues to apply corruption, self-inflicted conditions. In PvP/WvW a foe entering downed state should also proc this effect since conditions are wiped when downed. Pros: (1) This resolves the clunky play style of trying to use Epidemic in the middle of stacking conditions without killing the target foe too soon among Epidemics slow casting time and projectile speed. You can now condi-burst a foe to death without missing/wasting this ability. You can also condi-burst a foe to death up until their last 1% HP without feeling like you wasted skill CD by not just being patient and letting the conditions melt the foes remaining HP. (2) If you are stuck in combat while only fighting 1 foe, the initial vulnerability application now makes this skill not a complete waste of a skill slot. You could argue that the self-condi application of Epidemic makes it not a complete waste if you have condition conversion/transfer or condition consume/heal abilities, but thats not universally helpful to all necromancer builds. Con: This skill no longer favors the play style of focusing on a target boss while clearing out adds with Epidemic. Instead you would switch targets to an add, condi-burst the add, and then Epidemic the add to splash conditions on to other adds and the boss. Flavor: This skill mechanic fits with the same skill mechanic style of on-death proc effects as several GW1 necromancer skills including Rising Bile, Putrid Bile, Icy Veins, Blood Bond, and Death Nova. This skill would also work exactly the same way as the GW1 ranger skill Pestilence."

As much as I *do* appreciate this, we could eventually run out of weapons to give to classes, so I thought: Why not introduce a unique weapon for every class? Class| Weapon| Hands | Example Skill | Skill Description ---|---|----|----|---- Warrior| Greataxe | 2 | With the Blunt Side| Knock down your enemy, doing minor damage Guardian| Pike| 2 | En Garde! | Lunge fiercely, piercing through enemies and inflicting vulnerability Revenant | Cestus | 1 or 2 | Ravage | Unlease a flurry of attacks, causing bleeding for each one Ranger | Crossbow| 2 | Flasbang Bolt | Fire a bolt that explodes in a 600 radius, blinding and damaging enemies Necromancer| Scythe | 2 | Harvest | Wave your scythe through enemies in front of you, stealing life force for each for hit Thief | Throwing Stars | 1 | Vital Spot| Hit your enemy, doing more damage to foes currently bleeding or below 50% health I haven't been able to come up with ideas for Mesmer, Engineer, or Elementalist. ^Disclosure: ^Of ^course, ^this ^is ^all ^for ^fun. ^I'd ^like ^to ^see ^what ^else ^you ^guys ^can ^think ^of ^to ^add ^to ^this ^list. ^I ^wholly ^trust ^Anet ^in ^their ^development ^of ^this ^fantastic, ^amazing ^game. ^ "

Permanent might/vulnerability shouldn't be easy to maintain. But, perma might/vulnerability should be accessible in raids and large events. * This could also encourage a **more active** play style by strategically popping your might/vulnerability to enhance your next (few) attack(s). * There could be **unique profession/specialization mechanics** where a second stack of might/vulnerability, with its own duration meter, can stack in intensity with base might/vulnerability. For example, the second layer of vulnerability could be a part of a ""Cracked Armor"" Spite trait on Necromancers (giving Necromancers a unique talent useful in raids). This would mean foes with cracked armor (two stacks of modified vulnerability) have the effectiveness of 40 stacks of vulnerability. To balance this, cracked armor would probably be about as uncommon as alacrity. On world bosses this could easily be maintained and speed things up a little bit. What are your thoughts? I find this mechanic to be more fun. Do you have any suggestions or do you think might and vulnerability are fine as they are?"

But the more i play it, the more i just got into thoughts. So what could be make to make so like your charhe of a warband. And some thoughs about a new mechanic for the Revenant based on the Renegade Mechanics. I used the Wiki to reduce the spelling mistakes. Apologize from my side. **Renegade** **Mechanics** Kalla's Fervor After thinking for a while, i realised that the Citadel Orders are like a outside help for Kalla. Fervour means passion. The more passionate someone gets, the more you can get people driven for your cause. Which should make it easier to persuade them to give you more stuff cheaper. Kalla's Fervor now increase your stats to 20 Ferocity, 3% Condition Duration per stack, up to 5 charges. And will be used as a extra fuel for the Citadel Orders. You get enough Fervor, so why not use and it give now choice between a passive stat bonus or a more active one. **Citadel Orders** * Heroic Command Refresh the duration of your Kalla's Fervor and grant nearby allies might for every stack. Cast time: 0.5s Energy cost: 15 Recharge: 10s 5 Might per Kalla's Fervor 8s Number of Allied Targets: 7 Radius: 300 When used, it consume 5 charges of Kallas Fervor, it gets increased properties. Cast time: Instant Energy cost reduced to 10. * Citadel Bombardment Cast time: 0.75s Energy cost: 35 Recharge: 15s Damage: 160 Burning for 2s Ordnance Count: 10 Ordnance: 3 Radius: 120 Range: 900 When used, it consume 5 charges of Kallas Fervor, it gets increased properties. Cast time: 0.5s Energy cost reduced to 20. It should act as burst or a pressure tool. 33% more power damage and easier to use when Kallas Fervor is consumed. * Orders from Above Cast time: Instant Energy cost: 25 Recharge: 20s 1s of Alacrity per 1s Number of Allied Targets: 5 Duration: 4s Interval: 1s Radius: 240 When used, it consume 5 charges of Kallas Fervor, it gets increased properties. Breaks Stun Energy cost reduced to 20. **Weapons** *Short bow* Every shot is piercing now. A soldier should be able to shot harder. * Shattershot Damage: 183 2 Bleeding for 2s More damage in a smaller time window. * Bloodbane Path Cast time: 0.5s Energy cost: 4 Recharge: 3s Damage (4x): 558 4 Bleeding for 6s More damage in a smaller time window. More hits. * Sevenshot Cast time: 0.75s Energy cost: 7 Recharge: 7s Damage (7x): 798 7 Torment for 4s Increased the width of every arrow, which would make the targeting easier. * Spiritcrush Cast time: 0.75s Energy cost: 12 Recharge: 9s Damage (4x): 588 4 Burning for 2s 4 Slow for 1s Solid no change needed. * Scorchrazor Cast time: 0.75s Energy cost: 16 Recharge: 12s Damage: 110 2 Burning for 2s Knockdown: 2s Solid no change needed. Except it could get the targeting system of the Deflecting Shot from the Dragonhunter. Which would make it more independent of target. *Off hand sword* * Grasping Shadow Damage: 587 Fury for 8s Chilled for for 3s Pull: 600 Attack Range: 300 Shadowstep Range: 600 Reduced casting time to 0.25s Easier to use, allows for a quicker disengaged option and can be used as a setup for Scorchrazor and Sevenshot. *Off hand axe* * Frigid Blitz Pass-Through Damage: 55 Final Damage: 550 Chilled for 2s Slow for 2s Reduced casting time to 0.25s Decreased casting time allows you to get behind your target faster, so it's a dodge without evade. **The Razor Warband** Well on of the biggest problems of the renegade are your Warband members, they are more useless then turrets. So to make them more useful, they are now permanent as long as you're are in combat and they retreat after 3s if you are outside combat. They all act now like a walking Ventari's tablet,except the Heal and the Elite, but with life points and can still effected be hard Control effects. Every time your Warband is summed up or moved to a new location, the member refreshes his buff. They do damage with a chance based on your Critical Chance to crit, up to 5 enemy targets around them. The Warband can be affected by Aegis, Protection, Regeneration, Resistance, Retaliation, Stability, Stealth or Swiftness and all Conditions. **Healing** * Breakrazor's Bastion Cast time: 0.75s Energy cost: 10 Recharge: 30s Damage: 10 Pulsing Area Heal: 369 Initial Self Heal: 4,529 Breakrazor's Bastion for 10s Number of Allied Targets: 5 Duration: 10s Interval: 1s Radius: 360 Range: 900 Pulsing 1 Stability for herself for 3s Initial 1 Stability for herself for 3s Interval: 3s Pretty much the same, just some needed stability for her. **Utilities** Having a health bar and being able to be stunlock, justified giving them mobility.

When you critically strike, or attack your enemies from behind or their flanks, you'll inspire yourself with Kalla's Fervor. Recharge: 2s Gain access to Citadel Order abilities. **Major Adept** Small Changes, just a bit more support for the warband. * Ashen Demeanor Recharge: 3s Disabling a foe cripples your enemy, which leaves them vulnerable and inspires you with Kalla's Fervor. 2 Kalla's Fervor for 8s 1 Vulnerability for 6s 1 Crippled for 3s Removes 2 conditions on your warband. * Blood Fury Recharge: 3s Fury increases the duration of bleeds you inflict. Gaining fury inspires you with Kalla's Fervor. 2 Kalla's Fervor for 8s Bleeding Duration Increase: 25% Grants 1 Stability for 4s to your warband, when you gain fury. * Wrought-Iron Will Evading an attack inspires you with Kalla's Fervor and grants boons to nearby allies. Recharge: 3s 2 Kalla's Fervor for 8s 1 Retaliation for 2s 1 Regen for 2s Number of Allied Targets: 5 Radius: 240 Grants 1 Retaliation for 4s and 1 Regen for 4s to your warband, when you evade a attack. **Minor Master** * Endless Enmity Critical hits have a chance to cause bleeding. Chance on Critical Hit: 33% 1 Bleeding for 4s **Mayor Master** Bigger changes * Tactical Retreat Removes inhibiting condition after using a hard Control effect or Stun break skill. Recharge: 6s 1 Swiftness for 6s Removes 1 inhibiting condition When a warband member gains Swiftness, apply 1 Superspeed for 4s to them. The old effect was to situational and the second though to give the knockback to your warband looked really weird. The new effect works now hand to hand with Ashen Demeanor. * Heartpiercer Bleeding you inflict deals more damage. Gain fury when you critically strike a foe below the health threshold. Damage Increase: 25% Recharge: 8s Health Threshold: 50% 1 Fury for 6s I just took the old effect from Endless Enmity and put it here. A replacement for the Piercing was needed. * All for One Using Legendary Renegade abilities grants protection to allies near the summoned warband member. 1 Protection for 1.5s Number of Allied Targets: 5 Radius: 360 Reduces direct damage to your warband by 50%. The Protection applies even, when you just move your warband. It's balanced on the 10 Energy you are sacrificing. **Minor Grandmaster** * Brutal Momentum While at full endurance, increase your chance to critically strike. Gain vigor when you gain fury. Recharge: 8s 1 Vigor for 6s Critical Chance Increase: 33% Solid no change needed. **Major Grandmaster** More impactful. * Vindication Gaining Kalla's Fervor grants you might. Citadel Bombardment pulls more missiles into Tyria for every stack of Kalla's Fervor affecting you. 1 Might for 3s Increased Missiles per Kalla's Fervor: 1 Cast time: 0.75s Energy cost: 35 Recharge: 15s Damage: 140 2 Burning for 2s Ordnance Count: 10 Ordnance: 3 Radius: 120 Range: 900 When used it consume 5 charges of Kallas Fervor, it gets increased properties. Energy cost: Reduced to 25. Creates a Fire field at the end of the skill. Duration: 3s Combo Field: Fire Radius: 120 It acts now as Napalm strike. Maybe should have a rectangular field instead. * Lasting Legacy Kalla's Fervor you inspire lasts longer. Increase your maximum potential stacks of Kalla's Fervor. 10 New Maximum Stacks: 300 Ferocity, 20% Condition Duration Duration Increase: 50% Heroic Command Cast time: 0.5s Energy cost: 15 Recharge: 10s When used, it consume 5 charges of Kallas Fervor, it gets increased properties. Cast time: Instant Energy cost reduced to 10. Halves the interval time of your warband for 3s. More burst on your utilities and heal. Citadel Orders still only consume 5 stacks. * Righteous Rebel While you have maximum stacks of Kalla's Fervor, receive reduced damage from conditions and range attacks. Your Warband receives the defensive effects. Orders from Above lasts longer and affects a larger area. For the player Condition Damage Reduced: 25% Damage Reduced: 10% Range Threshold: 360 Stacks with Close Quarters. For the warband Condition Damage Reduced: 50% Damage Reduced: 20% Range Threshold: 360 Duration Increase: 50% Radius Increase: 120 Warband members stay active even when you switch legends. Mostly defensive. Orders from Above still gets his consum bonus. You can naturally, not move you warband when yuo are in a other legend. **Revenant** **Mechanic** * Energy Will still be the same. * Primary and Legendary Stances: This idea should help the revenant on his lack of skills. Revenant gets a new slot for a Primary Legend. You have still 2 Legendary Stances, but the Primary Legend will give you access to 3 new skills like the Citadel Orders and Fervor based on the legend. Primary legend skills are based on people and the environment the character lived in. The Legend that is used as a Primary can still be used as stance. You can't switch the Primary Legend in combat. * Jalis's Fervor: Increase your stats to 20 Power, 30 Toughness per stack, up to 5 charges. You get the Fervor through taken damage and critical strikes. * Mallyx's Fervor: Increase your stats to 30 Condition Damage, 20 Precision per stack, up to 5 charges. You get the Fervor through critical strikes and boon removel. * Ventari's Fervor: Increase your stats to 30 Healing Power, 20 Toughness per stack, up to 5 charges. You get the Fervor through healing and removing conditions. * Shiro's Fervor: Increase your stats to 20 Ferocity 30 Power per stack, up to 5 charges. You get the Fervor through flanking and critical strikes. * Glint's Fervor: Increase your stats to 4% Boon Duration, 20 Power per stack, up to 5 charges. You get the Fervor through appling boons and critical strikes. They don't need to be called Fervor, but something based on there past life. **Primary Legend example** * Ventari * Pale Tree Grants barriers around a target area. Cast time: 0.75s Energy cost: 35 Recharge: 15s Initial Barrier: 650 Barrier per Pulse: 325 Number of Allied Targets: 5 Duration: 3s Interval: 1s Radius: 120 Range: 900 When used, it consume 5 charges of Ventari's Fervor, it gets increased properties. Cast time: 0.5s Energy cost reduced to 20. A Trait in Salvation would change it into, create a massive barrier and heals for small amount every pulls on a target area. A Water Field for 3s appears at the end of the skill, when 5 charges of Ventari's Fervor are used. Please give your thoughts on the Renegade changes and ideas what skills you would apply to a primary legend or what would you change. Thanks for reading"
140,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Druid is still unreachable,4,7bgl7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7bgl7s/druid_is_still_unreachable/,2017-11-08 08:55:42,"Removing grace of the lands from the game was essentially the first try to remove the druid as the predominant healer. The problem is that the new might buffs are so strong, that the sheer utility of a healing druid is nearly unreachable for other full healers ( e.g. not off healers like the condi druid ). Well at least as full harrier druid. With it's 95 to 100% boon duration it can do the following: * 25 Stacks might on 10 people * 100% fury uptime without mesmer and quickdraw via warhorn * Strong sustained heal via high duration regeneration stacks * Strong burst via water field blasts and ca * 10 man spirits * 5 man spotter * Strong cc via pets * 2/3 vigor uptime with sun spirit for 10 people Furthermore he can also do the following misc utility if needed: * Group rez * Group stunbreak * 100% protection uptime on 10 man via stone spirit * 100% vigor uptime via pet swap if playing axe * Aoe immobilize via entangle or single target immobilize via jacaranda * High amount of vulnerability via jacaranda (fotm) * Multiple pushes and knockbacks So even if a ele or a rev healer heal more, I just don't see how they can keep up with this much utility. So I would still say that the double druid will stay meta for groups that need two healers. Or let's put it like this: Imo removing grace of the lands did nothing for weakening the druid as the alpha healer. Or what do you think? P.S.: Yes, I am aware the high level groups mostly use hybrid condi druids as dps/healers, but this thread is mostly about groups that need the support of two full healers."

I just wrote this one day cause I couldn't get it out of my head. Anyways here is my idea for a Necro elite spec, the **Vampire** **Elite Spec Weapon**: Pistol both MH and OH. Because why would you only get MH Pistol, Dual Wield that shit like Alucard. **Shroud Mechanic Change**: Blood Shroud Basically my thought process was instead of it becoming like another Shroud Form Transformation, it could act more like doping. The Life force bar turns red (Blood duh) and it'll add a passive buff to stats. Except I thought it out a bit more and it got complicated. Since it doesn't change skills or add extra profession skills aside for it being activated I thought it should have some gimmicks Blood Shroud can't be activated under 100% (unless traited, which don't worry I get into later), and will have different effects when under 50%. Forced to stay in Blood Shroud for at least 6 seconds *From 51-100%: it will add 10% condi damage and duration (hey if the numbers look bad remember it's fictional) and all bleeding damage applies 2 stacks of bleed for 5 sec and all bleeding attacks add 1 extra stack of bleed for every 2 stacks of bleeding applied. *From 1-50%: 20% condi damage and duration, all non bleeding attacks apply 4 stacks of Bleed for 5 seconds and all 1% of all applied bleeding damage returns as healing *Blood Shroud will have 2% passive LF drain every 5 seconds and maybe have LF cost on weapon skills (haven't thought too much about how this will work with skills that actually regen LF, maybe they will just cost the same amount of LF they regen, idk) **Traits** Adept Minor-Predatory Instinct- increases crit rate on bleeding enemies by 10% Master Minor: Fresh Wounds- every time you apply bleeding to an enemy that has no bleeding applied from you you inflict fresh wounds (all bleeding deal 33% more damage, 20 sec duration) Grandmaster Minor: Immortality- Regen applied to you is 33% more effective, every 10th bleed applied while Blood shroud is active applies 3 sec of regen on you **Adept Majors** Life from Blood- Sanguine skills (sanguine is the vampire skill type classification name, forgot to say) will regenerate LF on cast Cull the Weak- Bleeds applied also apply vulnerability. Some sort of ICD on this one. **Master Majors** Bullet Enthusiast-Pistol 1 pierces, Pistol 2 skills regens 2%LF per hit on target and gain reduced recharge Armor of Blood-reduce damage from enemies by 1% per stack of bleeding on enemy while Blood Shroud is active (max 50%) **Grandmaster Majors** * King of Blood-LF Degeneration during Blood Shroud is lessened to 1% every 5 seconds, lessens forced time in Blood Shroud to 3 seconds and allows the entering of Blood shroud at 50%, Sanguine skills get extra effects while Blood Shroud is active * Corrosive Blood*- Every 2 stacks of bleeding applied also applies 1 stack of poison * Trigger Happy- Pistol skills gain extra effects if a 2nd pistol is equipped 5%extra outgoing damage per Pistol equipped **Weapon Skills** * Pistol 1: Blood Shot- low damage a/a that stacks bleed (2 stacks for 5sec maybe?) 1.75aspd maybe, 20% Projectile finisher (Trigger Happy: 2nd weaker shot in between regular attacks) * Pistol 2: Bullet Crucifixion- in my head this is a super cool animations attack that stuns for 1/2 sec, hits for 5 times and applies 2 stacks of bleed per hit. 30CD maybe? (Trigger Happy: Hits for 10 times instead) * Pistol 3: Thirst for blood-a projectile finisher attack that does more damage per every 5 stack of bleeding on target. (but like up to 20 and there will be a strong effect and 20 and up stacks of bleed like 10% extra damage)25CD (Trigger Happy: adds 2nd shot for half damage after initial shot for half the damage) * Pistol 4: Bloodletter- low damage skill that recovers LF and applies bleeding that also gets more effects depending on the amount of bleed on the enemy(applies more bleeding and get more LF per stack of bleed on enemy up to a certain cap)15CD (Trigger Happy: changes targeting to cone and hits 2 targets instead) * Pistol 5: Bullet Curse- shoots 3 low damage bullets that have different effects. 1st bullet applies 10vul, 2nd bullet applies 5sec cripple, 3rd bullet 1sec daze 25CD (Trigger Happy: adds a 2nd shot in between shots that hits for half the effect) **Heal Skill** Blood Feast- I'm thinking now there might already be a skill that uses this name I can't remember. Anyways it'll have a low initial heal and then for the next 10 seconds 20% of damage returns as healing (25CD) **Utilities** *Vampire Shift- I couldn't think of a better name. It'll have an ammo system (3? 1/2 in between cast 10 sec ammo regen) and is a short 600 range blink (King of Blood - Becomes leap finsher and evade 3/4s ) * Covenant of Blood- Link up to 5 allies in a 600 rd and your allies receive 10% of all healing you receive, and you get 5% of all healing all the allies receive. (King of Blood- also shares other boons for half the duration) * Enthrall- single target 1 second daze and applies 2 stacks of bleed(10 sec?) if it interrupts applies extra bleed. Maybe on ammo system (2 ammo count) (King of Blood- also applies 2 sec of immobilize and heals an amount per stack of bleed on enemy) * Bloodlust- Bleed target and gain 2 stacks of might and .5% Lf for every 5 stacks of bleed on target (45CD) (King of Blood- also applies 2s Fury per 5 stacks of bleed) *Blood Curse- mark a target and bleed them after 5 sec enemy explodes in a Blood Nova(blast finisher) damaging enemies in 600rd and transfering half the amount of bleed they have. Alternatively can manually explode for 300rd explosion and full bleed stack transfer.(45CD)side note I can't really think of a good name for this. (King of Blood-all enemies that were hit by the initial blood nova will explode with lesser blood nova after 5 seconds, med damage, applies 10 stacks of bleed to all enemy hit) **Elite** Festival of Blood- lots of skills with the name blood I know * summons blood field that makes everyone in it apply 2 stacks of bleed every 3rd damage tick * pulses 2 stacks of bleed and 1 stack of cripple every 2 sec * follows user 900rd, 20s duration affects up to ten people. * Dark Field (King of Blood- changes stacks of bleed applied to 5 per pulse and changes to 2 stacks of bleed for every damage tick) **Final Notes** There are some empty slots in the traits because I couldn't think of any more that fit there that wouldn't be overpowered. Again, I'm not a developer or anything like that and all these are just ideas. TL;DR: I watched Hellsing and thought gunslinger necro would be cool. "
143,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"What's your opinion about Revenant's energy system and power builds?

I'm not good at doing builds or anything, just trying to improve. I'll talk mainly about Power Herald with no intent to be a main healer but any group buffs is a plus.* ------------------------------ My conclusion, and please change my view if you think I'm wrong, is that the energy system makes you play the UI or worry too much about resource management if you want to do optimal DPS or fill a certain role. And by optimal DPS I mean trying to at least compete with an auto-attacking Daredevil. It's like you're full of awful trade-offs like Facet of Nature vs Impossible Odds. The staff has amazing CC but no traits for damage and you do around 70% of traited sword damage (not counting vulnerability). The hammer feels very subpar for the occasional-temporary-ranged-weapon-switch, like rifle warrior. If you want **good** CC you use staff (and lose a potential ranged weapon switch) or you use a skill that drains like your entire energy. Charged Mists is just too good not to use but trying to drain Glint is boring and the damage modifier is also dependent on it. Mallyx's ult has a weird cast time and the utilities don't synergize well. Jalis is LIFE. Damn I would really like to be able to camp Jalis (so much fun) for deeps and use my second stance just for a secondary role like CC or maybe even heals if the group is struggling. How cool would an axe/axe jalis rev would be? The animations and theme are nice, and the whole legend theme is just amazing. The weapons are cool (except for the trade-offs I mentioned). I will revisit Revenant each update, but at the current state I don't feel like playing it."

URL *Im using the exact same set on Heart of mist, which is marauder + rune of scholar. Those 273 damage difference were quite significant since triple tap relied on critical hit + number of attack. Please do something about rifle deadeye @net. Your slow malice system are taking heavy toll to rifle power spec, forcing us to play cat and mouse just to deal damage number that can easily achievable by spamming p/p unload. Instead of dealing 2 vulnerability, you can give deadly aim/ cursed bullet buff that will increase your death's judgement damage (or maybe it will give next death's judgement full malice damage when at full stack).

Unlike Dhuumfire, this application of vulnerability is not capped and works the same way as the base torment+cripple application of F1-5 abilities. This vulnerability can stack up to 8 times (2 stacks of vulnerability multiplied by 4 applications) with being near you and 3 lesser shades. **Reapers Might** - Using the F1 ability should apply only 1 stack of might on you. Unlike Dhuumfire and Unyielding Blast, 1 stack of might is only applied when using F1 and not applied when using F2-5 abilities. **F5/Desert Shroud** - Enter a shroud that is intended to pulse out only 2 stacks of torment to foes near you and/or your shades. * If a foe is **near 1 shade** it will receive **1 stack** (not 2 stacks) of torment per pulse. * If a foe is **near 2 shades** it will receive **2 stacks** of torment per pulse. * If a foe is **near 3 shades** (not a Greater Shade) it will receive **3 stacks** (not 2 capped stacks) of torment per pulse. * If a foe is **near you** it will receive **2 stacks** of torment per pulse with an additional stack of torment+cripple at the initial cast of this skill due to F1/Manifest Sand Shades mechanic. This additional stack of torment+cripple is not applied to foes only near shades when casting F5/Desert Shroud unlike skills F1-4. * If a foe is **near you and 1 shade** it will receive **3 stacks** (not 2 capped stacks) of torment per pulse with an initial stack of torment+cripple. * If a foe is **near you and 2 shades** it will receive **4 stacks** of torment per pulse with an initial stack of torment+cripple. * If a foe is **near you and 3 shades** it will receive **5 stacks** of torment per pulse with an initial stack of torment+cripple. I wish all of these effects were capped like Dhuumfire to discourage shade stacking. While shade stacking, F5/Desert Shroud has a burst when using Unyielding Blast to max out vulnerability stacks on 3 targets in 3 seconds and permanently maintain those stacks with the adept trait alone. Other capped effects I appreciate that are like Dhuumfire include F1/Manifest Sand Shades barrier via the Desert Empowerment trait, F1/Manifest Sand Shades boon conversion via the Unending Corruption trait, F2/Nefarious Favors condition conversion, F2/Nefarious Favors boon conversion via the Path of Corruption trait, F3/Sand Cascades barrier, and F4/Garish Pillars fear. I at least wish there was more consistency and clarity with skill descriptions. For example, why does F1/Manifest Sand Shade still describe that summoning a shade uses life force? **TL;DR** Scourge F ability mechanics are not working the way they are described, and their interactions with traits are inconsistent. Devs wanted to discourage stacking shades, but you get the most condition damage by stacking shades."
147,vulnerability,Guildwars2,PoF elite specialization discussion: Post release,33,72djpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/72djpo/pof_elite_specialization_discussion_post_release/,2017-09-26 02:25:58,"So, we've had the weekend now to play around with the new elites after the changes made since the demo weekend a bit ago. And as such we should, I feel, discuss the new elites. Strengths, weaknesses, and general opinion. Ideas on what needs changing one way or another. That sort of thing. I'll start us off talking about the ones that I've played. Weaver, Scourge, and Deadeye. Only those three for me, as I haven't worked on my ranger, revenant or engi enough for those, and my warrior and mesmer aren't even 80 yet. Further, from me there will only be my thoughts on PvE, open world and dungeons/fractals though no raids, as I don't PvP often. 'Cause I'm terrible at it. So first up, my main. Elementalist: Weaver New Class Mechanic: The new class mechanic with weaver is quite fun and can lead to some interesting combinations. The sheer plethora of skills that come from it are staggering, and if you enjoy stance dancing like I do it is just incredible. If you don't, stick with with a staff tempest or something, since you won't enjoy what you have to do to get the most out of it. Not much else for me to mention here, as it doesn't really modify your class mechanic as greatly as the scourge changes to shroud does or the like. It still modifies it, and the weapon skills show that no less(and in fact likely more) work was put into it than other class specializations, but it's pretty straightforward. New Utility Skills: The new utility skills for weaver are okay in my opinion. They aren't great, and I think I prefer the shouts from tempest a bit more, but they aren't terrible. The heal skill feels a bit weak to me, but most the ele heal skills do. Which can be explaned by the fact that we can always attune water and get a bit more healing that way, no matter what weapon(s) we're using. The elite is fun, and feels fairly impactful with the benefits of it, and when you can pull off attuning to all the elements, making enemies float is amusing. New traits: The weaver trait line is interesting. It definitely lends itself more to a condi build than pure power. Though it has a bit of potential giving yourself some boons, and some okay survivability. Which you want when using the sword since you're a squishy in melee. There are some that I'm... Eh... About. I don't think I'll ever use Elements of Rage, for example. The damage boost could be nice, especially paired with fire's pyromancer's training water's aquamancer's training, and scholar runes, so long as you stay above 90% health. It would be a nice 40% damage increase when attuned to only fire above 90% health. But others are quite nice. For a condi stance dancing build Weaver's Prowess is very nice. For... Just about any build, but especially ones using Air as another trait line, Swift Revenge means a constant 7% damage increase. Because you'll pretty much always have swiftness or superspeed. So a solid trait line overall. New Weapon: The sword is the weakest part of the elite spec, I think. It's 1 feels too slow, still, and the majority of it's abilities feel a bit... Weak, to me, compared to other weapons, no matter what sort of build you're going for. Part of this could just be me still getting used to sword range on a character I'm too used to keeping my distance on, and thus perhaps missing more often than I should. Or it could be a result of running fire/earth as other traits to help condi damage and a bit of survivability. But I just feel as a power weaver it doesn't quite hit hard enough, and as a condi weaver it takes a bit longer to build condition stacks than feels right. But I still think this is the weakest of the weapons available. A pure condi weaver would likely see better numbers using scepter/dagger or scepter/focus. A power weaver(or really any power ele) would likely see better output from a staff. Next is... Thief: Deadeye Okay. I like the deadeye. I like the traits, I like the utilities, I like the weapon. So I might be coming through a bit biased, but I'll try not to. New Class Mechanic: The new class mechanic is malice as a new resource and marking which replaces stealing, and is a bit better about how it changes your class's play style. Malice is a flat damage buff. It has a couple other interactions with utility skills and such, but it's pretty much just damage. And it's nice. Marking replaces steal, as said, and is done at range, and doesn't teleport you in. Which makes since as deadeye is a very long range spec. When paired with rifle. It lasts 25 seconds, and takes 10 seconds when you're attacking to build up full malice. That leaves 15 seconds to deal 15% higher damage. With one of the grandmaster traits it goes up to 21% more damage at max. Which is lovely. But takes 10.5 seconds, leaving 14.5 for your burst damage. So, yeah. Half a second less of max damage, but your max damage will exceed the max damage without it. All in all, a nice little mechanic. New Utilities: So your new utilites are cantrips and all in all, they're very nice changes. The heal is very nice, especially with malice stacks. Your other utilites are good as well, mostly focused on keeping the enemy away from you in one way or another with modifiers for marked targets or malice. In PvE the elite is a bit less useful as revealed isn't quite as big a deal there. I'm sure it's great for PvP, but in PvE you aren't going to be relying on stealth QUITE as much, though it can still be useful. Especially if you Revealed Malice, and pop in and out of revealed with it for more power and quicker malice generation. I prefer to run a different elite. New Traits: The new trait line is pretty solid, and lead themselves to a nice bit of diversity. While other builds are certainly possible, I see two main builds a deadeye can really focus on. Pure damage or boon sharing. A condi build could be interesting, focusing on p/p and d/d, but I haven't toyed with it much, as I like the rifle. Pure damage should be obvious. Take ones that give increased damage or crit chance and run with it. But boon sharing could be interesting. All the stolen skills give a boon and apply a condition to your target. With Peripheral Vision your stolen skills apply their boons to allies near you and the conditions to targets near the marked target. Fire for Effect makes it so that hitting your target with a stolen skill grants 10 might to alies around it. And if you're far enough away, allies around you as well. Then you can take the one that makes it so that using a cantrip grants another stolen skill. With proper traits in other lines(such as the one that lets you use stolen skills twice) and you can get some decent boons spread out, if a bit randomly as to which boons they are. New Weapon: Rifle I really like the rifle. I do. But it has issues. It can hit very, very hard, and is focused around making sure you do. But it is a very immobile weapon. Which can make it tricky to use properly, especially when soloing. You have to constantly avoid AoE attacks, which is time you're not attacking and thus malice is building up slower and you aren't dealing damage. And if you get hit by the AoE you better hope it doesn't knock you down or the like, as that knocks you out of kneeling. Which costs initiative to renenter, and that means you might end up missing out on hitting your 4 skill more than once. But, when you do hit it... Oh boy. I think the lowest I've seen it hit for with my deadeye is 9000 damage. Though I've never tried using it with 0 malice, that's still a very nice number to see floating away from an enemy. And with full malice, full might, them with full vulnerability, and the, relatively, easy to achieve 100% crit chance and 200% crit damage? That number will get to 15k+, no problem. More, depending on how well geared you are and all. Overall I really like rifle, but don't think it's going to be seen quite as often as other weapon loadouts in fractals and raids and such. Simply because other loadouts will let you deal damage more consistantly, without reliance on being stationary. Further, kneeling takes 5 initiative. So if you do stop kneeling either due to being knocked out of it or having to move to avoid an AoE, keep that in mind, as kneeling again may make it so you miss your window on Death's Judgement. Deadeye Note: One thing of note is that deadeyes do not have anything that gives them the new barrier mechanic. I know that Elementalist and Necromancer both do, not sure about the others, but deadeye does not get this. And finally... Necromancer: Scourge New Class Mechanic: This mechanic is the one, of those that I played, that changes your class the most. You no longer enter a shroud state. Instead you summon up to 3 sand shades, which are immobile AoE areas, basically, that last 20 seconds. These shades build up to having 3 stored using the ammunition system. They do damage and apply conditions when plopped down. Then you have four shroud skills that center around you and your shades. These are cast from your life force bar as a resource, which shades are not and can be placed freely so long as you have them to place. These skills affect the area around your shades AND around you. So you can use them without placing any shades. There's only one that deals damage and it takes the most life force to cast, but they're all useful. It's a very interesting mechanic. New Class Utilities: Scourges get punishments. Which are all abilities that give you and/or allies positive effects and your enemies negative ones, mostly by corrupting boons on them which turns them from a boon into a condition(s). Three of them also grant barrier(your heal and two regular utilities), which combined with the barrier you can get from one of your shade abilities means that you can get(and grant) substantial amount of barrier. This really, really helps in mitigating the loss of the extra health bar effect of a non-scourge's shroud, and keeps the necro from losing it's place as being very hard to kill. So that's nice. And I can see many groups bringing along a scourge for the barriers, condi-removal, and boon removal/corruption. And to a lesser extent, boon sharing. I don't, however, see it replacing other necro specs for damage output. It's good, but not great. New Class Traits: Scourge traits focus around 2 things, with one split into two categories. Support and condi damage. For support you have two ways to go about it. Condition removal and boon removal/corruption. Not much to say on those. It focuses on either supporting your team by giving more barrier and granting might and removing conditions, or by making your boon corruption beneficial for you. Increased life force, gaining the corrupted boon, making it easier to corrupt boons. That sort of thing. For condi damage your focus is more on torment and burning rather than the bleeding that is so easy to get as a necro. But it's fairly standard stuff. Torment applying burning, more expertise, that sort of thing. The most interesting trait is, I think, Sand Savant. A grandmaster trait that makes it so you can only have one shade at a time, but it has a larger AoE, can affect more allies and enemies, and a reduced recharge. So instead of having three smaller shades spread out over an area to affect as many allies/enemies as possible, you have one big one hitting a large area. Just interesting to see a trait that modifies a modified mechanic in such a way. Minor note for condi damage scourges: Demonic Lore is nice, sure. Boosts your torment damage and all. But if you grab it, grab it for that, not for the burning on a tormented target, since that burning can only inflict one target every three seconds. It's not a bad source of burn, but the increased tormet damage is the more beneficial part I feel New Class Weapon: The scourge gets a torch and it's... Nothing to write home about really. The abilities are not bad, by any means. Though never use the 5 to boost allies near the target after removing their conditions. Accidentally did that and they got no might. It could just be that after playing one class with 5 new weapon skills thanks to having a rifle, and another with roughly half a billion thanks to being an elementalist, just getting two feels a bit of a rip off. But I suppose that could be a tradeoff from how drastically the scourge's class mechanic changed. Final thoughts. Of the elite specs that I've played they're fairly solid and interesting. They have foibles and some will see more PvE use than others if I guess right(poor rifle deadeye), but overall fairly solid. Some changes I would suggest are fixing Weaver's 1 so that it doesn't feel so slow OR so that it feels as slow as it is, but feels more impactful, making it so that deadeye rifle users aren't punished so heavily for having to stop kneeling(I realize it is an integral part of their mechanic and a rather powerful mechanic, but I fear it will lead to too many people not using the rifle. Or refusing to stop kneeling and dying in an AoE). For scourge... Not much, really. I like reaper better, but that's not due to an inherent issue with scourge. Reaper just fits my play-style better. Scourge seems fairly solid to me in a support role, though perhaps a bit weak in a damage role. So maybe improve that a bit? Would like to hear from others on this, their own opinions on matters or comments on mine. How other elite specs feel, both in pve and pvp, and so on."
148,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"Interesting ""Hidden"" Mechanics of Scourge's Shade and Shroud Traits.",120,72xqu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/72xqu2/interesting_hidden_mechanics_of_scourges_shade/,2017-09-28 14:08:29,"Lately I've been testing out Scourge and how the Shade abilities interact with traits that influence Shroud. Here are some of my findings. Now I saw these are hidden because the whole shroud mechanic has changed and the traits don't properly really represent that. You would never know how these interact without testing. 1. From blood magic, F5, enter desert shroud, is considered ""going into shroud"". So the trait unholy matron (which absorbs conditions and gives you life force) activates while F5 is active. F4 is considered shroud ability 4. So traits like Transfusion will work here. See your team about to get stomped? Get within a decent range and use F4. It will give them 2% of health + teleport up to 5 players to your feet! Life From Death will activate when you leave your desert shroud (F5). 4. From soul reaping. Foot in Grave will turn your F5 ability into a stability granting stunbreak. Speed of shadows also works here when using F5. Dhuumfire will make every one of your F abilities inflict burning. Including summon shade. So when you summon shade at a location, it inflicts burning to all within range. Unyielding blast works the same way, making all your F abilities apply vulnerability. Vital Presence - this gives you reduced shroud skills recharge and give you vitality. This also affects the shade skills. Except summon shade. So your F2-f5 all have reduced recharge. 7. From the Spite tree, spiteful spirit works with the F5 ability and so does Rendering shroud. 8. From curses, enfeebling shroud now works with F5. Path of corruption works with F2, giving it the ability to convert 2 conditions at once at each shade location (and around you). 9. From Death Magic, Unholy Sancuary, Beyond the Veil, and Shrouded Removal all work with F5. So now F5 can remove conditions over time, give you regen, and give you and your allies protection when it ends. Combine this with lets say Soul reaper. Deadly strength, increases your power based on vit and doubles in shroud, also works. 6. Also, the shade abilties can be used WHILE in Lich Form. So that means all those bonuses are carried over into Lich Form. So you can get a 50% increased to your crit chance if you use F5 while in Lich Form. So Death Magic + Soulreaping. This puts your F5 desert shroud on a 16 second recharge time. So you get a 16 second stun breaker that grants stability, pulsing health, condition removal, grants swiftness, removes movement impairing conditions. Unlike before, you don't have to enter shroud and lose all your abilities. So you still have all your utilities, weapon abilities, weapon switching, and F2-F4 abilities to use. Not sure if this will be meta, but i just love how they interact. Makes the class a lot more interesting now. I thought that was really cool and opens up to some really fun plays in my eyes. "
149,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Weaver dagger/focus crit build,15,73hdvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/73hdvq/weaver_daggerfocus_crit_build/,2017-10-01 07:44:59,"Fellow elementalists, are you tired of using a staff? Do you not want to buy condi gear? Do you want carpal tunnel syndrome? &amp;nbsp; If you answered yes to any of these questions then this is the build for you! &amp;nbsp; **Link**: URL &amp;nbsp; **Build premise**: This build uses arcane and the air grandmaster trait 'fresh air' to constantly hop between stances, whilst spamming dual attacks and air 1 (lightning whip). It maintains 80-100% uptime on all of the core buffs (explained in the rotation section) and gives you very fast access to all skills on your weapons. Survivability comes from two sources of arcane shield, a 20% cd reduction on arcane shield, earth 5 for invuln, and air/earth 4 against projectiles. I've only used this in pve, I imagine its too squishy for pvp but if someone wants to give it a go let me know how it works out. &amp;nbsp; **Traits** Air Passive: +25% movespeed when attuned to air. You are almost always to air in this build, so this is a nice bonus (1) **Ferocious winds** a big ferocity boost, no competition from the other traits in this tier Passive: **Lightning strike**, a chunk of damage when you switch to air with no cooldown, you will be switching to air a lot (2) **aeromancers training** for the precision and the cd reduction, again no competition in this tier Passive: **Weak spot**, vulnerability on crit, no cooldown, more damage :) (3) **Fresh air** initially i tried bolt to the heart, but the buff uptime you get from constantly spamming air attunement is far more important. &amp;nbsp; Arcane Passive: fury (2.5s) when switching attunements. If you are on the ball this is 90-100% uptime, as you can attune to air twice in under a second with fresh air as a weaver. So it's basically just +20% crit. Nice. (1) **Arcane precision** for the on crit bonus. If soloing this is definitely the best pick as it synergises with superior elements from weaver to give +15% crit chance. Alternatively if you want more suvivability or have another source of weakness, pick **renewing stamina**. The extra endurance is a big survivability boost. Passive: gain boons when switching attunement. 100% swiftness uptime, ~50% protection/regen uptime and some might (2) **Final shielding** for survivability, this also combos strongly with your next pick (elemental surge). If you forego elemental surge this still might be the best pick, but consider **arcane resurrection** for group content Passive: +180 concentration, -15% attunement recharge. Nice. (3) **Elemental surge**. This is the main skill I would consider switching, as it is up against **Bountiful power**. Elemental surge gives you a 20% cd reduction on arcane shield and the final shielding passive, as well as +150 ferocity which you can maintain a high (75%+) uptime on. Bountiful power is +2% damage per boon, so not great for soloing but probably way better for group content where you have a constant source of buffs. &amp;nbsp; Weaver Passive: Makes you a weaver, reduces attunement cd (1) **Superior elements**, combined with arcane precision you will have near 100% uptime on weakness, so this trait is just +15% crit chance. The other traits in this tier do nothing for you. Passive: Barrier on dual attacks, no cooldown. A nice defensive buff. (2) **Swift revenge**, you have 100% swiftness uptime, so this is a flat +7% damage. **Bolstered Elements** could be taken as a survivability boost, but it has anti-synergy with arcane shield (they proc at the same time), so you might want to swap that trait out if you pick this. Passive: +120 precision/power/toughness/healing depending on attunement. For you this is basically +120-240 precision. Nice. (3) **Elements of rage** converts precision to ferocity, a huge buff, but also gives +10% damage when dual attuning to one element. If you've spotted the pattern you would be right in thinking you will get 100% uptime on this, so another +10% damage. Nice. &amp;nbsp; **Skills** Healing skill: **Arcane brilliance**. This is a preference for me, and the highest damage option as it gives arcane lightning for 15s (+150 ferocity), on a 20s cd. If you haven't specced for arcane skills then **glyph of elemental harmony** is probably better. Skills: I am using **Arcane shield**, **Stone resonance** and **Glyph of fire**. These give you high defence and some more passive crit, however if you are confident with the build you could swap out stone resonance for **Conjure frost bow**, just so you can use its 4 attack which is amazing against large hitbox targets. Elite skill: **Conjure fiery greatsword**. You have no particular synergy with this, but you can still stance swap like crazy when using it and its damage output is insane. **Glyph of elementals** might be competitive, but I don't think it is. &amp;nbsp; **Rotation** With your incredibly high crit chance (100% in full exotic berskers, with the help of your buffs), air stance will always be available. Your goal is to switch constantly from air/air to either air/earth or air/fire, and then immediately back to air/air, all whilst spamming their auto attacks and dual skills. &amp;nbsp; In air/air spam 1 and use 2 off cd, and save 3-5 for defense when you need them. The main reason for going air/air is to maintain 100% uptime on elements of rage (+10% damage). &amp;nbsp; In air/earth use attack 3 **grinding stones** and attack 2 **ring of earth** and then immediately switch back to air. You are only switching to earth to use grinding stones, as it is a strong damage over time you don't need to channel, and you will continue to cast it after switching back to air/air. It may be wrong to use ring of earth at all as the damage is low and it has a 0.75s cast time, but I've been slipping it in to the rotation where possible. &amp;nbsp; As you switch out of earth/air you will briefly go through air/earth and have access to earth attacks 4 and 5, which give you 3 seconds of reflect and 5 seconds of invuln respectively. Use them as needed. &amp;nbsp; In air/fire you should use the dual attack (**plasma burst**) for the swiftness/weakness it provides, and possibly attack 2 **drakes breath** before switching back to air/air. (drakes breath also might be worth skipping in favor of more air 1 auto attacks, but i think the damage is closer/slightly favors drakes breath, and its better for aoe). &amp;nbsp; Whilst you are in fire/air you should use attacks 5 (**fire shield**) for the free burn damage and might, and possibly attack 4 **flamewall** if you are with a group who can use the combo field (you can get might from it using arcane brilliance and earth 4 as blast finishers, which is worth doing if you can fit it in). &amp;nbsp; Other than that you don't need to switch to any other attunement combos, however water does provide a small amount of healing and regen which can be used on demand. &amp;nbsp; Use arcane brilliance and arcane shield off cd if you can for the damage boost, but equally save them if you think you will need the defense/healing in a few moments. &amp;nbsp; Fiery greatsword can be used off cooldown, but is best saved for when you want to aoe a group down, evade attacks with its attack 3, or run away by using attack 3 and 4. &amp;nbsp; **Gear** Full berserkers for the power/precision/ferocity. Assassins is fine too but you will go over 100% crit and be wasting stats. I've been socketing everything with ruby orbs (+power/ferocity/precision) as I haven't seen a rune combo I think is worth it, but let me know if you disagree as I think this could be optimized. I have no idea what is best for your weapons sigil, but you cant go too wrong with a superior sigil of force on everything (+5% damage). &amp;nbsp; **TLDR** + ~100% crit chance + 100% uptime on tons of powerful self buffs + huge single target/small ranged aoe damage + moderate/good surviability, easily able to solo groups and multiple elites + not another staff build - you have to press so many keys, this build has no chill"
150,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Utterly horrible multiplayer Story Mode [Spoilers],0,73hyy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/73hyy2/utterly_horrible_multiplayer_story_mode_spoilers/,2017-10-01 09:28:38,"Guild Wars 2 has consistently had terrible, terrible implementation of multiplayer participation in its Story Mode. Sometimes the second player can interact with items, sometimes they cannot. Sometimes they can see conversations, sometimes they cannot. Sometimes they are useful additions to the instance, sometimes they have literally nothing to do. Having played every Living Story mission and every HoT mission through in multiplayer, it just reeks of horrible implementation, inconsistency, and uselessness. Having just played through the finale to Act 2 of the PoF story, however, ArenaNet has sunk to a new low. In my opinion it may have been the single worst multiplayer experience of the entire game. The fight involves the Eater of Souls, a difficult boss with a life draining attack and brief break-bar. The first player is playing as their normal character (with a few thematically-important cosmetic differences), and has access to their full line of skills. The second player is Navi, from Ocarina of Time. I wish I were kidding. The second player is a small floating, glowing orb spirit, cleverly named ""Lost [Class]"", and has none of their skills or abilities. Instead, they have three abilities: 1. Grant Might. This ability is a 4.5s channel which, upon cast, gives one stack of 3s of might to an ally within range. After the channel is complete, the skill goes on a 5s cooldown. 2. Grant Vulnerability. This is the exact same as Grant Might, but gives one stack of 3s of vulnerability to an enemy in range instead. Again, after a 4.5s channel, it goes on a 5s cooldown. 3. Grant Regeneration. This is an AoE targeted spell (roughly the size of a typical Guardian symbol) which grants 3s of Regen to allies in the area. It has a 20s cooldown. These abilities are a **fucking joke**. Granting one stack of might, or one stack of vulnerability, is utterly meaningless given the incredibly short duration and incredibly long CD of each ability. The fact that the buff/debuff actually runs out *before the skill is even done casting* adds to the embarrassment. The Regen is a joke as well, given that one of the main mechanics of the encounter involves consistently dodging away from the boss, thus minimizing the amount of time your ally will actually stay in the zone. As if these limp, ineffective abilities aren't bad enough, the encounter *actively punishes having multiple targets*. The boss's life drain ability can target the ally, almost immediately downing them while granting the boss up to half his HP back. Given that you're a glowing orb, with zero evasive or defensive abilities, you are almost certain to be hit by the ability. The worst part of all of this, to my eyes, is that all of this had to have been **intentionally implemented by the devs.** If this were a bug involving your default gear or equipment, I would understand. In some story instances in LS3, non-primary players were simply teleported out of the way and locked in place to avoid having to deal with them - this, while eminently frustrating, is at least an understandable shortcut for handling the problem. But to intentionally lock non-primary players into the most useless, demeaning, impotent form possible is utterly insulting. For a game that's supposed to be playable with friends, ArenaNet is doing everything they can to just fuck over those of us who try to experience the story in a party. It would have been far, FAR better to simply not allow party members into this instance. These abilities are a fucking joke, and whatever ArenaNet dev decided they should be implemented should be locked into that orb form for their entire GW2 experience. It is utterly and completely unacceptable. If you have ANY plans to play the story of this expansion, **DO IT SOLO**: ArenaNet clearly does not value your playtime or gaming experience as a member of a party."

I just want to give my low effort ideas on the current concept of a group mount. What would make this mount unique from the rest is, it should be a group mount and a siege mount. Now Anet has already said they want to avoid using mounts as combat only, but I still want to make this idea. Have different seats or roles on the mount, like what you will see in Battlefield with a gunner, driver, spotter, etc. The utility skills are abilities that let you switch seats around if they are available. Weapon skills are abilities that vary on your seat. * Driver - speed boost and temporary self-defense buffs. * Gunner - Have artillery skills. (Maybe only make them debuffs like vulnerability, weakness, cripple, etc. to make it balance I guess) * Support - Provide support to allies around (For example, regen, AOE heal, quickness, etc.) I had to rush this idea out because it sounds exciting in my head but again I don't expect Arena Net to do something like this. Anyway, my lunch is ending soon :D"
152,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[qT] Path of Fire Builds and Benchmarks,1572,74b1ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/74b1ik/qt_path_of_fire_builds_and_benchmarks/,2017-10-05 07:41:48,"**Hey guys,** &gt;**All of the builds we used for the benchmarks, written rotations and more in depths details about the classes and builds can be found on our website: [qtfy.eu](URL &gt; If you can't see the new stuff: Make sure to hard-refresh ([CTRL] + [F5]) or clear your cache. We've all been hard at work, figuring out new gear and testing builds. There are still a few things missing, but we plan to continue updating stuff over the next few days. **Which new classes came into Meta and what changed in general** With Path of Fire a lot of strong Condi Specs were added. Scourge, Weaver, Renegade, Firebrand and Soulbeast all got powerful builds hitting 37-39k DPS on the golem. Additionally Weaver has a very strong Power build on the golem, although its very niche in an actual raid, and Power Holosmith is an upgrade from Power Engi but still falls behind Weaver/Tempests and DragonHunter. Double PS Warrior, Druid and Chrono are recommended for every raid group. Its possible that you could replace 1 PS Warrior with a Renegade, since it does provide a fair amount of might. Or play with an alacrity Chrono combined with a quickness Firebrand, to give buffs, but we believe its worse overall everywhere except maybe the mursaat overseer. Otherwise not much changed, except we have a few more DPS builds to pick from for each encounter. Something that has become very noticeable though, is the severe lack of CC on almost every new DPS build. Which puts even more pressure on the Druid and Chrono to CC properly. ## Class Specific changes: **Warrior:** Not much changed here. Both Condi PS and DPS builds received some damage nerfs, targeting blade master and wounding precision, resulting in about a 1k personal DPS loss. PS warrior remains a must-have for every group, but DPS warrior is outclassed now by a lot of the new elite specs from other classes. Spellbreaker is sadly not the saviour of power warrior, its completely useless for PvE. **Guardian:** Is in a really good spot right now with strong condi and power based builds, making it a solid choice for pretty much any boss. As well as dealing top tier damage, firebrand also provides about 20% quickness uptime for its sub-group and can share aegis to block powerful attacks. **Currently we only have a Viper benchmark for Condi Firebrand, even though the Griever varient gets about 1k higher DPS, because none of our Guardian players have the gear. We plan to update the benchmark once Griever insignias have become available ingame.** **Revenant:** Renegade was everything Condi Revenant needed, you can now replace the weak trait line Invocation with Renegade and swap out the Jalis Legend with Kalla. Less of the damage on Condi Renegade comes torment compared to Condi Revenant, which makes is less reliant on moving bosses to achieve high numbers. Also the damage is a bit higher than the benchmark suggests since the Mesmer clones cant proc the bleed to its fullest effect. **Thief:** One of the biggest losers of this expansion of endgame PvE, Deadeye is only a small DPS increase over Power D/D Thief. Putting it a little higher than a PS warrior on the golem and has very weak burst compared to other power based builds. Wont see much use in Raids or fractals. However Condi DD remains untouched, so it maintains its top position on the few bosses where it can be fully utilised. **Ranger:** Soulbeast puts the Condi DPS build back into the meta, it allows you to merge with your pet for more stats and uses dagger instead of axe, but otherwise plays very similarly to Condi Ranger. Finally a much needed condi duration trait was added and while it doesnt directly affect Condi Druid, we have updated it to use the same as Condi Soulbeast. This allows easier swapping between the builds and is actually a very small DPS increase over the old krait rune setup when not using hidden barbs. **Engineer:** Power Holosmith is a fair DPS increase over power engi, Photonforge has good skills but they dont scale properly with weapons strength. The new traits Lasers Edge and Photonic Blasting Module are really powerful and synergise well with each other to maintain at least 80% uptime on the 15% damage modifier. Unfortunately it still falls behind Weaver/Tempest and Dragonhunter on most encounters. Condi Engi is still better off playing with Tools instead of any elite spec, since you get stuck in Photonforge for 5 whole seconds and theres only one good skill for a condition based build. **Elementalist:** While Weaver is very strong on the golem in reality its a very fragile Spec with a lot of downsides that arent obvious right away. Some of the problems are: Arcane Variant you apply no Vulnerability since you also lose access to Overload Air, meaning your group might not even cap Vulnerability. You dont have access to any CC apart from your Deep Freeze. Gust is a major DPS loss because you have to double attune into Air. In Wing 1 and Wing 3 Weakness cant be applied to any boss so you have to run with Signet of Fire and an Accuracy Sigil resulting in a substantial DPS loss. You lose the Protection and Stability from Overloading resulting in an even squishier class and a more interruptible rotation. **Mesmer:** Condi Mirage is a fair DPS increase over Condi Mesmer, but it still falls behind most other condi DPS builds. Chrono is pretty much in the same spot, there is a new gear set with firebrand runes thats less than 1% more effective power but sacrifices the duration of all boons other than quickness to get it. **Necromancer:** Scourge is a really strong DPS option now, especially for bosses where you can cleave mobs since Epidemic really shines there. It no longer relies on getting whirl finishers in chill fields for good DPS, and has a bunch of traits which increase condi duration allowing it to use renegade runes. ## Benchmarks: **DISCLAIMER:** * Every benchmark has been done with full +5 stat infusions. (about 2% dps increase) * Condition builds used Pinpoint Distribution. (roughly 3% - 3.5% dps increase depending on class [for example almost none on condi mesmer])We thought about removing this from realistic buffs since Engineer is quite below other Condi classes and might not be worth to take anymore but we decided to wait for the next balance patch to see if anything changes. * No Night Sigils or Scribe utility foods were used * These numbers are the numbers done in a vacuum, under almost optimal conditions.

153,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Making Deadeye make sense (or let's buff Deadeye),0,74l4bz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/74l4bz/making_deadeye_make_sense_or_lets_buff_deadeye/,2017-10-06 14:31:27,"Wall of text ahead! TL;DR below. Hi y'all! It's me again. I was just going to comment on a thread to give my two cents on a Deadeye discussion but I accidentally hit 'back' on my mobile. RIP comment, so I figured why not start a discussion instead? Here we gooooo, LET'S TALK DEADEYE. Deadeye has a unique, hyperstylized playstyle that in practice doesn't really hold up in any of GW2's game modes. We could sit here on reddit and called it a meme/lolworthy/dead spec, but I challenge you all to consider instead ways we could improve the class and make it fall in line with more stable, reliably performing classes. I've already seen some great suggestions from some of you guys. The following suggestions are a mix of those I've seen on Reddit and some of my own. -Change Death's Mark so it is instant cast. Give the cast time instead to Stolen Skills. This change retains the potential for counterplay. It's a popular opinion that the cast time on Death's Mark is clunky and its ability to be evaded nigh invalidates the already risky tactic of waiting for Malice generation. -Change Death's Mark and Malice so its effects are granted to party members and/or allies (10 for PvE, 5 for PvP+WvW). This would provide Deadeye with a baseline support ability (Something akin to a class specific Vulnerability). This group DPS boost synergizes well with Deadeye's limited support abilities. -Add peircing to certain rifle abilities. Enemy bodyblocking is the bane of Death's Judgment, a skill that already sees low uptime and low average DPS compared to the risk taken to use it. Make it so that Death's Judgment peirces targets and hits extra targets for a fraction of the primary target's damage. I think this should be baseline because were it to be a trait it might invalidate any of the traits in that tier. -Rework traits so that skills benefit mainhand/dual pistols as well as rifle. This one threatens to chip away the Deadeye's conceptual identity from a lone sniper to something more like a gunslinger, but I think it's for the best. Deadeye's traits seem to assume that players will camp rifle but as we all know, rifle is underperforming and risky to use for little reward. Why pistols? Not only are they thematically similar to rifle (firearms) but P/P is ANOTHER thief weapon set with low mobility and underperforming numbers (though imo they rock for open world and fractals that punish melee). What do y'all folks think? I'd love to hear your feedback! Deadeye doesn't have to be silly! "
154,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"On CC and pets, an extensive look at druids/soulbeasts",176,74o3j0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/74o3j0/on_cc_and_pets_an_extensive_look_at/,2017-10-07 01:51:15,"**tl;dr: rock gazelle replaces moa in all aspects** With the new expansion out, we have new pets for our rangers/druids, and a new elite spec to interact with our pets and gain all new skills. The new [qT benchmarks](URL are out, and from that post one of the important insights is: &gt; Something that has become very noticeable though, is the severe lack of CC on almost every new DPS build. Which puts even more pressure on the Druid and Chrono to CC properly. So I took some time to look at not only the new pets and soulbeast interactions, but also at established pets and mechanics, to see if we can optimise ranger gameplay a bit with regards to CC usage. I also found some interesting pet mechanics that I didn't know about before. #CC Comparisons Let me start by giving you [this gif](URL The main source of CC I will be taking into consideration is 'hard CC'. These are the CCs that have an immediate chunk effect on defiance bars, such as daze, knockdown or launch. There are two reasons for this. The main one is that defiance bars in raids usually need to be broken quickly, so the effects over time of soft CCs can take too long. The second reason is that the soft CC conditions don't stack, so 8 people applying immobilize doesn't help. A good resource is the [defiance bar wiki page](URL although some double checking needs to be done (I've made several corrections the past couple of days while testing). Back to [the gif](URL The top 8 bars are tests done on a champion golem in the fractal lobby. This golem has a small hitbox and a 600 strength defiance bar. The bottom 3 bars are additional tests on Gorseval, to also test a large hitbox for the wyvern. Do note that the top bars are recharging immediately, which doesn't happen in raids as far as I know. I just couldn't find a non-recharging defiance bar to easily test other than Gorseval. You can see all specific CC values in the table on the wiki page linked above, but the important ones I'm considering for raid purposes are: * 150 * Lunar Impact (CA #3) * Path of Scars (axe #4) * Fang Grapple (fanged iboga F2, additional 50 from 1 sec immobilize) * 200 * Concussion Shot (shortbow #5, no matter the position) * Charge (rock gazelle pet skill (and melded skill)) * Dazing Screech (pink moa F2) * 232 * Wing Buffet (electric wyvern skill (and melded skill)) * Lightning Assault (electric wyvern F2, can hit multiple times, or none, see below) * Head Toss (rock gazelle F2) * 300 * Dazing Screech (black moa F2, actually 3x100 in one second intervals) * Brutal Charge (pig pet skill (and melded skill)) * Call Lightning (storm spirit sacrifice) In the gif you can see the different effects on the defiance bar. Note that the 150 example in the gif is from the Fang Grapple fanged iboga F2, which inflicts a one second immobilize after the pull, that's why the bar recharges a bit slower (since immobilize does 50 defiance bar damage per second, that's why the 150+50 lines up with the 200 recharge). A few comments about the different bars in the gif: * The 3x100 is from the black moa F2. As you can see it is quite different from the pink moa F2, which simply does 200 damage in one go. * The 200+232 is the rock gazelle first performing its own pet attack Charge, followed immediately by the F2 Head Toss. * The 232+232 is the electric wyvern attacking with its Wing Buffet, followed immediately by the F2 Lightning Assault, hitting once. * I included CA #5 (Natural Convergence) because it can be a very useful additional CC since it inflicts multiple soft CC conditions (slow, cripple, immobilize) for a considerable time and defiance bar damage (in total over 500). The main immediate conclusion: rock gazelle is straight up better than either of the moas. Not only does it do more CC with its two skills (more than double that of the pink moa), I haven't even spoken about skill details. Here the very important part is that the Dazing Screech recharge for the moas is 30 seconds, while both gazelle skills have a much shorter recharge (15 sec for the Charge pet skill, and 20 sec for the Head Toss F2). Not to mention the pet's damage is higher in general. Non-pet observations: nothing new really, except maybe Call Lightning from the storm spirit sacrifice could be taken into account if running it in this vulnerability-lacking meta. Druids can of course use CA #3 and #5 to CC as before. Concussion Shot on shortbow is the only hard CC for the soulbeast in the current default meta build. #Pet Mechanics: Pet Positions Now, before going over to ""which pet should you use"", I have to talk about how you should use the pet. Most guides I've seen only talk about pet choices, but don't go more into detail on how pets work exactly. In fact, I found out something I didn't know and hadn't read of seen before while making this: pet positions. I'm pretty sure most of you have seen that your pet likes to stand in one position relative to you at most times while out of combat. All 'pets' work like this, including summon skills like Sylvan Hound or a necromancer's minions. There are some specific rules about this for ranger pets that I'd like to explain. First a [gif to go with the following paragraphs](URL What's happening in that gif? You can see that the pets have a set spawn location relative to my character, namely front right and back left. In fact, pets can naturally have one of three spawn locations: front left, front right, and back left, but never back right. How does this work? Well, the following information is from a few hours of testing, but much of this is even now still unclear to me, but I'll try to be as precise as I can. Whenever you load a map, the last pet that was active will always be active, and either be front left or front right. The secondary pet will be either front right or back left. This configuration will be fixed until it is forcibly changed. Pets can swap to each other's position by changing pets. As you can see in the gif, changing an active pet will swap it to the other position, while changing an inactive pet will keep the same positions. Dying or transforming (potions, mounts) will force a certain configuration 100% of the time: the last active pet will be front left, the inactive pet will be back left. Melding as a soulbeast will maintain the same configuration, but the melded pet will have the front left or right position after leaving beastmode. You can also force a change in configuration by using summons such as a Druid Spirit, Sylvan Hound, etc. This is the only way to get a pet in the back right position. You may be asking yourself why I'm explaining this seemingly useless information, but it all has to do with CC, specifically that of the electric wyvern. I'm sure many of you seasoned rangers will have had the experience of swapping to your wyvern and using its F2 only for it not to hit the target. In my testing, this happened almost 100% of the time when the wyvern was spawned inside the hitbox of the target. Often you fight close to the boss in melee range with your dps pet, and then quickly swap to the wyvern for CC. This is where positioning of the pet is key. Here is a [gif illustrating the problem](URL As you can see in the first example, I had the wyvern in the front right pet position, making it spawn inside the target's hitbox when swapped to due to my positioning. As a result, the F2 completely missed. This is even true if you let the pet attack the target for a bit, including waiting for the Wing Buffet attack before using the F2; it will still miss. Therefore, to make sure to get the highest chance of your wyvern F2 hitting the target, you should put your wyvern in a pet position that won't spawn in the target, which should usually be back left (as you will be facing the target most of the time). Note that this doesn't always help, because, as you can see in the gif, the F2 sometimes doesn't even hit from a distance, although it can hit twice even on small hitboxes. In short, while this may seem like pretty inconsequential nitpicking, if you want to have a (much) better chance at landing those wyvern F2s you should try swapping it to the back left pet position. Like I said, I've never seen anything posted about pet positions before, so if you have more information please share! I'd suggest at least giving all of this a try to see how it all works. #Pet Recommendations A shoutout to /u/enaretos for doing some [pet dps research](URL with the new pets, as well as old meta pets ([YouTube vid](URL dps tests at the end). ##Druids There won't be many surprises for people looking only for CC on their pets as a druid: the rock gazelle and electric wyvern come out on top. The moas are easily surpassed by the rock gazelle in all aspects: more CC, shorter recharges on CC, higher pet damage. There's no reason to choose a moa over a rock gazelle. The electric wyvern is particularly strong on large hitboxes, as can be seen in the [gif](URL on the Gorseval examples at the bottom. The electric wyvern consistently hits 2 or 3 times with its F2 in my testing on Gorseval. For both the rock gazelle and the wyvern, it is advised to wait for the pet to perform their own CC pet skill (which is usually cast almost immediately) before using the F2, as this is the most reliable way to impact the most amount of CC. Condi druids specifically may also take into consideration the fanged iboga as a replacement for the moa on bosses where confusion and torment work to their advantage, like Matthias. It has a 200 breakbar damage skill (150 from pull + 50 from immobilize) on a 20 second cooldown while doing very respectable damage. I didn't mention the last PoF pet with considerable soft CC, the Jacaranda. It has almost perma immobilize: its F2 Jacaranda's Embrace does over 16 seconds of immobilize on a 20 sec cooldown! However, since there are lots of other sources of immobilize and it's not a particularly fast form of CC I didn't take it too much into account. It can be of great utility though, both from its almost perma immobilize and a few stacks of vulnerability, and it does good damage too. ##Soulbeasts In the qT benchmarks the lynx is used for soulbeasts to permanently meld with. There's also the option to have bristleback as a secondary pet only to be used to pre-cast its melded pet skill Sharpen Spines which functions much like Sharpening Stone. Note that the iboga could be used instead of the lynx as well, particularly for Matthias. It is generally not recommended to unmeld with your pet to swap to a CC pet as that is a considerable dps loss. As a last resort that may be useful, since the only hard CC available to a soulbeast in the meta build is Concussion Shot from the shortbow for 200 defiance bar damage. There's another solution that could be of use: changing the lynx for the warthog. It is also a 'Deadly' type pet that buffs condi damage and grants access to Primal Cry, but of importance for CC is the melded pet skill Brutal Charge, a 3 sec knockdown leap finisher that does 300 defiance bar damage, which is considerable, although it has a 30 sec recharge. The melded skills do less damage than the melded lynx skills, but the Maul skill applies some bleeds, and the knockdown could trigger the minor soulbeast trait Twice as Vicious. The warthog shouldn't be used unmelded, so perhaps the lynx could be used as a secondary pet in this case to swap to in case of forced unmelds (down state). #Conclusions Moas are out, in favour of the rock gazelle. Several of the new pets offer viable alternatives, such as the fanged iboga and jacaranda. Druids now have quite a few more options to choose from, and can change pets depending on the encounter and squad requirements. If using the electric wyvern, I'd suggest looking at the part about pet positions and trying it out in game. Soulbeasts don't have many CC options, and in some groups it may be considered to use a warthog to meld with instead of a lynx. If you have a correction, addition, or suggestion, please let me know. #Edits Some good information from the comments in this thread. - When using warthog as your main merge pet on soulbeast in order to have more access to CC, consider using iboga as a secondary pet. When swapped to, it has a small/moderate CC and does good damage, both on its own and merged, similar to the lynx. Especially to be considered for Matthias. - Jacaranda is an excellent option for back warg duty during Escort Glenna, with its 17/20 sec immobilize. - Take note of all possible CC options in your arsenal, as with certain pet combinations you can do a lot more CC than just the ones mentioned above, usually at a (perhaps considerable) dps loss. For example, melding with a 'versatile' pet to gain access to Prelude Lash (150 damage pull + ~200 damage immobilize) or more CCs. I noted the main ones I was considering for raid usage in my post, but there is definitely more CC out there. Check out the [wiki page](URL too."

Im running the condi renegade URL build for PvE and have had no troubles thus far. I literally camp renegade the entire fight and easily pull 17k dps during fractal 40 farms and top dps during raids most of the time. This varies with boons and skill but generally the class is highly rewarding for not too much effort on your end. I know a lot of players seek this type of gameplay so it might be worth checking out. The class brings a pulsing daze (high cc) in the form of an AOE which makes trash mobs and defiance bars a joke and also has a built in CC with axe 5 as well. Can apply vulnerability (and cripple) if youre lacking that. I can squeeze more dps by weapon swapping with a geomancy sigil but to trivialize the gameplay and make things more consistent daily Ive stuck to camping renegade. The shortbow although lacking in dps gives you the ability to DPS when youre not able to melee. Often nets a 4k dps loss doing this but gives you access to two long range hard cc abilities. One thing to keep track of is summon circle positioning. Where you place them relative to your team is important for your own dps. I found this easier to play than fb as well and since it relies less than burning you can get better times om the fractal 40 farm. You also provide permanent fire fields and minor might generation. Overall a very fun class to play. In terms of fun though subjectiv, ive enjoyed fhis over holosmith and firebrand in pve. What have you guys thougjt about your pof class thus far?"

I don't mean for this to be offensive to any Warriors out there, I just mean to say that I think Specializations should be revisited in general, and these are my suggestions for Warrior. Hello everyone! I've been playing Guild Wars 2 since launch, and pretty much only played Warrior. I've used just about every Warrior build under the sun, and I enjoy most of them. I suppose I was born to be one. Anyway, I say all that to say that I think that what I'm suggesting could easily be applied to all the other professions based on what they're good at, but I simply don't know enough about them to make suggestions on them. So, I love the Trait system in Guild Wars 2. I love the idea of choosing a few things to specialize in and being really good at those few things. However, at least with Warriors, the Specializations don't really feel to me like Specializations, because they feel like more of a soup of different passive abilities that, for the most part, have little to do with what I feel the specialization should support. So I've suggested a re-work, with concrete examples of what they might look like. I've tried my best to format all of this correctly. Also I tried to balance all of these well, but some of them might end up looking a bit under-powered or over-powered, so I apologize in advance for that. **Strength:** Focused on Might, Stability, and Physical Abilities * Top Line - Might *Restorative Strength - Using a healing skill grants five stacks of Might (6s)* *Warrior's Momentum - Each critical hit has an 80% chance to grant one stack of Might (5s)* *Might Makes Right - Grain Healing and Endurance when granting yourself Might* * Middle Line - Stability *Brave Stride - Your first strike when entering combat grants one stack of Stability (8s)* *Stand Your Ground - Cast ""Stand Your Ground!"" when stunned* &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; -""Stand Your Ground!"" - Shout.

157,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[WvW] Major Issues That Still Need Addressing,0,76md7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/76md7d/wvw_major_issues_that_still_need_addressing/,2017-10-16 09:57:09,"First of, I'm glad that Anet buffed WvW rewards a few months back. And with the release of PoF, there are a still major WvW issues that need to be addressed. 1. Population Balance - Population balance especially by timezone remains a major issue. Relinking of servers every 2 weeks also does not help. In the past, NA server players in timezones of EU, OCX, SEA all tried to stack (for the most part) in the tier 1 servers so that they could consistently be matched with one another to get fights. With the linking of servers and re-links every 2 months, this has caused continuous chaos in matchups which results in these guilds having to constantly transfer and re-transfer just to get fights or risk taking breaks for weeks at a time (which often kills guilds). Solution: It's time to get rid of server links and introduce a stable solution. Either merge servers for good and create incentives to destack certain servers (eg -BG). With the introduction of WvW rewards tied to pips, there have been no incentive to trim the fat off servers that are stacked. The other option is to try the implementation of battlegroups that was originally proposed with HoT. I'm not sure what the final solution is but something needs to be done. Outside of NA prime, alot of other timezone guilds are dying or have already died. 2. Skill Balance - Yes we know Anet will only do skill splits as the very last option but the whole meta is dominated by conditions. For condi damage, the only 2 stats that matter are condition damage and expertise. For power damage, it requires having 3 stats with power, precision, and ferocity. As everything in WvW meta is based around on being able to dish out damage while being tanky enough, the risk reward obviously tilts towards condition builds since they only need to add vitality and toughness stats which are readily available with trailblazers/dire. Solution: The simplest solution would be to have weakness affect condition damage. I don't know why it doesn't since vulnerability affects condition damage. The other option which I think is better but more work for Anet devs is to reintroduce condition caps just for WvW. This way there is no need to do major skill balance changes that would impact PvE. This would force some power specs to being played instead of everyone stacking condi builds. These are just my thoughts and I'm open to everyone's opinions on the max condi stacks per player: Condition | Max Stacks ---|--- Burning | 4-5 Bleeding | 20-25 Confusion | 8-12 Torment | 10-12 Poison | 10-12 "
158,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Ideas for holosmith rebalancing (numbers may vary),0,76o3kl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/76o3kl/ideas_for_holosmith_rebalancing_numbers_may_vary/,2017-10-16 15:15:11,"Since most people have explained to really like the concept holosmith, but dislike that it has a very low amount of synergy with engeneer and feels like its own thing, and also the gameplay feels unrewarding and undertuned due to locking you out of kits, i thought i could give some food for thought or discussion with some easy to implement changes which go beyond pure numbers. So without further ado: *Sword: It is pretty fine in my opinion (edit: besides aftercasts which have been pointed out, but those are not things to change easily), but if i were to change anything, i would bumb the cooldown reduction from the autoattack chain from 3 seconds up to 5 seconds, so you can use sword 2 again after a chain and gain access to quickness after 1 chain and forge reliably. *Photon Forge: it is mostly fine, but in order to make it work with engeneer flavor-wise, i would add finishers to the forge skills which work thematically with them, similarly to how hololeap is, well, a leap finisher already. Corona burst could be a single whirl, Photon Blitz could have a 20% chance of projectile finisher per bullet, and Holographic shockwave just screams blast finisher. Utilities: these are fine, but in order for it to have more synergies with different playstyles, i would grant them synergy with having above 100% heat, to make the enhanced Capacity storage unit trait worthwhile. Its a strange one in that it wants you to be above 100% heat, but punishes you for it by effectively locking you out of forge for too long, so i added several over 100% heat synergies with exceeds that play into that playstyle. *Cold Vapor: New 100% threshold: ""7 seconds of frost aura and cold vapor, you cannot generate heat while cold vapor is active."" The idea behind it is flavorwise, you can use your coolant supply to block overheating and take advantage of the mightgeneration on high heat by gaining access to your forge without overheating. If you think that 7 seconds would make it too strong as of a hps, keep it mind healing turret has close to the same heal on 15 second cooldown if you pick it up, however since it has the damage reduction and would stack with regen, you can lower the amount the mist heals to compensate. For Cauterize, i would give the 100% threshold remove all conditions, and give 1 second of self burning instead of 1 stack to compensate (well the self burn should be duration instead of stacks on the base one as well, but yknow). *Spectrum Shield: New 100% heat threshold ""lose 50% of your heat, and gain 1 stack of 2 seconds of stability for every 10 heat lost"" the idea behind it is, again, allowing you to manage your heat easier, while fixing a bit of the problem of being cced to death as a close range fighter, by giving you stability to compensate. The drawback is losing most of your heat, so unless you manage correctly, you will be stuck with 0 heat if you have to stay on the defensive or mismanage. As far as Flash spark goes, i would give it a 120 radius increase since it would thematically fit (you could argue for a cooldown reduction as well since it would be what the skill needs, but that should not be locked behind a grandmaster trait imo). *Hard light Arena: this is one is a tough one due to how broken it can be with lower cooldown, so instead i would give it 50% extra duration of the boons from the field for yourself only, as long as you are above 100% heat. (So for example instead of 2 seconds of protection per tick, you would gain 3, but once you drop below 100% heat, it would be 2 seconds again). And you could make it drain 5% extra heat per second while outside of forge to compensate. As far as prismatic singularity goes, i think a further radius increase would be more then enough, so another 120 radius pull range above 100% heat. *Laser Disk: In order for it to work with a sword build, i would give the disk a 100% heat threshold to also give a stack of 1 second of vulnerability per hit, with it draining 2% heat per second outside of forge to compensate. As far a blade burst is concerned, it would fit to have it as a long range weakness application so i would have the 100% threshold increase the range by 300 and make it apply 6 seconds of weakness on what it hits. *For Photon Wall i would give the 100% threshold grant 2 seconds of protection whenever a projectile is reflected by the barrier. To compensate, every time a projectile is reflected, you lose 5% of your heat (this one can be in forge as well, due to the opponent being able to prevent the heatloss by playing around it). Particle accelerator would have a 100% threshold to give 2 seconds of superspeed instead of 3 seconds of swiftness. *Prime light beam: I would give it a 100% threshold of 5 stacks of vulnerability per field pulse, in order to synergize it with power damage builds. So what do you think? Do you like or dislike them, do you think you should rather just adjust damage numbers and call it a day, or do you think my ideas are too strong, too weak, or don't fix whats inherently lacking? Just let me know, thank you for your time."

Something that can hopefully take advantage of existing on-swap stuff like the trait Fast Hands &amp; Runes of the Warrior, as well as thief traits like Quick Pockets. In addition to something like a weapon set with a 2nd auto attack chain. Let me know your thoughts &amp; Enjoy the Preview Weekend Everybody!!

160,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Soulbeast oppressive superiority testing,33,6ujle9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6ujle9/soulbeast_oppressive_superiority_testing/,2017-08-19 04:01:28,"So since the trait oppressive superiority was revealed there has been debate over whether it was percent health based or flat health based for its damage buff. I did some testing on a heavy target golem to find this out. To get the golem below my percent hp, I used dagger 1 once then waited for the vulnerability to expire. Then I used torch 4 once and recorded the numbers with three tests of using oppressive superiority and not using oppressive superiority. Here they are Total hp golem: 22,084 Health after dagger 1 without O.S.: 21784, 21722, 21788 Health after torch 4: 16906, 16934, 16923 Health after dagger 1 with O.S.: 21633, 21622, 21615 Health after torch 4: 16174, 16392, 16365 My health was 15922 so at no point would its flat health be lower than mine. Thus it appears that oppressive superiority's damage increase is based upon percent hp rather than flat hp. Furthermore, it appears that it counts equal hp at 100% also as being valid for the dps increase for the dagger 1. This has me very excited for the potential of soulbeast in a pve spec and for the potential of condition ranger to finally have a trait increasing condition duration in pve."
161,vulnerability,Guildwars2,SoulBeast Demo Feedback &amp; Suggestions,43,6une1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6une1l/soulbeast_demo_feedback_suggestions/,2017-08-19 15:39:22,"Ahai fellow Ranger enthusiasts! With the demo live and the SoulBeast available to test, I wanted to provide my thoughts/praises/criticisms of the specialization and open this thread for others to do the same. There is a lot to discuss and tweek in the short time we have before PoF's launch, so let's try to be as productive as possible. As there is already a [strength and discovery](URL thread, I instead want to direct this thread to improving SoulBeast by addressing bugs, mechanics, synergy, and numerical coefficients to better bring the kit together and make it shine. Still, apologies for the upcoming word-wall. As a Ranger main since early launch back in 2012, I am committed to helping SoulBeast optimize the stoic, savage, dps-oriented theme it seems to want to be. Constructive criticisms are welcome; let's do all we can to help the devs help us. I will begin by giving my own opinions. To clarify, I am a PvX'er so I will be speaking generically, but I am a casual when it comes to PvP (t3 gold) and WvW (rank 280) so I will leave those areas for others. All-in-all, I admit I am...dissatisfied with SoulBeast as it is now. Ranger has really needed a better damage-spec for a long time (particularly power) and I was hoping SoulBeast would address this. It did, in a sense; It feels so close to being something fun and great, but noticeably fell short of that mark in a few areas -- sort of like a skeleton that needs meat. Thus, nearly everything I am about to suggest will be a buff of some kind. But even still, I believe they are warranted (especially in-lieu of what the other elite specs can do with their damage/utility, and in consideration with the low starting-point of base-Ranger dps). **1: Traits** First, the minors- [Elevated Bond](URL [Furious Strength](URL [Twice as Vicious](URL Generally it's good design to have the minors synergize with themselves. Such synergy can be seen in most other traitlines (such as Wilderness Survival's increased endurance regen, protection on dodge, and protection granting healing). Synergy portrays a clear purpose and flavor. In the case of elite specializations, the main two minor traits we want to synergize are the master and grandmaster slots, since the adept slot is used to alter the profession mechanic. I like where these two traits are trying to go, but they lack synergy and their executions leave room for improvement. Condition damage receives almost no damage increase in-practice, and there is little-to-no synergy between the two. I would change them to: * Furious Strength: You deal more damage [5%] and condition damage [5%] while you have fury. * Twice as Vicious: Disabling a foe increases your damage [7%] for a short duration and grants [x seconds of] fury. Reasoning: there are a few advantages gained from this alteration. First, giving the condition damage increase dependable to fury (which can be sustained more than disables) makes the condition damage increase for SoulBeast condition builds much more prominent. This also gives conditions builds more of a reason to sustain fury, creating incentive for skirmishing builds to swap weapons more, traited Survival skills to be used more frequently, etc...Giving the larger power damage boost and fury gain to Twice as Vicious improves SoulBeast's ""quick savage burst"" it seems to desire through various quickness sources, synergies the trait with Furious Strength, and works well in design with Ranger's kits (Hilt-Bash -&gt; Maul, Point Blank Shot -&gt; Rapid Fire, Path of Scares -&gt; Worldly Impact, etc...). Now for the major traits. Ultimately, it seems the top line is going for self-defense/sustain, the middle for boon/group-support, and the bottom for damage. I will assume this is the intent when I express my thoughts. *Adept* [Fresh Reinforcement](URL [Live Fast](URL [Unstoppable Union](URL Of these three traits, I believe Unstoppable Union is in the best place. It fulfills its purpose to deliver more damage (in a utility sense) and remains in the power threshold expected of an adept trait. Ultimately, I believe these traits should incentivise the player to exit and enter beastmode as often as possible. Having said that, Fresh Reinforcement feels somewhat redundant with Live Fast. Furthermore, Live Fast does not adhere to group-support that the middle line should strive for. I would combine and modify the effects of Fresh Reinforcement with Live Fast in the middle line to: * Live Fast: Entering beastmode grants you the boons affecting your pet and using a Beast ability grants nearby allies offensive boons [fury &amp; quickness, probably in a 360 radius]. Reasoning: This trait would allow SoulBeasts to function more effectively in a group-setting, making use / minimizing waste of the extra boons passing over to the pet and giving small support to nearby allies. It also still remains in the power threshold expected of an adept trait. However, now this leaves Fresh Reinforcement without an effect. Seeing as the top line has to do with self-defense/sustain, and adept traits should incentivise entering/exiting beastmode, I would make this trait's effect simply: * Fresh Reinforcement: Entering beastmode heals you for x (Perhaps the healing on this trait could be calculated after the pet is absorbed, that way supportive pets would heal for more, giving more incentive to use them). Reasoning: This adept trait is simple, thematic, fulfills its purpose, and depending on the healing coefficient -- effective. These changes would give the adept traits purity of purpose and, again, incentivise exiting/entering beastform as often as possible. *Master* [Second Skin](URL [Essence of Speed](URL [Predator's Cunning](URL Ultimately, I believe these traits follow or should follow a theme of ""passive bonuses"" supporting their respective roles of defense, support, and damage. There are just a few buffs I would make. However, in the grand scheme of things these buffs could prove to be too much. So I will leave it to the devs and commentors to agree or disagree with my ideas. For these traits I would change: * Second Skin: Conditions inflict [33%] less damage to you while you have protection, and you gain [x seconds of] protection on disabling a foe. Reasoning: Second Skin is very nice, but it is entirely reliant on other abilities. Giving it its own small source of protection on disable would incentivise SoulBeasts to reduce their incoming pressure by going on the offensive (makes sense thematically) and kinda-sorta synergize-with/work-alongside Twice as Vicious. * Essence of Speed: (Maaaaaaybe decrease the internal cooldown of this trait from 5 seconds to 4 seconds). Essence of Speed does a good job supporting the boon/group-support and passive effect it's inline for by taking pressure off other boon providers in your group, so the only thing that could be debatably changed is its internal cooldown to make it more worthy of a master slot. * Predator's Cunning: When you apply poison or vulnerability to a foe, steal some health from them. Reasoning: Predator's Cunning really only benefits condition builds. Perhaps the life-steal coefficients could be lowered to compromise, but giving Predator's Cunning the ability to proc off vulnerability application would not only better benefit power builds and remain thematic, but it would also synergize very well with the majority of Ranger's kit (Opening strike, Maul, Rapid-Fire, traited Concussion Shot, Hunter's Call, Storm Spirit passive, and dagger auto). *Grandmaster* [Eternal Bond](URL [Leader of the Pack](URL [Oppressive Superiority](URL Ultimately, grandmaster traits are supposed to have weight and really help define a build. With this in mind, and with the lack of common trait thematics like cooldown reduction, *and* keeping in mind the rest of SoulBeast's kit, I would make the following improvements: * Eternal Bond: (Increase the protection duration upon taking lethal damage in beastmode from 3 seconds to 6). Reasoning: While some people advocate for the healing to be larger, I disagree with this. Considering that beastmode can be remained in, it would be too powerful to increase the healing done by this trait too far beyond what it is now without additional investment. Instead, to help make it worthy of a grandmaster trait and to let it synergize with the rest of Ranger's/SoulBeast's kit, I would simply increase the duration of its protection ""health cushion,"" giving a little more time for the player to recover whlie still allowing for counter-play. * Leader of the Pack: Stance skills grant their effects to nearby allies for a [50%] reduced duration. Stance skills apply [x seconds of] quickness to allies. [20%] Reduced recharge on Stance Skills. Reasoning: This trait is supposed to be SoulBeast's ""in"" to supporting groups as a damage dealer. Also, I do not believe the stances are so powerful -- even when shareable- to neglect a cooldown-reduction option. Giving quickness to to this ties the ribbon on the package, so to speak, synergizing with the previous group-support traits and remains thematic. * Oppressive Superiority: You and your pet deal [20%] increased damage to foes who have less health than you. Conditions you and your pet apply to foes with less health than you last [20%] longer. Dagger skills gain [1] additional charges. Reasoning: Even with a 100% buff, this trait will _still_ not be OP, but instead be truly worth its elite-spec grandmaster slot and help bring SoulBeast a good step closer to the damage-roll it should adequately fulfill. I don't trust myself to do the math, so if someone else wanted to calculate what this + other traits would put SoulBeast dps at I would be grateful. Still, I wouldn't think this would put SoulBeast over Dragonhunter or Weaver in terms of dps. Also, the conditional of needing to keep your health above your opponent really helps justify the numbers. Finally, the addition charge granted to dagger 3 is mainly there to improve power builds for reasons that will become clear shortly, in addition to supporting the theme. I did not suggest a cooldown bonus for this trait because [Ambidexterity](URL in the Wilderness Survival line already grants one. **2: Weapon - Dagger** Dagger was personally my greatest disappointment, probably because I can tell that just under its surface is an amazing fun weapon. Ultimately, I want dagger to be more aggressive than greatsword but less defensive. Dagger should be one of the go-to weapons for both power and condition damage builds *and* synergize with more SoulBeast and Ranger traits. In my opinion, it is doing pretty well on the condi-front already, so I won't be making suggestions for that. Instead, I will be offering suggestions to up its power game. In much the same way that greatsword _is supposed_ to make Reaper feel like a slow-hitting monster, I want dagger to make SoulBeast feel like a fast-hitting beast. Auto: [Groundwork Gouge](URL [Leading Swipe](URL [Serpent Stab](URL [Deadly Delivery](URL The auto attack for dagger aims to be a fun and thematic set, but falls short on two fronts. In-testing, the chain felt clunky through its slowness relative to what one would imagine a feral ""beastly fight-style with tooth and claw"" to feel like, as well as its power output. To accomplish this, I would do two things: * Reduce the cast-time on Leading Swipe and Serpent Stab from 1/2 to 1/4. * Slightly increase the power coefficients (particularly power scaling) of all 4 skills. Reasoning: When I was testing the dagger, it really only felt usable and in-theme when I had quickness. When I did, it felt like it was hitting as quickly then as it should normally. If dagger hit as quickly normally as it does with quickness now, and thus even faster with quickness after the change, it would feel like a truly ferocious weapon. Sure, retaliation and confusion would hurt (*a lot*), but that's all part of the counter and thematic play. With this change, power scaling coefficients wouldn't need to be super high. 2nd Skill: [Double Arc](URL The second skill essentially feels like a different, shorter auto-attack. In fact, it's difficult to see when this skill is used in the middle of an auto-attack chain -- it all looks and functions the same. To synergize with other ranger traitlines, and with Soulbeasts theme, skill 2 needs to do 2 important things: * It needs to be a single, heavy striking attack like maul (To work well with Moment of Clarity and Remorseless) instead of a 2-hit. * It needs to have a quick, long reach (like the 300 range movement with Hilt-Bash on Greatsword) to feel good and hit reliably. Im thinking it be something similar to Thiefs Heartseeker, but a lunge/dash instead of a leap/flip. Reasoning: with these changes, the skill would become distinguishable from the auto chain and gain synergy with the Ranger's power kit. 3rd Skill: [Instinctive Engage](URL Finally, the third skill is really well-done and in nearly a perfect place, it just needs a couple additions to really bring the weapon together. skill 3 also needs to do ~~2~~ 1 important thing: * It needs to disable the target briefly. Nothing too much, but a 1/2 or so second daze would synergize with Moment of Clarity, Predators Onslaught, and Twice as Vicious. * ~~It needs to grant fury in addition to its quickness.~~ [Edit:] I just realized my suggested change to Twice as Vicious would allow this skill to grant Fury if it acquired the daze. Fury would help set up the burst this skill aims to accomplish and synergize with Remorseless, Vicious Quarry, and Furious Strength. Reasoning: This skill is the weapons power-variant key to burst setup. Adding just these two features would go a long way with linking the weapon to the rest of power Ranger. If these changes were implemented and the numerical values balanced, I believe dagger would better fulfill its role as a quick, savage weapon. **3 / 4: Utility - Stances / Mechanic - Beast Skills** In my opinion, the stances and beast skills the most solid things about SoulBeast. With my suggestion to Leader of the Pack, stances would already be gaining enough to feel great. And most beast skills already work good. Therefore, I won't be addressing them. however, feel free to voice your own opinions. **5: Bugs** I've seen quite a few threads and posts detailing bugs present with Soulbeast and trying to document them. I wish to do the same; In the coming days I will do what I can to list all I find here. * [Dolyak Stance](URL Skill does not grant its boons Retaliation or Stability. Cheers and happy testing! I look forward to any good criticisms and feedback we can give to the devs. And fun fact -- this is my first Reddit thread (be gentle, haha)."
162,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Scourge Unintended Condi DPS Buff,5,6urj4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6urj4o/scourge_unintended_condi_dps_buff/,2017-08-20 06:55:34,"When placing a Sand Shade at the enemy's location the enemy will receive 1 stack of torment. If you place a sand shade away from the enemy location but the enemy is next to you, then the enemy will still receive 1 stack of torment. This function is similar to damaging, Mesmer shatter abilities. Most shade abilities are capped at 1 stack or application of w/e it does (condition conversion, barrier application, fear, etc.), but this torment is not capped. This leads to an interesting (and contradicting) play style to maximize condition damage. By contradicting, I mean to refer back to the developer's goal to not encourage stacking Sand Shades on one spot. **Scenario:** An enemy is hitting you in melee range while simultaneously standing under two of your Sand Shades. You place a third Sand Shade on top of them. Now the enemy receives 4 stacks of torment on that third manifestation rather than just 1 stack of capped torment. You would even want to continue replacing Sand Shades while all three shades are already up to proc that 4 stacks of torment. This is reinforced by the F1 ability, to manifest a shade, not consuming any life force (even though the skill description says it should). In addition to this, the Desert Shroud pulsing torment application also stacks per Sand Shade. This synergy results in tons of burning and torment application on a stationary foe. **Exceptions/Inconsistencies:** This stacking effect is not adjusted for the Sand Savant trait that makes a greater Sand Shade rather than three lesser Sand Shades. The greater Sand Shade is treated as a singular source of torment application even though its description says it counts as three lesser Sand Shades. So if you stood next to a foe and placed the greater Sand Shade on top of them, then the foe would only receive 2 stacks of torment rather than 4. This stacking effect is also not shared by the burning application of the Dhuumfire trait. This burning is capped at 1 stack no matter how many shades are stacked on the enemy. **Discussion:** The Sand Savant DPS debuff could be intentional balance because the greater shroud has more superior support capabilities by affecting up to 10 allies with each ability. The massive amounts of torment applied on a stationary foe can also be balanced DPS because torment damages mostly with foes that are moving around. What are your thoughts? Is this inconsistent and not documented clearly enough through skill/trait descriptions or does this feel intentional and balanced? Either way it means support Scourges will spread shades while condition damage Scourges will stack them. I'd prefer if all Scourges were encouraged to spread shades and they could just cap the torment to 1 stack per pulse/skill but add a few more seconds on to each stack to make up for the DPS loss. *Edit:* Even though the Dhuumfire trait's burning is capped, the vulnerability from the Unyielding Blast trait stacks per shade (maintaining maxed out vulnerability very easily). Both of these abilities are intended to only affect the F1 skill, but they affect all F abilities and each pulse of F5. This is not consistent with Reaper's Might which is also intended to alter the F1 ability. Reaper's Might only grants Might on F1 and not on any of the other F abilities. While on the topic of inconsistent implementations of traits affecting the shroud, how will these traits work effectively with the Scourge? * Unholy Sanctuary - when taking fatal damage * Transfusion - how? * Signets of Suffering - lost benefit of retaining signet passives while in shroud"
163,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Power Shatter Mirage is the Best Version of Shatter to Date,128,6urq2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6urq2z/power_shatter_mirage_is_the_best_version_of/,2017-08-20 07:30:56,"Hey all, &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I've been playing Power Shatter Mirage strictly in PVP since the beta weekend began, and I have to say that it is superior to any version of Power Shatter that we've had to date. Let me preface this by saying this build is really for people that like a twitch style of gameplay. If you want something chill, this is not for you. But if you remember the old 100-0 Power Shatter spec and want to play it again, but the best version of it that it's ever been, then you might like this. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Traditionally, Power Shatter is a get in/get out kind of fighter with huge spike potential and decent evasiveness and mobility. Power Shatter always wanted to be the best plus one in the game but never quite made it because of D/P S/B Thief, until now. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Traits:** &amp;nbsp; I like the idea of buffing every aspect of the traditional Vanilla Power Shatter that was made famous by OsiCat! and people like him. Power Shatter, to me, was huge burst from stealth and escape/sustain potential with evades and blurs. So, I just wanted to make those tenants of Power Shatter better. I started by making my dodge do more. By giving better defensive sustain, escape ability, and burst potential, we basically turn our dodge into a Daredevil evade on steroids. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Mirage Cloak, the new dodge mechanic replaces your dodge roll with a useful evade-in-place dodge frame. You can use Mirage Cloak to stand in place and dodge, meaning you can continue attacking, or you can move in the direction you normally would have dodged in, but will have no downtime on attack frames because Mirage Cloak allows you to attack while in it, even while moving--making a point blank Mirror-Blade, Mind-Rack combo in combat super simple to pull off by simply dodging into your enemies during cast. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Other, notable traits that I took were to buff Mind Rack/Mirror Blade in some way. I figured I would stick with the themes of old Power Shatter builds and focus solely on damage and escape. So I chose the Dueling and Domination lines to pick up some crit damage against stunned foes (exactly how you want them to be before a Mind Rack) and some extra damage on Shatter, again, against stunned foes (inactive). After that, it's just the usual Domination line stuff: daze to stun and boon strip to better set up stunning into Mind Rack combo. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This became my central focus once I figured this out. I wanted to buff the Mirage Cloak mechanic to be very powerful so I could use it to mitigate damage while allowing me to pursue enemies faster and allowing me to get off ""quick casts"" with it. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I decided on the traits Renewing Oasis, Mirage Mantel, Elusive Mind, and Evasive Mirror as my major traits in the Mirage and Dueling lines. Making my dodge remove a condition, reduce condition duration, break stun, give super speed, projectile mirror after successful evasion (fuck you Deadeye), give regen, and protection! And, of course, endurance regen through 100% Vigor uptime. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Amulet:** &amp;nbsp; Assassin. We actually want to Crit and Crit hard, very often. So this is the amulet of choice. We will have constant uptime on Fury while our opponent is below 75% health, so, combined with the Assassin amulet we will have 81% chance to crit most of the time. This means we'll get more mileage out of Superiority Complex in Dueling. &amp;nbsp; The downside is, of course, that you have 15K+ health. You very well could run Marauder amulet with this instead, it just won't be as effective. But you'll probably die less with it. Eh. Tradeoffs. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Runes:** &amp;nbsp; Scholar. I think most everyone can see where this is going. The whole concept of the old Power Shatter build was to plus one. You're not really supposed to be fighting one v one unless you're pushing far. And even then it's better to wait until you can tag team with a team mate. However, the burst potential on this build is god damn down right incredible. Sure people have methods of blocking your burst. But if timed correctly and the opponent is stunned, you will 100-0 anyone that doesn't have an auto cast defensive trait, stab, or protection up. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Sigils:** &amp;nbsp; This one is actually in a great spot. Used to be that you would take Air/Fire on Great sword and call it a day. Now we have interesting options. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; First, I broke down my weapon sets by function. I wanted Sword/Torch to mean more mobility for me and less mobility for my opponent. I went with Energy (more dodges/more Mirage Thrust) and Stagnation (cripple opponent when switching to this weapon in combat) on that set. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Great sword is for burst so I wanted to compound on that. I chose Savagery and Exposure for it. Savagery gives us more stun duration and more damage against stunned foes, which is nice, while Exposure actually gives us 7.5% increased damage (due to Fragility in Domination) for 5 seconds after switching to Great sword right before your burst. Making it a great set up right before a spike. These two alone give us 10.5% increased damage on weapon swap. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Side Note:** &amp;nbsp; In a dream scenario you will interrupt your opponent right before your Mirror Blade, Mind Rack combo for an additional 12% increased damage due to Fragility. Making the on switch burst buff to be 22.5% increased damage plus 25% increased crit damage from Superiority Complex plus 30% increased Mind Rack damage from Mental Anguish. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Skills:** &amp;nbsp; I chose Mirror for my heal; Mirage Advance, Mantra of Distraction, Portal, and Jaunt for my skills. I think they actually work very well with the theme of Power Shatter. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sadly, the new heal just doesn't offer enough to have to back track to it's original position to gain Mirage Cloak again. Maybe some enjoy it, and I wouldn't chide them for liking it so, but for me, it just didn't feel right. I ended up choosing Mirror because of Deadeyes. And it's been great. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Mirage Advance needs some tweaking, but I'm really enjoying it so far. It sort of takes the place of Blink in this setup for better or worse. Basically it's a shorter cooldown than Blink, and has the same function when it comes to burst (get near your opponent). The downside is that it's not instant cast so you can't Mirror Blade combo it. But the retreat option on it with the bonus of giving you endurance is the reason why I'm playing around with it. So far I've enjoyed it. You can also try Illusionary Ambush for an instant cast skill that auto targets and teleports clones instead of Blink. Or hell, just choose Blink. Your choice here. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Mantra of Distraction's recent buff to lower the cool down of Diversion, combined with MODs also lower cool down, make this a top tier in my book. Also, ammo system is fantastic! &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Portal. This build is meant to be a roamer and quick map traverser. That's what portal is for. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Jaunt. I love it. I wish it was 600 distance instead of 400, but I love it. Need a quick stomp away from danger? Stomp, Jaunt away, wait, Jaunt back. It's instant cast so you can charge MOD while using it, or you can Mirror Blade combo with it. It also removes conditions, and you can dump all 3 rounds to get away from something fairly quickly. Also, since it's instant cast, you can be stunned and use it. Combine this with Mirage Thrust and Portal and you have the best mobility in the game. Haters don't know what's up. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Ambush Skills:** &amp;nbsp; I will say that I completely agree with the community that some of the Ambush skills, on the whole, seem as though they were not well thought out nor are they very interesting in most regards; however, I will sing the praise of Mirage Thrust; it is insanely powerful, as it is a mobility skill and debuffing tool on a very low ""cool down"" allowing 1200 travel using two Mirage Cloak dodges, and it's ability to quickly stack up vulnerability on your opponent. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Final Thoughts:** &amp;nbsp; I'm in love with Mesmer Power Shatter again. Chrono just didn't fix my itch like this. Power Shatter belongs to Mirage. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **TL/DR:** &amp;nbsp; Power Shatter is back baby. &amp;nbsp; Domination: 1-1-2 &amp;nbsp; Dueling: 1-2-1 &amp;nbsp; Mirage: 2-2-2 &amp;nbsp; Amulet: Assassin &amp;nbsp; Weapons: SW/T GS &amp;nbsp; Sigils: Stagnation/Energy (SW) Savagery /Exposure (GS) &amp;nbsp; Runes: Scholar &amp;nbsp; Playstyle: Abuse interrupts and dodges. Then Mind Wrack. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Edit:** I have no video footage of this because I cannot play the game and record at the same time on my laptop. Play for yourselves."
164,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"[Weaver] First impressions, skill tweaks, potential changes - Constructive Discussion (long post)",55,6uw8w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6uw8w9/weaver_first_impressions_skill_tweaks_potential/,2017-08-21 01:15:48,"First of all I'd like to say that elite has great theme, absolutely gorgeous animations and sound effects, it seems great on paper, but not so much in actual gameplay. I'm aware that this is demo/testing weekend and lots of things are probably going to change, but I want to point out on changes that I feel would improve the gameplay of the elite spec. I'll go through all of the new stuff that *I think that need to be changed* and try to be as objective as I can. First of all, **sword**. It has very short range which doesn't fit perfectly with squishiness of the class, it has rather slow skills which make sense since ele channels magic through weapons, but those channels usually end up being high risk-high reward skills which doesn't seem like it on sword. * Skill 1: first two parts of chain have extremely low range and bigger cast time than any other sword auto attack without any substantial advantage (or any 'magic channeling', it's a regular autoattack with elemental particles), I think that cast time shouldnt be higher than 0.5 sec. 3rd attack should IMO have a bit bigger range and slightly increased cast time (1 sec from 0.75), they should feel strong and slow. * Skill 2: **water** and **earth** are pretty good, but I feel like **earth** deals a bit too much damage for what it gives. **Fire** seems like a complete mess - range is short, animation is very slow. It's only strong if you use it on top of your target and it doesnt move from your field, doesnt feel like a gap closer at all. I would give it higher range (600) with slightly increased leap speed. **Air** one is another messy skill, it's obviously meant to be gap closer, but its range is too short for that and it's a shadowstep with cast time, which makes no sense. I would do same as on fire: bigger range (600 from 450) and no cast time, just like every other shadowstep, it has a big cooldown for what it does so it would make no sense if it was bigger. * Skill 3 (fully attuned): these ones are actually pretty balanced between strength, cast time and cooldown. I would maybe reduce damage on water attack so it can have same cooldown as other elements. However they are gated behind 2 attunement cooldowns so maybe they could be a bit stronger in some ways. * Dual skills - pretty decent, but I think they could use slight tweaks, mostly in range since they have 50 less range than fully attuned skills 3, it just feels unnecessary. I noticed some thematic problem with **water/earth** combo, but I'll mention that in scepter section. **Dagger** also has decent dual skills. **Fire/earth** skill seems a bit odd and rather useless, adding 1 second of burn wouldn't hurt at all. Overall they are strong skills with high cooldown which make sense. **Water/air** might be a bit too strong though, I would reduce daze from 1.5 to 1 sec. **Staff** - I feel like **fire/air** skill should have longer channel but higher travel speed, it's plasma after all. **Fire/earth** could use an extra second or two of duration because it feels like a weaker version of lava font on a much higher cooldown, with cast time increased from 0.75 to 1 second, just a thought. **Water/air** seems like it's missing something for its high cooldown, I would add small base healing and 1 vulnerability stack per hit. **Water/air** should IMO pulse vulnerability instead of damage, or both, but with very very low damage ticks. **Trident** skills seem rather good, but I didn't test them at all, and it's kind of irrelevant since UW combat is not that game breaking. **Scepter** - I was a bit disappointed with some dual skills. **Fire/air** definitely needs more damage (10-20%) in form of adding another 0.5 second tick and make all ticks slightly stronger, or add some kind of burning explosion at the end of channel with minimal aoe radius, or the simplest - vulnerability+1 sec burning per tick . It has big cooldown with no utility (comparing to phoenix), it's damage is good, but if it's doing just damage, it should be higher IMO. **Fire/water** has 1200 range for no reason, 900 is perfectly fine. **Fire/earth** is just bad - it roots you in place (no other scepter skill does), it has mediocre damage for that long channel, and it gives vulnerability which has nothing to do with both fire and earth. On top of that it's a single target ability (not quite sure on this one though). I think it should have just higher damage, not require you to stand in place to cast it, removed vulnerability, but have cooldown moved from 12 to 15. **Water/air** skill is way too slow for what it does. The projectile is probably the slowest in game. I would remove damage from it completely, slightly increase traveling speed, and add some vulnerability and daze, cooldown from 15 to 18. **Water/earth** - feels a bit off on scepter since it's an aoe field. I think that sword and scepter should swap these skills because scepter is a lot better at throwing rocks at someone while sword could use another pulsing aoe. **Aquatic stance** seems rather ineffective since weaver doesn't have that many reliable gapclosers. Other utilities seem pretty good except for **Unravel**. I said it before and I'll say it again, this skill should have not been introduced as utility. I was thinking about what would happen if this was an F5, and it just looks like another skill to press for no reason. I think that attunement changing wasn't implemented all that great. People say that there should be a trade off for picking an elite spec, but we have that already in form of half attunement, global cooldown is making it a lot worse. Swapping to element gives you just half of its skills, and element goes on half cooldown, which makes perfect sense. But we're getting 4 seconds of *global cooldown* on all attunements instead of only those we are currently using. Just imagine global cooldown on shatters or virtues or something similar. I also think that having no global cooldown would be rather broken, and make Unravel and Weave self almost completely useless, however I do have some ideas. 1. Let's do it the opposite way of elementalist's attunements. When you attune to one element, make all others go on full cooldown (4-5 seconds) while that element goes on 1 second. We mastered that element already, there's no reason why it's going on full cooldown too. 2. Similar as above, but make mainhand attunement go on half cooldown (2 seconds) and offhand attunement on slightly lower (3 seconds). 3. Add weapon swap ability to swap mainhand element with offhand one, 9 sec cooldown. What's currently implemented with skills (full attuning and reduced cooldown) should partially exist by default, and partially through traits. Currently, we're locked in same element for 4 seconds without access to our defensive skills from offhand weapon. Sword has strong defensive options on some elements, but other weapons dont, and as we all know, ele is too squishy class to have limited access to defense. Another thing that I don't understand is **Weave self** buffs from attunements. Water has 2 pretty strong buffs, while all others have just 1. Woven fire seems too strong if it's 20% condi damage done instead of condi damage stat. Woven air and earth are nicely balanced, air looks good and somewhat fixes the gap-closing problems while earth synergyses well with vitality trait. **If** some of the attunement cooldowns are about to change in the future, elite skill would have better value if 2 second recharge was removed from it, but add and balance buffs to woven elements. So something like this: - Woven fire: +10% damage and +10% condi damage dealt - Water: 15/20% boon duration and outgoing healing - Air: +40% speed and +10% crit chance or crit damage - Earth: +200/250 vitality and toughness **If** some of the attunement cooldowns are about to change in the future, Unravel would also lose almost all of its value (but it shouldn't exist at all **IMO**). I think that ele could really use a boon spam skill (only skills with such effect are shouts/auras from overloads, which needed to be traited multiple times). I have one suggestion, stance that pulses boons depending on attunement and slightly heals/cleanses 1 condi per pulse (or something else, or nothing), similar to how Primordial stance works. It would be also a great way to give ele something (boons) that it can't access otherwise (which is one of the reasons we take elite specs, right?): - Fire : retaliation - Water : resistance - Air : quickness - Earth : aegis / stability **Traits** are in general nicely balanced. Ferocity buff from major GM seems a bit too high. 2 superspeed traits should be IMO merged into 1 which means we'll need another trait, possibly stance/attunement based trait. Minor GM that gives buffs depending on attunement could have values reduced slightly (to 100 maybe), but apply double buff if fully attuned. How do you feel about current weaver?"

167,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Trait Revision Request (Especially for PoF),0,6vsr5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6vsr5u/trait_revision_request_especially_for_pof/,2017-08-25 04:20:26,"There are several traits that proc in intervals for balance that should be revised. * Scourge - Demonic Lore: Proc Burning on Torment (3 sec cap) * Curses - Chilling Darkness: Proc Chill on Blind every (3 sec cap) Why can't these traits use a percentage system instead? * Curses - Barbed Precision: Proc Bleed on Crit (33% chance) * Superior Sigil of Torment: Proc Torment on Crit (50% chance) The time interval mechanic definitely works best with some mechanics. * Blood Magic - Unholy Martyr: While in Shroud, Draw Conditions from Allies (3 sec cap) * Spite - Rending Shroud: While in Shroud, Apply Vulnerability to nearby Foes (3 sec cap) But, with other mechanics it discourages bursts and causes the player to want to mentally count intervals to make the most of procs. For example with the current Condition Damage Reaper build using the Chilling Darkness trait, I find myself counting 3 seconds after using a blind to maximize bleeds. The other mechanics capped by time intervals are more passive and it makes more sense for them to have a time interval mechanic. With Demonic Lore, for example, I would like to not be punished for unloading all of my torments in a brief time rather than guesstimating when my 3 seconds are up each time after I torment to maximize my burns."

However while trying the rifle out it felt really similiar to warrior's rifle, with the only real difference being the kneel mechanic. What i mean is: Rifle #1: Both apply vulnerability and have a 3/4s cast time. Rifle #2: Slows target and is a projectile finisher (immobilize if kneeling). Rifle #3: All variants consist of shooting a few bullets in quick succession. Rifle #4: Both brutal shot and death's retreat consist of you moving backwards. Also kill shot and death's judgement are essentially the same skill as well. I'm not saying deadeye's rifle is bad, but i would've loved a bit more flavour and i hope some skills could be modified a bit for release.

Well you could say that i am doing my job correctly.. But I think this is a design flaw in its own. You have so much elements that give you and your group might so it gets completely lost and cut off when your reach your 25 stacks. Shouldn't be the max amount of something not get reached that often? It should be really special to hit the greatest amount of anything or the supply for it is way too high. Same goes for vulnerability. 
170,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Re-aligning the relationship between Power and Condi,0,6y6rtm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6y6rtm/realigning_the_relationship_between_power_and/,2017-09-05 19:00:48,"# A new problem that has actually been here all along: Conditions have never really done anything but damage. Even now, with the breakbar mechanic securely in the game, they bring nothing unique to power specs aside from some mild breakbar degeneration in the form of the movement-imparing conditions (which isn't even substantial at all when compared with the coordinated hard CC chaining required to successfully stun a boss). This means that the relationship between power and condi specs has always been a binary better or worse than situation propagated by arbitrary changes made by GW2 devs. The solution to this is to give conditions an actual, unique purpose outside of the realm of just damage. Another hurdle to power competing with condi in 2017 is the fact that not only can conditions burst now (something that, initially, wasn't necessarily possible given its effectiveness in 2012-2014), but this burst damage is something that can be sustained far easier over the course of its respective cool-down periods with far less risk of DPS loss compared to power builds. Power damage can be negated to 0 very easily while conditions, once applied, apply direct, armor-ignoring damage through dodging, blocking and invulnerability. Moreover, additions such as Torment and the Expertise stat have basically only given Condition Damage extra hits in addition to their already ferocious base damage with the 2015 condition stack update. Given the passive damage nature of a DoT that manages to deal lethal damage, there becomes no real reason to run a power spec. One more issue with conditions has always been their lack of combat legibility. Conditions are so frivolously thrown aroundoften generated by passive, RNG triggers and mere auto-attacksthat the majority of any given stack of conditions might not necessarily correlate to a specific cool-down on a skill-bar at all (especially within a PvP scenario). To fix this, the smorgasbord of single condition stacks could be packed together into denser bundles across all skill and trait options rather than left to trigger one by one without any real sense of rhythm. Despite the higher stack totals, **a new condition stack system detailed below** would prevent conditions from going completely wild with initial burst potential. However, the role of a long-term source of pressure damage would remain. As an example of packing conditions into higher stack bundles, consider the following: &gt;Sharper Images (Mesmer Dueling line) * Now a Major [tier] trait. * Function changed to: Your Phantasms gain Sharper Images when they are summoned. * Sharper Images: Your next attack inflicts bleeding. * Bleeding|5| (6s): [damage] This trait now no longer constantly procs on RNG clone and phantasm crits, but rather is now fixed to a predictable, controlled source. This not only puts control of bleed stacking into the hands of the user, but also provides a possible window of counter-play for player opponents (the effect would have to work like Thief venoms so that a Phantasm miss would consume the Sharper Images buff without effect). The fact that it would be a ""Major"" trait would mean that it gains a substantial opportunity cost when it comes to deciding what to sacrifice when choosing to stack more conditions. Many other traits could be adjusted to fit this paradigm which is more balanced toward attrition and pressure. The same thing could be done to auto-attacks by loading an entire chain's condition production onto the final strike (or just removing an AA's conditions out-right and folding them into other weapon skills). # Condition Re-balance Concept (bringing condi burst in line): * Aside from Vulnerability (which would retain its current functional behavior), applied conditions which stack in intensity are now classified into two types: **Residual** and **Active**. * When a stack of X [condition]s totaling more than 1 are applied to a target, that target receives 1 stack of **Active** [condition] and (X-1) stack(s) of **Residual** [condition]. * The total number of Active condition stacks on a target contribute to the total amount of condition damage that said target will take during every condition tick. Residual condition stacks tally the total count of condition stacks which will eventually turn into Active condition stacks to the target should the Residual stack entirely manage to resolve. * Regardless of the number of initial condition stacks applied at once from a single source to a target, that target will always start with 1 stack of Active condition stacks while the rest will be counted as Residual stacks. A Residual stack of applied of conditions converts into Active stacks at the rate of 1 stack per second. * If a player with Residual stacks of conditions does not take direct damage within 3 seconds, Residual stacks begin rapidly decaying to 0 at a rate of 1 stack every s. * Cleansing a stack of any given condition will respectively clear all current Active and Residual stacks of that condition. # In-Practice Scenario: * Player A, with a single strike, inflicts 5 stacks of bleeding onto Player B. * Player B, therefore, receives 1 stack of **Active** bleeding and 4 stacks of **Residual** bleeding. * In the first second of condition damage ticks, Player B takes damage equivalent to 1 stack of Bleeding from Player A. * After the 1st second, the Residual stack reduces by 1 and applies 1 more stack of Active bleeding. Therefore, in the 2nd second, Player B now has 2 Active stacks of bleeding and 3 Residual stacks of bleeding. Damage for the subsequent tick adjusts accordingly. * This process continues until all Residual stacks have converted into Active stacks or the stacks are cleared via condition cleanse. * Should another stack of many bleeds (or even just a single bleed stack) be applied to Player B, this system will add extra single stacks to Player B's current Active stack total accordingly. Therefore, if 5 players were to simultaneously apply 5 stacks of bleeding respectively to Player B, Player B would receive 20 Residual stacks of bleeding and 5 Active stacks. This same scenario could be applied for non-simultaneous application of any intensity-stacking conditions. * Visual representation (with trash UI implementation): URL # tl;dr Power needs to be the burst option for player damage if it's going to be able to compete with Condition Damage at all. Removing burst from Condition Damage options will make GW2 combat much more legible and dynamic by putting dangerous/finisher damage back in the hands of builds that actually need to connect hits consistently in order to finish a target. Condition Damage will need a unique function aside from damage if it's going to have a role alongside Power without any real burst potential (what that unique function is remains up in the air)."

The logs are below. URL *this is the new version* URL You can see that since the start of the fight on the first log, condi DPS classes were around 2k lower than on the second log. All the buffs were only 1% different on the logs, which is probably a bug alone, but those are where the differences stop. Due to the power DPS basically being the same number between the two logs, we've went ahead and assume its a bug where vulnerability doesn't give the 25% increase with 25 stacks to condition damage. I hope /u/deltaconnected can let me know if there is anything else, or if I'm wrong to begin with. I've also ran into buffs not even being calculated mainly Alacrity and GOTL. TLDR: It seems ARCDPS is broken by vulnerability."

Your right attunement becomes whatever your left attunement was, and your left attunement becomes the new one. To attune to one attunement fully, you have to use the same one twice in a row. * Attunement swapping is on a 3 second global cooldown. * Dual attuning and single attuning are both encouraged with traits. * Many skills/traits grant a barrier so you don't instadie as a melee ele. Barrier is a new mechanic that buffers your health total. * Left attunement is considered your primary attunement for the purposes of traits, like passive heal or immunity to crit. **Sword skills** * F1 - Chain that burns on the final strike * F2 - Leap and short fire field * F3 - Deals extra damage to burning enemies, also causes burn itself * W2 - Evade backwards, regenerate, and leave a water field * A2 - Shadowstep to a target, daze, and gain superspeed if you interrupt. Leap finisher **Dual skill** Sword * F/W - Double strike, apply burn and chill * W/A - Ranged chill attack that hits multiple targets Staff * W/A - Moving hurricane that pulses heal and chill * A/E - Large piercing boulder that moves very fast and dazes. Long windup but big damage Scepter * F/A - Piercing beam that deals large damage * F/E - Meteor that causes vulnerability and burning * W/A - Piercing projectile that chills * W/E - Multihit aoe attack that causes bleeding and vulnerability **Stances** Non-elite stances have 2 charges, which can be used successively on short cooldowns. Charges take longer to refresh. * Healing - Gives a buff that heals in an aoe when hitting enemies * Stone Resonance - Gain barrier periodically * Unravel - While active, forces you into one attunement * Twist of Fate - Stunbreak, evade, and gain superspeed * Primordial Stance - Damages and inflicts different conditions based on attunements. Fully attuning one element gives the same condition twice * Weave Self (elite) - Reduces attuning cd, gain bonuses for attuning. If you attune to every element before the stance ends, gain a powerful buff that combines each individual attunement's bonus, and you can end the stance to float nearby enemies"

Its text says that Light Aura reduces incoming condition DAMAGE by 10%. I thought that this was profession specific at first, but the Icon is the exact same for normal light aura. Does this mean that some other combo fields/finishers will change as well? This is a pretty huge change IMO. For reference: Current light aura (which can only be gained by leaping through a light field) grants 2s of retaliation when struck with a 1 sec ICD, and lets you inflict a stack of vulnerability when you strike a target."
177,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[Discussion] I am concerned about the state of Ranger.,25,6rlp5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6rlp5y/discussion_i_am_concerned_about_the_state_of/,2017-08-05 02:40:41,"This is going to be a ~~long~~ **very long** post specifically addressing my thoughts and concerns towards Ranger in regards to gameplay and identity, followed by my idea on how to begin to resolve the problems. ###Ranged weapons and Ranger identity I want to start out by saying that I am in no way opposed to melee rangers, I am actually quite fond of the way that melee has been incorporated as an option for rangers; I enjoy the design and play of sword, ax and torch especially, and I do associate these weapons with the identity of Ranger (namely the theme of 'survivalist'). I don't think Greatsword was a necessary addition to Ranger kit, but it makes sense enough that I don't mind it, and I am glad for those that do enjoy it that it is an option. But, ultimately, at the core of Ranger identity, I of course think of bows. Now, we have access to two different bows - Longbow and Shortbow - and whilst I personally think that the state of Shortbow Ranger is in an okay place right now (at least as far as PvP and PvE viability goes), Longbow Ranger - 'Archer Ranger' - most certainly is not. To me, Ranger is supposed to identify as a ranged weapon specialist, beastmaster, survivalist and outdoorsman. In most games I enjoy playing as the archer, and I conceptualised my GW2 Sylvari Ranger [long before](URL the game released. Official descriptions such as [this](URL >A master of ranged combat, the ranger is capable of striking unwitting foes from a distance with his bow. is what lead me to choose Ranger in the first place. Like many GW2 players, I own a multitude of characters, but my Ranger was my very first character, and despite not being as useful or played as much as others, I have over 3000 [hours clocked on her](URL and (with the exception of sPvP) I've always played her as a 'Longbow Archer'; I desperately want to be able to play her as one without feeling like a hindrance to my allies. ###Druid and Soulbeast [Druid](URL was an intriguing addition to Ranger, and I like the specialisation as a whole, but Druid focuses on support and healing, with a cosmic/astral theme. It is very different to me than what a Ranger is - and while initially I had an internal conflict over this, I've come to the conclusion that I actually prefer elite specialisations working as identities of their own. I made a separate character to play as Druid, as I want my Ranger to be... well, a Ranger. I didn't want to get rid of her identity as an archer - the reason I picked Ranger to begin with. Soulbeast does look interesting, and for those who enjoy the idea of 'Melee Ranger' I believe it's going to be a great addition, but for a short while after the confirmation of Soulbeast, I couldn't help but feel like I would have preferred to see another ranged option (Rifle or Pistol), though I attribute the core reasons for feeling that way to be Archer Ranger being so lacking as it currently stands (hence the making of this post), and Soulbeast identifying itself too closely to Ranger rather than something of its own - Ranger already has melee weapons, and the idea of merging with your pet seems like a glorified version of what the existing Beastmastery specialisation could be. That being said, I also acknowledge that we haven't seen enough of Soulbeast yet for this to be a fair judgement, and I am surely very biased due to my passion towards what I want for Archer Ranger. Maybe Soulbeast will provide a better option for/will become a core part of Melee Ranger - after all, I don't see Rangers running around meleeing things with a sword either. I would welcome Soulbeast more warmly - it would feel like a better addition - if it will provide Ranger with an extra, individual identity, like Druid successfully does. If the problems with Archer Ranger were resolved, I doubt that the thought of Soulbeast filling the gap for what Ranger currently lacks would have crossed my mind to begin with. ###Are ArenaNet abandoning Archer Ranger? I am very afraid that ArenaNet are moving away from the Archer Ranger identity - whilst the Ranger used to be described on the [Official Guild Wars 2 Ranger Profession page](URL the Ranger description *used* to be: >Rangers rely on a keen eye, a steady hand, and the power of nature itself. Unparalleled archers, rangers are capable of bringing down foes from a distance with their bows. With traps, nature spirits, and a stable of loyal pets at their command, rangers can adapt to any situation. but at some point changed (*proof below), and is currently: >Rangers rely on a keen eye, a steady hand, and the power of nature itself. Unparalleled survivalists with traps, nature spirits, and a stable of loyal pets at their command, rangers can adapt to any situation. **Proof:** The [GW2 Wiki Ranger page](URL quotes the original description - with the same official Guild Wars 2 Ranger Profession page linked above as the source. According to the wiki page history it was first used on the page on the [15 March 2014](URL and, as of this post, is still being used on the wiki page presently. The old description is also [quoted here on reddit](URL 3 years ago by /u/Rengaru, citing the same source. **Why was it changed?** At the moment the profession page lacks anything at all relating to marksmanship or ranged weapon proficiency - only that Rangers can tame pets, lay traps, and summon spirits. I agree that in Ranger's *current* state they are not ""unparalled archers"" - Warriors see more use of longbow than rangers do at the moment - but this is something that I want to see resolved, not abandoned. ###Main problem The biggest issue Longbow Ranger faces at the moment is an inability to be compatible with the standard combat method of players stacking in one place, which contributes heavily to a severe lack of damage. Whilst I'd bite the bullet for the sake of Ranger being more viable, I also want to point out that the damage rotation is quite dry. I'm sure many of you remember Colin Johanson's quote [""I swung a sword. I swong a sword again. Hey, I swung it again!""](URL mocking stale MMO combat in the [Guild Wars 2 MMO Manifesto](URL saying [""We want to change the way people view combat.""](URL With 5 [Longbow abilities](URL - one being the autoattack, and the final 3 being utility abilities, the only ability longbow has for damage is #2 [Rapid Fire](URL #3 used to apply 10 stacks of Vulnerability to your target, so it actually had a place in the PvE combat rotation, but this was replaced in favour of granting the Ranger stealth - a useless PvE combat ability. As far as [weaponswapping](URL goes, [Shortbow](URL is not a viable option as a second weapon - its damage is largely based around condition damage, wheras longbow doesn't utilise damaging conditions at all and is based on Berserker stats. Swapping to a melee weapon would mean having to return into melee range in order to be effective - with the time this would take, this isn't viable (let alone the complete opposite idea of archer) either. A second longbow is the only beneficial option, but the second longbow's abilities share a cooldown with your first longbow. The only reason having two longbows at all is beneficial is thanks to the Skirmishing trait [Quick Draw](URL The most optimal longbow ranger damage rotation (as far as I've discovered) is as follows: Stand at 1000+ range, position yourself behind or to the side of your target for [Hunter's Tactics](URL send your pet to attack (and make sure you remain behind/to the side of your target), drop [Frost Spirit](URL or activate [""Sic'Em!""](URL as your pet is about to attack, activate ~~""Rampage as One""~~ ""[Strength of the Pack!""](URL as your pet is about to attack, press 2, autoattack until 2 is almost off cooldown, weapon swap, activate [Quickening Zephyr](URL press 2, activate [Signet of the Wild](URL activate [""We Heal as One!""](URL press 2, repeat. *""I pressed 2. I pressed 2 again. Hey, I pressed 2 again!""* is a fairly accurate description of using longbow for damage. The [longbow autoattack](URL dictates that the further away the Ranger, the more damage the attack does. Not stacking with your group prevents attainment of boons and buffs, which are vital to damage, and healing, which is vital to surviving. So how can a longbow ranger get the most out of its damaging abilities whilst benefiting from allies to optimise its damage in combat? I have a concept for a solution that could solve the problem. ###My proposed solution My concept solution to remedying the Longbow Ranger's problem lies in Beastmastery; or rather, our pet. Most pets are melee, and fight in melee with your group. See where this is going? Introduce a (Grandmaster? Replace [Zephyr's Speed](URL trait somewhere in Beastmastery that is a glorified, backwards version of [Fortifying Bond](URL - any buff, boon and heal your pet gains is shared with you - if possible, including alacrity and profession buffs. I've thought about this a lot, and even have a name for it: Symbiotic Bond, after the [Guild Wars 1 ability of the same name](URL :) This allows the Ranger to stand at range without losing buffs (and hence, damage) or healing. It would give a better idea as to what else Ranger needs to appropriately tune its damage, and does not pose a threat as an overtune to other Ranger playstyles because it does not benefit someone already standing in melee. In past quarterly updates Ranger's seen some fantastic changes - [Summer 2015 Torch buffs](URL [Fall 2015 Axe buffs](URL [Spring 2016 Axe/Condi buffs](URL [Summer 2016 Sword buff](URL [Fall 2016 Pet buffs](URL [Winter 2016 Shortbow Update](URL [Spring 2017 Greatsword buffs](URL and [Summer 2017 Shortbow and Axe buffs](URL **ArenaNet! It is time for Ranger to receive its archer identity! Bring on the longbow buffs/remake!** ###Why it didn't matter as much in the past Before Raids, profession damage didn't matter as much to the community as a whole. Since Raids released, we have established profession DPS benchmarks for what is good and what isn't, and that matters to people now a whole lot more, not just for raiding, but for general PvE (Dungeons, Fractals) as well. This isn't to say that non-meta is unaccepted by everyone - there are many players who play just for fun and welcome everyone - but similarly there are players who only want the the top-tier options, and won't allow anything else in their party. Now personally I think *that is okay*, but as far as the difference between profession DPS goes, I also think it's a bridge that should be gapped to give the playerbase as a whole more options and variety. Whilst I can concede that it's unrealistic to expect all professions to be able to achieve the exact same DPS, and I understand damage tradeoffs for healthpool, utility support and CC, I do think that each profession should have at least one avenue that enables them to reach top-tier, if not for PvE overall, at the very least for one PvE encounter, such as Condition Mesmer on Matthias or Revenant on Deimos. After all, wasn't that the goal? Here are some quotes from Guild Wars 2 Systems Designer Isaiah Cartwright in the [Combat in Guild Wars 2](URL video. >[""In Guild Wars 2 we really want you to be able to play what you want to play, when you want to play it, where you want to play it. And the way we did that is all of our professions can adapt to almost any situation""](URL >[""Anyone can be a support character, anyone can be a damage dealer.""](URL ###Why this was an unresolvable problem in the past In the past, as I've understood it, there was not a system in place that allowed gamemakers to change abilities in one gamemode without affecting the others. Longbow Ranger does not compete with current meta PvE DPS such as the Tempest, but to buff it so for PvE would have affected PvP as well, and in those circumstances I can understand why addressing some of the issues I am mentioning would result in a negative experience for other players (if the autoattack damage gets buffed to tune longbow damage, it would not be fun to get killed quickly from a range much greater than your own). More recently, [there have been developments](URL that allow differences to be made to abilities without affecting the other gamemodes. ###My goal The ultimate goal of this post is to draw some attention to the problems with 'Archer Ranger' in its current state, with the hope that ArenaNet will address these issues in the future. If there is any ongoing development for the Archer Ranger, I would absolutely love if a developer could share some information. I want to see more Rangers in open world, and more warmly welcomed in PvE content such as Dungeons, Fractals and Raids. As a community here, I'd like to know how you feel about the above, and what *you* think about Ranger. ###Thank you Thank *you* for making it all the way through my post. Thank you ArenaNet for making Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2, I extensively play and adore both! I apologise if at any point I have come across as unappreciative or impudent, I promise that it is not intentional - I am just extremely passionate. Thank you for giving players such a wonderful game to play. Thank you for all your maintenance and additions. Thank you /r/GuildWars2 for this subreddit; an outlet for us to share and discuss as a community. ####**TL;DR** - Ranger is missing it's archer identity! ArenaNet, please don't abandon it!"

Weve changed it to immediately grant stability to the caster so you have the opportunity to prevent crowd control before it lands. The Retribution trait lines identity was centered around Sustain and was somewhat lacking in synergy; a couple trait reworks here are intended to create some interplay with retaliation and stability. The Devastation line and the Legendary Assassin stance have been about Power damage and seizing initiative, and weve pushed a few modifications here to help Power builds and offer revenants more control on when their traits come into play. **Weapon Skills:** - Hammer Bolt: Fixed a bug that allowed this skill to hit foes beyond its maximum range. - Echoing Eruption: This skill now leaps to a target, if there is one. Increased the leap distance traveled by 25%. Fixed a bug causing this skill to display the incorrect range. - Shackling Wave: Increased damage by 66%. This attack now inflicts 8 stacks of vulnerability for 5 seconds. The range has been increased from 300 to 450. - Grasping Shadow: Increased damage by 25%. The fury duration has been increased from 6 seconds to 8 seconds. **Utility Skills:** - Protective Solace: Fixed a bug with this skills tooltip displaying the incorrect radius. - Inspiring Reinforcement: This skill has been unsplit from PvP, reducing the energy cost of this skill from 35 to 30 in all game types. - Vengeful Hammers: Added a third hammer and reduced damage by 33% to preserve approximate damage per second. Changed the base function of this skill so you can no longer lose projectiles as a result of passing too close to uneven terrain. This skill has been unsplit from PvP, using the increased healing values in all game types. - Energy Expulsion: Increased the duration of fragments created by this skill from 5 seconds to 10 seconds. - Enchanted Daggers: Increased damage by 20%. - Riposting Shadows: This skill now grants 6 seconds of fury when activated. - Impossible Odds: This skill now grants 10% increased damage for its duration in addition to its existing effects. - Jade Winds: This skill now inflicts 6 stacks of vulnerability for 6 seconds on each foe struck, in addition to its existing effects. - Soothing Stone: This skill now grants 5 seconds of retaliation when used, rather than scaling retaliation based on the number of conditions removed. **Traits:** - Abyssal Chill: Fixed a bug that affected how this trait displays its torment skill fact. - Nefarious Momentum: Increased the might granted when using an assassin-stance skill from 2 to 3 stacks. This trait now grants 2 stacks of might for 10 seconds when using a nonassassin stance skill. - Mutilate Defenses: This trait now has a chance to inflict vulnerability when you critically strike rather than on any strike. The chance to inflict vulnerability has been increased from 25% to 33%, and the duration of vulnerability has been increased from 4 seconds to 6 seconds. - Empowering Vengeance: This trait has been reworked and renamed Vicious Reprisal. Vicious Reprisal increases the duration of retaliation applied to you by 50% and causes your attacks to do 10% increased damage, granting 1 stack of might for 8 seconds as long as you have retaliation. - Improved Aggression: This trait has been split and now increases taunt duration by 100% in PvE and 25% in WvW and PvP. It now also grants 2 seconds of retaliation when taunting a foe. - Versed in Stone: This trait now also converts 13% of your Toughness into Power. - Determined Resolution: This trait has been reworked and now reduces the damage you take while you have stability by 15%, and increases the duration of stability you apply by 33%. - Hardened Foundation: This trait has been reworked and now grants up to 120 Toughness, converting 7% of your Toughness into Healing Power. - Natural Abundance: Increased the duration of fragments from this trait from 5 seconds to 10 seconds. - Hardening Persistence: Fixed an issue in PvP where this trait was not granting the proper amount of Toughness when using Facet of Light. - Planar Protection: This trait now casts Dome of the Mists when you use your healing skill in addition to when you take falling damage. Increased Dome of the Mistss recharge from 5 seconds to 20 seconds. Envoy of Sustenance: This trait no longer grants boon duration. It now grants up to 240 Concentration at level 80. - Venom Enhancement: Increased the poison application of this trait from 1 stack to 2 stacks. - Focused Siphoning: Increased damage dealt by 20%. - Malicious Reprisal: This trait now triggers when you block an attack as well as when your attacks are blocked. The unblockable attacks from this trait now deal 25% increased damage. This trait has swapped positions with Jade Echo and moved to the Master tier. Reduced recharge from 30 seconds to 20 seconds. - Assassins Annihilation: Increased damage dealt by 20%. - Enduring Recovery: This trait no longer grants a chance to recover endurance every 10 seconds when struck. Instead, it now grants a constant 25% increased endurance recovery, as long as the trait is equipped. - Jade Echo: This trait has swapped positions with Malicious Reprisal and moved to the Adept tier. Renamed the skill fired by this trait to Lesser Jade Winds. - Assassins Presence: Increased the Ferocity bonus granted by this trait to 225 at level 80. - Dwarven Battle Training: The chance to apply weakness has been increased to 100%. - Dismantle Fortifications: This trait now grants 5 stacks of might for 5 seconds when you attempt to disable a foe with stability, in addition to its previous effects. - Steadfast Rejuvenation: Increased the chance for healing to occur to 100%.

179,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Necromancer changes 8/8/17 patch,36,6sgde7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6sgde7/necromancer_changes_8817_patch/,2017-08-09 06:37:00,"One of the biggest changes for necromancers in this patch is the change to the Vital Persistence trait. Previously, this trait reduced the rate at which life force decayed while in shroud and was too powerful compared to the other two traits in the same tier. Weve changed the functionality of this trait in order to provide a different option that is easier to track and is more competitive with other traits in the same tier. The Lich Form elite skill has also received a significant update and had most of its functionality overhauled to better position it as a power-based option that can complement Plaguelands. One other major change was to the Signets of Suffering trait in the Spite line, which previously was competing with Spiteful Spirit as a boon-corruption option. Weve reworked this trait to more directly benefit signet skills and increase the boon-corruption power of Spiteful Spirit a bit for players who want that functionality. Profession: - Infusing Terror: Updated the description of this skill to clarify the damage-reduction component. Weapon Skills: - Life Siphon: This skill has been unsplit from PvP and now uses the higher healing value in all game modes. Fixed a bug that caused this skill to go on higher (normal) recharge when interrupted while Quickening Thirst is equipped. - Dark Pact: This skill has been unsplit from PvP and now uses the higher damage value in all game modes. Utility Skills: - Spectral Walk: Removed one of the unique enhancements from visibility because it had no function. Increased duration from 8 seconds to 10 seconds. - Spectral Armor: Increased duration from 6 seconds to 8 seconds. - Spectral Wall: Increased duration from 5 seconds to 6 seconds. - Spectral Grasp: This skill now fires at the necromancers original target and up to 4 other enemies within a 1,200 range. Increased the recharge from 20 seconds to 50 seconds. This skill has been unsplit from PvP and now functions the same in all game modes. - Lich Form: This skill has had a functionality rework for many of its skills. Its active duration has been increased from 15 seconds to 20 seconds. - Marked for Death: This skill has been renamed to Lichs Gaze. The functionality of this skill has been reworked and will now fire a bolt of dark energy at a random, nearby enemy that cripples for 2 seconds and applies vulnerability for 10 seconds. This skill uses the new ammo system, with an ammo count of 5 and a count recharge of 1.5 seconds. There is a 0.1-second recharge between each use. - Chilling Wind: This skill has been renamed to Ripple of Horror. The lich will now fire a wave of terrible power that fears enemies struck by it for 2 seconds. Grants access to March of Undeath while the wave is active. - March of Undeath: Shadowstep to your Ripple of Horror, destroying it. - Mark of Horror: This skill has been renamed to Summon Madness. This skill no longer requires a ground target. Upon casting, minions will spawn every second for the next 8 seconds. Minions spawned have been changed from Jagged Horrors to a new Unstable Horror. Unstable Horrors have a low health pool and will explode after 6 seconds if they are not killed, dealing damage in a 180 radius around them. - Grim Specter: This skill has been reworked to no longer clear conditions from allies or boons from enemies. This skill now tethers up to 5 nearby enemies, drawing Vitality to the lich. The lich gains up to 30 Vitality per stack for 20 seconds, life-stealing each pulse. Enemy players struck by this skill have their Vitality reduced by an equivalent amount for the same duration. - Shadow Fiend: Increased damage of basic attack by 50%. Increased damage of Haunt skill by 33%, and fixed an incorrect skill description. Haunt now applies chilled for 3 seconds and weakness for 5 seconds, in addition to blind. - Plague Signet: Updated skill facts to clarify that this skills passive effect transfers 1 condition every 3 seconds from allies to yourself. Signet of Spite: When activated, this skill now inflicts 2 stacks of torment for 6 seconds, in addition to its previous active effects. Traits: - Soul Eater: This trait has had its functionality changed. It now reduces the recharge of greatsword skills by 20%. Additionally, it grants healing and life force every second while in combat and wielding a greatsword - Spectral Mastery: Duration increase has been reduced from 50% to 20%. - Spiteful Spirit: Fixed a bug that caused this trait to be nonfunctional while underwater. Fixed a bug that prevented this trait from granting retaliation. Fixed a bug that caused this trait to fail to display the number of boons converted. Increased the number of boons converted from 1 to 2. - Chill of Death: The skill fired by this trait has been renamed to Lesser Spinal Shivers. - Terrifying Descent: This trait now also inflicts 1 stack of torment for 3 seconds on foes you fear, in addition to its previous functionality. The skill activated when taking falling damage has been named Lesser Terrify. - Spiteful Renewal: This trait now triggers when you use a healing skill instead of when striking a low-health foe. - Signets of Suffering: This trait has been reworked to have the following functionality: Signets have a 20% reduced recharge and their passive abilities are improved. Signet passive effects are preserved while in a shroud. - Signet of Vampirism: Healing when struck has been increased by approximately 50%. - Plague Signet: The number of conditions drawn per interval has been increased from 1 to 2. - Signet of Spite: Increased Power to 270 at level 80. - Signet of the Locust: Grants an additional 180 Healing Power at level 80. - Signet of Undeath: Life-force gain per interval has been increased from 2% to 3%. - Ritual of Life: This trait no longer improves revive speed. The skill cast by this trait has been renamed Lesser Well of Blood. This trait now causes Well of Blood and Lesser Well of Blood to revive allies by 7% each pulse. - Life from Death: Increased the revive amount to 10%. Increased healing by 25%. - Vampiric Rituals: This skill has been unsplit from PvP and now provides 5 seconds of protection in all game modes. Increased life-stealing values by approximately 100%. - Speed of Shadows: This trait has been reworked, now grants 10 seconds of swiftness, and removes all movement-impairing conditions when you enter a shroud. - Vital Persistence: This trait no longer slows shroud decay but instead grants bonus Vitality and reduces the recharge of shroud skills by 20%. Which change has gotten your attention? Any thoughts you'd like to share? Personally, I'm a bit curious about the reformed Lich abilities."
180,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Engineer Post-Patch: Almost untouched and still too kit-reliant,1,6so3xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6so3xb/engineer_postpatch_almost_untouched_and_still_too/,2017-08-10 06:04:22,"When you think of the Engineer class, what features do you think of? Perhaps you think of one (or several) of the various weapon kits that are so ubiquitous on engineers. Maybe you think of the tool kit abilities that give the Engineer flexibility and utility. If you played PvP many season ago, you may still have nightmares of bunker Engineers surrounded by a small fleet of nigh-impossible to assail turrets. You might even think of some of the gadgets used for their potent (but *incredibly* niche) abilities. As an engineer main for 4+ years, all of these things come to mind. Not to mention all the numerous problems with the class. **The problems:** Engineer has (as far as I can remember) always been a pretty solid class; never too weak or two over-the-top (barring some brief glitches). But as things have changed, I've noticed a bit of a pattern settle onto Engineer. Engie has become the ""hard"" class (along with Elementalist). I'm sure we all know of the joke about warrior where you can rub your face against the keyboard and be effective, while Engineer and Elementalist have to play their keyboard like they're a world-premier master of the piano. This difficulty comes from possibly one of the largest issues with Engineer: having to switch between multiple kits constantly to be ""effective"". If you're doing it right, your fingers fly across they keyboard and it's a hell of an experience. But without these kits, Engineer is lacking. Coupled with this, about half of the Engineer's utility skills are nearly useless or better covered by the weapon kits. When was the last time you saw turrets, gadgets, or elixirs used in an effective build (or something coming close to effective)? Maybe you can think of a couple examples, but for the most part, I bet you can't think of a use for half of the Engineer skills. *** **An Example:** Let's briefly looking at the Rifle turret, at level 80, it has a 476 damage ever two second. That's 238 DPS. No stat scaling, no crit chance. Just 238 DPS at best, and probably much worse if the target is has increased toughness, blocks, evades, etc. etc. Now, you might be thinking, ""Well, the turret over-charges when you place it! Obviously it's meant for burst damage while it's over-charged."" And you could potentially be right, except the over-charge is almost just as bad. A 50% fire rate increase, piercing targets (which will rarely do anything), and 1 Vulnerability per shot. There are Signets on other classes who out perform that with their passive alone. But let's not forget the toolbelt skill for the turret: Surprise Shot. On a 8 second recharge (quite low), you get 266 damage with a 1.0 power ratio at 1000 range. Wow. That's pretty good sounding. Until you look at **just** the #2 of the Grenade kit, Shrapnel Grenade. A 5 second cooldown, 195 damage with a 0.55 power ratio, and 10s of bleeding. Not that much better that Surprise shot. Until you remember there are **three** grenades, and they have an AoE. A **sixth** of Grenade Kit is *significantly* better than **all** of Rifle Turret. This trend continues with other turrets, almost all gadgets, and pretty much all elixirs. Anything that one of those utilities can do, a kit can do better (and with more flexibility). And don't even get me **started** about the Med Kit and what a laughable piece of garbage that thing is. *** **Why this is bad:** First and foremost, when I play Engineer, I feel like I'm being ""forced"" to pick kits because of everything they do and the utility they provide. Once you've got the picks that fit your build (usually 3 or 4), how much more choice do you have in your build? Maybe 1 or 2, possibly 1 or 0 since Healing Turret is effectively a must-choose. Having most of your utilities pre-picked for you does not make an interesting experience (I feel the same way about Rev, but this post isn't about Revenants). Further, the ""requirement"" for multiple kits on any build raises the skill floor to a very irksome level. And compounding this issue is the fact that the amount of reward for such a complex rotation is almost identical to far simpler classes (and sometimes even worse). So good Engineers are working harder for the same (or less) reward! That is ultimately demoralizing. **What has ANet done?** The short of it is... not much. This most recent patch saw a pretty large buff to Gadgets and the Gadgeteer trait, but after significant thought and stress, it seems pretty clear to me that it's not even close to enough. Even with these new changes, Gadgets are very clearly sub-par compared to the tried-and-true of the Engineer. (And not to mention Turrets got a minor nerf as they lost knockback on detonation. I'll miss you Explosive Powder! D': ) Other than a fairly small quality of life change, turrets have been untouched since they were (justifiably) nerfed by making them vulnerable to criticals and conditions. But even before that, there wasn't a ""place"" for turrets in PvE. The only elixir that has ever really seen use is Elixir S as it provided some potent escape and utility in PvP, and I'll occasionally use Elixir U as a good source of Quickness and Stunbreak as well as an anti-projectile wall. But Elixir B? Elixir R? Elixir C? Almost entirely unused! (Though Elixir C could potentially see use as an anti-""burst condi"" utiltiy, it's over-shadowed by Purge Gyro and the Elixir gun kit.) And to these elixirs, nothing has changed since the train rework just before Heart of Thorns (and that didn't even change the utilties, but rather the traits involved with them). **What SHOULD be done?** First and foremost, I think there should be a *limit* on the number kits that a player can equip. I believe two kits would be more than fair and still leave 3 slots (2 if you pick Healing Turret, cause... duh) open for playing with. Obviously just limiting the number of kits able to be slotted would cripple the Engineer if nothing else changed. Additional changes to Gadgets, Elixirs, and Turrets would be needed. Perhaps the throw ability on Elixirs could put out a small field which would pulse some effect (kinda like Throw Elixir R and Throw Elixir U already do). This would provide a great deal more utility on the Elixirs and up the team-play aspect more, an aspect which Elixirs have always lacked. Gadgets should either become the **best** at **one** thing (like the Personal Battering Ram which now provides 3 hard CC's on one utility) or provide a very specific ability on the utility with a more generalized and useful effect on the toolbelt (much like Rocket Boots provides a leap combined with an anti soft-CC effect but a decent damage ability on the toolbelt). Honestly, I'm not sure what could be done with Turrets, but I think taking some inspiration from Signets one other classes might be the way to go. *** **TL;DR:** * Engineer is far too reliant on kits. * Half of Engie has little to no point because of kits. * Engineer is excessively complex to play at high levels because of kits. * It's been this way for far too long. * Some limiting effect should be placed on kits. * Underused, non-kit utilities of Engineer should be buffed/reworked to compensate. * Engineer is not *bad*, but it feels limited. * This most recent patch did very *very* little to fix the issues with engineer."

If I use **[Water2-&gt; Air2-&gt; Air5-&gt; Fire4-&gt; Fire2-&gt; Fire3]** I am outputting ~20k damage in a single burst with auto-attacks turned off.

I had tried GW2 over a year and a half ago with 3 friends when multiple F2P specs were still 1st and 2nd tier in PvP, but I am struggling to get back into the game now that the HoT specs dominate to top 3 PvP tiers on Metabattle. MY THOUGHTS ON THE F2P BUILDS SO FAR: -I am still seeing success with greatsword/hammer Warrior which seems to provide the strongest, most influential, noob-friendly F2P spec. -I have tried dagger/pistol-shortbow thief which I found incredibly underwhelming, weak, and squishy for the amount of effort required. Honestly, I've tried a few other Thief builds and F2P Thief seems to be trash. Trying to set up backstab when I could just put a Pistol in my main-hand and click one button to do 3x the damage of backstab makes the rogue-type play-style and mechanics seem questionable. If you have any interesting F2P Pistol/Pistol builds please do tell since I find it the most enjoyable. -I have tried the URL build which, while I enjoy the play-style and survivability, just isn't having the influence or damage that I'm expecting, and I am losing 3v3's on bases despite having what seems like an incredibly strong AOE/team presence. Primarily, I'm noticing that the staff abilities, in particular, while providing powerful de-buffs and control seem to be having 100% of their damage completely negated, so I swap to scepter/warhorn for the higher condition damage, but need to swap back after one rotation to continue to provide AOE support. Deathshround, of course, is powerful, but I'm not finding that switching into, or in and out of it, is providing any more damage pressure. -With Ranger, and I hand't noticed this a year ago, with the longbow/greatsword build, I'm finding the decreased mobility in combat and decreased mobility while strafing without using forward momentum to be resulting in 100% of my deaths (this is really frustrating because one of the biggest tricks in WoW is that strafing directly sideways allows you attack at a perfect 120 degree angle and kite. I find the mobility in this game to be the most frustrating factor as a F2P player due to how quick the F2P builds die, and how it turns what would be 'fast-paced-combat' into a needlessly cumbrous experience). -The URL build seems to work well, but lacks damage compared to almost everyone else on the battlefield which results in a lot of try-harding just to have a HoT character walk up and one-shot you. But again, this is one of the more influential choices. I have tried building many of my own Mesmer builds with zero success. The old F2P shatter Mesmer build from 1.5 years ago simply requires way to much effort for way to little damage. I was seeing if I couldn't just make some type of troll super high damage ranged-condition build, but I'm not having any success; feel free to make suggestions. MY ISSUES WITH DAMAGE DONE AND TAKEN: So my issue here, which again didn't seem as obvious when I tried the game over a year ago, is that HoT builds keep walking up and ""one-shotting"" me, or more specifically, killing me in under 5 seconds while it takes me a solid minute or so to output enough damage to kill them. This is happening across all of the F2P specs. I am not interested in purchasing HoT, as I'd prefer to just sub back to WoW, so I am trying to make F2P work. This is simply an observation that I am attempting to adapt to. AS A RESULT OF THIS (AND AS MENTIONED): I have begun trying to develop my own builds to see if I can't exploit some of the tree-weapon-class combinations. So far my half-baked builds have been mostly unsuccessful except in one instance: Axe/dagger \ Sword/torch condition ranger has worked wonderfully. This ranger build along with the greatsword/hammer warrior are now my most effective and enjoyable F2P builds BY FAR. Here is a look at my ranger build if you have any suggestions: URL and I am using Rune of the Krait and Carrion Amulet to enhance bleeds. I basically tried to put every talent into condition damage, used the two pets with the highest condition damage, and then tried to use sigils that I thought best matched and augmented the condition damage. The utility/elite abilities are kind of random. I am using Lightning Reflexes and Signet of the Hunt simply because because mobility is so limited in this game. Signet of Stone feels like it needs to be replaced, but I'm not sure what with. I am using Strength of the Pack instead of Entangle for the extra condition damage because in trial and error, Strength of the Pack seemed to secure a kill more often. I would LOVE some build suggestions about other exploitative or obscure build types that would allow me to secure kills, output tons of damage, or have significant influence, because as I've mentioned, the HoT builds are blowing me up anyways, so I'm just looking to have a strong impact and/or help out the team before a Dragonhunter Guardian comes over and one-shots me. IF IT ISN'T CLEAR: I have 3 accounts with a Warrior, Necromancer, Ranger, Elementalist, Theif, Mesmer. I am also very happy to create another account and try out a Guardian or Engineer build if you have any good suggestions. I am interested in any type of play-style. I've been wanting to see if I could develop my own Guardian build that is super tanky with tons of aoe support, for example. It would be fun to just run around making all of my pay-to-play teammates twice as strong. BEYOND THIS (AND SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG) I AM LOOKING FOR HELP WITH THE S/F FRESH AIR ELEMENTALIST BUILD: URL This is clearly one of the strongest F2P builds (I know because I keep killing things by spamming random buttons), but it is immensely confusing for the following reasons: -I cannot figure out the when I should be using which abilities and how I should be juggling the attunements since there are so many abilities, similar abilities, and the guide doesn't demonstrate a proper strategy. The guide indicates how to use the double lightning strike by repeatedly switching into air attunement. OKAY. But when, how often, and what how about the other 15 abilities? It keeps referring to ""your burst"" but doesn't indicate what that is? Is this ""burst"" just the air atteunement double lightening? It says to use the utility stun to ""set up your burst""... so what exactly are the spells used in this so-called ""burst"" that require me to set up a stun since the lightning strikes are automatic? -My bad habit/urge is to try and use all of the spells in any one attunement as you might in PvE so that I don't waste any cooldowns. This is clearly not the appropriate way to play this spec, so which abilities should I never be using? Which abilities should I only be using in certain circumstances? Which abilities should I always be using? And how should I be weaving through my attunements to use these abilities (for example do I always switch to AIR first before switching to another attunement i.e.; Water for cc - into Air for lightning strike - into Earth for defense - into to Air for lightning strike - into Fire for aoe pressure - into Air...etc)? -I understand that this is a difficult question to answer, but I am entirely lost. I go into fire atunement and always try get off ALL of the abilities since they do some of the highest damage. I try to switch into air as often as possible for the double lightning strike, but I'm not sure how regularly/how I should be using the other Air abilities [for example I could go into air for lightning Strike, into earth for defense, back into air for Lightning Strike+blind, into water for cc -- or I could just use the blind the first time I am in air, or I could use the blind both times I am in Air attunement [my point is the number of ways to weave these spells together is essentially endless and my head is literally spinning]. Usually, I try to switch into water to provide healing and CC, but I'm not sure how long to stay in water, or if I should be using all of the water abilities each time (like Shatterstone). I try to switch to Earth for defense, but again I'm not sure if I should just be using a few of the abilities or all of them, or weaving in and out from Air and only using certain abilities. -SHOULD I BE AUTO-ATTACKING IN EVERY ATTUNEMENT, OR IS THAT A WASTE OF TIME? This is a big one. Because my instinct is to get the burn from the Fire auto-attack, the bleeding from the Earth auto-attack, or the damage from the air auto-attack (the water auto-attack seems to be the weakest). Maybe I'm wrong though. Maybe I shouldn't be auto attacking in any of these attunements and focusing on spells? Maybe I should only be using the Fire and Earth auto attacks for the condition effects? MORE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES INCLUDE: -Swirling Winds (Air) and Magnetic Wave (Earth) They essentially do the same thing with Magnetic Wave being stronger. Am I supposed to use swirling winds to block some projectiles, then switch to Earth for Magnetic wave to block MORE projectiles and cure conditions. Should I just switch to Earth, use Magnetic Wave since it is stronger, then switch back to Air? -Fire Shield (Fire), Obsidian Flesh (Earth), Rock Barrier (Earth). Should I just be using all 3 of these when I'm being focused? Do I use one, switch to air switch back, use another, switch to air switch back, use the third, switch to air? -Should I be using Water Trident every time I switch to Water attunement? I keep trying to use it to heal myself or some teammates, but seems relatively weak, and I feel like I am just wasting a GCD. How about Shatterstone? Am I using it every time I go into water? or am I randomly weaving it together with the other attunements in a one-off fashion to inflict vulnerability? -Should I be using all of my Fire abilities? Or perhaps only using them in aoe/teamfight scenarios. What about for single-targets? Should I be switching to fire just to use a couple abilities or create a fire field, then switch to other attunements to proc blast effects? ANYWAYS: I know I have bogged you guys down with a lot of information, but I didn't want to make 10 different threads. PLEASE DON'T FEEL BURDENED AND ALLOW ME TO NARROW THIS DOWN AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO RESPOND TO BASICALLY, WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR IS: Obscure, unique, powerful weapon/specilization combination builds that will allow me to sort of exploit tree effects for high damage or a lot of influence in PvP (outside of the obvious top tier contenders listed on Metabattle). An example would be my awesome Ranger Axe/Dagger \ Sword/Torch build which has been winning me more fights than any Metabattle build so far. AND: A critique of my Ranger build, but keep in mind that, so far, I am having more success with this build than any other free to play builds. I understand that, as is the case with my Necromancer, there a lot of important tree interactions that can make a build more well-rounded. However, as noted, I seem to be getting blown up anyways, and focusing all of my talents into condition buffs on my Ranger has unexpectedly resulted in one of the most fun and effective builds so far - which is why I am seeking similar pocket, op, questionable, but fun and strong builds. AND, perhaps: A list of S/F Fresh Air Elementalist abilities, when and why to use them, how to weave the attunements/spells together, and a general strategy that includes all of the abilities instead of just [switch into air as much as you can to proc double lightning]. Feel free to answer the questions about the specific examples I provided, but if you just describe how/why to weave/use each spell, or provide a typical fight scenario that includes most of the abilities and how it plays out - you will have answered all of my questions in one fell swoop. Ultimately, I am just very unclear on how, when, and why I should be switching attunements, how to effectively use each attunement, how to weave abilties/attunements together, and what my primary method of ""burst"" and/or securing kills is. AND, LASTLY: Feel free to critique my comments about the F2P builds; Condition Necro, Mantra Mesmer, longbow/greatsword Ranger. It is clear to me that I am not playing them optimally at this point, but I believe my points still stand. The F2P necro just isn't as strong as it use to be, but the staff abilities are incredibly fun - I'm just struggling to win even team-fights with it. The Mantra Mesmer is great but takes quite a bit of effort for very medium damage. The LB/GS Ranger is obviously great at long-rage - but I'm suffering from limited mobility and I'm having various HoT characters blink on top of me and kill me within seconds with zero ability to effectively kite (my best bet is just to stick with the GS and spam Maul which isn't enjoyable to me, unless perhaps I was building some sort of Melee ranger build) Thank you again for any suggestions or help, and again I wan't to reiterate that your responses do not need to be as lengthy, intricate, or verbose as my wall of text. You do not need to answer every question. I am just looking for some sweet pocket-OP F2P troll specs (especially a double pistol thief spec if anyone can think one up), and with S/F Fresh Air Elementalist I am really just looking for a clearer understanding of how to play the spec, set up kills, and when/how to use each attunement. **EDIT;** spelling, grammar, update"
184,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"sPvP: Reaper Shout ""Nothing Can Save You!"" Why not much use/not listed in Metabattle?",0,6nrspe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6nrspe/spvp_reaper_shout_nothing_can_save_you_why_not/,2017-07-17 18:27:28,"It's an AoE shout that deals some damage, gives Reaper unblockable for a long duration or just 4 seconds. It corrupts 2 boons of everyone around the Reaper into Vulnerability and it's cooldown is pretty fast when traited with Augury of Death. On a shout build it becomes really useful, allowing your shouts to become unblockable and other skills too. In comparison, Corrupt Boon corrupts 3 boons and is unblockable. More useful in a condi build but on a power build I don't really see it's usage since you want Vulnerability over other conditions anyway."
185,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Warrior's Axe Traits/Skills balance should be looked at again,156,6cgcsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6cgcsl/warriors_axe_traitsskills_balance_should_be/,2017-05-21 22:48:58,"So with the recent patch many people including myself got really excited about the possibility that you could play an effective build with Axe in Raids/Fractals now. Sadly the recent changes missed the mark in that regard and really highlighted a lot of the problems to me. Let me preface this by saying that I don't think it's easy to balance a game with so many different skills, traits, gamemodes and playstyles, but if Anet decides to specifically take a look at a specific aspect of a class I want them to get it right. The changes with the recent patch were: &gt; Axe Mastery: Now gives 300 bonus ferocity as long as you have at least one axe equipped. &gt; Eviscerate: Now grants 5 stacks of might for 5 seconds if it hits. &gt; Decapitate: Now grants 5 stacks of might for 5 seconds if it hits. &gt; Double Chop: Increased damage per strike by 7%. &gt; Triple Chop: Increased damage per strike by 7%. &gt; Cyclone Axe: Now grants 2 seconds of fury per hit in addition to its previous effects. Increased vulnerability applied per hit from 2 to 3 stacks. Updated skill fact to show vulnerability applied per hit rather than total vulnerability for both hits. &gt; Throw Axe: Increased damage by 27%. &gt; Dual Strike: No longer gives fury. Now gives quickness for 1.5 seconds per strike that hits. Most of these changes benefit Warrior a lot in a Solo setting and might even push it over Greatsword DPS for Solo Warriors. But for Raid/Fractal Warriors it changes nothing in regards to Endgame viability. I think a lot skills/traits have obvious flaws so let me go over them **Skills** * Whirling Axe Probably the worst offender. Since it's been added to the game it got 2 damage increases. &gt; September 09, 2014 Increased damage by 17%. &gt;January 26, 2016 The PvP and PvE versions of this skill have been remerged, resulting in a 52% damage increase in PvE areas. Considering this skill is still a DPS loss in any rotation over plain autoattacking it should be easy to see how bad this skill was at the start of the game. However what's the actual issue here is that before this patch Whirling Axe was probably a dps increase but with this patch Anet increased the whole autochain of Axe by 7%, making Whirling Axe a DPS loss again. * Dual Strike That it gives quickness is not really relevant for Raid/Fractal Warriors but that doesn't matter too much. In the end it still is a decent DPS increase which is good. * Throw Axe Also a skill that got buffed in this patch. Is a slight DPS increase, minimal but an increase after all. Really average skill, not much to say about this one. * Cyclone Axe Just like Dual Strike it's a decent DPS increase and other useful perks. Decent skill * Auto chain A pretty decent Autochain that's really annoying to use in a rotation because the most damaging part is gated behind the first 4 hits. Nothing bad about that in itself but if you interruppt your chain at any point you have to start all over. Meaning you can't weave your skills between autos. * Decapitate This skill now gives 5 Might which means you can now run PS Axe Warrior. One problem is the fact that the Shockwave of the skill(which is half of the damage) doesn't hit the target itself which makes this skill a minimal DPS loss and not worth using because it fills your endurance faster and you have to dodge more to keep up your Stick and Move trait. **Traits** * Axe Mastery I mean come on. You have this awesome trait and you put it in the same line as Berserker's Power. A 20% damage increase after you use a burst skill. This trait will never be picked in any build aslong as it's competing with Berserker's Power unless BP gets nerfed or Axe Mastery gets buffed. * Forceful Greatsword Not an Axe related trait by itself but what makes this really annoying is that there are no other viable choices to pick for an Axe Warrior, or any non GS builds specing into Strength. Please give an alternative if you're not running GS. * Dual Wielding It increases your Attack Speed by 15% while wielding a sword, axe or mace in your offhand. Wow, that's great! Except that it get's overwritten by Quickness thus making this trait do nothing. Please apply it after Quickness and include Torch in the choices. PS: The attack speed increase from going Berserk also works like this. So yea, while this patch helped Axe Warrior a bit it still is behind pure Greatsword(even though close) and generates a bit less Might. Power Warrior in general has a lot of problems in PvE but that would be too much for this reddit post. Discuss!"
186,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"Necro: Just rework ""Chilling Death""",0,6cmfzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6cmfzl/necro_just_rework_chilling_death/,2017-05-22 20:28:38,"Having your main DPS stem from a combo field sounds like a lot of fun in theory, but in high-pressure, organised raids that isn't something that will end up benefiting anyone. I suggest the following changes to make a Reaper a power class again: - Switch Decimate Defenses (**MAJOR TRAIT**) (Striking a foe with vulnerability increases your critical hit chance) and Chilling Death (**GRANDMASTER TRAIT**) (Chill deals damage over time). - Chilling Death gets reworked into the following: Chill deals a delayed strike (damage is equal to 3 stacks of bleed for 8 seconds). According to my calculations, this will come to 1,968 damage per Chill strike. [(0.06 x 1000 condi damage) + 22] x 8 seconds = 1,968 damage. - Decimate Defenses gets reworked into the following: Striking a foe with Vulnerability increases power damage by 1% per stack. There, problem fixed. Power gets a 25% flat DPS boost and additional Chills applied to the foe (like how your Reaper shroud and GS auto-attack are SUPPOSED to do) give you a nice DPS boost. However your DPS isn't dependant on Chill fields anymore, but will be for optimal DPS. "
187,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Fun but unrealistic idea for Spirit weapons,1,6d4ftc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6d4ftc/fun_but_unrealistic_idea_for_spirit_weapons/,2017-05-25 05:33:59,"So I started to think about a possible change for Spirit weapons after someone brought [this](URL piece of artwork to my attention and this gave me an idea: What if spirit weapons where changed to act like engi gadgets instead of as AI summons? So when you use Bow of Truth for example it will let you target an area that gets bombarded with healing and condi clearing arrows by arrows that come from spirit bows that shoot from behind your character that he signals to shoot, as if the character are commanding a ghost archer regiment. [Ideas for the other weapons](#s ""So for the other weapons I got: * Hamer of Wisdom: Send forth a Hammer that knocks down enemies at its destination with a powerfull smash that also acts as a blast finisher. * Shield of the Avenger: Create a shield infront of you for a short while that pushes enemies away and grant aegis at the end of its cast. Tried something unique as a way to block instead of projectile/attack denial. * Sword of Justice: Summon two swords at your sides that make a rotation around you while melee attacking enemies around them and applying vulnerability. These swords would be using the current spirit sword attack animation instead of the more usual, and in more opinion less flavourful, flat weapon."" ) But here is the problem: Besides the work that is required to make this skill work mechanically it would also require at the very least 4 new animations for summoning while using: one-handed weapons, Staff, Longbow, or Hammer/Greatsword. I believe this would be way to much effort for Anet to do but its fun to think about what could be."
188,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Spoilers: In-depth Analysis of Necromancer elite spec in expansion,0,6f0o5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6f0o5i/spoilers_indepth_analysis_of_necromancer_elite/,2017-06-03 21:09:06,"URL I included both the Reaper elite specialization and the Scourge elite specialization in the link above so we can do an easier comparison. I think we can actually draw accurate inferences by comparing both. I think it would be more accurate this way because Anet might model the relevant effects after the Reaper traits. **The traits** * **1st trait:** Shows the weapon. Reaper = Greatsword Scourge = Torch * **2nd trait:** Shows the new shroud. Reaper = Reaper Shroud Scourge = What the hell is that? This? URL Monster bear shroud? Just kidding...looks like a devourer of sorts * **3rd trait:** New skill Reaper = Shout healing skill Scourge = A burn-based healing skill? Perhaps something like healing based on damage done to enemy or 'burning' up your shroud for healing etc. That was what I thought if I matched trait for trait. But the color of this trait is different. It doesn't look like a new skill color. It looks more like a normal trait. I think this trait position is swapped with the 13th trait. The healing skill was moved to 13th. And the burn condition boosting trait was moved here. See trait 13. The 13th Reaper trait is a Chill condition-boosting trait. This 3rd trait on Scourge looks like a burn condition-boosting trait. * **4th trait:** Reaper = Shout-boosting trait Scourge = A trait that boosts the **new type of skills** we are getting...It looks like a man standing between two shadows that could be summons...but I'm thinking more and more its going to be like the **mesmer's themed manipulation skills**. I'll explain more later. * **5th trait:** Reaper = chilling nova aoe damage trait. Doing a round of aoe chill damage on chilled targets. Scourge = looks like a needle marking a spot/cross. Hitting a target. Perhaps it works the same way as Reaper. If you hit the enemy under certain conditions, he will take more damage or you inflict vulnerability etc. * **6th trait:** Reaper = reduce movement impairing conditions. Defensive. Scourge = Looks like a simple bleed icon. But if we follow the Reaper's theme of a defensive trait, it might mean blood transfusion. As in you gain blood/HP. * **7th trait:** **Very important! Shows what new condition focus we are getting** Reaper = Inflict Chill on fear Scourge = The whole image looks like a 'burning fire' image with a scary face and I'm guessing its going to inflict burn on fear. * **8th trait:** Reaper = New skill you are all weaklings shout. Defensive. Scourge = New skill. It looks like an AOE regeneration channeling skill. Defensive. Or it could be he is encased in an AOE fire field that does cleanses or heals or something. Or an AOE convert all conditions into boons. * **9th trait:** Reaper = New skill chill shout. Offensive. Scourge = **WTF IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE GETTING A MOBILITY OFFENSIVE SKILL!!!! PLEASE MAKE THIS HAPPEN!** I'm guessing he is riding on burning speed to move swiftly. Burn yourself to gain swiftness? hahahaha. * **10th trait:** Reaper = Grave digger. A booster for new weapon. Scourge = Looks like a ball with concentric circles and swirling auras inward. Probably reduces recharge on new weapon torch. Not too sure what skill though. * **11th trait:** Reaper = Chilling victory for life force gain against chilled enemies. Scourge = Looks like a bubbling image...like poison...or its so hot and boiling its burning? Burning would seem to fit the theme more. Gain life force on burning? * **12th trait** Reaper = decimate defenses. a trait that boosts the crit stats. Scourge = looks like the guy is in ZEN mode...boost...healing stats? **please NO** * **13th trait** Reaper = Increase chill duration and lessen damage from chilled foes. Scourge = This is possibly the new healing skill that was swapped with the position of trait 3 on the Reaper traits. It looks like a grim reaper with his hand near his mouth about to swallow something. Or is he saying **LOOK AT MY HAND!!!** * **14th trait** Reaper = new skill. Offensive. unblockable shout. boon removal. Scourge = new skill. offensive. 2 hands. erupting from the ground. Maybe aoe immobilize? * **15th trait** Reaper = Gain life force or HP on boon. It was represented by a butterfly or moth image =/ Scourge = Looks like some sand is dripping into a bowl, like an hourglass type of dripping. Perhaps something to do with time/accumulation for some gains. * **16th trait** Reaper = Deathly Chill. Chill condition does damage. Offensive. Scourge = Burning does even more damage? Look at the image. The poor soul is being burned and in agony! * **17th trait** Reaper = Attack faster, gain ferocity stat, reduce shroud skill recharge. Offensive. Scourge = Looks like someone in shock with 3 exclamation marks. Possibly something to do with our shroud skills, offensive in nature. * **18th trait** Reaper = new skill. Defensive shout. damage reduction. Scourge = new skill. Looks like a large serpent. defensive or offensive? it looks very offensive to me though. A summon/minion? **NO PLEASE NO** Could it be a...mesmer-themed manipulation type of skill? * **19th trait** Reaper = New elite shout. Stun. Stability giving. Chill. Scourge = New elite skill. It looks to me like a mask or head screaming. Its too blur though. Could be anything. **What is our new type of skills going to be?** For Reapers it was the Shouts. For Scourge? I'm thinking it might be similar to Mesmer's Manipulation. URL &gt; **Manipulation is a skill type used to evade attacks, mislead opponents, redirect forces or to simply escape from a deadly situation. Many of these skills focus on the aspect of control, turning what could have been a player's end into an opponent's undoing.** Lets look at the new skills trait images again. **Trait 4 :** the trait that if mirrored with the Reaper's 4th shout boosting trait, is a trait that boosts our new skill. A man is standing between 2 shadows. Manipulation? Deception? **Trait 8 :** the new aoe skill. AOE convert all conditions into boons maybe? Fits the Manipulation description above. **Trait 9 :** A movement skill...An escape skill? Similar in purpose to mesmer's manipulation blink? **I WANT THIS!!!!*** **Trait 13 :** Reflect projectiles and heal yourself for mesmer manipulation. This skill with the grim reaper looking at his hand...I don't know... **Trait 14 :** Again a ""double"" hand image that could be manipulation themed. **Trait 18 :** An illusionary serpent? Or the serpent bites back which fits the theme of manipulation. The opponent comes near you thinking its a branch but its actually a snake and it bites. **Trait 19 :** Elite skill. I don't know. Let me know your thoughts =p"

Is it worth it to do the 3rd autoattack chain when you can interrupt it with a stronger move such as 2, 3 and Arc divider? The 3rd hit seems to have a longer animation than the first two. It also does not apply vulnerability stacks. So although it does more damage personally, it has less might/second generation potential. 2. Whenever 2 and 3 and bursts are down, should I be prioritizing keeping endurance low by rolling instead of auto chain? Or should I be saving rolls to dodge attacks instead? 3. Does the damage from Reckless Dodge proc Forceful Greatsword's might generation? How about the sigil of air proc? 3. When should I be using 5? Is the best time to do so if you get knocked back from the boss and need to quickly get back? Or is it better to roll towards the boss instead? 4. I've been told that I should be prioritizing auto chain over arc divider until the boss is under 50% because auto chain stacks might faster. Why? Does Arc Divider not proc Forceful Greatsword? Or is this just saying ""yo if the boss is at 54%, you may want to wait 2 seconds for it to dip to 50 to maximize DPS""? 5. Should I wait for my team to set up combo fields before throwing down banners for blasts? I feel like its better to just set up banners before the fight begins. If the fight is long, and my banner comes off CD, should I throw it down or continue DPSing? What if I'm in berserk? 6. If most of my skills are down, is picking up Banner of Discipline and using 2 worth my time over auto attacks? 7. How many arc dividers should I expect to get out of a single beserk with no quickness? With quickness and a competent Chrono? 8. What percent damage increase will running Scholars be compared to Strength runes? Wouldn't you lose a ton of might stacks by using scholars? thanks!"

These can be fixed anytime. &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ &gt;**Link to imgur album with all the Corruption updates: URL &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ &gt;This one is focused on Corruption specialization  likely one of the most important specializations, if the rumours are true and the next Elite Specialization will offer some support for Condition playstyle. **Why does it need an update?** Because it has: &gt;* *Outdated Traits* - Many traits in Corruption were meant to work with the first version of Mallyx, which got removed for BWE3. Holding conditions on yourself for damage modifier, healing per condition but with added ICD are just examples. They are leftovers of the old systems that are no longer in place. &gt;* *Blatantly underpowered traits* - Traits like Maniacal Persistence which sounded and were useless even before Specialization update and now nobody would ever think about touching them with a stick. &gt;* *Abundance of passive procs* - Half of the traits are completly passive and dont affect your gameplay. The procs are not even remotely controllable or fun. &gt;* *Mandatory traits* - Demonic Defiance. Thats the single reason why PvP Mallyx builds would even go for that specialization. Situation looks similar in other tiers  theres always a superior trait. &gt;* *No flavour* - The traits are mundane and uninteresting. Rather than picking a trait that synergizes with your build you pick the one thats the least terrible or even works at all, because others are bugged. Traits add nothing to the theme of playing condition Revenant besides edgy names and dont make you feel any more powerful. &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ &gt;I wont be going into Mallyx reworks, at least for now, just touch on few things before I move on to traits: &gt;* **Banish Enchantment** -Currently it is a piercing beam in between caster and selected target. To get maximum effectiveness out of it, you have to target the furthest target in line. I would love this skill to fire a beam that pierces in line regardless of chosen target, because this removes the unncessessary target swapping and fighting UI. &gt;* **Resistance on Mallyx**  I would like to see Demonic Defiance trait removed and Pain Absorption to be changed. Currently PA is problematic because in solo situations the Resistance uptime it provides is minimal and requires heavy boon duration investment while with allies around the Resistance uptime from this skill alone is too much. Find a middle ground for this skill. Possibly 4-5 seconds Resistance and bonus 0,25-0,5s Resistance per condition from ally? If Demonic Defiance (the must-have trait in tier) was removed as well, we could get some baseline Resistance on Legendary Demons heal and maybe on something else. &gt;* **Echoing Eruption**  This skill, while great, faces some really annoying bugs when it randomly changes direction. Sometimes you would like to blast in other direction than targets, too. To combat this, I strongly suggest this ability to be a skillshot. &gt;* **PvE Damage and Condition Revenant**  The suggested traits reflect my view on this problem. To explain it in simple way, I believe the way the way to make Condition Revenant damage viable in current PvE where NPCs are mostly static is not to add PvE-specific (?) traits that make Torment work like Burning or Bleeding, but to focus on **the dichotomy of Burning and Torment** present in Revenants kit. If foe is moving, increased Torment damage compensates for the loss in Burning damage. If foe is not moving, increased Burning damage compensates for the loss in Torment damage. The way re-worked Diabolic Inferno trait works supports this vision while not affecting rotation. Core Mace kit brings us triple Blast Finisher on low cooldown and a combo field, giving synergy in here. &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ &gt;Now on to traits. **I strongly suggest** to open [the Corruption album](URL in another window/on another screen to have a clue what I'm talking about. In order: &gt;* **Rampant Vex**  *Adept Minor.* Unchanged. Classic critical strike trait, almost every profession has one of these. &gt;* **Defy Nature**  *Adept Major.* Replacing Replenishing Despair. This trait gives you a corrupted effect of every Legend on heal  the opposite of its core theme and gameplay. I thought it would be a fun idea and I think it turned out decent. Has strong potential in pretty much all builds, especially some hybrids. Legendary Demons heal is also a Blast Finisher, to fully synergize with further traits in line. &gt;* **Demonic Defiance**  *Adept Major.* Changed. I took the idea of Boss characters resistance from Guild Wars 1 and mixed it with Mallyxs theme. I think it would be very solid defensive trait and an amazing synergy with Pain Absorption. &gt;* **Spontaneus Destruction**  *Adept Major.* Replacing Venom Enhancement. Strong trait for all game modes and competitor in the tier. An alternative to Defy Nature in some PvE encounters. &gt;* **Opportune Extraction**  *Master Minor.* Changed. This trait now requires a boon to be present in order to trigger. &gt;* **Toxic Shock**  *Master Major.* Replacing Bolstered Anguish. A playstyle-defining trait, one of the ones Im the most proud of. Heavily affects the optimal way you use skills if picked and would often require you to change your rotation on the go. Im not sure if it should be single or multiple target skill, so I left this bit out. &gt;* **Bonds of Torment**  *Master Major.* Replacing Frigid Precision. Named after one of the skills used by bosses in Realm of Torment in Guild Wars 1. Powerful trait that makes thriving in melee range easier and works well with some other traits due to recharging boon removal on demand. Prioritizes player characters over anything else. &gt;* **Consume Torment**  *Master Major.* Replacing Spontaneous Destruction. The crit trait for crit specialization, insane when working together with the new Spontaneus Destruction. Very similar to Decimate Defenses in Reaper Specialization, but because Torment is harder to come by than Vulnerability, increasing crit chance more per stack. &gt;* **Yearning Empowerment**  *Grandmaster Minor*. Changed. Similar traits on other professions are a bit strongers than just duration increase, so to go with the theme of the name, I added a bit of conditional Might. &gt;* **Diabolic Inferno**  *Grandmaster Major.* Changed. Now its the core of the PvE Mace playstyle, working decently in other game modes as well. Idea behind this trait is to compensate for times when Torment works at half the potential and play into Revenants kit. Adds more thought and value into Blast Finishers. &gt;* **Bolstered Anguish**  *Grandmaster Major.* Replacing Maniacal Persistence. This simple trait plays well into Mallyxs tools, works great with Demonic Defiance and gives new life to two odd old traits that were leftovers of Beta Mallyx  Replenishing Despair and Bolstered Anguish. &gt;* **Demonic Possession**  *Grandmaster Major.* Replacing Pulsating Pestilience. Final piece if you want to be the horror of builds that spam a lot of boons. Your boons are now my boons. All stolen boons would be normalized so no stealing 10 Stability stacks or 25 Might at once. Still extremaly useful. I was thinking about moving the Opportune Extraction recharge part of the Bonds of Torment trait to this trait, but left it there for now. &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ &gt;All tooltips created thanks to [that_shamans tooltip builder tool](URL I appreciate all feedback. &gt;Thanks for reading.

192,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Basic Revenant PvE Guide,130,6bb4fu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6bb4fu/basic_revenant_pve_guide/,2017-05-16 01:41:00,"* Updated for May 2017 balance patch &amp;nbsp; There aren't a lot of written guides floating around and the class has gotten some really bad press recently, so I guess it is a good time to have one. &amp;nbsp; # So What is a Revenant? &amp;nbsp; Revenant is a hybrid jack-of-all-trades master-of-none brawler/utility class. It is not a class that can do almost everything (Engineer), or do many somewhat-related things at the same time (Elementalist), or even do something particularly well (Warrior), but it can do some important things to a degree. What you can expect from the class are: respectable sustained [DPS](URL good armor and health, multiple strong [CCs](URL with short cooldowns, simple and reactive gameplay and easy provision of [boons](URL and various utilities for you and your party. Although multiple nerfs have made the class fallen out of favor in Raids, and the class has downsides with low peak DPS, fixed stance skills, lack of build varieties, weakness to [condition damages](URL mediocre heals and slow skill activations, a Revenant can still be quite fun if you like its unique style, and can shine in less-than-optimally organized parties. &amp;nbsp; # Stances and Energy &amp;nbsp; Revenant has two unique class mechanics: stances and energy. The class gets versatility due to having several interchangeable stances that provide different utilities and playstyles. Energy management is a very important aspect since all Revenant skills require energy to use in addition to cooldowns. These two mechanics makes the class quite different to play from others. You may think this can make it difficult to play, however, in practice Revenant is fairly easy to run in general PvE with simple skill rotations, good survivality, and generally forgiving gameplay. Base Revenant gets four stances or legends: Shiro, Ventari, Jalis and Mallyx. Becoming Herald gives you one more, Glint. You can select two stances from out of all four or five, but you are limited to only Shiro and Mallyx in underwater. You can have only one stance activated at a time. Press F1 to swap stances between chosen two, and there will be a 10 second cooldown afterwards. Each stance skills have their own separate cooldowns, so for example you can use two heals in two stances in a quick succession. Each stance is dedicated to a certain role as it comes with a fixed set of healing, utility and elite skills. Unlike other classes, there isn't any different set of skills you can choose from. One stance has exactly five skills you can use and you can't even put race skills in your elite skill slot, therefore it is very important to pick up appropriate stances before the fight and switch to proper ones as the situation demands. The other important class mechanic is energy, which is similar to a Thief's initiative. All Revenant skills except basic attacks use up different amount of energy. Some skills consume fixed amounts energy as soon as they are used, and other skills are toggles: they are turned on when first activated (which may or may not have activation energy costs), continuously draining energy as upkeep costs. You can turn them off manually, but else they'll be automatically turned off with 4 second cooldowns when your energy runs out. Swapping stances will also toggle off all currently activated skills. Energy is always filled back to 50% when out of combat. During the combat it'll fill up to 100% at the rate of +5% energy per second (+5e/s), if there is no upkeep cost. The current energy consumption rate is displayed next to your stance swap button, and will be shown as graphically like &lt;&lt;&lt; (-3e/s) or &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (+4e/s). Maximum drain is capped at -5e/s, which means you can't have more than -10e/s upkeep cost with +5e/s default recharge rate. Swapping stances resets the energy to 50%. This gives you two choices when you do not have enough energy for a skill: either wait for a few seconds for it to recharge, or change stances. The latter is usually recommended as you get some free energy. This also means that if you want to be highly efficient, you should quickly burn off all your energy with skills, swap legends, burn off energy, and repeat. Swapping stance will also activate runes that activate with weapon swaps, and there are several traits that give additional benefits like stun break, condi cleanse or [AoE](URL damage / heal to stance swaps: more reasons for frequent stance swaps. However, do note that swapping stances as quickly as possible can be very inflexible in reality, if not boringly repetitive. &amp;nbsp; # Stance Skills &amp;nbsp; ### Shiro (Assassin) Shiro gives the class some nice burst damages and dodges, but you get less effective heals. **Enchanted Dagger** heals you by a small amount initially, and your next few attacks will heal you by stealing some health from the target. The effect lasts for a rather long 15 seconds, but initial healing amount is low and the skill is difficult to use since you need to hit enemies several times for noticeable healing. Consider this skill not as a regular heal, but as more of a sustain that you preemptively activate in order to maintain your health level and to increase DPS. The skill can still be used to increase your damage when your health is full. **Phase Traversal** and **Riposting Shadows** are Shiro's two rather expensive movement skills. Phase Traversal works well as a general purpose gap closer with 1200 range, but requires a target, needs a half second activation time and has an annoying 5 second cooldown. On the other hand, Riposting Shadows costs slightly less, does not have a cooldown or need a target. It makes you evade backwards, gain stamina, and removes several movement-imposing conditions as well as stuns. Try to use this skill well: you lack a good heal in this stance and have to avoid taking damage. Use About Face key (look at your keybinds) with Riposting Shadow to quickly dodge forward. **Impossible Odds** gives superspeed and quickness for a 40% DPS increase. As a toggle skill it can be freely turned on and off, but don't do that often since it has 10 energy startup cost and -10e/s upkeep cost. Use it when you have enough energy to burn for a while or otherwise the startup cost becomes a waste. On the flip side, the high cost makes it easier to quickly burn off all remaining energy before swapping stances. If your goal is maximizing DPS, you should not use any other skills during Impossible Odds since you'll want to dedicate all energy to its quickness. You'll want to use Vengeful Hammers (Jalis) for DPS instead if you have a mesmer in your party, as he or she can give a good amount of quickness to you. Outside of combat, the skill is still useful for speeding up other activities, like opening chests or gathering resources. Finally, the elite skill is **Jade Wind**. While briefly freezing five enemies around you can be a lifesaver, this comes with a significant activation time and a hefty 50 energy cost that you could've use elsewhere. One interesting use I can think of is underwater boss fights in Underwater fractal and Honor of Waves P2 and P3, where two successive use of Jade Wind can remove most of the bosses' [breakbar]( URL and freeze trash mobs around it, but you'll have to stay in Shiro to keep doing that. &amp;nbsp; ### Jalis (Dwarf) Jalis is the stark opposite of Shiro as it focuses on reducing incoming damages, and with some damage reduction skills you can take quite some abuse. **Soothing Stone** is the only plain normal self-healing skill of Revenant, which also removes three conditions as well. You may want to slot and use Jalis if you want to have a plain normal heal. Use other stance's heal for more peculiar situations. **Inspiring Reinforcement^B** is Revenant's only active skill that provides stability. It has its obvious uses for not getting knocked back, especially if you are running to somewhere, but it is not a very good one. The skill is quite slow to activate and you'll have to stay on the narrow brick road to keep receiving stability. Furthermore, it has a very annoying problem that exists in many other Revenant skills: the skill can fail when you are standing on a steep incline. This has been noted by many players before the class was released, but sadly the bug has not been completely fixed. From now on I'll use **^B** to denote skills with the bug as there are many. **Forced Engagement** slows and taunts the targeted enemy. It has a short cooldown, but expensive in terms of energy, and taunt in PvE is a niche skill with limited applications. If you want to pull something you can usually use your ranged weapons. The skill can be used if you don't have one, or the target is too squishy (pulling holograms for Clockheart in Twilight Arbor Aetherpath). Otherwise it is more useful as a last ditch CC. **Vengeful Hammers^B** is another toggle skill, which reduces all physical and condition damages applied to you by 20% and generates two hammers that spins around you to hit enemies for some damage and healing. This gets more effective when you are inside a large group of mobs as hammers can easily hit multiple enemies nearby, giving you more damage and heals. While the damages aren't that spectacular, you can run it for fairly long so you may want to keep this skill on when you are in Jalis and taking hits. Again, this skill is bugged like Inspiring Reinforcement and often bugs out or automatically gets turned off when used on an uneven terrain. Hammers will disappear when they hit the ground, and the skill will drain energy but will stop working when the hammers are gone. The skill has additional problem as it fails in the same way when used near a wall or invulnerable enemies, and moving toward one of these can also break it. Narrow corridors can make the skill practically useless, so keep an eye on your hammers. The elite skill, **Rite of the Great Dwarf** reduces all physical damage for you and 4 nearby players by half for 5 seconds and breaks stun. Expensive for a stun break, but if you can afford it, the skill is a good way to brace your party for hard-to-dodge big attacks (something like what Icebrood Troll does in Honor of the Waves P1). Note that it does not reduce condition damages unlike Vengeful Hammers, but you may use Versed in Stone (Retribution) trait for condi defense. You can use Vengeful Hammers and/or Facet of Chaos (Herald), One with Nature (Herald) or Envoy of Exuberance (Shield) with this skill for even more damage reduction, but their effect is multiplicative and not additive when used together. (e.g. using both VH and RotGD is not 20% + 50% = 70% reduction, but 1 - (1 - 20%) * (1 - 50%) = 60% reduction) &amp;nbsp; ### Ventari (Centaur) Ventari is a party-wide healing stance, where you can summon a tablet and heal people around it. Swapping to Ventari automatically summons the tablet at your feet which can be moved with **Ventari's Will** skill. It will heal allies in its path while moving. If you move too far away from the tablet, it will be unsummoned and you will have to get it back manually with **Project Tranquility**, which once again puts the tablet at your feet. Once summoned, the tablet will pulse small heals for those near the tablet and will allow you to use other Ventari skills. These skills are fairly straightforward: use **Natural Harmony** for more healing, **Purifying Essence** for condition cleanse, and **Protective Solace** for generating a dome-shaped shield (you can blast it for condi cleanse as it is a light field) around the tablet to block incoming projectiles. **Energy Expulsion** destroys the tablet for some knockback effects. The problem of Ventari healer is that, while the healing amount is decent, the tablet's radius is limited and it isn't just agile enough. You can move it with Ventari's Will, but that will cost you 5 energy in addition to a 3 second cooldown. Eventually you'll get to know that a lot of things can happen in 3 seconds, which makes a not very mobile source of healing not very useful. Then there's the fundamental problem of a healer being not that useful in this game. You first and foremost dodge, block, or mitigate damage in this game, therefore healers are less needed unless in a more difficult contents. High tier fractals and Raids are the exception as enemies can hit you very hard and quick, but fractals don't really need one if you are good enough, and while Raids definitely require a healer, such highly organized instance is not where a Revenant is good at. Arenanet tried to change Ventari few times because of this. Due to a recent patch, Natural Harmony can now give alacrity with Salvation trait line selected, and alacrity is a very strong buff which reduces skill cooldowns by 33%. However, alacrity is mostly useless for Revenant him or herself since skills are normally limited by energy costs, not cooldowns, and mesmers already can hand out more alacrity. Probably the only saving grace of Ventari in general PvE is Protective Solace. This can be extremely helpful in some stationary, projectile heavy environments as you can easily put up your shield for more than 15 seconds at 50% energy level. Applications include veteran Bristlebacks, rocket turrets in Caudecus's Manor P3 where you can deploy shield and revive downed party members, Jotun Stargazer in Arah P1, Dredge APC in Sorrow's Embrace P3, multiple sections in Uncategorized fractal, and many more. Slotting Ventari temporarily for such occasions can be critical for your party's survival, but on the other hand, not all projectiles are blockable, and having a competent Mesmer with Feedback or a Guardian with Wall of Reflection in your party may be enough for the job. Still, feel free to experiment with Protective Solace as Revenant is more of 'filling a gap for your party' class and you can always adapt to the situation. &amp;nbsp; ### Mallyx (Demon) The legendary demon stance is designed to be used in conjunction with a mace and a condition build. **Empowering Misery** heals you slightly less than Jalis's soothing stones, but that can change if you have several conditions on you. **Pain Absorption** pulls conditions from your allies and gives you and your party a short condition resistance, while also acting as a stun breaker. If your party members have trouble surviving condition damages this can help a lot, and you can use it for condi-heavy fights like Thumanova fractal boss, Mai Trin fractal or Migraine Eir if needed. Use Facet of Nature (Glint) to get longer resistances. **Banish Enchantment** works as a boon stripper, which has very limited uses in PvE and **Unyielding Anguish** is a leap skill with AoE condition damage. Lastly, **Embrace Darkness** is an interesting one which you can turn on for self buffing, pulsing condi AoE and ignoring blind condition effects on you. A resistance to blind is bit too specific to use but since energy consumption isn't that high you can rather freely turn it on for buffs and damages. Due to a recent buff Mallyx became fairly competent in dealing condition damages and it can be used offensive or defensivey. When used offensively, one thing to note is that Revenant's most condition skills give torment, which does only 50% damage when the target is stationary. The problem here is that most mobs in Guild Wars 2 are too lazy to move, except for some new ones introduced with Living Season 3. Otherwise, this stance can be briefly used defensively without condition builds for getting condition resistances with Pain Absorption. However, no skill in this stance removes any conditions at all. Pain Absorption gives you resistances, but you'll immediately take all condition effects and damages that's currently stacked on you as soon as they expire. Revenant is highly susceptible to condition damages by design, so be careful about what conditions you have and react accordingly. &amp;nbsp; ### Glint (Dragon) Unlocking the elite specialization allows you to use Glint. This the most important, go-to stance for a Revenant, and you should get it as soon as possible. All other stances are highly specialized and rather limited in their scopes, but Glint can work in many situations with its balanced set of skills. It also opens up a whole new game of maintaining energy consumption and boons for you and your party. Other benefits include a shining disco plate on your feet and occasional creepy music, which fortunately can be heard only by your character. All Glint's skills are toggle skills. These skills will be toggled on when first used, and will constantly pulse boons to you and your party, draining the energy at a fixed rate. If you use the skill again, it will be consumed, which have some other effects and will be put on a long cooldown. Alternatively, you can simply turn on all the other skills and let the energy quickly run out to turn them all off with shorter 4 seconds global cooldowns. For healing, **Facet of Light** provides a small trickling amount of regeneration to you and your party. When used again as **Infuse Light**, it will turn all your incoming damages into healing for 3 seconds, akin to a warrior's Defiant Stance. This is a very good way to quickly restore your health, survive huge attacks, or even running through some insta-down gimmicks like Aetherblade fractal's electric floor. You can simply use it and quickly stand on an impending doom of red circles to fully recover your health, but swap to other stance and use something like Soothing Stones when there is a clear lack of red circles. Just save the Facet of Light for the appropriate moment if you can, and do not use protection or other damage reduction with Infuse Light as reduced damage means reduced healing. **Facet of Strength** pulses several stacks of might to you and your party. Using it again delivers some good damage and a full stack of 25 vulnerability to enemies in front of you. Vulnerability is not usually in a short supply, but sometimes you may want to turn the skill off in that way to reduce energy consumption. **Facet of Darkness** grants fury, and consuming it will reveal invisible enemies near you and break stuns. You don't get a lot of invisible enemies in PvE, and you should refrain from frequently consuming it for stun breaks as maintaining fury can be important for your party for damage increase. **Facet of Elements** pulses swiftness, a nice 33% increase in movement speed to you and your party. This is another reason you'll want to keep using Glint. Turn it on whenever you have to move from location to location. You can consume it as **Elemental Blast**, a weak CC and condition AoE when you do not need mobility. The elite skill, **Facet of Chaos**, grants a solid 33% damage reduction for you and your party. This skill uses up energy quickly (-5e/s isn't really that high, but you'll likely to have other facets draining energy at the same time). Helpful for surviving tricky situations, and this can turned on when stunned. It acts as a slow but strong CC when consumed as **Chaotic Release^B**, but this comes with a long 45 second cooldown. Finally, **Facet of Nature** is another skill that comes with the elite specialization, but this skill works separately from stances. Press F2 to extend durations of current outgoing boons of you and nearby players by 33% (does not work for already applied ones). The skill is helpful in cases like an Elementalist is stacking might for your party, or a Mesmer in your party is trying to provide quickness, and you should keep it running for them; just swap stances before your energy completely runs out so that the Facet don't get turned off. If that is not the case, you can turn this on briefly before combat to slightly extend your own boons, and then consume it for additional source of regen, might, fury, swiftness and protection. Afterwards, you can continuously consume it for more boons without energy loss. This is useful when you have to stay out of Glint for a while and unable to supply boons to your party. With Glint available, you're set for the general boon-supplying gameplay of a Revenant. You can freely apply these boons to you (and your party, if there is one) as the situation demands. You'll want to get swiftness while travelling; swiftness and protection for skipping trash mobs in dungeons; fury and swiftness for short, easy encounters; might, fury and regeneration in stationary challenging fight, and any other combinations that situation demands. For an example, if your party have 4 PS Warriors, you certainly don't need to supply might. Ideally you'll want as many boons as possible for a maximum effort, say, in a party full of Necromancers, but you cannot turn all Facets on at once due to the -10e/s upkeep cost limit. For instance you cannot use Impossible Odds (-10e/s) and Facet of Nature (-2e/s) at the same time. You won't even able to consume the facet while using Impossible Odds as you won't be able to turn it on in the first place. Such limitation is important in Glint where all skills require upkeep energy costs. Remember the numbers: regen (-1e/s), might (-2e/s), fury (-2e/s), swiftness (-1e/s), protection (-5e/s) and boon duration (-2e/s). Since your energy will be recharged at the rate of +5e/s, using regen, might, fury costs -5e/s and will stop your energy from increasing or decreasing. You may want to apply boons at maximum upkeep cost of -10e/s using something like regen, might, fury and protection, and your energy will be dropping at the rate of -5e/s. That way you'll run out of 50 energy in 10 seconds, and you can stance swap every 10 seconds to get more 50 energy. Burn off energy in that stance and be back to Glint before, preferably, your boons expire. That is the maximum boons you can maintain for your party, although you should also consider that this will leave little excess energy for other skills, making the gameplay very inflexible. You won't be able to use CCs or stun breaks in a timely manner when your energy is on a very tight budget, which can make the gameplay quite difficult. This is no longer the case if you have another Revenant in your party. Same Facets from different Revenants do not stack, in a way that two Revenant with Facet of Strength each activated will not give them twice the amount of might. You may want to discuss with him or her about who will maintain which one for optimal gameplay, although optimization wasn't high on the priorities list if you managed to get another Revenant in your party in the first place. Still, with some coordination two Revenants can maintain something like permanent projectile block by alternating Protective Solace (Ventari), although its utility might be limited. A small last tidbit about Glint is that you'll often want to activate multiple boons at once as soon as you swap to it, which requires pressing multiple keys at once. Change the keybinds so that you can comfortably do this. Personally I use ESDF movement and 12345WZXCV skill keys setup, but you might want something different. Also, many keyboards do not support pressing multiple keys very well, and you may have to try pressing keys in a peculiar sequence. Don't fret as you'll have plenty of chances for practicing, especially if you have to go underwater a lot. &amp;nbsp; # Weapon Skills &amp;nbsp; ### Sword A good mainhand weapon with high damage autoattack chain. I recommend always having one equipped. **Precision Strikes** let loose several short-ranged homing projectiles. The projectiles applies some chill and this skill can be used to hit targets just outside of melee range, but its projectiles have very interesting target priorities. Use it inside a mob to prevent them from flying all over the place. Ideally you could continuously use it on cooldown for DPS increase, but it should be done without interrupting auttoatack chain. **Unrelenting Assault** makes you shadowstep around the target while attacking and gain some might. Again, the problem is that it can be unreliable. If there are multiple enemies, you will be hitting them in a seemingly random order and it can even hit harmless critters instead of enemies. Furthermore, the skill actually moves your character around during the process, which makes it possible to place you at undesirable locations, like a brightly burning pool of lava when the skill ends, or end abruptly if you hit an obstacle during the movement. With its low damage and unpredictability, Unrelenting Assault becomes more of an evasion skill. Use it if some boss mob is about to hit you with a huge attack or if you need some breathing room out of hostile AoEs, but beware of the 3/4 second activation delay. You can cast Enchanted Dagger (Shiro) beforehand for some bit of quick, safe healing. Sword can be also equipped in offhand as a utility weapon, which is more or less effective for single difficult boss mob. **Duelist's Preparation** is a solid 2 second blocking skill that allows you to move around while doing so. The skill has a follow-up for immobilize, but you'll be hard pressed to find an use for such skill combo in PvE. **Grasping shadows** stabs the target and shadowstep back with the target in tow. Again, it is unlikely that you want to pull one mob out of a group, but you can still use this as a hard CC and a dodge. &amp;nbsp; ### Mace A condition damage mainhand weapon with torment, poison and burning damage built in. This is a weapon used for condi DPS alongside Mallyx stance, although you should always keep in mind that torment applies only 1/2 damage when the target is stationary. If you can make it move, always do so, but it won't be easy to make it more effective as then your target can move out of your condi field. Its second skill, **Searing Fissure^B**, lays down a fire field, and **Echoing Eruption** applies torment with a blast finisher. As both skills have low cooldown and low energy cost, a Revenant with mace can make several, quick AOE attack combos that can be quite fun to use: even simply spamming 2 and 3 will give you a decent amount of might, but like in the case of sword try not interrupt your autoattack chain for DPS. &amp;nbsp; ### Axe The Axe is a good offhand weapon that works well against multiple trash mobs, and you'll want this weapon equipped for most of times. **Frigid Blitz^B** throws the axe at the target and shadowstep through it when it hits. While it has some activation delay, this acts as a great gap closer, and also as a quick way to get behind of a big enemy. The skill fails if the axe misses, or the target moves out of the range after you throw the axe. You also apply short slow and chills to multiple enemies you teleport through. Use Precision Strike (Sword) or Elemental Blast (Glint) shortly afterwards for stacking more chill on the target, as a way of quickly intercepting and slowing it down. **Temporal Rift^B** generates a gap on the ground and pulls nearby enemies toward it. A nice fight opener to gather mobs in one place so that your attack will hit them all, if you can aim it well. Additionally, since they will form a straight line over the gap, you can quickly target the furthermost enemy on it and use Frigid Blitz to dash through, applying chill and damage to all of them. Revenant has several other skills that hits multiple enemies on a straight line, such as Searing Fissure (Mace), Surge of Mists (Staff) and Coalescence of Ruin (Hammer), so consider using them with this skill. Also works as a hard CC and quick interrupt. &amp;nbsp; ### Shield Only available after you become a Herald. As you can expect this comes with two defensive skills. **Envoy of Exuberance** has a weak AOE heal and short protection that can help you and your friends, and **Crystal Hibernation** has a 3 second block with a weak self heal. Compared to Duelist's Preparations (Sword), Crystal Hibernation provides some heals, and has longer block duration with longer cooldown but moving will cancel the skill, making it bit clunky to use. Overall, shield has its apparent uses if you want more defensive options, but since all skills require energy you'll probably not use it very frequently. &amp;nbsp; ### Staff A great utility weapon. Use it with main hand sword and swap to staff whenever needed, but always be quick to swap back to sword for DPS. Its autoattack chain is unique in that it drops healing orbs at the end of it, but doesn't hit hard enough. **Punishing Sweep** is a gateway to **Debilitating Slam** for dazing up to three enemies. In theory this is another hard CC in a Revenant's arsenal, but you can only use Debilitating Slam when Punishing Sweep hits an enemy that is using a skill at the moment. This is very hard to do in PvE as you often have no idea about what is considered as a skill for NPCs. Since you can use more effective Surge of the Mists with the same energy cost and less hassle, you'll probably not use it very often. **Warding Rift** is a block with blinding up to 3 enemies. You'll probably not switch to staff for this skill, but it can help negating damages if you have the staff out at the moment. **Renewing Wave** is a small heal and condi cleanse skill. You may want to have it ready for several occasions since Revenant is quite limited in condition removal. This can also heal and cleanse your party members, and can be used while on move. A Revenant has several hard CC options, but **Surge of the Mists** is doubtlessly the strongest and the most important among them. The skill makes you dash through the target, hitting it multiple times for damage and knockback CC. In many instances you'll equip staff solely for this skill as it is often enough to destroy the entire breakbar of a dungeon or fractal boss. Not all of them, though. Some like Aldus Stormbringer in Honor of the Waves P1 are completely immune to knockback effects, probably due to some developer oversight. Still, with this skill and all the other CCs you get, it is easy to keep demolishing breakbars by yourself. This can make some boss fight much easier if you are in an inexperienced group. Apart from CC, use the skill to push away enemies or stuffs like bombs in Auric Basin south gate, to evade attacks or to move slightly faster. Beware that the skill can hit only partially if you are too far away, or even miss entirely if the target moves away. Also, it can be an embarrassing way of falling to your death when used toward a cliff. &amp;nbsp; ### Hammer The only ranged weapon Revenant gets. Its default attack is slow, but can hit multiple enemies in a row and hits harder than most other classes' ranged weapons. Auttoattack DPS isn't that high, but it is a 100% guaranteed projectile finisher, while other weapons' AA usually have only a 25% chance to do so. **Coalescence of Ruin^B** is a AoE attack that hits several targets in a 3-part line. The farthest section of this line hits hardest, so if you are able to maintain your distance this will be actually a DPS increase. Since this is not a projectile attack and has a short cooldown, it can be spammed to kill enemies with projectile reflects or blocks like Jade Colossi in Solid Ocean fractal. Usually don't work against enemies over a large gap. **Phase Smash^B** is a ranged AoE with chills. Although your camera stays still, the skill will actually move your character to hit enemies and move you back when it ends. This works as a decent evasion, and a way to briefly reach some spots. May kill you if you try to use skill through something bad like fire shields that protect archers in Twilight Arbor dungeon. **Field of the Mists^B** generates a small wall for projectile absorption in the front of you. The wall is fixed at your character's front and will move or turn with your character's movement, so you have to directly face the threat to properly utilize it. Can be used for self healing as the wall acts as a dark field and your hammer autoattack passing through it will steal a little bit of health for you. Use Impossible Odds (Shiro) for quicker lifestealing. **Drop the Hammer** is another hard CC, but this time it is an ranged AoE one. Beware of a very long activation time which often makes the skill miss, and always try to anticipate the enemy's movement. &amp;nbsp; ### Spear Nothing much to say about the sole underwater weapon, but there are two skills viable for default autoattack: **Spear of Anguish** for ranged, and **Rapid Assault** for melee. If you are using action camera, I recommend setting the latter to autoattack so that you can simply hold left mouse button for the ranged attack and tap 2 when you are in a melee range. &amp;nbsp; # Traits and Builds &amp;nbsp; As of May 2017, PVE Revenant can use either power or condi DPS/support builds: power is easier to gear up but has lower damage, while condi is harder to set up but has more damage in the long run. I recommend using either [power dps](URL or [condi dps](URL build for general PvE. Whichever build you use, occasional changes in weapons and stances will carry you through most PVE situations. Be it doing dailies, guild races, resource gathering, open world meta events, soloing champs, dungeons, fractals and maybe even raids, there aren't a lot of need for changing traits. All revenant traits are tied to stances, so there aren't a lot of wiggle rooms. Still, some important traits here include Assassin's Presence (Devastation), an important party buff that only a Revenant can maintain, and Rolling Mists (Invocation) that can easily push up your critical chance over 80% with Facet of Darkness (Glint) and a full berserker gear. If you have trouble surviving, you can use Invigorating Flow (Invocation) and Assassin's Annihilation (Devastation) with Vengeful Hammers (Jalis) for some good sustain, but losing Swift Termination (Devastation) is a big loss in DPS. Hardening Persistence (Herald) is another trait that can help as it provides additional toughness per amount of upkeep energy cost you currently have, but you may get unintended aggros. Additionally, you'll give up Radiant Revival (Herald) for it, a very handy trait if your party member goes down in a pool of hostile AoEs. You get a 2 second Infuse Light when you start reviving allies, so you can comfortably jump in. Empty Vessel (Invocation) and Cleansing Channel (Invocation) are for easily available stun break / condition cleanse with stance swaps, and having them on a 10 second cooldown can be very, very useful. You should use berserker runes for condi builds, but you do have some options for armor runes in a power build. Superior Rune of Scholar is ever popular among most classes due to its 10% damage bonus when your health is over 90%, however, maintaining that health level can be a challenge when you do not have a healer around. Superior Rune of Strength can be helpful in a much less organized fights, as you get more might generated by yourself. Superior Rune of Hoelbrak is a budget alternative to that, where you get slightly less might duration and 20% shorter condition effect on you instead of 5% damage boost from might. Finally, Superior Rune of Rage is a very cheap but good option with benefit of extending fury duration and making Facet of Darkness a more readily available, additional stun break. &amp;nbsp; # So what do you do as a revenant? Playing a Revenant shouldn't be that hard since it does not have offensive DPS rotations: all skills other than autoattack have their specific uses and energy costs so they shouldn't be spammed. This means that while your DPS is low, you can easily maintain it for long even when under pressure - you use weapon skills when situation demands and you have enough energy, otherwise just autoattack. Remember to supply boons with Glint if needed, and you're all set. Probably what most new players have trouble with when playing a new class is staying alive. You may need some adjustment phase since while Revenant has decent health and armor, its heals are rather mediocre. You get to use two, but most of them are highly situational and less effective compared to other classes' heals. Altering builds and gears helps a lot in this regard, but in fact a Revenant can be fairly resilient in a full DPS spec if you get the hang of it: evade, block, stun break, apply protection, liberal use of CC, and use Infuse Light (Glint) effectively. You don't have complex DPS rotations, so pay attention to enemies instead, use your dodges and blocks effectively and interrupt when they are preparing big attacks. Know which attacks hits you hard enough and use Infuse Light in a timely manner to quickly heal yourself back to the full health. Do not waste it, or you will die in difficult encounters. Also, try to adapt to the situation by swapping stances and weapons. I've already mentioned that you should get Glint ASAP, as you'll use other stances in combination with it. For power builds you'll use Glint/Shiro or Glint/Jalis. Glint/Shiro works well for quickly clearing easy contents or fighting harder, small group of mobs where you can constantly dodge around and switch melee and ranged weapons on the fly, but you should be wary about taking damage as your two heals are tricky to use. Maintain protection and position yourself well outside of a harm's way. Alternatively, Use Glint/Jalis for easier brawling, where you will constantly applying Facet of Chaos, Vengeful Hammers and Rite of the Great Dwarf to reduce incoming damage. As Soothing Stoneand Vengeful Hammers are competent heals you'll feel more comfortable in taking hits. With proper builds you can facetank some bosses with Jalis, however, bear in mind that damage reduction works only to an extent. When enemies are hitting you hard enough, they will kill you regardless. Mallyx and Ventari can be briefly used against condi/projectile defenses, but in most cases, Glint/Jalis has protection and damage reduction skills for not dying. On the other hand, you'll likely to use something like Glint/Mallyx or Jalis/Mallyx in condi builds. Jalis/Mallyx is a full DPS spec which can give max damage when your party can support you, but otherwise Glint/Mallyx will be easier to use due to Glint's boons. Again, Glint/Jalis isn't too bad in condi build you have trouble surviving. Also, consider swapping out weapons at that too. For power, Sword/Axe combo provide decent DPS, evasion, CC and utility in one package, and works well in general PvE situations. Sword/Sword looks cool, but is mostly useful for something like a big boss fight, although S/A still works well in that situation. S/Shield helps when you have trouble not dying, but energy cost is a bit of problem there. For condi, use mace instead of sword. For a backup weapon, use a hammer if you absolutely have to range, otherwise get a staff for its amazing CC. Always look for the teal bar under the boss mob's health bar. If other players can destroy it quickly, that's great, but if they cannot...a Revenant can have up to 4 hard CCs and several more soft CCs readily available depending on the build, so use them well. In the end, always try to have some fun in this class. It is not as good as other classes in certain roles as peoples say, but a Revenant is versatile and unique one that you may grow fond of. I certainly love [mine](URL Even if you do not like the playstyle, a Revenant is still quite useful for gathering flax or winterberries and holding unused items while standing forever lonely at Lion's Arch. And who knows what kind of fun the upcoming expansion will have for Revenants... :-)"

It just has massive utility and good group buffs, the rotation feels exciting and engaging. But it's not a high dps class, and you really don't want more than one in a dungeon or fractal. If I'm looking at the fractal LFG tool and see the group already has a mesmer, I just have to skip over that one. I've got 4 other level 80 characters, (thief,engineer, elementalist, guardian), and I haven't used my level 80 boost from HoT yet. I'm in the process of crafting ascended armor for my mesmer, I'm half way there so I know it's a big investment. I want to have a second character to play when the mesmer isn't needed and you need more damage. Ideally it's be someone who can mostly take care of keeping themselves alive and help others if needed as you don't always get fully organized groups. I remember playing Engineer awhile ago where you'd have rifle, flamethrower, grenade, and elixir gun and you'd just go through those using the high damage skills off cooldown. All the skills were focused on damage, but it had some utility with might stacking, vulnerability, and the elixir gun tool-belt skill had a stun breaker. Today's engineer builds don't seem to include an elixir gun, so you lose out on the stun breaker. I'm beginning to ramble, but maybe using the level 80 boost on a Ranger to make a druid would be good too?"
195,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Beginner's Guide to Mesmer Weapons: Which one is best for you?,3,6244aa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6244aa/beginners_guide_to_mesmer_weapons_which_one_is/,2017-03-29 13:56:20,"Let's start off with a disclaimer: I am by no means an expert in the ways of mesmer. But I have learned a lot while playing mine, and I want to share my thoughts on an aspect I feel get overlooked in a lot of guides: general philosophies for the various weapons this class can use. This is meant to supplement, not replace, existing guides for leveling a mesmer, as I focus specifically on weapons here and little else. I also reserve the right to be wrong about some things, and I welcome opinions and corrections in the comments. This is my first time writing a guide like this, so I'm prepared for a few hiccups. Some general advice to begin with: As this guide is geared toward leveling rather than endgame, I won't be trying to declare a ""best weapon"". For the wide majority of Core Tyria, the build your using is not nearly as impactful as how well you can use it. That means, find a weapon set you're comfortable with. Hopefully this guide can help you figure out which weapons suit your playstyle the best, rather than just parroting the current ""meta"". Don't stress, experiment. And above all, have fun. So without further ado, let's get into it. **Two Handed--** Two handed weapons generally emphasize range or AoE. It won't fit every situation, but I recommend carrying one with you as an option for when you need it. (Greatsword if you're playing Power, Staff if you're playing Condi). ~~~~~~~ Weapon: Staff Uses: Condi + Boons + RNG Notes: The staff mesmer is an agent of chaos, and I don't just mean the trait line. It's one of the most prominent examples of chance among weapons in GW2. This is how it works: your auto attack will bounce between any nearby targets, be they enemies, allies, or you, and is not afraid to hit the same target more than once. Any time it hits you or an ally, it grants a random boon. Any time it hits an enemy, they get smacked with a random condition. That condition they might be a minor inconvenience like a cripple or vulnerability, or it might stack on the damage with bleeds and burns. You and allies will get stuff like might or fury. The effects are not pronounced enough for you to curse the RNG too much, especially since you'll be getting several chances per second to get the one you want. The other skills do much the same thing: the 5 skill makes a AoE field that pulses random effects like the auto. The 4 skill gives you an aura version of the same. The 2 skill is an excellent mobility tool that also supplies clones which, you guessed it, cast even more chaos. The 2 skill can even be combo'ed with the field from the 5 skill to become another source of the aura version, just in case the 4 skill wasn't enough for you. Finally, the 3 skill is what ties it all together. With all this chaos flying around, your enemy is bound to have quite a few conditions on them before long. That's where the 3 skill comes in, summoning a phantasm that does extra damage based on how many conditions its target currently has! This weapon is great in a group context, where there's plenty to bounce on and fit in an AoE, though you'll need a single, beefy target to get the most use out of the phantasm. Note: While the boons and conditions from staff skills are random, they're drawn from a short list unique to each skill, so you can't actually get something like protection from your auto, for example. To avoid bloating this section, I'll put an appendix at the bottom. ~~~~~~~ Weapon: Greatsword Uses: Ranged Power + CC Notes: Take that, Revenants, because the mesmer has been using heavy melee weapons in decidedly non-melee ways since before it was cool. This is indeed a large sword, but you will not use it to slash or smash like those uncultured warriors. ^I'm ^sorry, ^my ^warrior ^main. ^Plz ^love ^me. Instead, you get a badass weapon with Frickin. Laser. Beams. It's actually one of your longest-ranged weapons, and build around that fact, since the beam does more damage over long distances. The 2 skill throws a bouncing sword that creates a clone at its first target, as well as giving might to allies. The 3 skill hits a single target (or tight cluster of targets) instantly, removing a boon from them. I commonly see 3 skill used to supplement the beam, since it comes out very quickly. The 4 skill gives you your very own pet warrior, a phantasm that will use warrior's greatsword 3 on your enemies, twirling through them like a ballerina of doom. It also cripples foes, to help keep them away from you. Finally, the 5 skill is your only close-range attack, a swing that knocks away foes that have gotten too close. This is basically your panic button, and it's on a fairly long cooldown, so use it wisely. It's also important to mention that a trait in the Domination line causes the greatsword 2-5 skills to apply crippling (or... more crippling in the case of 4), which is highly recommended to assist in your keep-away tactics, as well as stacking might with your beam, so you hit harder too. Edit: Corrections made to 3 skill and Domination trait line. Thanks, u/Gayest_Charr_Ever. ~~~~~~~ **Main Hand--** These weapons will usually be your bread-and-butter. Your main source of damage. As with the two handed weapons, you only get one choice for Power or Condi. ~~~~~~~ Weapon: Scepter Uses: Condi + Shatter Fodder Notes: The scepter is your other main condi weapon. I remember reading guides back in the day that said the scepter was a very weak weapon and thus, not recommended. I am happy to say that from my experience, this seems to no longer be the case. Where the staff is all about giving your enemy ALL the conditions, the scepter only gives you access to two: mainly torment, with a little confusion. Instead, it focuses on clone production. The scepter is the only weapon I know of that generates clones from its auto attack, so you will always have a steady supply. Being clones, they don't really do much damage, but what they can do is set you up for a shatter faster than any other weapon. If you like to make things that resemble yourself explode violently, see a therapist, but also play scepter. The auto also applies torment, for consistent condi damage. While the attack only hits a single target at a time, I do like this weapon for groups of enemies, because while you need a target that can take a hit in order to get the full potential out of your staff, the fickle nature of the scepter's clone production reduces the penalty of spreading the love around. The confusion I mentioned earlier comes from your 3 skill, which deals a nice little chunk of damage whenever you need it in between shatters. The 2 skill is a block which, when successful, counters and summons yet another clone. It's good to have friends, am I right? Even when they're imaginary? ...Right? ~~~~~~~ Weapon: Sword (main) Uses: Power + Evasion Notes: If you're the crazy sort of mesmer who wants to actually fight your enemies up close an personal, then the sword is your weapon. Fortunately, it happens to be rather good at keeping you just out of your enemy's reach. The auto attack does good Power damage on its own, but also applies two stacks of vulnerability per cycle, and strips a boon on the third hit, or deals extra damage if your foe doesn't have a boon. But getting up in your enemy's face and wailing on them is not what this weapon is about, and you will be curbstomped countless times until your learn that. Instead, playing sword is an elegant dance, almost like fencing in a way. Get in, get out. Bait, and punish. As such, your other two skills are there to help you keep your enemy guessing. The 3 skill sends a clone to leap at your foe and start slashing them. But is that a harmless clone that just landed in front of them, or you? Your enemy won't be sure, because as soon as the clone lands, you can switch places with them by pressing the skill again. They'll admittedly be tipped off at this point, but it won't matter, since they'll be immobilized by your arrival, leaving them at your mercy. This leads quite well into the 2 skill, which is a frenzy of sword slashes to take advantage of your enemy's immobility. You don't even need to fear getting attacked during this, because you are also distorted (AKA intangible) for the duration of the animation. In fact, sometimes you don't even need to have an enemy to hit, sometimes you just want to pop up your 2 skill to be invulnerable to a big attack coming at you. It's extremely versatile, and experienced players can pair the 2 skill with shatter f4 and other tricks to be practically untouchable. Just make sure you're watching for when it ends, so you don't leave yourself open. I kid about the crazy mesmer trying to fight at melee range, but I must stress that the sword is easily your most powerful weapon once you master it. And as the different-est (totally a word, shut up) playstyle for your leveling experience, don't knock it 'til you try it. ~~~~~~~ **Off Hand--** As you may notice, your off hand options vastly outnumber your main hand options. What that means is that here is where you really get to make your mesmer your own. The right off hand (or off hands) should add flavor to your main weapon choice, whether you want to go for a defensive weapon or add some extra attacks to your arsenal, whether you want something to help out fellow players or just keep yourself out of trouble. The choice is yours! ~~~~~~~ Weapon: Sword (off) Uses: Power + Defense Notes: The only weapon so far that the mesmer can use in either hand, the sword retains it's 'cautious melee' philosophy in off hand. The 4 skill is a block, which when successful, counterattacks the enemy and replaces you with a clone while moving you a short distance away. If you've been faked out, and no attack comes to activate your counter, fear not! You can cancel the block by pressing the skill again, and you will instead shoot out a projectile a short distance in front of you, dazing your foes so you still get an opening. It's not as good as if you'd actually gotten the block, but think of it as a consolation prize. Without all the condescending ""Nice Try""s or ""Better Luck Next Time""s Okay, maybe a little of that. Anyway, the 5 skill is a plain old phantasm... that rocks. Unlike some of the more bursty phantasms out there, which do a spike of great damage and then stand there with a glazed look in their eyes, this phantasm does a hit-and-run attack at a comparatively faster pace, so it actually feels like they're fighting with you. It's a great way to supplement your overall dps, and it's a repeating leap finisher, for those sweet sweet auras. ~~~~~~~ Weapon: Focus Uses: Power + CC + Utility Notes: This will be your best friend when leveling, and not even for a combat reason. Walking through the field your 4 skill places grants swiftness, speeding up your movement and helping you get to the action faster. At current balancing, the swiftness boon lasts for about half the cooldown of the skill itself, essentially meaning you can go fast about half the time. It even works for your friends! Pair it with the Signet of Inspiration utility skill for nigh-constant swiftness! As for combat, the 4 skill can cripple enemies, slowing their movement, and better yet, the followup ability can pull any nearby enemies into a nice little pile for you. The phantasm summoned by the 5 skill can do a lot of damage in a short time, before standing there doing nothing for a while. The phantasm nullifies projectiles while attacking, which means you can use it as a temporary shield by hiding in it when it first comes out, relying on the blades to keep melee attackers at bay. It's also a great whirl finisher, so try to make use of your allies' fields. You can also pick a trait in the Inspiration line to make both focus skills reflect projectiles. Overall, it's a neat little weapon, not great for every situation, but worth it early on for the swiftness alone. ~~~~~~~ Weapon: Pistol Uses: Power/Condi (see below) + CC Notes: While the pistol normally deals power damage, it's commonly used by condi players thanks to a trait in the Dueling line which adds bleeding to all your pistol attacks. 50% chance for every single bullet. The 4 skill summons a phantasm that unloads its guns into the poor fool who crossed you. The power damage alone from that is impressive, but with the aforementioned trait, that's a whole lotta bleeds. Mind the cooldown, though, as the phantasm doesn't attack very often. The 5 skill can take a little getting used to, since the conditions it applies aren't random, but instead specific to each enemy the attack hits. First hit stuns, second dazes, third blinds, fourth confuses. In practice, this means the first enemy will be stopped the longest, the second enemy will be stopped from doing stuff for a shorter time (but can still move), the third won't be stopped but might miss you for a while, and the last one won't be stopped but will take some condi damage from the confusion. It works just fine as a simple stunning move, but if you can learn it, it can be fun to plan out which enemies get hit by the bounces. The pistol might have a bit more of a learning curve than some of the other weapons, but the reward for sticking with it is a very solid offensive supplement. Plus, it's currently the only way you can be a magical gunslinger. Just saying. ~~~~~~~ Weapon: Torch Uses: Condi + Utility Notes: This weapon doesn't seem to get much love in late-game PvE, but I personally find it the most fun. Both of its skills will burn your foes, with the 4 skill throwing in a blind, and the 5 skill giving your allies some fury for extra precision. The fun thing about it is that the 4 skill will also let you vanish in a puff of smoke, becoming invisible (stealthed) for about three seconds, then reappearing in a blaze of glory and pyrotechnics. Mesmers have a couple sources of stealth, but this is one of the easiest to use consistently, and depending on the traits you pick, stealth can lower the cooldown on your torch skills for even more stealth. The condi damage is nice, but honestly not as good as the pistol, which is why that gets used more often. Still, I recommend the torch if you like to pretend you're Houdini while you play fantasy games (because who doesn't?). ~~~~~~~ Weapon: Shield (Chronomancer Spec only) Uses: CC + Pure Defense Notes: Elite Specializations are only available to players who have purchased the Heart of Thorns expansion. This is more a weapon to look forward to than one you can try out now, unless you're playing PvP. In PvE, you can only use this in endgame. That said, the shield covers one of the mesmer's greatest shortcomings, being squishy. Ever heard pro players mention their ChronoTank builds? Well, while the process of leveling a mesmer is often paved with the smell of fear and death (eww...), once their elite spec is unlocked, they gain several useful abilities to help them stay alive (along with other cool stuff that's not important here). A core part of this newfound not-immediately-dying ability is the shield. The other nifty thing about the shield is that it's all about doing things twice. Stopped your enemies with a stun wave? The wave turns around and stuns them again. Blocked a big attack with your barrier? You get a followup barrier for zero cooldown, provided the first one actually blocked something. The wave also grants quickness to allies it passes through, which everybody will love you for. In general, it works sort of like warrior's shield, but better. And also shinier, so there's that. ~~~~~~~ And that's all the weapons a mesmer can currently use. I hope this helped. See you in game! :D ~~~~~~~ **Appendix A: Staff Boons and Conditions** Winds of Chaos (skill 1) Boons: Fury, Might Winds of Chaos Condis: Bleeding, Burning, Vulnerability Chaos Storm (skill 5) Boons: Aegis, Retaliation, Swiftness Chaos Storm Condis: Chill, Poison, Weakness Chaos Armor (skill 4 / aura combo) Boons: Protection, Regen, Swiftness Chaos Armor Condis: Weakness, Confusion, Cripple **Edit:** Thank you so much for the feedback, everyone! I'm learning things even I didn't know! I want this guide to be a helpful resource to any aspiring mesmers out there, so I will try to update this guide when I have the time. Keep sending your suggestions! Once this guide reaches a satisfactory level of quality, I think I'd like to try making guides like this for other classes as well. Warrior will probably be next, since that's my main. "

It could be a combination of elite specialisation and legendary weapons. ------------------------------------------------------------------ New Weapon Idea for every Class: ------------------------------------------------------------------ Warrior -&gt; Greataxe (Two-Handed) Guardian -&gt; Halberd (Two-Handed) Revenant -&gt; Katana (Two-Handed) Engineer -&gt; Rocket Launcher (Two-Handed) Thief -&gt; Fist Weapon / Claws (Two One-handed) Ranger -&gt; Crossbow (Two-Handed) Elementalist -&gt; Chakram (Two One-Handed) Mesmer -&gt; Scythe (Two-Handed) Necromancer -&gt; Grimoire (Two-Handed) ------------------------------------------------------------------ Three Examples: ------------------------------------------------------------------ Warrior: ----------------------------------------------------------------- Warrior gets ""Hareths Hate"" as the new Greataxe Weapon with six dyable slots (the sixt dye slot will change the aura of the weapon). Warriors burst-skills (F1) will now leave a puddle on the ground that act as a window into hell. ------------------------------------------------------------------ Skills: ------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.1.Deadly Chop: ""Take a swing and chop your foes to inflict vulnerability."" ~Chain~ 1.2.Hellish Swing: ""Swing your greataxe back and chop your foes to inflict vulnerability."" ~Chain~ 1.3.Gate into Hell: ""Smash your greataxe into the ground to open a gate into hell. Periodically inflict burning to foes."" -&gt;Combo-Field: Fire ------------------------------------------------------------------ 2.Destructive Chopper: ""Take a swing and chop your foes with a powerful strike. Deals more damage to disabled foes."" ------------------------------------------------------------------ 3.Crack into Hell: ""Smash your greataxe into the ground to create a crack in front of you that acts as a window into hell. The crack will deal massive damage and inflict burning to foes."" -&gt;Combo-Field: Fire ------------------------------------------------------------------ 4.No Escape: ""Jump at your target to knock it down."" -&gt;Combo-Finisher: Leap ------------------------------------------------------------------ 5.Thousand Axes: ""Spin around and throw axes in all directions. Thrown axes inflict vulnerability to foes and grant might to allies."" -&gt;Combo-Finisher: Whirl -&gt;Combo-Finisher: Physical Projectile (20%) ------------------------------------------------------------------ Engineer: ------------------------------------------------------------------ Engineer gets ""R.O.C.K.E.T."" as the new Rocket Launcher Weapon. ""R.O.C.K.E.T."" has six dyable slots (the sixt dye slot will change the projectile-colour). Engineers toolbelt-skills will now create a spectacular firework when activated. ------------------------------------------------------------------ Skills: ------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.Dynamic Rocket: ""Fire a rocket that gets faster the closer it gets to the target. Creates a little explosion that inflicts burning to foes around the target."" -&gt;Combo-Finisher:: Physical Projectile 100% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 2.Pulverization: ""Fire a very fast rocket at your foe that inflicts blindess and vulnerablity. Recharges instantly when hitting a blinded foe."" -&gt;Combo-Finisher: Physical Projectile 100% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 3.Rocket Bombardment: ""Fire three successive rockets at your foe to inflict burning and vulnerability."" -&gt;Combo-Finisher: Physical Projectile 100% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 4.Rocket Jump: ""Blast the ground, damaging and knocking nearby foes down and leaping backwards."" -&gt;Combo-Finisher: Explosion -&gt;Combo-Finisher: Leap ------------------------------------------------------------------ 5.Firework: ""Fire several rockets at the target area to periodically create explosions that inflict burning and vulnerability to foes."" -&gt;Combo-Finisher: Explosion ------------------------------------------------------------------ Mesmer: ------------------------------------------------------------------ Mesmer gets ""Dreamsickle"" as the new Scythe Weapon. ""Dreamsickle"" has six dyable slots (the sixt dye slot will change the colour of illusions and phantasms). Shatter skills will now splinter illusions and phantasms like glass. ------------------------------------------------------------------ Skills: ------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.1.Dream Slash: ""Slash your foe to inflict confusion."" ~Chain~ 1.2.Dream Gash: ""Gash your foe to inflict vulnerability."" ~Chain~ 1.3.Dreamy Swing: ""Swing your scythe around you, striking nearby enemies. Inflict confusion and vulnerability."" -&gt;Combo-Finisher: Whirl ------------------------------------------------------------------ 2.False Awakening: ""Pull your target with an enlarged scythe to you. Inflict vulnerability when successfully pulled."" ------------------------------------------------------------------ 3.Dreamcatcher: ""Slash your foes with three successive attacks of your scythe. Recharges faster when you hit a slowed foe."" ------------------------------------------------------------------ 4.Phantasmal Reaper: ""Send out a scythe at your foe that slows at contact and creates an ""Phantasmal Reaper""."" -&gt;Combo-Finisher: Physical Projectile (100%) -&gt;Phantasmal Reaper: Periodically sends out a illusionary scythe that bounces between foes to inflict slowness. ------------------------------------------------------------------ 5.Dreamspiral: ""Spin around and inflict confusion to nearby foes. Creates a illusionary whirl that periodically pulls nearby foes."" -&gt;Combo-Finisher: Whirl ------------------------------------------------------------------ How do you find the idea of elite-weapons? Would it be a alternative to elite specialisations? In my opinion it is interesting and cool but elite-specialisation are still better! Greetings Monti"
197,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"Some continued ideas , for Fun.",0,6627dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6627dm/some_continued_ideas_for_fun/,2017-04-18 21:19:50,"This is a continuation of a weapon concept post I made here : URL I was just coming up with new ideas and wanted to put them somewhere. Now , on the last post I was called out for ACTUALLY suggesting and expecting these to be things in the future , which is my fault for not saying other-wise. I didnt think of it like that for a second , it was really JUST for fun and games. I wanted to hear other peoples concepts and what abilities theyd like, and maybe get some criticisms. This doesnt mean anything at the end of the day. Thanks you all &lt;3 I finally came up with the Tome for Mesmer btw. So, it would be based around defense and would have a block , a stealth and a knock back. Maybe a unique thing for it could be making it seem like they are passive to enemies or maybe , for PVP , make them untargetable for a short while. FALCHION: All heroes want to be the guys with one handed swords. Unfortunately you must always have two in this game or a Greatsword due to one being nearly redundant alone. That is where the Falchion comes in! By all technicalities it is a two handed weapon but these single-edged blades would look as if they were being used in one hand. The theme here would be all types would have a move that would help with foes on lower health , those it could still be a bit more diverse in how it does it. I got this idea from of Rytlock fights and thought Sohothin could make a cool Falchion. Warrior: A warrior would use these are power weapon rather than the condi of normal swords. Warrior could try use their free hand to punch people away or even weaken them with a chop to the throat. A few spinning attacks could suit. I think , to be awesome , that their Execution Attack should be a dash that leaves them behind their target a short distance afterward. Whilst it could be impractical to do , Rule of Cool applies here. Revenants : For some reason a few people I know associate Revenants with Cantha and mostly use Eastern themes. This is likely because of Shiro being awesome to use. Now , I am not certain who to use for this , for a Legend , but I know what I want it to be like. This could be based around dashes and being faster than the enemy to catch them as they run away. This could be a Bleed based weapon mostly , with maybe a vulnerability here or there. Instead of being health-dependant I think that their Execution Attack could be based on how many conditions the foes has for damage. Elementalist : This is mostly because some many people wanted Tempests to use swords and some were properly disappointed by the Warhorn. I personally, didnt care too much. FIRE : Based around throwing the sword and having it come back , whilst wreathed in flames. WATER : using the sword as a focus for mist based magic for boons and condi removal. EARTH : Based around protection , but on allies rather than ones self . AIR : this is where the Execution Attack would be. It could be the Ele summoning a storm and having one single bolt of 1000 GIGAWATTS roast the low health opponent. CROSSBOW: Look , I know we have rifles and longbows , but they both dont feel very Slow yet strong  to me. Which is why this is here. And just to say that my second reason is simply : Crossbows. Are. Awesome. Engineer : BOOM! This would be all based on exploding bolts and would work nicely with Explosives rather than Firearms. Maybe have an cripple and a burn for good measure , as well as a AOE knockback. It may be primitive but at least Engis could customize their ammo , unlike bullets. I guess. Thief : This could be their sniping weapon rather than what rifle WOULD be for them. It could have a smoke grenade arrow , a sky barrage , and a Kill Shot - like stealth ability. Maybe even a knockdown and a immobilize for good measure. Guardian : This is odd. Rather than be its own weapons I was more considering this be.a replacement (?) for the Longbow for Dragonhunters. I know Dragonhunter is supposed to be a Witch Hunter tribute and they used crossbows. I see where Anet were going with their Longbow idea , but it really does suit more , or for my mindset at least. Id like to hear thoughts here. LANTERNS : Think : a more mobile and defensive torch. It was just a thought , maybe have then be more supportive even? I say this would be Off-hand mostly , but yknow , someone might use it main hand Guardian : I liked to imagine Guards have a move similar to Infiltrators Strike for thieves but maybe burning and removing conditions as well. Maybe have another teleport that could reveal people caught in the area. Necromancer : Look up Thresh from League of Legends. Literally that. It could be a type of phylactery for the Necromancer. Engineer: It could be an Off-hand that could use an Oil splash that can cripple and poison. And you could combo this with a fire ability afterward that could blind and burn , whilst also making an explosion. I may have simply made a better pistol Off-hand. HALBERD : A lethal defense weapon that may not do tons of damage overall but could deal some good AOE , and maybe involve some good counter attacks. Its be a battleaxe really but easier to differentiate from the regular Axe for the name. Necromancer : It could be similar to the Greatsword but may be more mobile , and with less conditions but could reap a fair amount of Life Force. Maybe have a slow dash that could have them swinging it whilst moving, this might also break immobilization maybe. It could also have a leap that could generate Life force and blind whomever is nearby at the impact. Warrior : This could be more of a Protect my Allies weapon. Maybe have a built in protection and whirl finisher for combos. This could have leap with a blast finisher maybe and the Burst Skill could push people away , for longer distances t more adrenaline. Ranger : This would use the Axe side of the Halberd parentage , with the unique gimmick of dealing more damage as long has the enemy has MORE health. It could use the imagery of a Oakheart or maybe simply a person cutting down a tree. Maybe the spec could allow rangers to use Plant-based Pets that are yet to be added, other than Sylvan Hounds. WIND AND FIRE WHEELS/ CHAKRAM : These weapons in particular could be based around ferocity and critical hits. Itd be mid ranged based , possibly with some sort of deflection. Mostly based on how Rangers use Axes. Revenants: The basic attack could work like Vapour Blade , but could give ferocity on the way back. Maybe use the Mists to put down Light and Dark Fields and have a whirl finisher there somewhere. Maybe the attack could be a Physical Projectile. Mesmer : This could be a Condi weapon. The thrown blades could confuse the foe with the spins and maybe have a Whirl that could allow the Mesmer to turn invisible and escape if they hit a foe. Mayhaps have Phantasmal Discus , a illusion that could slow and apply bleed. They could look like Jugglers! Thief : Maybe have some inbuilt avoids and some poison based attacks. It could maybe put the thief into a Martial Rage that could pile on the ferocity stat. CLAWS: Know, I know you would think Like Wolverine but I think it could work as a sort of Gauntlet with sharp fingers instead , as Vigors (seen in my last post) kinda do the primal punchy sort of thing. Engineers: It could be a ranged weapon for them , working more like a laser in a gauntlet rather than a claw. It could apply a good few conditions , focusing on burning and maybe have an attack that hurts with more conditions , like the Necro Scepter. Thief : Poisoned attacks. Lots of em. Not sure what else to put here to make it different than dagger though. Mesmer : Maybe rather than Illusions based on the character , have them based on Wolves and Tigers maybe , with Phantasmal Predator and Phantasmal Stalker. The wolf could follow the target and deal cripple , whilst the Tiger could stealth and fear when it appears. I thought of this because What do claws inspire? Fear , because of spooky werewolves and Tigers :P Honourable Mention : WARGLAIVES : a Dual sided weapon popularised by World of Warcraft. This isnt really a weapon suggestion as it is me simply pointing out the similarities between Revenants (GW2s latest class) and Demon Hunter (WoWs latest class). Both are blindfolded warriors using otherworldly powers that are based on something from a game before the one where they were playable. Well thats my post. Id like for people to comment their own ideas for such things. I know thesell never happen but it is just for fun. Dont forget to check the last list as well. Thank you &lt;3 "
198,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[Guide] A guide to Super Adventure Box bosses (King Toad and Storm Wizard),8,664s4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/664s4x/guide_a_guide_to_super_adventure_box_bosses_king/,2017-04-19 04:41:00,"It's a bit late in this year's festival, but I just thought back to feeling really frustrated when the holiday started (being a first-time SAB player) - the boss encounters felt confusing, I didn't know what was going on, and there was hardly any information available on the interwebs. Thus, this post now exists - which will hopefully this will help somebody next year at least. All information pertains to Normal mode. ##**A few words on zone bosses:** Zone bosses (""cages"") are found at the end of each non-final zone in a map. They have laser attacks which are telegraphed by the hovering head. * **World 1**: Single laser attack targeted at your current position. That's all they ever do. Simply side step when the head suddenly faces you. * **World 2**: Two different attacks: * One is a set of four laser attacks, 90 apart. The location of the first attack is fixed, thus meaning that four out of the eight sides of the cage are ""safe"". Stand there. * The second attack is a circle sweep laser, followed by an explosion. Telegraphed by the head laughing. Dodge forward (""into"" the model) to avoid both damage ticks. ##**King Toad:** Found at the end of World 1. His boss arena can be seen [here](URL His fight gimmick is that you should feed him jewel shards from his necklace to make him attackable. He has two main patterns to watch for: * **Swallow pattern:** The fight always opens with this pattern, which is indicated by King Toad looking to both sides rapidly. Attack (stand at the pink blob in the picture above) the obvious red necklace to split off a crystal shard if you don't have one yet and pick it up (bundle). Target the main head (careful: not the necklace), wait for his mouth to open, throw crystal (#1 on bundle bar). If done properly, King Toad will become vulnerable to attack after a second or two. Mash 1 immediately to break off a new shard for the next cycle and start dealing damage as soon as possible, and don't stop until he goes invulnerable, then prepare for the next pattern. * *Note: If you don't throw a crystal into his mouth, he will sweep the entire area with his tongue. Dodge to avoid, though this should never happen in an optimal fight.* * *With the Chain Sticks, you can just barely two-cycle this boss - you might need three with the default weapon.* * **Stomp pattern:** Indicated by everything else. There are multiple variations corresponding to different stomps, each of which will cause a different shockwave to emit from the impact location. None of the shockwaves reach the rocks circled in blue in the arena layout above - stand there to avoid all damage until he reverts back to the previous pattern and you get to do stuff again. **Storm Wizard:** Found at the end of World 2. The fight consists of two stages. **Stage one** is a very simple encounter in a circular area, with SW spending most of the time invulnerable (as indicated by a lightning orb shield). Wait for him to throw his main projectile attack at you, reflect it using the Glove of Wisdom (#9), which makes him vulnerable until he's done moving to the next location. Smack him, then repeat. At 50% health, he adds a ""charge"" (not really fast) where he chases you while evading, then does a sudden ""punch"" that does really weirdly timed damage. I can't find any consistent way to avoid it, just wait for him to stop doing the charge animation, punch him, and risk taking a heart or two of damage - or play it safe and stay away during the charge. Up to you. **Stage two** begins when Storm Wizard hits zero health and becomes invulnerable, transforming into a cloud dragon. The fight arena will then split into a circular center platform (""center"") surrounded by six floating platforms (""outer ring""). Here, Storm Wizard performs the following sequence: * **Lightning sparks:** Sparks spawn on both the center and ring platforms. The ring platform sparks have a chance to shock the entire platform they're on, while the center sparks just chase you around. Stay on the center platform for two sets of sparks and 1-mash them to death. Afterwards, the boss should've stopped circling, signaling... * **Lightning breath:** All sparks despawn, and Storm Wizard performs a lightning breath attack on the center platform. Jump to one of the outer ring platforms immediately after the second set of sparks dies to avoid taking damage, then just wait it out. * **Dive bomb:** After the breath attack ends, Storm Wizard will fly up off the top of the screen, then dive all the way to the bottom. When he disappears, he locks onto the current platform you're on, and will reappear shortly after to destroy that platform from below. Simply move one platform over after he disappears fully to avoid this, and get ready for... * **Vulnerability:** After Storm Wizard eats the platform and disappears off the top of the screen, the lightning breath visual will disappear from the center platform (the actual damage persists for a second or two after this). Storm Wizard's hitbox appears as soon as the damage disappears, so get onto the center platform and start mashing 1 like your life depends on it. After a few seconds, the boss' model will actually crash onto the platform too, so you can see what you're hitting. Just keep mashing until you stop seeing/hearing damage, at which point the boss takes off again and the sequence restarts. * *With the Chain Sticks, you do about 75% per vulnerability phase, so I'd assume you can two-cycle this boss even with the default weapon.* I hope this helps you in your SAB adventures, and maybe somebody next year won't feel as completely confused by what the shit is going on in SW phase two as I was two weeks ago."
199,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Engineer Changes,10,5vnol4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5vnol4/engineer_changes/,2017-02-23 14:03:00,"**My thoughts on the changes:** * The rifle change is a nice treat, but I feel it's a far cry from making Engie-Rifle playable in any sort of format. *Very* oddly, the condition damage on the skill (at close range) increased about 56%. This makes almost no sense to me since the rifle hasn't any other condition capability, so you'll never use it for the condition damage (although the longer bleeding duration does synergize with Hematic Focus somewhat nicely.) However, the rifle still pales in comparison to Scrapper's hammer. If you are doing physical damage at close range (where the Rifle is at full effectiveness), you *really* should just go Hammer. If you're doing long range physical, you run a kit. This buff doesn't make Rifle any better in a practical sense. * A 33% increase to condition damage for Fragmentation Shot. If you're playing Condi Engie, you should not be auto-attacking with your pistol (*especially* after some of the nice Condi buffs in this patch). * Uhm... wh-...what? Why did Blowtorch get buffed? Blowtorch was *the* skill you wanted to use as much as possible and they buffed it by 33%? I won't complain, but I am confused. * Both buffs to Elixir U are very nice. With HGH, you can get a cooldown of 32 seconds on both the drink and wall. The buffs provided aren't particularly amazing, but nice none the less. However, the wall can be a great defensive option; 12 seconds of negating projectiles for 12 seconds every 40 seconds is nothing to sneeze at. * The ""buffs"" to Shredder Gyro are an absolute joke. At level 80, the Gyro does approximately 1k damage every second. This sounds pretty decent, until you realize a) the average DPS drops to about 300 when you take cooldown into effect, b) not all of the hits may actually land if the target moves/kills the Gyro, c) the utility provides very little functionality beyond the damage, and d) the Gyro **DOES NOT SCALE WITH YOUR STATS**. The final point makes the Whirl Finisher almost entirely useless. Each flaming bolt that hits (and it won't be a lot), will only deal 131 damage at most. You cannot increase this except by Vulnerability. While this is *still* the case, I do not know. This utility is an interesting idea in the sense that the Whirl Finisher seemed to be the main selling point of the thing; however, the execution does not match this idea as ArenaNet seems to keep pushing the physical damage up. This not only makes the skill boring, but it also makes it severely difficult to balance as the expected damage will vary entirely by how long the target remains in the AoE. * The changes to bombs seem mostly like bug-fixing, but increased Immobilize on Glue Bomb will not be unappreciated. * Shaped Charge, Glass Cannon, and Static Discharge have all been directly buffed. These changes can be combined together to increase physical damage by a fairly hefty amount, but I would say that the tools aren't quite there to make physical damage *great*. * Shrapnel has effectively been upgraded. A bit more than double the proc chance but half the duration of the conditions will net-gain Engineers who use explosives. As a side-effect, Shrapnel will be a bit more ""bursty"" in terms of damage. However this seems more like a smoothing out of RNG. The 15% chance was fairly uncommon to occur so this new version should make things more consistent (which is always nice). * The tooltips showing which skills are considered ""Explosive"" will certainly be appreciated, as will making Gyro self-destructs explosive. However, I will miss crippling smoke bombs, though I will entirely admit that interaction was unintuitive and certainly a bug. * Pinpoint Distribution. Oh my god. At first I was pretty excited. And then I realized... **THIS NEW VERSION LOWS YOUR CONDITION DAMAGE!** (Though, I admit, not by TOO much.) With the old version, you were guaranteed 100 Condition Damage and it only went up from there. In a reasonable build, it would net you pretty close to 200 extra points which is super nice! But now it's set to 150, losing you stats (though it gives it to other players, too). **_HOWEVER_**, giving condition damage is nothing like giving power. Power will *always* be useful, as will precision or ferocity since *all* skills scale off of those three stats. Condition Damage though? Not all abilities scale with it. It's probably a net-gain most of the time, but this still rubs me the wrong way quite a bit. * These Flamethrower buffs are actually quite nice. It pushes the FT a bit more into a hybrid kit, which isn't bad by any means. Flame Blast, which was fairly respectable burst, is now improved by a fair amount from the damage increase, not to mention 9 seconds of extra burning if you can time your blast well. These changes likely aren't going to increase FT's use at all, but they will push the numbers up _a bit_ for people who do use it. *** **What wasn't changed:** * Med Kit. Oh lord, Med Kit. Another balance patch and yet again, no change to Med Kit. The numbers are theoretically there, but the difficulty of using it and the loss of a player's DPS while using it just makes Med Kit a complete joke. Literally the only use is in a Static Shock build for the F1 ability. * Turrets. Turrets need love. While not as bad as Shredder Gyro, they're still pretty far down there (except healing turret). For most of them, their use is outweighed by ""losing"" a utility slot for something better. * Gadgets feel like they're on the cusp of usability, but for the most part, anything they do, you can get with something else better. Blast Gyro makes Battering Ram look like a joke, Utility Goggles isn't as flexible as either Elixir B or Elixir U, Rocket Boots is just out-matched by the hammer's #3 (though the tool belt skill is respectable), etc. * Shield. I bet most of you forgot that Engineer can even equip a shield. I know I did. This weapon is so intensely over-shadowed by the Hammer, I honestly cannot think of a reason why you would want to equip it. * General Trait balancing. Things are certainly better after this patch, but there are still a number of lines where I feel there is only one choice (and sometimes not even that). For instance, if I want to use Elixirs in an offensive build, I either have to choose a dead trait (unless I'm using elixir gun), remove myself from combat for 4 seconds when I hit 25% health, or have a worse regeneration on me when I'm using a kit. Tuning some traits up and maybe even tuning others down would certainly diversify builds."
200,vulnerability,Guildwars2,How to make Reaper great again,5,5vx65t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5vx65t/how_to_make_reaper_great_again/,2017-02-24 23:23:21,"(**Note that my editing suckand im trying to make it readible**) With recent buff to Deathly chill ArenaNet showed (in my opinion) that they are heading in a good direction for us-reapers. We must all agree that keeping buttload of minions healed by druids was a broken mechanics, even if it was the only mechanic keeping us in raid meta. With current change we can maintain 50+stacks of bleed without minions, bursting it even to 70-80 at times. So what is our problem now ? Lack of conditions ? No. Lack of AoE ? Epidemic says no. Its synnergy and group utility. Our traitlines look very meh in group content: Spite provides self might and vulnerability on target - things that are already covered teamwide. Grandmaster. ""Close to Death"" could be awesome addition if it also increased condition damage. Sadly it doesnt. Death magic was great minions synnergy, now it is just self sustain and occasional poison field, which now stand in the way of our buffed ice field whirl combo. Soul reaping gives us plenty of good things but in a useless way. Speed of shadows recharges F1 faster but that way we can miss weapon swap sigils procs. Vital persistence reduces cd of RS skills, GREAT! But then grandmasters strike again giving us basically nothing to increase performance.Blood magic is used most of the time simply because it is the only traitline that gives party-wide class-specific buff. A weak one unfortunately. Recent engi addition and our reaper's onslaught buff showed that Anet is willing to do some major updates. Exactly what we need. My personal ideas how to ""repair"" certain traits. **Death magic**: Flesh of the Master - increase the minions duration instead of health. Deathly power: Provides party with bonus power, increased buff while in shroud. **Spite**: Close to Death: Increased damage includes conditions. **Blood magic**: All life siphon should be increased, either by numbers themselves or by better scaling with healing power. Seriosly - full cleric vampiric presence heals for 41hp. No healing power is 33hp. This is a joke. EDIT:**Proposed change to vampiric presence** Instead of showing as a buff on player character it now shows as a debuff on the enemy. **Vampiric presence**: Weaken the surrounding enemies weakening them against conditions, and causing them to heal players that hit them. Target limit: 5 Heling per hit: 50 Condition damage increase: 15-20% **Soul reaping** Unyielding Blast/Dhuumfire - Shroud skills cause vulnerability/burning on hit/critical hit. Not just auto attack, all of shroud skills."
201,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Trogdor the Guardian: Build Concept,10,5wjopd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5wjopd/trogdor_the_guardian_build_concept/,2017-02-28 08:49:09,"# Trogdor the Guardian So, I figured I'd finally post a weird build I've been working on for some time. While potentially useful in raids, I've run this build in fractals and other content as well and found it perfectly solid there. I'm not a pro raider by any means, but I've taken it into a couple of raids with a good degree of success, and found that it has some interesting characteristics in most PvE content. ## Build and Rotations First off, [the build](URL The general rotation: * Feel My Wrath * Scepter 2 * Torch 4 (always throw this single-target, never throw it when fighting 3+ targets) * Purging flames on the target if you don't expect to have to clear conditions, else reserve this to clear conditions--but make sure you catch enemies in it as well. The initial cast burns enemies, as well as foes crossing over the outside of the ring. * Torch 4 (by now a crit will have triggered Radiant Fire, allowing you to throw it again against single targets) * At this point, **split your rotation based on the number of targets:** * **For 3+ targets:** * Torch 5 * Swap to sword * Sword 2 * Autoattack, using sword 2 on cooldown (without interrupting your autoattack chain) and repositioning to make sure you hit as many targets as possible with each swing. * On cooldown, swap back to scepter and begin another rotation. * Whenever a target is likely to die within the next second, use the Virtue of Justice activation. If you can't work this in effectively, don't worry about it too much, but it's a definite damage increase if you can pull it off in group content. * **For 1-2 targets, use skills whenever possible with this priority:** * Stay in scepter unless CC or other sword functions (projectile block, aegis) are needed. * Use scepter 2 whenever possible. * Throw torch 4 whenever possible. * Use Purging Flames/Judge's Intervention on cooldown (or as situationally appropriate for encounters with condis/CC to stunbreak) * Autoattack. ## Options/Alternatives * If you want to go all-in on the multi-target condition aspect of the build, consider taking sigils of fire rather than force. A sigil of fire proc will not only deal around 587 direct damage, it hits multiple foes, and can proc Permeating Wrath for an AoE burn. Thus, the sigil will always add at least one 4-second stack of burning when fighting 3+ foes, for a total of at least 2.5k damage to each foe--in this scenario it significantly outdamages Sigil of Air, and provides damage about on par to the gain from sigil of force. However, force is significantly better against single targets. * If you know you won't need to bring your own defensive skills or CC, I would recommend not bringing the shield. This lets you use torch skills on the sword set as well, which can let you camp sword/torch in fights with 3+ targets. * If you're roaming the open world, you probably won't need the extra damage from Signet of Wrath--you can generally one-shot many enemies below level 80 (and many of them at level 80) with a quick torch 4 throw or Purging Flames cast, even without the signet, might, or any foods. Take Retreat instead of the signet for a bit of movement speed, and consider pairing sword/torch + scepter/shield instead of vice verse, as sword lets you get around a bit better by targeting ambient mobs and using Flashing Blade. * If you're in a fight where you can consistently keep aegis up, change the Master of Consecrations trait to Unscathed Contender. Master of Consecrations is only there for the cooldown reduction for the most part; Unscathed Contender adds another powerful damage multiplier to your already significant stack of multipliers. * Consider changing the runes to Berserker runes. If you do, change your focusing crystal consumable to the Toxic Focusing Crystal, and change the sigils of force to sigils of smoldering to make sure you're capped on burn duration. This effectively changes the +5% damage multiplier from sigils to your runes, swaps your burn duration from runes to utility consumables and sigils, and gives you more offensive stats and another +5% condition damage multiplier, effectively increasing damage further. [This variant](URL is definitely more powerful than the original. However, Toxic Focusing Crystals cost nearly a gold apiece, and if you run regular tuning crystals instead this variant ends up being less powerful than the other. Capping burn duration is very important to this build's damage output--even against weak enemies--due to generally relying on a large number of short-duration burns. The effectiveness of this swap is also in doubt due to losing a 7% damage multiplier from the Flame Legion runes entirely. This variant will increase condition damage, but you may end up with slightly lower DPS in total. * If you can't survive, you can get away with swapping the Sinister trinkets to Carrion for some extra vitality. This definitely lowers damage output, but if you and/or your group can keep 100% fury uptime, you're getting +45% crit chance anyway, leaving you with 70% instead of the original gear set's 83% under the same circumstances. Given the lack of ferocity on the build and your only on-crit proc having a 10s ICD, raising crit chance doesn't boost your damage output as significantly as it would for many builds. Thus, trading some precision away in return for not having to play as defensively may actually increase your DPS on some encounters if you're having trouble with mechanics. ## Why It Works As you can see from the rotations, what you want to accomplish depends largely on the number of targets available. This build's specialty is definitely multi-target encounters. In tests with my fairly suboptimal gear and with no tuning crystal, I've been able to test at around 22k DPS on a single-target, normal-size golem with realistic buffs. With ideal gear and consumables, I would expect to see that go up to around 25-26k, maybe as high as 28k under realistic buffs against a large golem. Those aren't top-of-the-line raid numbers, obviously--qT's DPS benchmarks put that at around hammer guardian level DPS, but this build doesn't offer protection across a large AoE like hammer guard--but there's a few things that make me think this build offers some good potential. Firstly, its primary strength: AoE situations. You may have noticed in the 3+ target rotation that I threw torch 5 in, which seems a bit odd given the skill's rather anemic damage. Hitting a single target, you would get three procs of Permeating Wrath in total (maybe a fourth if you're lucky), for 6,000-8,000 damage in total, plus whatever direct damage the skill causes. However, with 3+ targets and the Virtues line, a full channel of torch 5 with every tick hitting 3 targets will proc 10 stacks of burn on 5 targets, dealing around 20k burn damage to each target (unbuffed--with might this would increase to about 26.5k, further with engineer passive/GotL/banner buffs), plus the torch 5's direct damage. This is a continuing theme throughout the build--anything that hits multiple targets in a concentrated area will very rapidly increase the guardian's damage to each individual target due to Permeating Wrath. Placing a symbol on one foe for 4 seconds will get 4 ticks of damage off, for a single 4-second burn from PW (2k damage). Placing a symbol on 5 foes for 4 seconds will get 20 ticks of damage off, for 6-7 burns for 4 second on each target (12k); the scepter 2 symbol can add even more due to its additional hits. A sword autoattack chain hitting one target will strike 5 times (1+1+3) for 1-2 PW procs (2-4k damage). A sword autoattack chain hitting max targets (3+3+9) can proc PW 5 times (10k damage). A condi Necro with Epidemic can quickly turn a burst of burns from these sources into an absolute firestorm in a much larger radius, as well. Support-wise, this build can help fill in gaps in quickness uptime, applies a bit of vulnerability, adds a bit of CC, and can help add a few stacks of might and fury to its subgroup. It also has decent AoE condi removal, and can of course throw out a couple of AoE aegis applications and some minor heals in an emergency. However, these functions are all consistently available to meta guardian builds (though dragonhunters tend to bring the elite trap rather than FMW), so I'm not counting these as any sort of bonus over a normal dragonhunter build. Internally, the traits play off each other effectively. There's a number of damage bonuses, both to direct and burn damage. Burning a target gives bonus crit chance and damage, damage ticks cause burning frequently with PW, symbols burn enemies (both with damage ticks causing PW procs and the Symbolic Power trait), and crits cause more burning with Radiant Fire. This build is something of a hybrid. It does a lot of condition damage, and that's what I've focused the build around. At the same time, despite a lack of ferocity, you end up with a very significant amount of direct damage due to the number of multipliers available--I'd estimate that as much as 30-35% of the damage output comes as direct damage, potentially more if you're able to go the Unscathed Contender route. Simultaneously, the burns it applies are very short-duration, with the longest being 10 seconds and the shortest being 2. This means the build doesn't have a long ramp-up time; you can go from zero to max DPS within 4 seconds or so, which is rare for a condition build. Thus, invulnerable phases on bosses don't kill off your damage output as much as usual, and you can bring your full DPS output to a fight for longer than most condition classes. The damage rotations are also very simple, and the single-target rotation is entirely ranged. This can be advantageous in encounters such as Vale Guardian, where you can easily have this character sit in green circles, with basically no loss of damage output compared to a melee encounter, or when you need to kite an enemy or group. ## Why It (Sometimes) Doesn't Work Quite simply, there are better builds for single-target DPS. In a situation where you know you're going to be hitting one thing and only one thing at a time (many raid bosses), or when condition damage isn't viable (burn- or condi-immune enemies), you don't necessarily want to bring this build if you have other condition damage options available. It's also a bit squishy in its default configuration, and even the Carrion-trinket variant is hardly immune to being one-shot if you miss a major tell. ArenaNet, in their infinite wisdom, designed a number of enemies that are immune to specific conditions. If you're doing the Molten Duo fractal, for instance, **do not bring this build** unless your group is fine with you dealing less than a quarter of your normal DPS in the effigy miniboss fight! The effigy is immune to burning, and this absolutely neuters your damage output--a good chunk of crit chance and one of your damage multipliers are dependent on burning, so even your direct damage suffers against these enemies. A special shoutout goes to the Dredge: an entire race devoted to making your life absolutely miserable by rendering both of your AoE blinds useless. At least most of their attacks are projectiles, so sword/shield can block most of them... Heavy, constant condition pressure murders this build. You have two ways of removing 3 conditions apiece, on moderate cooldowns--and one of those ways is a part of your ideal damage rotation. Shelter is useless against damaging conditions ticking away on you. You can handle a condition burst every 15-20 seconds or so; anything more frequent than that and you'd better pray someone else in your group is stripping conditions for you. Oddly, in 3+ target scenarios, you can effectively remove conditions from allies via torch 5 as a part of your normal damage rotation. This doesn't help you personally at all, though. Solo enemies that are immune to direct damage will reduce your DPS output significantly. The red split on Vale Guardian is a good example; while you can deal reasonable damage to it you won't match a condi ranger or even a condi necro's damage output. *Don't use this build in WvW. Your allies will hate you. Your enemies will hate you. You will hate you. Please don't do it.* ## Odd Tricks * You can teleport 1800 units, place a symbol under your target, and instantly add up to 6 stacks of burn on a target (3 guaranteed, 3 from procs/luck) with a single combo. Symbol of Blades on the sword teleports instantly when you use the skill, but the blinding strike and symbol are only applied after a short animation. By targeting an enemy--even one outside Symbol of Blades' range--and using it, then immediately using Judge's Intervention before the attack animation finishes, you get to apply the every single effect from both the symbol and Judge's Intervention to your target. This combo will also one-shot very nearly any enemy below veteran rank in PvE, so it's fairly amusing to use. * Shield of Judgment is much better than is normal on a power build due to blocks burning the blocked enemy. Throwing out a shield 4 and allowing yourself to get hit can deal several thousand damage if you crit with the attack. I haven't yet verified whether the burn from a popped aegis counts towards the Shield Master achievement or not, but even without it the shield 4 attack does decent damage. If you want to get that achievement, this build will at least get you up to 500 killing blows with a shield with a bit of effort! * Using Chains of Light to immobilize a strong foe in a symbol is pretty common practice on the scepter, unless you specifically need to save scepter 3 for a breakbar. However, it's especially effective in this build: not only does the symbol do appreciable direct damage, the rapid hits from Symbol of Punishment proc PW and Symbolic Power. Additionally, both Chains of Light and the symbol will add vulnerability to the target foe--you can get up to 7 stacks from the combo. Nothing too special, but the 7% damage multiplier is effective for both the direct and condition damage aspects of the build, given that both sides already have other damage multipliers and deal significant damage. ## Conclusion While somewhat situational, I've had a lot of fun with this build in pretty much every area of the game as I've been developing and testing it. It's got enough survivability to traipse around open-world content at its own pace. It's got serious enough damage output even in single-target scenarios to make it somewhat respectable (if not exactly ideal) in raids. It's actually really good in (most) fractals, where large groups of enemies are fairly common and its flexibility in damage output, CC, and support come into play a bit more. Even if the idea of condition-oriented guardian doesn't exactly appeal to you, I'd offer you this challenge: go into the PvP lobby, set up [this approximation of the build](URL run over to the clustered target golems in the west, and run through a couple rotations, if only for a chuckle. Wiping out clusters of golems in a giant explosion of fire is fun! **TL;DR:** Trogdor was a Guardian. Torch 5 best DPS available to any class ever."
202,vulnerability,Guildwars2,My (non-refined) vision for how to improve Necromancer viability in raids: Condition BASED damage buff for allies.,0,5wm77j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5wm77j/my_nonrefined_vision_for_how_to_improve/,2017-02-28 16:30:33,"**TLDR:** An aura that increases damage for allies based on how many conditions you have on a target, sourcing from whichever target has the most unique conditions from you. Looking at the community response to the recent balance patch, Necromancer players feel left out due to lacking any decent team support functionality beyond a somewhat overlooked life steal buff, transfusion, and being a walking epidemic button. Furthermore, players feel (and with good reason) that to simply buff the damage of Necro to match that of other damage classes would make their inherent large hp bars overpowered as a result. As such, I propose a way to tackle this problem in a way that supports the aesthetic of condition master, does not involve just buffing the damage of Necromancer skills so they fall in line with other classes, and also provides decent party support function so bringing a Necromancer is more justified. (This won't help power necromancer builds as much, but is hopefully a start that additional feedback could build upon. My suggestion is for a new party buff: **Corruption's Reverie:** For every unique condition on a target (only tracks the target with the most conditions from you), increase the damage (both power and condition) of 5 nearby allies by 1% Corruption's Reverie plays on the Necromancers theme of corruption, allowing your allies to prey upon the weakness that you cause in your foes. This theme of a better outcome with more conditions already exists within the necromancer tool kit in the form of Feast of Corruption, as well as the trait Target the Weak. Also, it rewards a more complicated build/damage rotation; as getting more unique conditions on a foe increases the damage buff to allies. This even has synergy with current skills, as the Soul Reaping trait Dhuumfire provides burning, several traits provide necromancer with additional source of vulnerability, the Reaper Specialization already allows multiple conditions to be place on a target from one application of blind/chill, and a well used epidemic to a secondary target means every single condition is now sourced from you, providing a temporary power surge in damage. As for where this trait would go, my initial guess would be for this to replace the current Grandmaster trait weakening shroud, but this could vary depending on where people think a support aura like this should go. The important thing about this Corruption's Reverie is that it isn't trying to make Necro a dps class, as I believe Necro would be better suited for a support type playstyle; mainly due to the current top dps classes typically requiring a complicated damage roation, a glass cannon type build, or both. While it may need more changes in a similar vein to this one to fully resolve the problem of lack of raid identity, I think skills like this provide a unique way of giving Necro a justified place in raiding beyond bringing tools for very specific circumstances. I'd greatly appreciate your feedback on this, thanks in advance!"

Epidemic isn't broken. It's just a really fucking hard counter to meta gameplay. Current meta involves Revenants Pain Absorption skill. This gives your team the Resistance boon. It also sucks condi's to one player (the perfect target for Epi). Once a single Rev gets Epi'd, you get 3-5 downs due to the number of condi stacks it pulled from teammates. When you bring a Mallyx Rev, you bring this upon yourself. You made the meta. Now you have to live with it. Pain Absorption - Grant resistance to yourself and nearby allies. **Absorb conditions from those allies**, gaining additional resistance per condition. Epidemic - Apply vulnerability on yourself. Spread conditions on a target foe to all nearby foes. (5 person limit) Notes - Epidemic only applies up to 25 stacks of any given condition. If the skill is to be ""rebalanced"" I'd recommend a slightly longer casting time and a big tell similar to the glint elite. You can either bitch or adapt. Drop Mallyx and bring in condi clearing machines."

Why an engineer, cause engineers have a very awesome trait (and underused) that completely negates and screws over not only this build but stealth based skills in general. The trait is [Lock on](URL in the tools trait line. What this trait does is when you strike a foe in stealth, you you cast [analyze](URL which then applies a 6 sec revealed buff on the enemy along with 10 stacks of vulnerability. That's 6 secs of you being able to see and kill the thief, and you can do that every 25 secs, and its extremely easy to bring these thiefs out of stealth since all you need to do is aoe around their black powder or aoe in their shadow refuge to hit them and kill them. For example, just hammer 5 their shadow refuge and you will not only stun them, but bring them out of stealth and make it easy for you and any others to quickly kill them. Yes I know this requires a engineer and if you dont have one or play one, find a new engineer buddy for WvW. Source: I use this trait all the time in WvW roaming and kill these thiefs no problem. EDIT: Some people are misreading this or making no sense. 1. This is for roaming and low man/havoc groups where you are most likely to run into these thiefs, zergs can completely ignore them. 2. Yes this doesnt solve the overall problem of the thief build but until it is nerfed, this is a way to fight them and beat them. 3. If the ghost thief runs away from you or doesnt fight you cause of this, congrats you win cause now you dont have to deal with them. 4. This trait really helps out friendlies who are already engaged with these thief since you can come to their aid and reveal/stun them allowing you and your allies to quickly burst them down. Yes they may be tanky thanks to their stats but that doesn't make them unkillable. 5. Different ghost thiefs will take different skills/traits and so you may not kill every single one but even killing 1 over killing none is an improvement."

Jalis also drains -7. So I wanted to check what does more dmg and here is what i found out: **Setup** I chose to stay in Mallyx/Jalis while just auto attacking and letting the aura/Hammers puls until I ran out of energy and than reactivating them when I was at 50% energy again. I did this while having all buffs and all class specific buffs and 25 vulnerability on the golem. **Results** *19146 *18551 *19141 *18606 *19609 *19069 *20224 *19747 *20656 *20163 Jalis Mallyx **conclusion** Jalis does more dmg under the assumption that all hammers hit all the time and the boss does not move, if the boss does move I think it migth be safe to assume that ,due to mallyx stacking torment, it does more dmg. And another thing might up the dmg of mallyx, the qt rotation of revanant uses precision strike when off coldown and it would obvoiusly up the dmg somewhat by having 10% more power and ferocity. (I did not do this in my test becuase I dont actually main rev and am not even fully geared and did not want to screw up by messing my rotation up.) It would be awesome if someone with a fully acended rev could test this a little bit more and point out possible mistakes.

210,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Imagined Engineer Elite Spec: Branded Technician,0,5q3unw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5q3unw/imagined_engineer_elite_spec_branded_technician/,2017-01-26 02:42:08,"Imagined New Engineer Elite Spec: **Branded Technician** Technician, or Tech/Tec for short. EDIT: Formatting. I think it's readable now. **Introduction** Rata Sums head researchers from the college of Dynamics contacted priory scholars from the Black Citadel who specialized in Branded research. Utilizing Asuran Dynamics theory and extensive branded knowledge of priory scholars of the Black Citadel, Engineers, with the greatest affinity for electronic technology and magnetism can now harness the power of the Branded amplified by electrified basalt commonly found in the sands of Elona without succumbing to the manipulation of Kralkatorrik. Themes: Magnetism and Electric Charges Lore inspired by: URL and of course, Kralkatorrik. I really wanted to make an elite spec that was relevant to GW2 lore. Shout out to /r/Tulki and his previous post about the Aetherblade elite spec which inspired this elite spec. URL I. **Objectives:** * To specialize in/enhance combo fields &amp; finishers * Encourage other classes to utilize combo field and finishers. * To enhance core engineer gadgets. * To avoid adding another profession skill (because core engineer already has 5 profession skills which I think no profession should ever exceed) * To reduce the amount of stability currently being shared in game. (I noticed that there is a surplus of Stability being given by several classes so I introduced skills that prioritize stripping stability.) * To provide another reliable source of quickness I. **LIMITATIONS** While I do consider possible balance implications and counter plays to some of the abilities I add with this elite spec, I will not frequently give specific Cooldowns, ICD, durations, or any specific numerals for damage output. But I hope to hear your input on this. Secondly, I do not care if Anet will include this into their future expansions or not. I thought of this elite spec simply because it was fun. Although, if Anet decides to include even just ONE idea from this post, I would be extremely happy. They can freely take any ideas from this post. II. **Combo System Rework** * I considered removing light fields from Guardian symbols but then I remembered that they have traits involving keeping uptime of retaliation. Even though traits such as Radiant Retaliation from guardian are relatively unused, I would still like to avoid nerfing core classes for the sake of creating new elite specializations. * This change has been mentioned several times before and I completely agree with it. A players combo finishers should prioritize his or her own combo fields regardless of whomevers field was laid first. This way you can always blast your water fields even when several fields overlap in boss fights. This makes Engie healing builds more viable. * Make Whirl finishers reliable. How it works now is that whirl finishers shoot bolts randomly. For the rework, whirl and projectiles should not be too strong but at least reliable, thus I suggest whirl finishers to fire in waves, 5 projectiles in 5 directions (similar to how Cantrip Tornado 4 skill for elementalist works.) with an ICD of 1 or 2 seconds. This is useful for bosses with large hit-boxes; large bosses will be hit by all 5 projectiles if you whirl in their hitbox. In addition, whirl projectiles should be homing up to a 45/60 degree angle from the direction they are fired from. Thus its possible to hit an enemy with 3 bolts if theyre close enough. * The second dilemma is how to reliably cast finishers on other players fields that you intend to during a 10 man or 5 man scenario during battle. In other words, if players cast light, fire, then dark field in that order, how would you be able to finish in the fire field since its sandwiched in between two finishers? For this, I introduce the Field Conversion utility. See Utilities section. III. **PROFESSION MECHANIC** Magnetic Fields: The Magnetic field is a combo field exclusively produced by the Branded Technician. It slows enemies standing in the field; the technicians fields produce unique effects when players finish in its area. Blast  AOE Quickness(2 secs); Whirl/projectile  Quickness (1s); Leap - Knockdown (2 sec) (Blast skills excite electric charges in the magnetic field, thus speeding up allies movements. Projectiles are hastened because they pass through magnetic fields which increase their velocity, Yes its weird that the character benefits from this but this is also how regeneration works. Leaping propels you through magnetic propulsion then allows you to pummel someone with the heavy gravity of your weapon unto them) IV. **WEAPON** Mace Main-hand (I know Bolt would have been thematic with this elite spec but I think Mace is the better choice for my ideas) Auto attack: **Anode Amputator**  Bash an enemy with a crack of electricity. **Branded Bonk**  Hinder your enemys movement by absorbing electricity in their body. Slows the enemy for 1 second. **Circuit Crescendo**  After gathering electricity from your enemy, whirl your mace to create a magnetic surge. Whirl Finisher. Weapon skill 2. **Kinetic Jolt**  Jump towards your enemy, immobilizing enemies from where you leapt from and immobilizing your target. (Leap Finisher) Weapon skill 3. **Magnetize Chains**  Pull all Immobilized targets towards you then create a magnetic field. Probably 5 targets. V. **TRAITS** **NOTE** I was greatly inspired by the daredevil and chronos traits when I made these. Whats amazing about the DD traits is that the grandmaster major trait greatly influence the playstyle of the class depending on which you equip. While for Chrono, the three trait lines represent a different type of focus: I.e the 1st focuses on utilizing slow, the 2nd enhances shatter potential, and the 3rd is related to alacrity and quickness. For the Branded Technician, I decided that the pattern would be 1) Enhancing Magnetic Fields, 2) Improving core Engineer traits, 3) Improving finishers. **ADEPT** **Minor**  Access to the main hand Mace, Glamours, and Magnetic Fields **Major** 1. Increased Gravity Slowing enemies also cripples them. Deal 10% more damaged to slowed enemies. 2. Polarity Wall: Shield skills now create a Magnetic Field upon hitting a target. (In the case of shield 4 it will simply cast 1 AOE on the player even when it hits 5 targets. Shield 5 will only produce a magnetic field when it is thrown and makes contact with the first enemy it hits. ) 3. Propulsion Fields - Allied players projectiles are propelled by the power of magnetism when they pass through magnetic fields, thus granting a 10% damage bonus for projectiles that pass through Magnetic fields. **MASTER** **Minor**:** Synchronized Fields**  apply an effect to yourself and allies that increases the duration of their combo fields by 2 seconds. **Major** 1. **Electrified Pulses**  Enemies standing in Magnetic fields take damage over time. 2. **Electrode Instability** - Glamours strip stability off enemies. Enemies whose stability has been stripped are knocked down and weakened. Against monsters, monsters are knockdown and weakened with or without stability. (The idea here is that characters with stability are heavier thus they have stronger magnetic potential. This also works in favour of classes like thief who have little to no access to stability; they can just walk through these AOEs with little trouble) 3. **Gadget Technician** - Gadget skills have added effects and toolbelt skills now become either a blast, leap, or whirl finisher. * Rocket Boots knockback foes from initial impact then land with an explosion at the end of a leap. Tool belt skill is now a whirl and burns in a radius. * Slick Shoes now inflict weakness upon initial knockdown and pulse it within its AOEs. Tool belt skill is now a leap. * Throw Mine : The gadget now releases 5 mines in the target area. Inflicts random conditions in an aoe per mine in addition to boon stripping. Tool belt skill, detonating mines is now a blast finisher for each mine exploding. * Utility Goggles: For its duration, enemies within the radius will be revealed, revealed enemies gain 5 stacks of Vulnerability. Toolbelt Skill is now a projectile finisher * Personal Battering Ram. Range is now cone shaped; Ram is also unblockable and ignores stability. Toolbelt skill is already a projectile finisher but now the Technician whirls and sends several Rams around the user (5 rams) * A.E.D. Cast time increased to 2 seconds. Stun Break. If you are interrupted while casting during the 2 seconds, you are healed for a large amount, if you cast the full 2 seconds, you are healed for a small amount. Still removes Burning, Bleeding, Poison, Torment. Toolbelt skill is now a Projectile Finisher. **Note**: I basically scrapped the fatal damage condition and instead made the activation condition when interrupted. This makes it more forgiving and similar to Revenant wherein you do not want to attack the Technician while casting it. **GRANDMASTER** **Minor**: Multidisciplinary - Executing either: a leap, whirl, or blast finisher gives an added effect depending on which grandmaster trait you equip: reduce 10% damage received, 15% condi duration, or 10% more direct damage respectively for a duration. **Major**: 1. **Highspeed Volt** - Gain superspeed on leap finisher. Leap finishers regenerate health and cleanse all movement impairing conditions (Chilled, Immobilized, Cripple) Synchronized Fields enhances the effectiveness of allies leap finishers. (this trait is essentially the leap version of Unhindered Combatant) 2. **Bipolar Bomber**  Blast Finishers execute twice. Synchronized Fields enhance the effectiveness of allies blast finishers. 3. **Charged Rotations**  Whirl and Projectile finishers bounce among targets up to 3 times each. Synchronized Fields enhance the effectiveness of allies whirl and projectile finishers. **NOTE** when I say ""enhance"", I mean that leap/projectile/whirl/blast does more numerical output, conditions/boons have increased durations etc. **VI. UTILITIES Glamour**  (Durations already factor in Synchronized Fields +2 sec duration) 1. **Heal: Magnetized Momentum**: This AOE pulses slight healing and grants immunity from and cleanses movement impairing conditions (and slow) while standing in the glamour. Large heal at final pulse. 2. **Area Inversion**: Leave a glamour that converts an enemy area of effect skill or if this skill is casted onto an enemys Area of Effect skill, the foes skill is re-casted on the same location and registers as the players area of effect. Duration is reset according to the original skills duration plus 2 seconds from Synchronized Fields. New area of affect is still affected by glamour traits. If this glamour is not used on another area of effect, then it acts as an ordinary Magnetic Field. Skills without combo fields such as Meteor shower are not affected by this skill. 3. **Polarity Dome**  6 seconds. Lay a well that reflects enemy projectiles. If an enemy shoots a projectile from within the glamour, the projectiles reflected become AOE damage on hit. Combo Field: Magnetic **NOTE:** Thematically, projectiles in the dome are suppose to just bounce everywhere at tremendous speeds because of the constant push and pull mechanism, but that is likely to reduce framerate so I think an AOE attack is good enough to represent this.) 4. **Ionic Currents**: Supercharge your allies weapons to shock enemies. (the same buff that tempests get when they finish casting their overload air) Combo field: Magnetic 5. **Field Conversion**, glamour, gain a Conversion Buff. While this buff is active, the next field you lay down will convert all subsequent fields that overlap the next field you place down convert into its current element. Combo fields produced by this skill are still affected by glamour traits. (E.g. I have the buff, I put down a fire field with bomb 2, now for the duration of the field, guardian light fields turn into fire, Mesmer wells turn to fire, etc. when they overlap my fire field) (The only combo field Engineer does not have access to is Dark field, which is blind and lifesteal) 6. **Elite: Repulsion Field**  10 seconds, Time Warp size. Create a Glamour that nullifies the effects enemies currently placed and subsequent area of effects placed in its area. If another Repulsion Field is placed upon this field, the two fields will cancel each other out. **NOTE** This skill is heavily inspired by the Professor/Scholars skill from Ragnarok Online called Land Protector/Magnetic Earth. URL In RO, Magnetic Earth also prevented friendly aoes from working in the area. I removed this to prevent trolling, then made it an elite so matches dont turn into pirate ship metas wherein in both wvw and pvp wherein everyone moves along the magnetic earth. **VII. SYNERGY W/ PROFESSIONS AND OTHER NOTES** * Synchronized Fields will improve the DPS of field dependent classes such as Elementalist, Guardians, Condition warrior, Well Necros, condi Revenants and subsequently increase the support capabilities of Chronomancers, Engineers, Druids. Also its traited glamours which increase ranged damage output via Propulsion Fields and AOE damage over time through Electric Pulses may possibly secure it a spot in fractals, and perhaps even raids as either DPS or a Utility. * Thieves: I dont see that much synergy with this class. Perhaps longer blind fields or dark fields (SR). But beyond that? None. Again, these synergies are just a consequence of the ideas I came up with for this spec, so Im sorry I didnt consider thieves. * I initially wanted to create an engineer elite spec that discouraged the use of kits, empowered gadgets AND turrets but I think it was too much to handle for just one elite spec; It would have been counter-intuitive to discourage kits because of their access to fields and finishers. I foresee that anyone who would want to equip this elite spec in PVE would spec 2 kits, 1 glamour, and mortar elite while in WVW possibly 2 glamour utilities, elite glamour and grenade kit for ranged condi pressure. * PVP: This class would likely still take a bunker role, taking mace/shield but would take the elite glamour which will make or break teamfights. Unless they have a Technician as well, in which case, their elites will cancel each other. Perhaps this class can also see a DPS role if spec-ed for cc and damaging glamours plus double blast finishers. **VIII. POTENTIAL ISSUES WITH THIS SPEC** * Unsure if Area Inversion should work on Boss AOES. This could potentially be game breaking. At the very least, this skill will not work on skills that have a opaque orange (such as shatterer shard storm) or green aoes (Such as Vale guardians wipe skill) but may work on red circles. * Field Conversion also has trolling potential, like turning all fields into light with condis in your team. * I intended the mace elite to be compatible with the engineer shield, not off-hand pistol, thus the lack of synergy between mace and pistol. It could be possible to see mace/pistol combination (which is highly unorthodox and Id love to see it) but its beyond me to think of any at the moment. * Im still debating on whether Multidisciplinary or Gadget Technician should be a major and the former a minor. But if Gadget Technician became a minor, then Technicians would be forced into a trait even when they dont use gadgets. Similarly, this has become an issue with minor trait Impact Savant for Scrapper since Gyros lost their ability to Daze. * Upon review, the gadgets do seem tacked on. Still, I do like that they provide more finishers which this spec is also supposed to specialize in. "
211,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[LN] 5-Man Sabetha - 18s left on timer,114,5qodtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5qodtk/ln_5man_sabetha_18s_left_on_timer/,2017-01-29 03:30:57,"Hey Guys! After many tries, a ton of theorycrafting and testing and hours of practice we are finally proud to present you with our 5-Man Sabetha kill, beating the last boss of w1 with 18 seconds left on the timer! Condi Druid (TaDe): URL Condi Warrior (Fail): URL Condi Ranger (Nightmare): URL Condi Ranger (Roca): URL Chronomancer (Wanda): Unavailable/RIP File So here a bit of info about our tactics (and there is a lot we did differently here): The first thing you will notice is our group composition. While most people use Elementalists on Sabetha, we found that core condi Ranger is actually the strongest for the encounter. Not only that (many of you mightve already known), but condi Ranger can also do Cannons extremely fast and efficiently, apllying a lot of condis in a short time and then going back to Sabetha as the cannons ticks down. This didnt work quite as well when we did south, as it prevented the ranger from getting into a decent rotation for the rest of the fight, which is basically the reason we decided to skip south and leave it up throughout the whole fight. Ultimately, this left our rangers with much higher dps than ele (even without take root this was slightly better). Which brings me to the next topic: Take Root. Wow that skill is broken. We were hesitant to use this skill at first as we werent sure whether race-skills are allowed for records, but the general consent seemed to be of the opinion that racial skills should be treated like any other skill during a record. Also there have been other records already that made use of racial skills. So, first we used this on our condi rangers (obviously). Later and after a bunch more tests we also used it on our druid and ultimately just said Fuck it, lets everyone use it - except Mesmer ofc. Even for our Condi Warrior this resulted in a dps-increase. As most of our runs only used Take Root on our two condi rangers I think I can say with some confidence that the kill would have been possible even without Take Root on Druid and Warrior, but since it increased our time by a few very valuable seconds we decided to roll with it. Our Druid was also playing a vital role in our tactic. To provide the Rangers with the highest possible boon uptime, he had to be very careful about his positioning. Standing on the opposite side of Sabetha led to Sabetha turning around between each of her skills led to her attacks being delayed and less pressure for the dps classes. Also he took the first time bomb after every flamewall and integrated doing this in his kiting and his rotation. He was also the one looking out for heavy bombs alongside the Mesmer. He took storm spirit to bring the necessary vulnerability to the fight and used the shatter to make up for CC on Knuckles that our warrior wouldve otherwise provided with headbutt. He brought Wyvern and Glyph of Equality to suppress Adds as they wouldve otherwise knocked us around a lot more. He was basically in charge of looking out for almost everything and the hidden carry of this run. Our Mesmer was obviously in charge of boon uptimes (quickness, alacrity, etc.). His special job was to pull adds to the middle so that our Rangers and Druid could suppress them with their pets, preventing knock-backs. This was a lot more important than one would think. He also helped out with heavy bombs and provided invulnerability in dire situations (this actually saved the run during Karde). He played with Illusions instead of Domination to increase Alacrity uptime (important for condi rangers). Our warrior was in charge of killing Kardes flame turrets asap. With enough dps we managed to kill Karde spawning only 2 Flame turrets, which he could kill off quite well without wasting any dps on the boss. The warrior took Take Root instead of headbutt, which changed his rotation a bit at the beginning of the fight and delayed our might-uptime during the first phase, but ultimately increased our dps. Our Rangers were in charge of the Cannons as previously mentioned. One of the rangers was assigned 2/4 while the other one had to take care of only one cannon and could focus a lot more on dps. Each of our Rangers also brought a dps-spirit (frost/sun), so our druid could bring storm spirit for vulnerability and CC. We made sure to not waste our Take Root on Kernen and Knuckles but instead kept them for dps-phases on Sabetha and Karde. The Ranger that had only one cannon also used his Wyvern CCs to suppress the adds whenever they were pulled by the Mesmer. Ultimately, we want to thank our fellow guildmate Farbstoff for his help in the theorycrafting-process. We were originally going to do a 6-Man kill, but wanted to go for the 5-Man rather soon as we saw how well our tactics worked, so he took one for the team and left the spaces to our rangers. Sorry for the wall of text guys, I hope you will enjoy our kill  ps.: No skill-clicking on this one! "
212,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Designing Guardian's missing skills (and spirit weapons).,8,5sh5ok,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5sh5ok/designing_guardians_missing_skills_and_spirit/,2017-02-07 08:44:14,"**Hello nice people of r/Guildwars 2!** EDIT: got some nice feedback, thanks! Now, let me address common concerns: while I mention Tarir for the guardian elite armor, I mostly use that name to suggest the shape that the armor should have, but I'm not saying it should be that precise armor with those precise colors. It's just to create an idea of how an elite armor should look. Second, a lot of people dislike the idea of an Elite Armor being the elite skill of spirit WEAPON skills. Understandable, let's work around this. Especially because a lot of person are also missing tomes, and they think that Elite Spirit Weapons could replace that. Overall, it looks like Promised Land is the most liked of the bunch. A little while ago I wrote a post about [Mesmer's missing skills](URL and how to fill those gaps. We had a nice discussion and I got some nice feedback, so I wanted to try again, this time with Guardian, another close contender to my favorite profession in GW2. For Guardian's skills, we have Shelter that is a type-less skill, and we are missing Heal Spirit Weapon, Heal Consecration, Elite Spirit Weapon and Elite Consecration. As a small disclaimer, for this suggestion I'll also include a small rework for how spirit weapons works, since in their current iteration I can't manage to think about a spirit weapon skills that would be useful while following the same format as the current spirit weapons skills, which are kinda underperforming in both PvE and PvP. On top of that, I believe that while a lot of people suggest Shelter turning into a Consecration Skills, it could potentially break the balance of a skill that's already really powerful and a strong choice as Guardian healing spell. Because of that, affecting Shelter cooldown with the Consecration traits could be a double edged sword. On one hand you can have another lever to balance the skill effectiveness, on the other you could potentially make that trait mandatory. In both scenarios, is not a decision to take lightly. However, I'll also try to design a possible version of Shelter as a Consecration spell. Without further ado, let's start with the spirit weapon update. **Spirit Weapons**: Spirit weapons are now always active as passive effects; they visually follow the Guardian around, and they add damage to his attacks, or enhance Virtue effects. Using their active skill would put the spirit weapons on cooldown, disabling the passive for the duration (follows the same principle of Virtues). |__________________________________________________| **NEW Heal Spirit Weapon: Staff of Resolve** A staff follows you around, increasing the rate at which Virtue of Resolve ticks, and causing half the effect of Virtue of Resolve to continue after the virtue is used. On activation, heals for a medium amount and disables the passive effect. **Spirit Weapon: Bow of Truth** A bow follows you around, and every X landed istance of damage from weapon skills, applies ""costantia sapients"" on the guardian, causing the next condition applied to the guardian to miss, and one condition is turned into a boon when the buff is consumed. On activation, pulses waves of cleansing arrow in a wide area near the target location (or the guardian if no target is present), cleansing conditions from nearby allies. **Spirit Weapon: Hammer of Wisdom** An hammer follows you arond, and on each final istance of a weapon chainskill, (or every X istance from ""automatic"" weapons), increases damage. On activation, knocks down the guardian target. **Spirit Weapon: Shield of the Avenger** A shield follows you around, blocking projectiles every few seconds, and causing Virtue of Courage to also grant regeneration when used or when the passive Aegis is consumed. On activation, it flies out weaking multiple foes and granting Aegis to allies. **Spirit Weapon: Sword of Justice** A greatsword follows you around, striking foes near you and applying Burning to foes far from you every X attacks, and causing Virtue of Justice passive effect to also apply vulnerability. On activation, pierces a target dealing damage and applying vulnerability. **NEW Elite Spirit Weapon: Enchanted Armor.** A smaller enchanted armor (similar to those in Tarir) follows you around, increasing damage dealt and reducing damage taken. On activation, summons an enchanted armor to drop on your location, knocking targets back, and attacking any targets that comes in range for a short duration, before disappearing with an healing wave. **EDIT Alternative Elite Spirit Weapon: Tome of Judgement** Unlike other elite skills, this one lacks a passive effect, but instead summons a tome to use in battle when activated. The tome has strong offensive skills, both as AoE and single target, and crowd control/utility skills that significantly reduce remaining duration/charges of the tome. When the tome vanishes, grants stability to the Guardian and remove conditions. The guardian can still access his or her utility skills while wielding the tome, but doing so also consumes the Tome duration/charges **EDIT Alternative Elite Spirit Weapon: Spirit Arsenal** Summons all your spirit weapons to momentarily defend you, knocking away enemies on cast and proceeding to deal massive damage to any enemy that comes near the guardian. However, summoning all the weapons places a heavy burden on the guardian, severely reducing his or her speed, but also granting him stability. &gt;comment: For those skills, I tried to keep the functions that spirit weapons currently have, reimagining them in a way that's slightly more functional and that lives up to he fantasy of spirit weapons, following you around and attacking your enemies. For the staff, I tried to imagine something that's unique enough from the current guardian heals while retaining the core functions of what a spirit weapons is supposed to do, and the general synergy that Guild Wars 2 loves so much between traits and skill types, trying to avoid overlapping weapons with signet (albeit they are similar in a certain way, having passive effect and active skills). I also considered ditching active skills, to make the passives stronger and to keep them different from signets, but it's a drastic option, and I guess it was worth a try to salvage the previous versions of Spirit weapons. **EDIT:** for the alternative elite spirit weapon skills, I used some feedback I got in the early comments. As I've stated in the first edit above, many expressed discomfort with the elite weapon skill being an armor instead of, you know, weapon, and also wanted the tome back. I'm not a huge fan of the tome as Bundle skill tend to be too little impactful to be worth sacrificing the immediate access to your weapon skills, but maybe, if you still retain your other utility skills, it could work. **Shelter as a Consecration skill** Blocks attacks while healing, and creates a small zone of respite below the guardians, granting Protection to allies that cross it. &gt;I already explained why I think that Shelter is a tricky skills to tune and balance, so I'd rather keep it simple and retain the identity it already has, add something terrain related to make it a proper consecration skills. **NEW Elite Consecration: Promised Land** Creates a blessed area where downed allies passively revive, and enemies cannot rally. &gt;this was definitely something tricky. Consecrations cover already a lot of ground, and I definitely didn't want to add more tools to the guardian creating a worse copy of another profession's skill. So instead I thought about something that could work with Guardian's identity and role, and I thought of an Elite skills that makes allies harder to kill while negating enemies the ""thrill"" of combat from rallies. |_________________________________________________| And that pretty much covers all of Guardian missing skills. Again, as for mesmers, I didn't cover duration and cooldowns as of course it's hard to understand how effective they are on balance and the current state of the game. And anyway, I was more interested in discussing how to design the Guardian's missing skills than discussing game balance, altough of course skills do affect game balance. "
213,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[Just for fun] Ranger Elite Spec: Warden,28,5tjkj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5tjkj5/just_for_fun_ranger_elite_spec_warden/,2017-02-12 15:14:47,"Hi, Reddit! I've been lurking on this sub for months as GW2 has crept back into my life, and I've really enjoyed being a part of this cozy little gaming community. I wanted to commemorate this by sharing this idea for an Elite Spec I've had rattling around in my head. I'm no stranger to GW2 but I'm new to posting on Reddit so please excuse any weak formatting. Especially since I'm working on a potato phone. :) Without further ado... [RANGER ELITE SPEC: WARDEN] The Warden is a protector of nature with a strong affinity for their animal companions. They do not keep pets, they keep lifelong friends with which they share a deep spiritual connection. Wardens can tap into the abilities of their animals and in return they use their strong defensive capabilities to keep them alive and well. [PROFESSION MECHANIC: ADULT PETS/ADVANCED PET COMMANDS] Wardens do not simply tame animals, they make lifelong friends of them. Wardens can train animals well past the juvenile state and the older beasts are able to carry out much more complex orders. The stronger adults have increased health and stats, but the extra training that has gone into raising an adult means Wardens can only fight with one pet at a time. Warden Pet Commands: -Attack my Target -Return to me -Pet Special Attack -Defend me: Pet tanks a portion of all incoming damage for 2 seconds. Stacks with ""Protect Me!"" Shout for a potentially massive defensive combo at the expense of pet health (Consider increasing the cooldown of ""Protect Me!"" for balancing purposes). -Hold them off: The warden's pet performs a CC action that varies with the pet's species. These are in addition to pet skills already in their AI rotation, thus consider lowering the duration of pet CC skills for balance. [PROFESSION WEAPON: SHIELD] Wardens fight with a shield and fearlessly leap to both man and beast's defense. Combined with clever positioning, a shield-bearing Warden and his pet make for quite the durable duo! Shield Skill 4: WARG SPASM. The Warden and his pet trade spaces and strike simultaneously, breaking out of stun. Shield Skill 5: BESTIAL DEFENSE. The warden channels a barrier of druidic energy that can be detonated to knockback foes and grant x seconds of protection to allies. [NEW PROFESSION SKILL: PHYSICALS] The Warden is so in tune with their pet that they can borrow attributes from them, which vary by pet attributes. Determining factors are the pet's highest stat. POWER pets allow might generation where applicable and change PHYSICAL combo fields to LIGHTNING. CONDITION pets allow vulnerability where applicable and changes combo fields to POISON. TOUGHNESS pets allow protection generation and changes combo fields to SMOKE. This will be denoted by variable Y in the following descriptions: SOARING STRIKE. The Warden LEAPS to the target location, generating Y for X seconds. Leap Finisher. Cures Immobilize and Chill. BEAST ROAR. The Warden looses a primal roar so potent it alters the landscape and fears foes. Blast finisher. Generates Y Combo field. DRAKESKIN: Grants retaliation + Y buff to Warden and Pet. Reflects Projectiles. When skill expires fragments of bones and scales erupt in front of you, reflecting projectiles and causing bleeding. HEALING SKILL, SWARM: The Warden teleports to their pet and heals. The pet heals the Warden for a percentage of damage done for X seconds. ELITE SKILL, TWIN SOUL: Warden and pet gain stability, break stun, and simultaneously leap towards the target in a dual attack. Leap finisher. Cleaves enemies along the way. Warden and pet switch places along the way. Whirl Finisher. WARDEN TRAIT LINE. I'm no expert at build theory and am overwhelmed at this part of the build design. If any of you guys found this remotely interesting/entertaining, feel free to drop some input! For now I will post only the Grandmaster traits. GRANDMASTER TRAITS. 1. GORILLA ASPECT. Auto attacks are slower but have a chance to trigger protection to Warden and pet. Attack damage affected by RANGE has the highest chance of triggering at MAX RANGE and attacks with CHAINS have the highest chance at the end of the chain. 2. HUNTER'S PREPARATION. All other skill types (Traps, Survival, etc) add x condition or boon in addition to their effects for X seconds. Survival: Blind Traps: Confusion Shout: Retaliation 3. TWO SOULS, ONE BODY Your pet cannot be used but weapon and skill damage is augmented and your pet's PHYSICAL skill augmentation still applies. ELITE SKILL TWIN SOUL is augmented to become TWIN STRIKE, a two-part whirling attack. And that's all I got for now, folks. Much love if you've made it this far! Again, I'm no expert, and there are surely ways that this concept can be more smoothly expressed. But I wanted to riff off game aspects that haven't been explored much. Does this spec appear to allow for build variety, my personal mark of a well designed class? YOU DECIDE!"
214,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Should vulnerability be different in pve?,2,5ts9m7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5ts9m7/should_vulnerability_be_different_in_pve/,2017-02-13 21:56:11,"25% damage buff is pretty good, one of the best debuff in the game probably. But the problem is how easy and forgiveable is to achieve this bonus damage against mobs in pve, specially on bosses. At the moment, we don't even have to try to stack it, neither to keep it at maximum, in a 5\10 men situation, or on world bosses, autoattacks and procs are enough. My point is that this debuff should be harder to mantain and more rewarding, debuffing an enemy should be part of the gameplay, this could even benefit class\build diversity. One possible change could be a ""vulnerability bar"" or ""armor bar"" like the defiance one on champions and above, the more you fill it, the more you damage the target, it would be almost the same thing but it would require some extra efford to work on this bar, and to compensate this ""new role"" the cap could be higher than 25% [maybe 33%] or still 25% with extra effects when you reach a certain % of the bar. Another change could be reducing a lot vulnerability duration and improve the stacking of certain weapons\traits\sigils\runes to actually feel that you're using it. What do you think? any idea?"

Needless to say, I feel more like a new player rather than a returning one, so I would like to see answers to some questions about the endgame that were not quite explained in the returning/new player FAQ. Sadly, none of my friends I started playing with are active today, meaning I cant annoy them with my noobishness first, so here I am instead. Thanks to anyone who even considers reading through this wall of text and possibly helping me to not appear as a complete idiot once I enter my first fractal or raid. There are also less elaborate TLDR versions of the questions where necessary. 1. In the raids and fractals, are you supposed to do just pure max personal DPS (like in certain other MMO where every millisecond not spent doing damage is a waste), or are you also expected to take care of healing and supporting others via non-DPS means such as creating combo fields? In other words, are there dedicated healers and supports, or is it more about everyone doing a bit of everything? **TLDR:** In PVE, should I focus entirely on my DPS rotation or use some support/healing as well? 2. Are the builds on sites like Metabattle and Quantify the only viable ones if you want to be competitive, or can you experiment more with your build and still be considered useful? Is it a cookie cutter style or can we move some traits here and there? 3. Back in 2014, I used to run a spec for dungeons with dual daggers (Ele) that focused on condition damage and switched between Fire and Earth. It seems to me that this spec still has a lot o synergy between traits and stats, but the Tempest/Air/Fire stuff that is so popular looks quite weird to me on the paper. I cant see the Tempest tree providing any significant DPS increase outside from the overload stuff, which sadly forces you to stay in melee range even with a staff, eliminating the advantage of better positioning. You dont even get to use some of the Air traits at all (like the movement speed), as you apparently stay mostly in Fire. Yet tempest seems to be so praised everywhere, even when all the focus seems to be on dealing more damage with all that berserker gear. Could someone explain to me why it is better than the raw +damage stuff in Arcane? **TLDR:** What makes Tempest better than Arcane? Is it normal that staff tempest needs to remain in melee range? 4. Ive managed to snatch some ascended gear for Laurels (rings, neck and a single accessory). What am I supposed to do with the infusions slots? Stuff like +5 power and some of that agony resistance for hundreds of gold doesnt seem really appealing to me. I guess the resist has some purpose, but are we really supposed to hoard hundreds of gold before being able to survive in Fractals, or is it just stuff for rich people who need some gold sink? **TLDR:** What to do with the infusion slots as a rather poor and newish player? 5. I have over 80 Mystic Coins. I desperately need more gold for stuff like the infusions, but even after looking at the recipes listed on the wiki, I cant put a value on them right now. Should I keep them, or sell them now and buy them back later when I actually need them for something specific? 6. My gear is now full exotic with some of that ascended stuff from the Laurel/WvW vendor. It took me exactly three days to get all this without spending much gold (except for the ascended stuff, which I got from those hoarded laurels and WvW points that I somehow received despite me never even entering WvW in the past, thanks A.net I guess). Is it really so easy to get the gear to enter the endgame, or am I missing something? Is the exotic stuff from dungeons and main quest rewards enough to enter fractals and raids, or do I need to somehow get more ascended gear for the agony resistance first? Also, is it better to have an ascended ring with condi dmg (from my original condi spec), or an exotic one with berserker stats as an Ele now? **TLDR:** Are dungeon exotic items good enough to be competitive in PVE? 7. If I apply vulnerability, does it also affect conditions already ticking on the target, or does it work only for the ones applied during its presence? Do the conditions then keep recalculating for each tick, or do they keep dealing the same damage ticks until their expiration even after the vulnerability drops? Things like this used to be quite a big deal in WoW some years back, so it intrigues me here as well. **TLDR:** How do conditions interact with vulnerability? Do they change dynamically with each tick, or keep the damage once applied? 8. There are some traits providing Might that are avoided in the Ele builds on the sites mentioned above, even when they seem like a better choice (moar power). Does it mean that there is a cap on Might stacks and you reach it from other party members, rendering those traits meaningless in groups? Im talking especially about Persisting Flames, which I cant even trigger on my own without switching to earth for the blast finisher, vs. Pyromancers Puissance, that grants a lot of Might without any additional effort. **TLDR:** Do boons have some stack cap that is easily reached in a party?

216,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"[PvE][Solo][Mesmer] DPS comparison of Sword, Greatsword, and Scepter when using different specializations",74,5um7tm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5um7tm/pvesolomesmer_dps_comparison_of_sword_greatsword/,2017-02-18 00:54:59,"It's been about two years since I adopted mesmer as my second main class. A lot has changed about mesmer since HoT and through the various balance patches; but its fundamental identity and playstyle has persevered, as has its potential to make many things trivial in solo play, particularly bosses. Recently I decided to attempt to quantify a number of builds in order to see how each trait combination and weapon set performs. I have a lot of information to share and only 40,000 characters, so I'll jump right into it. **For the entire post, please assume whenever I make a statement that it applies to *solo PvE Power-based mesmer and chronomancer builds only*.** *** #Introduction Here are a few things I will state about the builds I've tested: * Full Assassin gear with Precision infusions tends to produce the highest DPS, as much as 20% greater than full Berserker with Power infusions. * Generating and maintaining Might has priority over adding damage modifiers, because Might on the mesmer affects their phantasms, while damage modifiers don't. * Superior Sigil of Air is a higher self-DPS increase than Superior Sigil of Force under most circumstances. * Illusionary Swordsman (Sword) is the highest DPS phantasm, followed by Illusionary Berserker (Greatsword), then Illusionary Warden (Focus) and Illusionary Duelist (Pistol). * Due to the new player-controlled AI mechanics, ranged phantasms no longer have a niche advantage over melee phantasms, because bosses can no longer effectively cleave melee phantasms to death. * It is always best to begin a fight with three phantasms if possible. * Mantras aren't a significant DPS increase, but provide important utility for soloing. * Wells are a significant DPS increase, even if the caster doesn't stand in them. Alacrity and Quickness apply to phantasms, increasing their DPS and thus the mesmer's total DPS. **Weapons** Sword is the standard melee mainhand option. It offers Blurred Frenzy, a long channeled evade that roots the mesmer while dealing high cleaving damage in front of them. The DPS of sword builds will vary depending on whether Blurred Frenzy is cast on cooldown, or saved for mechanics to avoid them while continuing to deal damage. Sword synergizes best with the Dueling and Illusions specializations taken together. Greatsword is the standard ranged option. It produces its highest DPS when it stands more than 900 range away from its target. Through its Domination trait, in addition to other sources, it allows the mesmer to sustain 25 Might. Greatsword builds rely on phantasms to take aggro, so its damage varies depending on which types of phantasms are active. Greatsword is somewhat dependent on the trait Imagined Burden in the Domination specialization. Scepter is a midrange weapon with a hybrid damage setup. It competes with Greatsword for the ranged role, allowing more flexibility with offhand choices, but produces much less Might, and relies even more on its phantasms to do the work. Still, Scepter builds can easily replace their Sword phantasms, so their DPS variance is much smaller compared to Greatsword. Scepter/Sword contains two blocks, but they should only be used in extreme cases, as they spawn clones, and thus replace a phantasm. Scepter is largely dependent on the trait Malicious Sorcery in the Illusions specialization. **Videos** The names of each build below link to YouTube videos of me performing the rotations. The videos are a single take, divided up by trait combination. Annotations on screen should provide quick access to each rotation. I chose not to make any cuts because it is known that I am personally invested in the results of this test, so I wanted to take steps to create trust and demonstrate that every rotation was made with the same equipment, traits, and food. As each video is a single take, there are a few minor mistakes in a few rotations throughout the tests; I am confident these errors have little impact on the results due to the length of each test, as well as the normal expected variance threshold. **Notes** The damage range of Sword builds are determined by how often they use Blurred Frenzy. Since it is not always ideal to cast Blurred Frenzy on cooldown, due to being able to use it as a defensive skill, I ran two separate tests, one with a rotation that casts Blurred Frenzy on cooldown, and another which never casts Blurred Frenzy. This gives the build a defined DPS range within which it falls somewhere, depending on the encounter. The damage range of Greatsword builds are determined by which phantasms it has active. In solo play, phantasms get targeted and killed by bosses, and Greatsword builds cannot easily replace their Sword phantasms without taking the DPS loss of switching to Scepter attacks. It is often better to simply continue DPSing using Greatsword phantasms, which are easier to replace. To determine Greatsword's DPS range, I ran two separate tests, one with a rotation that uses Sword phantasms, and another that uses Greatsword phantasms. I've included percentile DPS rankings for each build within its trait section, as well as overall, in order to make it easier to interpret where each build stands in relation to one another. **Please keep in mind that these numbers reflect DPS in solo settings only.** This is not the DPS the builds would deal to world bosses, especially Domination builds, which scale very well with Vulnerability. *** #Mesmer [**Maximum Damage**](URL *(Domination/Dueling/Illusions)* These builds combine all three trait lines that directly buff phantasm damage. It is assumed that the mesmer equips Signet of Inspiration for Swiftness uptime and additional active defense, as well as a mantra or two to provide stunbreaks, CC, or condition cleansing. However, the damage bonus from mantras that are used for active defense will of course be situational, and Signet of Inspiration pulses Quickness randomly, which interferes with measuring each build's expected DPS. None of these skills are equipped for the tests; instead, racial skills are used as placeholders, indicating flexible slots for the player's choice in utility. Weapon | DPS | % in Category | % Overall | Build -|:--:|:--:|:--:|- Sword | 7322-7825 | 94-100 | 90-96 | [Link](URL Greatsword | 7005-7651 | 90-98 | 86-94 | [Link](URL Scepter | 6838 | 87 | 84 | [Link](URL [**100% Swiftness**](URL *(Domination/Dueling/Illusions)* These builds are similar to the builds above, but they incorporate a Focus in order to reach 100% Swiftness duration, a desirable asset in open world. This significantly affects the Greatsword build, no longer giving it access to Sword phantasms. As such, Greatsword has a single damage level, always preferring to summon Greatsword phantasms.

All Chronomancer builds from here cast Well of Calamity, Action, Recall, and Gravity on cooldown, such that they pulse to their phantasms while damaging their target; otherwise, taking Chronomancer in place of one of the three core specializations is a significant DPS loss.

Reduced shatter cooldown is highly desirable all around.

[**Personal Build**](URL *(Domination/Illusions/Chronomancer)* This build focuses on flexibility in and out of combat, supporting Greatsword and its phantasms as its source of damage, while offering Sword/Shield as a strong defensive set. The traits help reduce cooldowns across the build. Due to Greatsword phantasms moving around a lot, this build doesn't make use of wells when it is alone, which is most of the reason why its DPS is the lowest. Weapon | DPS | % Overall | Build -|:--:|:--:|- Greatsword | 5576 | 69 | [Link](URL *** #Conclusion It is difficult to draw general conclusions from this data, especially due to the nature of the content in which the builds are played, and the variance of each build and utility skill choice. Each test's DPS has the potential to vary by hundreds, which skews the result when comparing builds. Due to the desire to establish trust with this data, it would be quite a large project to test each build several times and take the average, while recording each one in its entirety in a seamless cut. However, here are some guidelines that are useful when preparing a build: * Sword/Sword pairs well with Greatsword, allowing the mesmer to retreat to range when necessary, but return to melee when it is safe. Even without Imagined Burden, Greatsword sustains greater Might than Sword, helping to eliminate some of the DPS loss of the autoattack while supporting the Sword phantasms. * Sword/Sword would pair better with Scepter if an encounter needs range sometimes *and* phantasms are killed very often. * Sometimes, camping Scepter/Sword with Sword phantasms is better than camping Greatsword with Greatsword phantasms. This means Greatsword pairs well with Scepter/Sword, both for the initial summons, and later when phantasms are being replaced. Malicious Sorcery is important for this build. * Greatsword has by far the highest burst damage for random trash mobs. The mesmer walks into near-melee range, summons Illusionary Berserker, throws Mirror Blade, and casts Mind Wrack after the bouncing is complete. * As long as the mesmer can maintain three Sword phantasms, Greatsword is a better ranged weapon than Scepter. * Scepter 2 and Sword 4 are blocks, but they also spawn clones, which would replace a phantasm if the caster has three out. * Taking Chronomancer and not using wells is probably a DPS loss in most cases. However, it does allow the mesmer to begin a fight with three of any one type of phantasm. Finally, it is important to state that playing solo mesmer is not all about its DPS. Mesmer is a class with access to a great number of defensive skills, which are important when taking on challenges meant for groups. Ultimately, the goal is to secure completion - not with speed, but with safety. The DPS difference between ranged and melee under normal circumstances is small enough that melee mesmer is best suited for only the least punishing content. **TL;DR Solo power mesmer/chronomancer DPS is complicated. Wear Assassin everything, Strength runes and sigils. Use your best judgment when choosing weapons, but try to work in some way to summon Sword phantasms. Melee is of course the best DPS, but not by so much that ranged is unplayable.**"

It's a pretty fun build but I'm wondering if sitting in a middle ground between tanky and dammage is the best idea. So my main question is should I keep this middle ground build or go to an extreme of either dammage or tanky? While still keeping my main goal of staying in shroud as long as possible?

Some harder enemies have a **blue bar** under their health. That is their **break bar**. Applying CC will lower that bar. Bringing it to zero will increase the damage they take, or have some other effect like preventing you from being killed. In some fights, like Mouth of Mordremoth, you should NOT apply CC until necessary. And more importantly, finishing a boss faster means you can spend more time doing other things, like fighting other bosses and getting more loot. To see what skills apply CC conditions or effects, take a few minutes to look at all your skills' tooltips. **Easy Rule of Thumb**: If a condition or other effect does NOT deal damage, it is CC. Vulnerability is the exception. That's it -- no need to memorize anything other than what skills you have. But if you want a list, here you go: ******************** Hard CC (best): Daze, Fear, Float, Knockback, Knockdown, Launch, Pull, Sink, Stun, Taunt, Basilisk Venom, Signet of Humility, Ice Bow skill 5 Soft CC (not as good): Blind, Chilled, Crippled, Immobile, Slow, Weakness NOT CC: Bleed, Poison, Burning, Confusion, Torment, Vulnerability List with specific classes and skills [HERE](URL **Bring More Than One** hard CC to a boss fight. Most characters will need to bring at least two or three skills, or at least swap weapons or attunements. The longer the CC lasts, the better it takes down the break bar. ******************** Let's recap: * CC means conditions or effects that do NOT deal damage, like stun, daze, knockdown, cripple, chill, etc. Vulnerability is an exception. * Bring more than one ""hard"" CC to a fight.

219,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[Concept] An Overhaul to Guardian,7,5ny2g2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5ny2g2/concept_an_overhaul_to_guardian/,2017-01-15 02:57:41,"For several months the state of Guardian has been debated amongst the community. It is often noted Guardian lacks the synergy of other professions. I had a sit down with a buddy to discuss some changes to create this synergy Guardian deserves. We spent two long days working on redefining the role of each trait line, a set of utility revisions and one of the most recent updates to the Dragonhunter trait Piercing Light. Since launch Spirit Weapon utilities have been rather lack luster. Even with the change to their activated ability over a year ago, they dont pass muster when compared to other utilities. We wanted to revitalize Spirit Weapons with an homage to Guild Wars ritualist weapon skills calling them *Imbue Weapon Spirit* with shorter cooldown in the range of 20-30 seconds. **Imbue Weapon Spirits** We discussed conversion of Hammer of Wisdom thoroughly and giving a buff that had a percentage chance to cause knockdown with attacks would have been extremely over powered. It was decided that a short burst of unblockable attacks would be a sufficient replacement for the knockdown. **Hammer of Wisdom - &gt; Weapon of Wisdom:** For 4 seconds your attacks are unblockable. While Sword of Justice was a decent damage dealer, when compared to newer updates to other utilities, it barely shone. This was mainly due to the cooldown on its command skill. With the conversion to an Imbue Spirit Weapon, we felt it could be repurposed to provide Guardian with another source to apply Burning. **Sword of Justice - &gt; Weapon of Justice:** For 6 seconds your attacks apply 1 stack of Burning for 3 seconds with a 1 second cooldown. Bow of Truth has always been a bit bugged curing conditions on enemy mobs and allies alike. This of course was not how the utility was meant to function, but considering the issue still rears its head it doesnt seem like there is an easy fix for it. We felt a more reliable solution would greatly benefit it. **Bow of Truth - &gt; Weapon of Truth:** For 4 seconds your attacks heal nearby allies for 160 (base heal) with a 1 second cooldown. The pulsing nature of Shield of the Avenger has always been an annoyance to Guardians. More often than not it would let through a hard hitting attack before activating and saw very little use outside of specific situational needs. We felt it needed to be more reliable as well. **Shield of the Avenger - &gt; Weapon of the Avenger:** Gain Aegis for 5 seconds. For 6 seconds whenever you are hit with an attack grant Aegis for 3 seconds to nearby allies, up to 5, with a cooldown of 3 seconds. I mentioned redefining the trait lines so lets dive into them. While Guardian traits have some synergy its rather minimal when compared to other professions. We thought this needed to be addressed in full. The **Zeal** trait line has been reworked to focus primarily on power based damage. Any traits with changes made will have notes attached. - Zealots Attack: Attacking a foe below 50% health applies 1 stack of Vulnerability for 4 seconds. *This is an entirely new trait replacing Zealots Speed. We felt a more reliable means of increasing damage output was suitable to replace a symbol on the ground at a given health threshold. With the addition of a symbol to every weapon it just seemed to be overkill.* 1. Fiery Wrath: 7% increased damage to Burning foes. 2. Wrath of Justice: Striking an enemy with Justices active effect triggers Signet of Wrath. *We moved it from the Radiance line. Changes to Retaliation since launch really swayed this decision.* 3. Zealous Scepter: Critical-hits with scepter grants Might for 5 seconds. *We reworked this trait to be more beneficial in a DPS spec rather than relying on Justices passive effect triggering it which in many cases is counter productive to synergy with traits in the Radiance line.* - Symbolic Exposure: Symbols apply Vulnerability for 3 seconds to foes with each pulse. 1. Zealous Blade: Greatsword skills deal 10% more damage and recharge 20% faster. *We reworked this to focus more on damage output. We felt the minimal amount of healing was lack luster in a DPS trait line and opted to increase damage with its removal.* 2. Zealous Intervention: When you interrupt a foe they suffer from Slow for 2 seconds and Vulnerability for 4 seconds. *An entirely new trait focusing on utility of DPS weapons and damage management. It replaced Binding Jeopardy which was also rather situational, but we believe there is more opportunity to interrupt a foe than immobilize or blind making it more useful.* 3. Shattered Aegis: When Aegis you applied blocks an attack it damages nearby foes and grants Quickness for 1 second. *We moved Kindled Zeal to Radiance and dropped this from the Grandmaster tier. To balance for the drop and the added 1 second of Quickness, the damage dealt to nearby foes would be lowered.* - Symbolic Power: Symbols deal 10% more damage and have a 33% chance to apply Burning for 1 second with each pulse. *We felt the Burning application on this trait was somewhat underpowered only applying burning once and not per pulse.* 1. Symbolic Avenger: You deal 10% more damage to foes in your symbols. 2. Judges Wrath: Immobilize lasts 33% longer. Gain 33% additional critical-hit chance against immobilized foes. *Heavily reworked Binding Jeopardy and renamed. It focuses more on increasing DPS through added critical-hit chance against immobilized foes versus applying a single stack of Vulnerability.* 3. Expeditious Spirit: Imbue Weapon Spirit effects are increased and recharge 20% faster. *Replaced based on the rework of Spirit Weapons.* cooldown. Weapon of Wisdom: Attacks also apply Weakness for 2s with a 1 second Weapon of Justice: Attacks apply an additional stack of Burning. Weapon of Truth: Attacks also remove a condition from nearby allies with a 1 second cooldown. Weapon of the Avenger: Hits on you grant 1 stack of Stability for 2 seconds. We imagined **Radiance** to be heavily steeped in condition damage and reworked traits to focus primarily on Burning application and increased duration. - Justice is Blind: Justices active effect Blinds nearby foes. 1. Justices Hand: Critical-hits with your sword have a 50% chance to Burn targets they strike for 1 second with a 1 second cooldown. Sword skills recharge 20% faster. *We renamed and changed some key features of the sword trait to have a chance to inflict burning more reliably, but kept the recharge reduction on skills.* 2. Radiant Retaliation: When one of your attacks is negated, your next attack causes 2 seconds of Burning with a 10 second cooldown. *This was a complete overhaul that pushed it down a tier in the Radiance line. We believe this could revitalize this trait so many people have complained about in the past.* 3. Inner Fire: Gain Fury when you strike a foe that has Burning stacks greater than 3. - Renewed Justice: Justice is renewed when you kill a foe. 1. Radiant Fire: Gain Zealots Flame when you critical-hit a foe. Burning duration is increased 33%. Torch skills recharge 20% faster. 2. Radiant Bastion: When you block an attack with Aegis, Burn nearby foes for 2 seconds. *We felt Retribution as a trait was an attempt to bring back some of the damage from the Retaliation rework and in a line more heavily focused on condition damage it would be more beneficial to have Aegis apply a short duration Burn.* 3. Kindled Radiance: Gain 10% condition damage based on Precision. *Moved from Zeal line, renamed and tweaked to better fit its new line.* - Permeating Wrath: Justices passive effect no longer only burns your target, but also burns the area around your target each time it activates. *We felt Permeating Wrath could do a lot more for Guardian in Radiance and round out the other minor traits that effect the Justice virtue.* 1. Spontaneous Combustion: Critical-hits against Burning foes causes an explosion that burns adjacent foes for 8 seconds with a 12 second cooldown. Burning damage increased by 10%. *New trait that focuses on increasing damage through spreading burning. Moved increased burning from Amplified Wrath.* 2. Searing Flames: Applying Burning to a foe already suffering from Burning deals additional damage and removes 2 boons with a 15 second cooldown. *New trait focusing on increased Burning damage and boon stripping. We felt it was more appropriate than Perfect Inscriptions in Radiance.* 3. Amplified Wrath: Your symbols are now fire fields and apply 2 seconds of burning per pulse. *For years players have been asking for a trait to turn Guardian light fields in fire fields. We thought a good rework for Amplified Wrath was just that and could provide an additional Burning source.* We moved a lot around in *Honor*. Many of the traits were working counter productive in their current locations and working against what we saw as the Healing line. - Selfless Daring: The end of your dodge roll heals nearby allies. *We thought this trait was more suitable at the adept level.* 1. Invigorated Bulwark: While wielding a mace gain 150 Healing Power. Mace skills recharge 20% faster. *We felt this trait was counter productive and relied too heavily on the ability to block attacks. A flat Healing Power boost was implemented in its place.* 2. Vigorous Precision: You and nearby allies gain Vigor for 4 seconds when you land a critical-hit with a 15 second cooldown. *We thought this minor adept trait was more suited as a major adept trait.* 3. Protective Reviver: Activate Shield of Absorption when you begin reviving an ally. Upon successful revival, you and ally gain Aegis, Protection and Regeneration for 10 seconds. 10% increased revive speed. - Benevolent Persistence: Outgoing Boon Duration and Healing to allies is increased by 1% for every boon on you. *New trait focused more on increasing Healing and Boon maintenance.* 1. Pure of Heart: Aegis heals when it blocks an attack. 2. Empowering Might: You and nearby allies gain Might for 1 second when you land a critical-hit. 3. Honorable Staff: Boon duration is increased by 20% while wielding a staff. Staff skills recharge 20% faster. - Absolute Resolution: Activating Virtue of Resolve removes 3 conditions from nearby allies. Virtue of Resolves passive effect is stronger. *Moved from Virtues line. We thought it was more suited to a Healing trait line.* 1. Symbolic Benevolence: Symbols are larger, heal allies and last 2 seconds longer. *Renamed Writ of Persistence to reflect its actual functionality.* 2. Altruistic Healing: Boons you apply heal those effected. *We moved this from Valor, but with an increase in the healing amount to compete with Pure of Voice.* 3. Pure of Voice: Allies effected by shouts have conditions converted to boons. Shout skills recharge 20% faster. **Valor** has always been the defensive trait line of the Guardian. We reworked its traits to better fit the role of defense. - Courageous Return: Courage is recharged when you revive a downed ally or when you rally. *We felt this trait wasnt really of the master level and moved it to adept.* 1. Smiters Boon: Activate Smite Conditions when you use a heal skill. 2. Focus Mastery: Gain Protection for 2 seconds when using a focus skill. Focus skills recharge 20% faster. 3. Stalwart Defender: Gain 180 additional Toughness while wielding a shield. Shield skills grant Stability for 1 second and recharge 20% faster. *We moved this trait from the master level to the adept level and reduced the added Toughness.* - Courageous Defense: Courage is recharged when you are struck while below 25% health with a 60 second cooldown. *We reworked and renamed Valorous Defense to provide a means of instantly recharging Virtue of Courage.* 1. Defenders Retaliation: When you block an attack with Aegis, gain Retaliation for 2 seconds. Damage received reduced by 10% while under the effects of Retaliation. *We heavily reworked Wrathful Spirit from Zeal to create a more defensive trait. 2. Strength in Numbers: Nearby allies gain Toughness based on your effective level. 3. Communal Defense: Grant Aegis for 5 seconds to allies when you block an attack with a 15 second cooldown. - Indomitable Courage: Courage breaks stun and grants you Stability for 4 seconds. *We moved this trait from Virtues as it is more suited to a defensive line. 1. Retributive Armor: Gain Retaliation when you are struck by a critical-hit. Retaliation gives you 260 additional Toughness. *We reworked this trait around Retaliation as a means of mitigating critical damage.* 2. Monks Focus: Meditation skills heal and grant Fury for 4 seconds to you and nearby allies. Meditation skills recharge 20% faster. 3. Defenders Will: When Aegis ends gain Light Aura for 3 second with a 10 second cooldown. When Light Aura ends gain Aegis for 3 seconds. *New trait created as a means of maintaining better defense in short bursts. we thought it was an interesting mechanic for a defensive line.* We took a hard look at **Virtues** and really gutted it to create a support line. - Inspired Virtue: Virtues now also apply boons to allies when activated. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Justice: Applies Might &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Resolve: Applies Regeneration &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Courage: Applies Protection 1. Retaliatory Subconscious: Gain Retaliation and Aegis when stunned, dazed, knocked back, pulled, knocked down, sunk, floated, launched, taunted or inflicted with fear. 2. Master of Consecrations: Consecrations last 2 seconds longer and recharge 20% faster. 3. Vigorous Resolution: Your Virtue of Resolves passive effect also regenerates endurance. *New trait to help with endurance management. While Guardian has Aegis and many sources of obtaining it they also have one of the lowest health pools in the game.* - Virtuous Momentum: Activating a virtue grants Swiftness for 4 seconds. *New trait to help with mobility.* 1. Virtue of Retribution: Gain Retaliation when you activate a virtue. Retaliation you apply lasts 33% longer. *We felt with all the other changes to traits and retaliation acquisition this was a master trait.* 2. Valiant Hammer: Hammer skills recharge 20% faster. Zealots Embrace becomes unblockable. *We renamed Glacial Heart which was an interesting concept, but we felt it fell short. Making the immobilize skill on hammer unblockable seemed more suitable allowing for a bit more CC but not on the scale of the original Piercing Light on Dragonhunter.* 3. Indomitable Presence: When you successfully stun break, you also stun break nearby allies. *New trait focused on providing a group stun break.* - Light of the Virtuous: Activating a virtue gives you Light Aura for 3 seconds with a 10 second cooldown. Virtues recharge 15% faster. *Dealing extra damage for each boon on you was moved to another trait and we felt gaining Light Aura on activating a virtue was an interesting way of obtaining additional damage through a boon.* 1. Empowered Contender: Increase damage by 2% for every boon on you. *This is a rework of Unscathed Contender that we felt was a worthy choice for the grandmaster level of Virtues.* 2. Perfect Inscriptions: Signet passive effects are stronger. Maintain the passive effects of signets when you activate them. Signets recharge 20% faster. *We moved this trait from Radiance. It didnt really fit there and with the changes to the Virtue line we propose it fits better here.* 3. Force of Will: Allies gain your virtue passive effects while they are not activated. *This is Battle Presence reworked to apply to all your virtues.* You will have noticed the absence of a fall damage trait. We felt it was an acceptable loss considering how extremely rare it is every used. With the implementation of gliding it is practically obsolete on all professions. Finally we wanted to address the most recent change to the Piercing Light trait from Dragonhunter. We understand the reason behind the change from a daze to a slow as it provides the same break bar damage. However, it removed some of the survivability of Guardian in PvE. The daze provided by traps really helps to keep them alive and kicking. I have seen several posts on the forums suggesting a short duration chill which seems to be an interesting concept and would provide a source of chill to Guardian with the removal of Glacial Heart from this proposed overhaul. Last, but not least. Id like to thank those of you in the community for taking the time to read over this rather extensive post."
220,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Blast Finishers - Their current state!,106,5opx2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5opx2e/blast_finishers_their_current_state/,2017-01-19 02:21:08,"I recently started exploring Engineer, and I found it it was a LOT of fun! You get so many blast finishers and so many fields, you can do almost anything from healing, to stealthing, to sharing might! However, there are a few things that bother me here. A lot of blast finishers (and other finishers) are kind of useless! Could we see a re-balance to make them more useful? Might stacking with blast finishers used to be the norm, but HoT has made that quite redundant. I'd like to discuss each field and their effects, and finally with a suggested alternative. Note that I will also discuss new field types &amp; their effects! **Fields** | &gt;Blast | &gt;Leap | &gt;Projectile | &gt;Whirl :---------|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------: Dark | Area Blindness (3s) | Blindness (3s) | Life Stealing (202 health) | Life Stealing (170 health) Ethereal | Area Chaos Armor (3s) | Chaos Armor (5s) | Confusion (1 x 5s) | Confusion (1 x 5s) Fire | Area Might (3 x 20s) | Fire Shield (5s) | Burning (1 x 1s) | Burning (1 x 1s) Ice | Area Frost Aura (3s) | Frost Aura (5s) | Chill (1s) | Chill (1s) Light | Area Retaliation (3s) | Light Aura (5s) | Remove Condition (1) | Remove Condition (1) Lightning | Area Swiftness (10s) | Dazing Strike (1s) | Vulnerability (2 x 5s) | Vulnerability (5 x 2s) Poison | Area Weakness (3s) | Weakness (8s) | Poison (2s) | Poison (2s) Smoke | Area Stealth (3s) | Stealth (3s) | Blindness (3s) | Blindness (3s) Water | Area Healing (1320 health) | Healing (1300 health) | Regeneration (260 health) | Regeneration (260 health) Let's analyse the following fields. ### Dark - Defensive/Healing focus: Blind &amp; Life Steal It has usage with life steal, but blindness is an absolute problem. A solution would be to change Area Blindness to Area Torment (2 x 5s), for WvW and PvP usage. Furthermore, buffing the life steal by doubling the numbers would dramatically make them more viable, putting them a place next to Water fields for healing (with damage as well). ### Ethereal - Offensive focus: Chaos Armor &amp; Confusion It is currently completely useless. The amount of confusion offered is too low. If the amount were to be tripled, the condition damage could be worth using it. Chaos armour is one of the most useless aura's in game, offering random boons when struck, and random conditions to the attacker. This RNG-based gameplay has little room in this game. A solution might be to change Chaos Armor into Blurr for 1 second. This could make Ethereal fields EXTREMELY useful in many PvE, WvW and PvP gameplay. ### Fire - Offensive focus: Might, Burning &amp; Fire Shield One of the best fields. It gives an amazing amount of might, with burning on the side. The burning is very underwhelming, however. A better solution would be to give 2 stacks for 2 seconds (which means 4 seconds with max condi duration). The leap finisher could offer Fury for 5 seconds in addition to a fire shield. I'd however suggest lowering the amount of time Might lingers, as 20 seconds as extremely long, even for a blast finisher. 15 seconds might be well enough! ### Ice - Defensive focus: Frost Armor &amp; Chill Completely useless in every possible way. The amount of chill offered should be tripled, at least. Frost Armor is good in itself, but 3 seconds for blast, and 5 seconds for leap is not enough at all. Raising it to 7 &amp; 10 seconds might give it more use, with the ability to (semi-)permanent usage in raiding. ### Light - Defensive focus: Retaliation, Light Armor &amp; Condition removal The condi clearing is not used very much, as there are many other ways of removing a condition that doesn't require field combo's. Therefor, I'd suggest it offering Condition Conversion instead of Cleansing. Light Aura could be increased to 7 seconds and Retaliation could be increased to 5. This could give the boon a lot more usage. (They should allow Retaliation to deal damage based on your Toughness &amp; Armor scaling, but that's a different discussion) ### Lightning - CC/Mobility focus: Swiftness, Dazing &amp; Vulnerability With the aim to impair your enemy and weakening it, Lightning fields are pretty good as they stand. Offering Swiftness is a great attribute when professions cannot give it easily to others. I wouldn't want to change anything, other than slightly increasing the vulnerability to 7 seconds for longer duration &amp; usage. ### Poison - Offensive focus: Weakness &amp; Poison Very weak and useless field. The weakness offered is barely useful enough to use, and nobody will ever blast for weakness when so many other skills already offer it. I'd suggest changing weakness to offer a new condition called ""Toxic"", which would be the first and only UNCLEARABLE condition we can deal to other players and monsters. Toxic would be the same as 5 stacks of Poison, but stacks only in duration (so the damage is fixed). This would give the field a very unique usage, turning it from useless to useful! The poison offered by projectile and whirl is pathetic as well. Inceasing it to (2 x 5s) gives it much more usage. ### Smoke - Defensive focus: Stealth &amp; Blind This field is a much better option for giving blind. The Stealth you can is very useful as well. Increasing it to 4 seconds would give it much more viability, however. As a way to buff blind, this field will give 2 stacks instead of one stack, turning blind into a stackable condition ONLY for this field, giving it competitive usage. ### Water - Healing focus: Healing The best field in the game, without question. It is the sole reason for why the Engineer can even survive most fights in the first place! Nothing should be adjusted to this field (in fact, I'd argue for a nerf!), so let's rejoice that they got this one great! ### NEW: Earth - CC/Offensive focus: Stability &amp; Bleed This field would be offered mainly by the Elementalist, as it has lost its previous unique Lightning field. It can blast Stability, offer magnetic aura on leaping and bleeds on projectile &amp; cripple whirl combo's. ### NEW: Nature - Defensive/Healing focus: Resistance, Super Speed &amp; Aegis A powerful field focusing on Resistance and offering Super Speed when leaping through it. When using a whirl or projectile, it will offer the user Aegis for a short amount of time. So here we have a new and improved field combo table. **Fields** | &gt;Blast | &gt;Leap | &gt;Projectile | &gt;Whirl :---------|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------: Dark | Area Torment (2 x 5s) | Blindness (3s) | Life Stealing (404 health) | Life Stealing (340 health) Ethereal | Area Blurr (1s) | Chaos Armor (5s) | Confusion (3 x 5s) | Confusion (3 x 5s) Fire | Area Might (3 x 15s) | Fire Shield &amp; Fury (5s) | Burning (2 x 2s) | Burning (2 x 2s) Ice | Area Frost Aura (7s) | Frost Aura (10s) | Chill (3s) | Chill (3s) Light | Area Retaliation (5s) | Light Aura (7s) | Convert Condition (1) | Convert Condition (1) Lightning | Area Swiftness (10s) | Dazing Strike (1s) | Vulnerability (2 x 7s) | Vulnerability (2 x 7s) Poison | Area Toxic (3s) | Toxic (5s) | Poison (2 x 5s) | Poison (2 x 5s) Smoke | Area Stealth (4s) | Stealth (4s) | Blindness (2 x 3s) | Blindness (2 x 3s) Water | Area Healing (1320 health) | Healing (1300 health) | Regeneration (260 health) | Regeneration (260 health) Earth | Area Stability (2 x 5s) | Magnetic Aura (5s) | Bleeding (2 x 7s) | Cripple (5s) Nature | Area Resistance (5s) | Super Speed (3s) | Aegis (3s) | Aegis (3s) As you can see, with these blast combo's we could see an entirely new meta arise. The game could we given that additional dimension that many have criticised it does not have. Classes could specialise on blasting specific fields, like how they used to before HoT was introduced, and professions could focus more on their specific leaps, projectiles and whirl skills for added usage. This change gives players the ability to play with combo fields as a priority, instead of treating it as a useless mechanic for most fields (exception of Water blasting, mainly). "

222,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[New player] Questions about meta and Necro.,0,5fjxtu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5fjxtu/new_player_questions_about_meta_and_necro/,2016-11-30 04:29:38,I started playing roughly 3 weeks ago. During that time period I bought the game used my level 80 bonus on Necro and bought a Legendary twilight with gems for my power build. ( I have a full time job and rather spend the money getting a legendary than the time. Don't judge me pls. ) In the beginning I felt really good about Necro it was a fun class to play around with I loved the power builds for sPvP and WvW. Recently I've been noticing some huge weaknesses with the class.Mostly lack of mobility and easy to dodge abilities. Heres what build I use for sPvP URL I often switch between berserker and marauders This is my WvW set up URL Idea of these builds - stack vulnerability and might with axe then attempt to burst down with great sword.
223,vulnerability,Guildwars2,What's your dream elite spec?,33,5giorf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5giorf/whats_your_dream_elite_spec/,2016-12-05 11:09:19,"So as is usual on the GW2 forums, I ran across a post in the warrior section for someone's idea of an elite spec, which got my mind wandering and I expanded on. I love thinking of the possible ways we could end up playing our characters in the future, so I wanted to see who else may have some nutty ideas we could expand on. Who knows, maybe we'll get lucky and Anet will steal something from us! (unlikely as hell) So anyways, the idea I ran across was a warrior Corsair. Thematically it makes a bit of sense, there's obviously pirates in the game and they have been adding pirate items to the gem store. Furthermore with the potential for us to eventually go to Elona, who had a sprawling navy once upon a time, it could fit in very easily. Going to copypasta my whole post from the forums because there's...a lot. **New Warrior Elite Spec: Corsair** * **New Utilities: Tricks** * **New Mechanic: Grappling Hook** * **New Weapon: Pistol** Since I finished crafting HOPE for my engi I was kinda hoping we could see pistols be a more common weapon. Warrior being one of the few that could realistically pull it off. I love the idea of a sort of pirate-y theme behind it, especially if we get to go to Elona with the next xpac (thanks leaks). So going off of this idea, I think this is how Id like to see it done. New mechanics! Tricks would fit the corsair image, and it plays a little like thief, and could even help alleviate some of those inherent problems with warriors against kiters. Something along the lines of tossing out a grappling hook to grab your opponents and pull you to them. Maybe even adding terrain functionality? hooking onto a wall or a tree and dragging yourself to it. The latter is a pipe dream, but I think it would be amazing. Corsair should be a brawler, up close and personal fighter. Even with pistols the range should be fairly short. No longbow ranges with a pistol shenanigans. Thinking &lt;900 range. Traitlines should have a focus on staying in fights, being slightly to moderately tanky (For the sake of expanding warriors usefulness in PvE and PvP without being hogtied to taking certain traitlines, especially in PvP). --- &gt; **Traits** **Minor Adept:** Boarding Line/Grappling hook. Unlocks this functionality for the class (every elite spec so far has had the first minor unlock their new mechanic, no need to change it) **Major Adept options:** * 1: Increased toughness/vitality/etc when youre within x range of an enemy. Or possibly smaller amounts and scaling based on number of nearby enemies. * 2: Spending Adrenaline heals for a small amount/removes conditions. * 3: Shorter CD on Grappling Hook (numbers may vary) ----- **Minor Master:** Gain quickness and/or vigor upon successful Grapple hook. **Major Master:** * 1: Upon being stunned/launched/other hard CC, activate your rum cask (noted later) * 2: Gain ferocity/might/fury for each bar of adrenaline spent * 3: Grappling Hook taunts nearby enemies when you pull yourself to them. ---- **Minor Grandmaster:** Grappling Hook applies weakness/immobilize upon landing. Gain stability (1 stack) **Major Grandmaster:** * 1: Every hit taken gives a stacking toughness buff that lasts x amount of seconds. At maximum stacks, gain pulsing stability (1 stability every few seconds) * 2: Holding a pistol increases power by x amount and reduces recharge of pistol skills by x%. Landing a critical with a pistol skill grants bonus adrenaline and might (small amount) * 3: Upon landing Grappling Hook, steal x amount of boons from the target, dealing damage for each boon successfully stolen. ---- &gt; **Weapon Skills** **Pistol Burst Skill:** Rapid Fire. Unloads a barrage of bullets over a few seconds. Number of shots increases with the amount of adrenaline spent. Perhaps even making this an untargeted cone max pistol range aoe ability. * Pistol 1: typical auto fire. Maybe giving it increasing damage based on how close you are to the target. * Pistol 2: double-up. Fires two consecutive shots. The first bleeds, the second cripples. Could make this a bouncing shot as well, ricocheting to nearby enemies. (short CD, 5 seconds give or take) * Pistol 3: leap over your target, firing down on them. 1/2s evade frame, applies vulnerability. Medium cooldown (7-10s) * Pistol 4: shoots gunpowder, burning and blinding the area in a small cone. Something like 350-450 range. * Pistol 5: smacks the target with the butt of the pistol, either stunning or dazing them. I think this gives the kit some fairly solid damage, defense, cc, and all around annoying qualities. I was taking a little bit of inspiration from Miss Fortune in League of Legends for the gun skills, though itll be a bit more Gangplank with the Tricks. ----- &gt; **Utilities** * **Healing:** Fairly large burst heal with boons. Giving might/vigor/fury/quickness/stability * **Rum Cask**: as mentioned earlier. Stun break. take a large drink from your rum cask, granting protection and vigor. semi short CD 10-15 seconds * **Fishing Net:** Tosses a wide ranged net over a targeted area applying immobilize. * **Explosive Cask:** place a powder barrel in a targeted area. It explodes after a set time or when shot by your own gun. Youll be able to set several barrels and overlapping barrels will chain explode. * **Boarding Party!**: Leap at a target area, evading during the animation. Leaving hanging ropes at your launching point that allies can interact with and use as well, using your same animation and evade frames. A little immersion breaking to have random hanging ropes, but come on, tell me that wouldnt be amazing. * **Elite:** Pulls out a 24lb cannon and fires in the targeted line, knocking aside any enemies in the path and dealing decent damage. At the end of the line the cannonball explodes, leaving a fire field. ----- I think this would fit the theme of a pirate or seafaring warrior, meant to crash the lines and take over a ship. Defensive options as well as offensive options in the Corsair traitline would help keep warriors from being pigeonholed into taking the same 1-2 traitlines in every game mode and add some diversity to the class. So anyways, let me know what you all think!"
224,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"Elite Specialization Concept: Prismatic, the Support Mesmer",2,5gl5as,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5gl5as/elite_specialization_concept_prismatic_the/,2016-12-05 20:59:33,"[](/rainbowtwiglee)Hey I can't sleep again so here's another support spec concept. I did [warrior](URL and [thief](URL ones too. --- **Prismatic** Prismatics are based on buffing allies to emphasize a specific playstyle for your group and setting up nests that will give your party an advantage when fighting in them. They're aesthetically based on Light (spectrum of light, not holy power like Guardians) --- **Class Mechanic: Light Break** A new shatter skill that grants you and nearby allies stealth for a set duration. Shattering illusions gives those affected health regeneration which is more powerful for each illusion shattered. --- **New Weapon: Shortbow** Shortbow is based around setting up Prisms which will allow your standard attack and heal with the weapon to bounce around and be more effective. * Radiant Strike - Fires a light beam that bounces strikes an enemy. If a Prism is nearby it bounces to it, then strikes another enemy. Can strike one enemy per Prism. Each hit deals less damage. * Healing Beam - Fires a light beam at a nearby ally, healing them. If a Prism is nearby it bounces to it, then heals another ally. Can heal one ally per Prism. (~5 second cooldown, instant cast) * Prism - Places a prism at target location, that enhances other Shorbow skills. Prisms have a duration but cannot be damaged. Can have 3 prisms at once. * Spectrum of Light - Heal allies in an area at target location. * Color Spray - Blinds and Dazes foes in a cone. --- **New Skills: Tints** Tints are buffs (not boons) that are applied to allies to enhance a particular playstyle. The enhance a particular stat while on and have both a passive effect and a triggered effect. Only one Tint can be applied at a time, with a newer one overwriting the old. Tints are cast at range and affect all allies in an area, preferring targets who do not already have a tint. Tints will last about 10 seconds. * Blue (Healing Skill) - Heal yourself and apply Blue Tint to allies in an area, which causes their heal skills to recharge faster and gives them bonus Healing Power. * Red - Allies tinted Red have increased Power and cause vulnerability to foes they strike. If they strike a foe who is at full Vulnerability stacks they stun them briefly. A single target can only be stunned once every several seconds this way. * Orange - Orange tinted allies have increased Condition Damage and cause burning to foes they strike with 2 or less stacks of burning. Striking a foe with more than 2 stacks instead causes a fire nova. This nova can only be triggered once per ally every several seconds. * Yellow - Yellow tinted allies have increased movement speed and Toughness. They gain Super Speed, Stability and break stuns if struck while below 50% health. * Green - Green tinted allies have have increased Vitality and damaging conditions applied to them deal less damage. If they have more than 3 conditions one of them is removed each second. * Purple (Elite) - Purple tinted allies cause Slow to foes who strike them. If a foe with more than 3 seconds of slow strikes a Purple tinted ally they are dazed. --- **Traits** I honestly don't have many good trait ideas for this one. **Minor** You become a Prismatic, gaining access to Shortbows, Tints and Light Break **Adept** Your Shortbow skills can bounce off you like you were an additional Prism Whenever you heal an ally you apply 3 seconds of Regeneration to them **Master** Your Tints skills leave behind combo fields at the location theyre cast **Grandmaster** Your Shatter skills apply a Tint to you, depending on which skill was used.

226,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"Is there an easy way to approximately figure out one's DPS loss when not running optimal options? AKA, how is DPS actually ""made""?",13,5htbhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5htbhz/is_there_an_easy_way_to_approximately_figure_out/,2016-12-12 10:56:49,"Hi. The title might be a bit convoluted, so I hope I can explain myself better. I've been looking at the DPS number charts and I am wondering about applying those in more everyday situations. Since the meaning of ""everyday situations"" differers from player to player, I am curious what actually contributes (and by how much) to the DPS numbers we find in the (for instance) [charts](URL For instance, if I look at the charts for something like a power rev, I see DPS numbers of over 20k. Now, if I take a berserker exotic sword rev to the training dummy and simply spam the auto-attack, my damage will be nowhere near it: it will probably be closer to something like 2k. Which means there are elements in the game that allow players to increase their damage by something like 10+ times. What I would like to do with this post is to figure out what those elements are and how they can help me (and my party) raise my damage (and by how much)? Or, even more importantly, how much damage should I expect to lose when NOT running those options? (Not running those options can be the result of things like doing solo open-world content spamming auto, or a random PuG and not having a ranger near me that grants me Spotter/Spirits or simply skipping on food because it's too expensive.) How much damage should I expect to see from a solo player that spams their auto-attack (aka plays poorly) with no boons and buffs? How much will adding 10 or 20 stacks of might help? How much will Banners help? Vulnerability? Ranger buffs? How much difference does a good build make? How about a good rotation of a good build? ... And what happens if you lack those things; which elements are easy to include that will provide the most benefit? Is it characters with specific builds, is it specific gear options, ... As I said, I know the question is a bit bloated (and I hope I made myself a bit clearer), but I am struggling to put the numbers I see in the charts into the context of the numbers I see in game and the results I am seeing (or failing to see). So, any insight into this would be greatly appreciated. Cheers!"
227,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"""Fixing"" the healer role of GW2: Aura overhaul proposal",0,5hy0oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5hy0oo/fixing_the_healer_role_of_gw2_aura_overhaul/,2016-12-13 04:51:58,"Can't change title anymore but I wish I had specified it as ""Fixing"" the healer role DIVERSITY of GW2. This is specifically in regards to how Raids introduced healers as a role. I think that it's a necessary ""evil"" to have healers but after about a year I'm also kind of tired of seeing only druid healers be brought in almost exclusively for their buffs pushing other classes out the optimal viability. In specific, I want to talk about Auramancer as a Raid healer and how I think a mechanic overhaul on something that's been in the game since inception could be possible without changing too much about the current traits. It is without a doubt that water camping staff healer provides more consistent healing than a druid at the cost of camping water. This is to me counter-intuitive to an elementalist's play style who generally wants to be element swapping and making use of our profession mechanic. What I propose is a bit of an overhaul on the Aura's system and a re-tooling/description on some of the tempest line's traits. Don't get me wrong, some aura's are good as they are flavour and usage wise. Frost Aura, Magnetic Aura for example I believe are niche and perfectly fine but I would want to re-examine Fire and Shocking. **Fire aura** works by applying burning to the enemy and might to yourself when you get hit. You have to get hit for it to work - on the squishiest class. So then how and why could you ever want this aura to be effective? Instead, I propose that Fire Aura be adjusted to grant 5% bonus damage as long as you're enveloped by one. **Shocking aura** works by stunning for 1 second on a 2 second cooldown when hit. I think thematically it makes sense on how it works but I think it misses the mark on it being a SHOCKING aura. It feels more like a Static aura to me right now (By static, I'm referencing Pokemon's electric type ability Static). I believe that there is a possibility to make Shocking aura living up to it's name sake better is to automatically incorporate the Air trait Lightning Rod into Shocking aura. That is to say, when you get hit with Shocking Aura on, you still stun them, it's still a 2 second cooldown but you deal damage with a lightning strike BUT not apply the weakness (it can be a weaker bolt) OR just apply the Discharge buff on application (similar to how Overload Air does it now). I propose we get a new/better air trait in the grand master talent or keep it as is as I'm sure it has use in PvP **Invigorating Torrents** currently applies Vigor and Regeneration. Great! Except for the fact that Regeneration is almost always instantly overwritten from a Chronomancer running Illusionary Inspiration. What I would propose is to tweak it so it still applies Vigor but rather than use Regeneration, simply state Auras you apply grant X healing over time (similar to the Soothing Mists trait). I do NOT think that it should apply Soothing Mists directly as this could encourage Fire/Air/Tempest traiting even if in normal current Fire/Air/Tempest damage spec you'd normally take Harmonious Conduit. ***Scenario A:*** This would then solidify Aura healing as more ""I want to have AN aura on me"". ***Scenario B:*** If we were to take it a step further and say this invigorating torrents HoT buff stacks up to a cap based on type of auras, then that could be an argument for ""I want to have many TYPES of aura's on me"". ***Scenario C:*** Making aura's stack in duration as opposed to how they are now (overwriting); this would make Auramancing want to specialize their equipment for a particular type of aura and also allow auras to be used as more bursty healing with Elemental Bastion ***Scenario D:*** Combining B and A as a scenario would make Auramancers want to put as many different types of auras on as possible for higher regens. Personally, I think Scenario D would be the best. It adds a complexity to when to use aura's and wouldn't be abusable (ie: stacking Fire Aura's, bursting down shorter content). Now of course, because this type of healing would be separated from Regeneration, Elemental Bastion would need to receive some nerfs or changed. If it were nerfed, then I think that's still fine because it again solidifies Druid as the burst healer and Tempest as having SOME burst heals but is more about the heal over time. This sort of aura change would also mean an Ele doesn't have to/want to camp water to heal. You could go a fresh air dagger/dagger variant with Air/Water/Tempest. Or you could go staff with Fire/Water/Tempest variant and take Powerful Aura synergizing with SunSpot; In that same vain, maybe you take the Conjurer and One with Fire trait in Fire tree and use Icebow to imitate Waterblast while you're in Fire and help supplement might generation. Another aspect of the proposed changes above would mean Rune of Shocking and Rebound could be considered offensive abilities now where the trade off is ""Do I use Rebound! as a way to put an aura on or as an emergency rally saving button?"". Furthermore, what about Rune of Radiance then? Could we maybe see a change from Vitality bonuses to Healing Power bonuses then? And with extended aura durations give you a reason to want auras for longer since you want Shocking or Fire aura up time to support your team's with damage (no different than GotL uptime). Finally, lets talk about the aura's that no one thinks about. Chaos Armor and Light Aura. **Chaos Armor** should be less ambiguous. Is it an aura or not. Currently it's not treated as one (Try it. Elementalist Earth Dagger 3-3 through an ethereal field and you don't proc Elemental Bastion). Should it be treated as one? I don't have an answer to that. If it were classified as an Aura, I'd make it more offensive by say for example applying random conditions and stripping random boons in a small radius (effectively a mobile ethereal field that you can't finisher off of). Specific, it rolls the die and will attempt to strip a boon and if the target doesn't have that boon, it will ""miss"" the boon strip; or make it like signet of inspiration where it will always strip but randomly strip which boon is being stripped based on what the enemy has. **Light Aura** is in an incredibly weak spot right now. Only after the first hit will it grant you retaliation and apply vulnerability to your attacker. While the concept of ""you hit me, you take damage back harder if you keep hitting me"" is novel, this doesn't feel very good because it implies you're on the backfoot already. It IS considered an Aura though. I propose that on application it applies a stack of Aegis and when aegis is broken while under the effects of Light aura, apply protection for a brief duration and blind nearby enemies. Now you may claim that Light aura and Frost aura are very similar now in that they are mitigating damage. That's true but in two different ways. Light aura protects against Burst while Frost protects for longer durations as there are more sources of Frost aura from an Auramancer. This also opens up Support guardians a little with Aegis being a profession prominent buff to them (but do keep in mind, a Guardian won't have the healing aspect of the Auras so they will be strictly damage reduction which is their job). EDIT: FORMATTING **tl;dr** - Under effects of Fire aura, 5% damage buff. Lightning Rod trait is automatically included in getting hit with Shocking Aura active. Light Aura: burst mitigation. Chaos Armor: Condition and Boon Strip chaos. Create ways of making other healers optimal/viable depending on the encounter and requirement. Basically: Diversify healing/buffing. This isn't meant to be a complaint about ""druids op"", I just would want to see variety. "

I have found inventions to be more dps than tools due to bunker down, and inventions has a lot more utility in terms of additional healing and condi clears for the party.

I just do not get the complaints about it being lower dps or poor utility.

Thoughts?,3,59a1w2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/59a1w2/my_attempt_at_providing_a_new_player_with_an/,2016-10-25 19:58:46,"**GUILD WARS 2 OVERVIEW** **Quests** *Quests in guild wars 2 come in the form of dynamic events, heart quests, and personal story quests. The first two types you encounter more often.* *Dynamic Events These events generally occur at random and provide substantial experience upon completion. They are marked by an orange circle on the map. These events are proximity based in that your progress towards completing an event only receives credit when you are within range. The events are often multi-step and can have different outcomes based on success or failure. Any player can join in and contribute regardless of whether or not they are in a party with other players. *Heart Quests These quests are static and are always located in the same place on the map, marked by a small golden heart icon. These quests yield very large amounts of experience and cannot be redone once completed unless you create a new character. Unlike dynamic events, these count towards completion of a zone, many areas have a dozen or so of these particular quests but are not mandatory to complete. *Personal Story The personal story is a choice based and primarily single player experience, though others can assist you at times if desired. The story eventually branches into different paths, though there are no wrong choices. Roughly every ten levels you unlock a new chapter; the story finishes at the level cap of eighty. It is shown via a green star-like marker on your screen **Combat** *Guild wars 2s combat is a fast paced and highly reactive affair. Skillful play and awareness of your class matters more than the gear youve equipped; do commit to practice.* *Combat Basics Dodging and movement are key to not being frustrated. Double tapping a movement key allows for dodging at the cost of endurance. Each class can dodge meaning that you must learn which powerful attacks to dodge so that you may spare yourself a death. A player can move as they are using skills. This mobility is crucial to how skills function as poor positioning can reduce your combat effectiveness. Upon your health reaching zero, you do not immediately die and can resurrect. This all veers away from traditional MMORPG standards, so do be mindful. *Skills Each class has a set of skills determined by the weapon you have equipped. Weapon skills are on the left side of your skill bar whereas healing, utility, and elite skills are on the right side. These skills unlock at certain level intervals. Each class has their own self-healing skill, thus prioritizing self-sufficiency is very helpful. Utility skills are selected from a list and can be changed out of combat at any time; never stick with the exact same utility setup. Elites should be used with care or else their impact will be wasted. *Weapon swapping Early on, weapon swapping is unlocked and should immediately be made use of. Attempt to learn each and every weapon and swap between your main and secondary weapon until you find the best combination. Quick on-the-fly swapping further emphasizes the fast nature of combat. A skilled adventurer has a weapon for every situation. *Combo effects Combo effects come in many varieties, though they can be applied to any situation. Certain skills may have blast finisher listed under them, while others may have combo field noted under them. Using a blast finisher inside of a combo field produces an effect that depends upon the type of combo field. Example A: a player uses the dragons tooth skill (a blast finisher) inside of a skill called ring of fire (a FIRE combo field). As a result of the combo, the player gains might which allows for you to do more damage Example B: a player uses a blast finisher within a WATER field, the combo result is a burst of healing. Alongside of blast finishers, there are also whirl,"" projectile, and leap finishers, each still used within a combo field, but blast finishers are usually far more important and have a stronger effect. *Conditions and boons Conditions can either hurt you or your enemy. Some skills apply various conditions that can greatly help you in battle. Cripple slows you or an enemy down when applied or vulnerability reduces defense. These are marked by small red icons near the health bar. Try to use skills that remove conditions from yourself to stay alive longer. Boons directly benefit you or your enemy. When applied they can do a range of things from increasing your speed to augmenting your defenses. Swiftness can grant a speed boost or Might will increase your power and damage dealt. All boons are marked by yellow icons near the health bar. **PVE** *While the open world provides a great deal of worthwhile content, challenging group content consists of dungeons, fractals and raids. These make up the more traditional end game of guild wars 2 from a PvE standpoint.* *Dungeons and Fractals These group content types are five man objectives that involve maneuvering dangerous maps with various bosses to be found. Dungeons have more story bound to them and are longer ventures; fractals are smaller, more focused tasks that are much easier to partake in. Fractals are generally more rewarding and can become very difficult. *Raids The greatest PvE challenge in the game, raids offer ten man objectives that have greater intensity than either dungeons or fractals. These allow for you to work towards a very long term goal while also emphasizing group communication. Do not attempt these without understanding the entire game as a whole. Tough bosses and mechanics demand good timing and awareness, but unlike other MMORPGs, raiding here is markedly streamlined and NOT needed for the sake of your character gaining the best equipment, thus, consider it optional. **PVP** *Players have a choice of either small scale or large scale pvp. Small scale structured pvp (sPvP) and large scale world versus world (WvW) allow for you to quickly partake in whatever level of player to player chaos you are inclined to. PvP comes along with it's own rewards, separate to that of PvE* *Structured PvP You and a small team of five total are pitted against another small team for control of a map. Team strategy is more important in this game mode and is viewed as being competitive. This can be played in a ranked or unranked fashion. Do what you can to help your team more than yourself. *World vs. World An entire server battles against another server for dominance. This is the most chaotic mode involving a clash of over a hundred players. World vs. world maps are separate from the rest of the game world, and whether you fight a single player or a group, be prepared to be swarmed at a moments notice. **The World itself** *The world is open and always lively, do not be afraid to venture beyond comfort to seek new locales.* *Zones The zones contain many things, from events, to quests, to vistas, and points of interest. Simply exploring grants experience, so do not assume curiosity in that regard is a waste; wander and learn. Each zone can be completed by finishing all activities within the zone. You are rewarded for completing any zone and completing every zone is beneficial eventually. *Waypoints Travel is quick and easy in Tyria, within the map are diamond shaped blue icons that allow warping at any point in time. Warp often to never miss any events but dont forget to slow down now and again beforehand. Travel revolves around waypoints meaning that you shouldnt feel poorly for constantly using them. *Hidden Locations There are many hidden pieces of content within the world. Mini dungeons with a touch of lore, challenges that grant skill points, paths that may not be so obvious, or perhaps jumping puzzles that uniquely test your platforming abilities, requiring a keen eye to find them. One might even start a dynamic event chain if they are thorough in their explorative efforts. *Living World Certain updates are called living world wherein the entire game world is effected in some way as a result. These major objectives encompass story, player interaction, interesting mechanics, and unique items. How often this can be experienced depends upon their release schedule set by the developers. It is important to log on during a living world event release as it is then unlocked for you to experience on your own time. Otherwise the content will be locked to you unless you purchase it from the gem store (cash shop) if you miss the live update time-frame. Living world is considered level eighty content, so do not rush to do it. **THE GOAL?** One may ask, just what is the overall goal of this game? The answer is, whatever you want! Guild Wars 2 is open ended enough to provide you, the player, with a fluid gaming experience that accommodates for a variety of interests, from exploration to downing a boss. Set a goal and achieve it, you are not forced to do what you dont want to do! Now go explore and experience, new Tyrian, as I hear there is a dragon afoot."

Their duration is increased depending on how much Adrenaline was spent to activate them; 1 bar is 4 seconds, 2 is 6 seconds, and 3 bars is 8 seconds. For balancing purposes maybe different Orders can heal for different amounts. With your Minor traits Orders are also enhanced so that they cure conditions. Your Orders cure conditions when activated. Press the Attack removes Weakness, Blind, Slow and Confusion. Form Up removes Bleeding, Poison and Burning. Keep Moving removes Cripple, Chill, Torment and Immobilized. Your Grandmaster trait also is related to Orders, increasing the duration of boons you apply to allies under Orders. --- **New Weapon: Mainhand Pistol** In a perfect world Id actually like to see a javelin type weapon like the Paragon spear from GW1, but pistol can serve the same purpose. Its probably the lowest damage of any Warrior weapon but has some good utility to it and allows you to use an offhand. Also builds Adrenaline pretty fast. * Auto Attack - Shoots a foe, building bonus adrenaline if you have less than 1 bar. * Disarm - Deals moderate damage to a foe and inflicts Weakness. * Flare Gun - Deals damage to an area, inflicting Blind and Vulnerability and revealing Stealthed targets. --- **Unique skill type: Armaments** Armaments are a stockpiled buff that a Commander uses to increases the effectiveness of themselves and allies. Think of the mechanic being similar to the necromancers Signet of Vampirism where it has both a duration and a number of charges. When conditions are met you or your allies will expend a charge in order to gain the effect of that particular Armament. Armaments gain more charges if activated with more nearby allies, up to a maximum of 5 allies. Ballpark numbers would be a base of 10 charges, +3 per nearby ally (so a total of 25 if in a zerg), duration of 8 seconds. * *Medical Supplies (Healing Skill):* Heal yourself for a moderate amount. Create a stockpile of Medical Supplies on yourself for several seconds. Allies near you who take damage consume a charge of Medical Supplies and heal themselves for a small amount. Charges can only be consumed once per ally per second. * *Battle Stimulants:* Create a stockpile of Battle Stimulants on yourself. Allies near you under the effects of a condition consume a charge to cure themselves of a condition. Charges can only be consumed once per ally per second. * *Frag Rounds*: Fire a Frag Round at an enemy, creating a stockpile of Frag Rounds on them. Allies who strike the target consume a charge and inflict a short duration stack of Bleeding. Charges can only be consumed once per ally per second. * *Reactive Armor:* Create a stockpile of Reactive Armor on yourself. Allies who take damage near you consume a charge and gain Protection and Retaliation for a short duration. Charges can only be consumed once per ally per second. * *Combat Boots:* Create a stockpile of Combat Boots on yourself. Allies near you consume a charge and gain Swiftness and Vigor for a moderate duration. Charges can only be consumed once per ally per second. * *Explosive Weaponry (Elite):* Create a stockpile of Explosive Weaponry on yourself. Allies near you who strike an enemy consume a charge and deal a small amount of damage in an area around their target. Charges can only be consumed once per ally per second. --- **Traits** **Minor** * (Adept) You become a Commander, gaining access to Pistols, Armaments and Orders. * (Master) Your Orders cure conditions when activated. Press the Attack removes Weakness, Blind, Slow and Confusion. Form Up removes Bleeding, Poison and Burning. Keep Moving removes Cripple, Chill, Torment and Immobilized. * (Grandmaster) Boons you apply to allies under Orders have increased duration. **Adept** * (Pistol Trait): Your Pistol auto attacks reduce the cooldown of your offhand skills by a small amount. * Diversion Tactics: When a nearby ally is downed, you Taunt foes near them. This effect can only occur once every 90 seconds. * (Trait 3) **Master** * Supply and Demand: Your Armament skills recharge faster if you consume all charges. * Herding Cats: Allies who are healed by following an Order for 3 consecutive seconds are healed for an additional amount. * Lead By Example: You gain increased healing from following your own Orders **Grandmaster** * Pushy: When you activate an Order with 3 bars of adrenaline, give Quickness and Super Speed to nearby allies. * Voice of Authority: Your Orders gain increased range and can affect more allies. * (Trait 3) "
233,vulnerability,Guildwars2,engineer new elite spec weapon or new kit.,0,5baa50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5baa50/engineer_new_elite_spec_weapon_or_new_kit/,2016-11-06 02:01:06," why not a staff? it would be called technomage or technomancer. he would use the power of its magic crystal with the steampunk engineering to create new spells and living creation. it would be the azura way of engineering. a mix of range and melee style like the rifle. one of the weapon spell could be a temporary invoked azura style turret that fire lots of little projectiles quickly then explode after it finish firing. lets see: the auto would be melee with a boon converter at the 3rd auto. (or some condi on the 3rd hit) the 2 could be some magic light burst or thunder burst (a little 3 hit charging thing) that blind on 1rst or 3rd hit and apply weakness and burning on each hit.(or whatever condi) the 3 a sort of temporary surfing ability to get close or escape a target with an explosion at the end that would pull in aoe toward the engi.(the surfing leave a little electric floor that give move speed to ally and does little damage to foes + poison)(combo explosion)(maybe buff ally with 3 second of quickness upon explosion).(while moving a little aura surround the engi to do some damage with an aoe wider than the aoe he leave behind)(upon activation the surfing grant 1 sec or 2 sec of super speed to the engi and an little dodge frame at the begining)(upon explosion apply torment to foes) the 4 the little turret spell. (that would be good and original and you could block for the time the turret is firing or use the turret to block some projectile).(good direct damage, apply some bleeding for condi users)(it can put an temporary aura to buff ally with protection or whatever boon.. egide?)(the turret will focus the ennemy you targeted when using the spell until it dies 5 seconds after or so)(its projectiles can pierce threw) the 5 would be a 2 stats spell. upon activation you slam the staff on the ground bumping and damaging foes(either a big bump or a static bump like the ranger spike trap), granting stab to ally. you need to wait for like 1 sec or 2 sec for the second spell to charge (you can still move and do something else why waiting for it).when ready you can fire a powerfull thunder/light/beam that does aoe damage but in a line like the revenant 2 hammer but instanty after a brief charge instead of moving toward the target. good direct damage, grant ally in aoe (but not yourself this time) immune to blind for a short time and add vulnerability, confusion, torment, burning. after the staff is charged you have 6 second to fire the beam. while charged each staff spell apply vulnerability on each hit except for the turret. it will have quickness instead to fire more quickly or all its shot will deal extra damage and extra bleed. i guess it still need some work and maybe some changes but that seems to be epic and original. (it could also be a new kit with a staff like weapon with a magic crystal at its end)"
234,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Necromancer Axe Rework: More Bones Edition,45,5bjewi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5bjewi/necromancer_axe_rework_more_bones_edition/,2016-11-07 12:23:48,"So I've been taking a break from GW2 recently, as the complete gutting of Necromancer DPS left me feeling sour, and Legion has left me hopelessly addicted to WoW again^~~Please^send^help^please^dear^god...~~ Well, recently I've been feeling very necromancery ~~Probably because my dick has been rock hard for the last 3 days, [damnit blizzard](URL Anyways, in my absence from the game I've been thinking about Necromancer's Axe as it's such a neat weapon, conceptually but I find it lacking in terms of execution. It's a terrible, terrible, terrible weapon in PvE, but it has a niche purpose in PvP and is amazing in WvW So I've been thinking of ways to make it good in PvE and make it a more enjoyable weapon along the same feel, purposes, and themes----While not disrupting its place in WvW or its niche in PvP I also feel like there is a severe lack of bones in GW2's necromancer's skills. So here's what I think: _________________ #AutoAttack Goals for this skill: - Improve responsiveness without disrupting the overall feel - Improve general performance and circumvent the aspects that make it hard to balance - Make it more engaging - Return its animation to how it was before they chopped it down The easiest way to achieve this is to split it into an attack chain 1. **Rending Claws** - 1/4 cast time Low damage and applies one stack of of vulnerability 2. **Severing Claws** - Identical to above, except for the animation which is a continuation 3. **Maiming Claws**: 1/4 cast time. Higher damage than previous hits. Applies 1/2sec of cripple. Generates 2% Life Force against Vulnerable enemies Ultimately, the entire chain should retain roughly the same cast time as the current skill, while also feeling more responsive and having the previous animations _____________________________ #Splintering Claws (Replaces Ghastly Claws) Goals for this skill - Once more, improve engagement without disrupting the feel of the skill - Improve performance and make more interesting and impactful to use - Retain same core animation while also adding minimal embellishments This skill has a great foundation, but I feel it's a little plain. I love the animation and think it's one of the coolest animations in the game---In fact, it's the only one I can think of that uses the default weapon model the way it does. 1. Cast time remains the same. Total Damage of Ghastly Claws (Now Splintering Claws) is untouched by this rework. 2. Now hits a total of 5 times. 3. Each time it hits, it rends a splinter of bone from the target. These bone splinters fly from the target to the necromancer and rest behind his back (similar to Revenant's Jade Daggers in Shiro Stance or Elementalist's [Rock Barrier](URL 4. These Bone Splinters will last 8 seconds - Each bone splinter provides 2% incoming damage reduction and condition duration reduction to the Necromancer, up to a total of 10% - Each time the Necromancer is struck, 1 Bone Splinter is consumed by the Necromancer (I.e. First hit they have 5 splinters and have 10% reduction, but the second hit they have only 4 splinter left so receive only 8% reduction. Third hit 3 splinters so 6% reduction) - Consumption of splinters is gated *per attacker* to prevent situations where one attacker can use a multi hit ability like Reaper's own Death Spiral to quickly strip all bone splinters. ______________ After Splintering Claws is used, it flips over to reveal a brand new ability: #Impaling Splinters The Necromancer can activate this ability to fire all remaining splinters at their target, and embed them within their flesh. 1. Cast time is 1 second---Splinters are embedded 1 by 1 within this period. If the skill is interrupted before it can finish, any splinters embedded will remain embedded. Any splinters that had yet to be embedded will simply disappear. 2. If any Bone Splinters were consumed before **Impaling Splinters** was activated, they will naturally *not* be embedded into the target 2. Each Embedded Splinter does damage and applies a debuff that *increases* damage taken and condition duration taken by 2%, up to 10% 2. The mechanics of this debuff mirror that of the defensive buff---Each strike received consumes 1 bone splinter and removes the effects associated with it. (I.e. first hit 10%, second hit 8%) Embedded Splinters last 6 seconds before disappearing 4. When an Embedded Splinter is consumed, it damages (3 or 5) nearby enemies for a small amount of damage and applies a 1/2 second of cripple 5. Embedded Splinters can be consumed by the Necromancer AND his allies. Consumption of Embedded Splinters may or may not be gated ___________________ #Unholy Feast Goals for this skill: - Improve overall performance Good skill, like the concept, like the appearance, it's cool. All in all, best part of the current kit and doesn't need many changes. ##ADD A BLAST FINISHER, DAMNIT!"

236,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[SC] Xera and Gorseval speedkills,60,5cwg1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5cwg1f/sc_xera_and_gorseval_speedkills/,2016-11-15 02:19:46,"Hey guys, Painbow here from Snow Crows. Recently we have been working on some speed kills of raid bosses to see how far we can push the timer. We had a lot of fun playing around with some of the mechanics and tweaking our tactics to optimise our kill times. We felt that Xera was more tedious than Gorseval because there was a lot more rng involved, along with room for error. We decided to use two condition-warriors in order to cleave the adds, but we did not feel the necessity for dumplings as the elementalists with alacrity and fire overload were able to maintain sufficient might. Because there is no damaging aura on Xera, Axias (non-tank-mesmer), Perry and Goku (warriors) were able to stand in front of Xera in order to help the druids replenish celestial avatar faster. The pulls for the adds were coordinated by the two mesmers and druids, we were then able to cleave them down quickly so they were not able to harass us. We had our elementalists use fresh-air-staff as they were able to line-cast meteor shower on the edge of Xeras arena. In addition the AoE damage from air overload is very good at killing the adds. In total, it took us roughly 8 hours in order to get a kill time we were happy with. Faster is certainly possible, but with considerable room for error its very difficult to get a perfect run. Xera 5:16min (5:44min left on timer): * Axias [Mesmer](URL * Perry [Warrior](URL * Breke [Ranger](URL * Derpy [Elementalist](URL * Roul [Elementalist](URL * Nico/Van Gherwen [Mesmer](URL * Goku [Warrior](URL * Jan/Kiwi [Ranger](URL * Mela [Elementalist](URL * George/Painbow [Elementalist](URL We found Gorseval more linear than Xera because in essence it came down to a DPS race. We had one condition-warrior in order to cleave the orbs and spirits in the split phase, while Goku used the power build. We played around more with our DPS classes, trying out guardians and elementalists in order to find what we felt to be optimal. We felt that two guardians was optimal because me and Derpy were able to block Gorsevals knock-back so people were able to cultivate more efficient DPS rotations without having to dodge. Guardians are also efficient at vulnerability stacking with F1 on the second ghost, along with the fresh-air-tempests using air overload. We swapped from Bolt to the Heart over to fresh air, as the damage during the split phase was much better as a result of faster vulnerability stacks. Guardians also have great burst, which is useful for annihilating the ghosts quickly. Me and Derpy used Virtues as we were able to keep up Unscathed Contender for 20% more damage. In total we spent approximately 5 hours on Gorseval. Our mesmers used distortion to provide us with invulnerability during the egg attack so we didnt have to dodge. The time could probably be pushed to 4:40 left assuming everything goes perfectly with perhaps a few developments in tactics. Shout out to Neo who helped us practice during our Gorseval attempts, but could not continue with us, so Perry replaced him. Gorseval 2:26min (4:34min left on timer): * Axias [Mesmer](URL * Perry [Warrior](URL * Jan/Kiwi [Ranger](URL * Roul [Elementalist](URL * George/Painbow [Guardian](URL * Nico/Van Gherwen [Mesmer](URL * Goku [Warrior](URL * Breke [Ranger](URL * Mela [Elementalist](URL * Derpy [Guardian](URL We will be going for more boss speed kills in the near future.

237,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Mesmer Elitespec Suggestion: Illusionary weaponmaster,5,5deud7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5deud7/mesmer_elitespec_suggestion_illusionary/,2016-11-17 19:55:26,"After a year of HoT I once again had some thoughts about new elitespecs. The one i liked most you will find here. First of all, what is actually missing? The Chronomancer is already the strongest class in game when it comes to teamsupport. In my opinion there is nothing more valuable than perma quickness and alacraty when it comes to a partywide DPS increase. There is already a strong Condibuild (as long as your enemie moves and attacks) as well as one of the best Tankbuilds. The only thing I could think about was a build for damage over time, something selfish for soloing content and running through openworld. Lorewise a Mesmer manipulates, with the help of magic, the thoughts of his enemies. He summons Illusions of himself, manipulates light (and even time as chrono). If he can summon whole boddies, why not just weapons too? And what would be greater than not just shooting arrows with a bow but swords too? Thats what I tried to realise with this build. I call it Illusionary weaponmaster and took a shortbow as weapon. I too created a new mechanic called Fragment of light. I will explain this at the end. But enough pretext, here is finaly what I thought about: Autoattack (no name yet): Shoot an arrow on your target. Create with a 50% on hit chance a fragment of light. 2 Swordfan: Shoot a fan of illusionary swords on your target. Create with a chance of 33% on hit a fragment of light 3 Illusionary arrow: Create an illusion that attacks your target with Autoattack. Deals more damage for every fragment of light (1-2%) (clone) 4 Heavy arrow: Shoot an illusionary Greatsword on your Target which pales him and knocks him down. (Knockdown 2s + 5 stacks vulnerability) 5 Phantasmal huntsman: Create an illusion which shoots a salve of arrows on your target (phantasm) 6 Healskill (no name yet): Consume your fragments of light. Get extraheal per Fragment. U1: Illusionary swords: Summon illusionary swords which circle arround you and destroy projectiles. Active: Command the swords to attack your target. U2 Illusionary Daggers: Summon illusionary daggers which support your attacks (+10% damage for a short period) Active: Command your daggers to pierce your targets armour (unblockable, applies vulnerability, slow and cripple) U3 Illusionary chains: Summon illusionary chains which immobilize your foes (immo + slow) and drains life from them (somethinc like vampiric on necro) Active: Destroy your chains to damage your target U4 Illusionary Warhorn: Applies might and fury to your and your allies. (5 targets) Active: Applies swiftness and superspeed on you and your allies (5 targets) Elite Damoklessword: Consume all fragments of light to summon a damoklessword over the battleground. Deals AoE-Damage + extradamage per fragment of light (10%) F5 (no name yet): Build Illusionary weapons out of your Fragments of light (2 Fragments = 1 weapon) Fragments of light: Available through shortbow and shatters (+ Traits). Maximal number of Shards 10. Fragments of light are leftovers which arise out of already used illusions. The illusionary Weaponmaster is able to use them again and craft new weapons out of them. Grandmasteries could be: 1. If an illusionary weapon gets destroyed it will create a fragment of light (50% chance). Deal extradamage per fragment of light (1-2%) 2. Damage and conditionduration is increased after shatter. Short bow skills recharge faster amd arrows pierce 3. Spirit weapons slow foes they strike. Spirit weapon summon and commanf skills have reduced recharge. Baseline should be: You are now able to use a shortbow and illusionary weapons. gain access to F5. Gain a Fragment of life for every illusion (clone and phantasm) that gets destroyed (inclusive destruction through new summon and shatter) I'm sorry for my bad english and hope you understood the idea behind my concept. I'm always open for further ideas so please write it down in the comments if you have any suggestions or questions "

240,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Speculative: Next Elite Spec for Revenant,0,54g63r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/54g63r/speculative_next_elite_spec_for_revenant/,2016-09-26 03:41:13,"Ok, so I've been sort of brainstorming ideas about upcoming new specializations, and thought I'd share my idea for the Revenant one here to get some feedback. For me, the ritualist is a natural fit for the rev; lore-wise they aren't a perfect math, but I'd rather have this thread be about my proposed ideas in general rather than whether or not the revenant and ritualist have enough in common to warrant a ritualist spec. Sorry if the format looks weird, I'll fix it if I can. Obviously, idea is somewhat unfinished, but the core is there. Let me know what you think! **Revenant Specialization**: Ritualist **Other Possible Names**: Medium, Spiritualist, Channeler, Anchor. **Lore**: Revenants have a natural tendency toward the mists; they are drawn to it, just as their power comes from it. Most Revenants find that communing with the spirits of the dead legends of Tyria comes easily to them, but attempting to commune with any lesser spirits was next to impossible - that is, until they met the spirit of a great fallen ritualist, who guided the Revenant down a path that was darker and stranger than any they had traveled before. Under this headmaster's tutelage, Revenants learnt how to summon ethereal manifestations of spirits from the underworld to aid them in battle. These spirits brokered contracts with the Revenant - a brief respite from the gloom of that place in exchange for servitude on the surface of Tyria. Ancient, forgotten magics now in the hands of the Revenant, they found themselves able to more easily wield the power of the mists directly and, with the aid of the long dead, are able to command a presence on the battlefield the likes of which has not been seen in Tyria for centuries. **Description**: The Ritualist specialization grants access to the legendary ritualist Master Togo, the ability to summon bound spirits to the battlefield, and use of the scepter in the mainhand. The utility skills granted by Master Togo will be familiar in either name or form to many players of Guild Wars 1, and often have double effects that apply to both you and any spirits you've summoned. **Profession Mechanic**: Legendary Ritualist Stance: Invokes the power of the legendary ritualist Togo, changing your utility skills. **Additional Mechanics**: Spirit Binding: Grants access to profession-specific skill above your weapon skill bar (would replace Facet of Nature's location). This skill allows the Revenant to create up to three stationary Bound Spirits at your location. Each Bound Spirit has an auto attack with longbow range at a rate of 2 seconds and 20% chance of being a projectile finisher. Summoning a Bound Spirit has a 1 second cast time and acts as an uncancelable (I know, not a real word) upkeep skill that ticks at -1 energy, for max of -3 (for 3 Bound Spirits). Boons and conditions can apply to Bound Spirits, and they can be targeted by enemies, but cannot be summoned within radius of 180 of each other. Attempting to summon a new bound spirit when 3 are up causes the first to dissipate and a new third to be summoned at your location. Running out of energy while in Legendary Ritualist Stance or swapping to another legend causes all Bound Spirits to dissipate. Has an undetermined cool down :) *Skills*: **Healing: Soul Mending** Heals you. For every summoned Bound Spirit, cleanse one condition. If no Bound Spirits are summoned, gain 10 energy (upkeep energy, not dodge). **Utility 1: Splintered Presence** (radius 240) Your next 7 attacks also deal damage to up to 5 enemies adjacent to your character. Your Bound Spirit's next 3 attacks bounce between 3 enemies. For every Summoned Spirit effected, lose 1 tick of Splintered Presence on your character. **Utility 2: Quick Was Hamato** (radius 600) Upkeep Skill at -5. Gives the player character an urn to hold. Cannot use weapon skills while holding the urn. While holding, grant quickness, vigor, and swiftness to nearby allies (these boons would stagger on application, sort of like pulsing every other second. So second 1, you get quickness, second 3, you get vigor, second 5, you get swiftness, repeat. Should keep it balanced). Your Bound Spirit's attacks inflict slow while holding the urn. You may drop the urn at any time, or force drop the urn when you swap legends or run out of energy. When you drop the urn, stun any nearby enemies. **Utility 3: Sheltered Union** (radius 240) Create an aura around each Bound Spirit that blocks incoming projectiles for 4 seconds. If a Bound Spirit blocks a projectile, when the aura ends, the Bound Spirit pulls nearby enemies. If no projectile is blocked, the Bound Spirits next 3 attacks inflict vulnerability and siphon health. **Elite: Spirit Rift** (radius 240) On player character's location and at every summoned Bound Spirit, release a ball of mist energy that over 3 seconds slowly rises from the ground. After 3 seconds, the ball detonates, dealing massive damage and applying weakness and burning to all enemies in range. *Weapon Skills*: **Scepter 1: Essence Strike** (range 900) Strike your foe with mist energy -&gt; **Essence Smite** (range 900) Smite your foe with mist energy, gaining 2 energy (upkeep energy, not dodge) -&gt; **Essence Sunder** (range 900) Sunder your foes with mist energy, burning your foe. **Scepter 2: Echoing Anguish** (range 900, radius 240) Ground targeted AoE. A large burst (blast finisher) of mist energy damages and confuses foes, followed by a medium damage burst that torments foes, and finally a small damage burst. **Scepter 3: Mist Ward** (range 540) Displace target (enemy shadow step distance 360) and apply cripple and weakness. Your next 5 attacks siphon health from foes. *Balancing and numbers and such needs work, and I'm also working on traits, but again: let me know what you think of the basic concept. Thanks :)"
241,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"""What Class should I play?"" - A summary of the playable professions to help you decide.",589,54m7mz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/54m7mz/what_class_should_i_play_a_summary_of_the/,2016-09-27 04:52:41,"[](/allthescrunch) One of the most common questions asked on this subreddit is What class should I play? In Guild Wars 2 you're not locked into specific combat roles by your class, but rather each class has a unique style in how they accomplish the same tasks. Below is a brief summary of each of the playable classes  noting their pros, cons and unique mechanics. This guide doesn't go into details about each game mode or provide popular builds, but instead gives an outline of what is appealing about each class and lets you discover the details. For those unfamiliar, the Elite Specializations are special Trait lines that you can unlock in Heart of Thorns (not available in the base game). Equipping them modifies your class mechanic in some way and allows you to a new skill category and a new weapon. ----- **Some notes about Learning Curves** Firstly: your mileage may vary. I've listed the averages based on player opinion but it's not uncommon for a class to ""click"" with you even if it's normally considered difficult. Second: learning curve is how hard it is to be OK at a class, not how hard it is to be great at it. Even the easy classes have a lot of nuance and depth to figure out, so don't worry about outgrowing your class - there's always room to improve. Lastly: some builds on the same class are more difficult to play than others. Rangers in general are pretty easy, but playing a Healing Druid Ranger in a raid setting is very challenging. Much like classes in general some builds may click for you better than others and some may be more complicated than others. Don't let a somebody else's build slow you down! Find what's right for you. ----- **Warrior** Easy learning curve Heavily armed and heavily armored, Warriors are your go-to front line brawlers. High health pools and heavy armor make them nice and cozy in the thick of battle and a wide array of weapons let them go toe-to-toe with any sort of foe. *Class Mechanic: Adrenaline* Adrenaline is a special mechanic to help warriors in combat. Adrenaline is built each time a warrior lands an attack, slowly filling a meter above your weapon skills. This adrenaline bar allows you to unleash a powerful Burst Attack based on what weapon you're holding in your main hand  ranging from laying down giant rings of fire to powerful single strikes. The more adrenaline you've built up, the more powerful the effect when you activate it. (+) Naturally High Offense and Defense - Warriors are the kings and queens of the raw numbers game. High health pools and heavy armor make them naturally durable and high base damage weapon skills make you dangerous to tangle with no matter what type of build youre running. (+) Huge weapon selection. - No matter how you want to fight, or who you're fighting, warriors have a tool for every occasion. Want some ranged AoE Damage? Go longbow. Looking for some added condition damage? Pick up a sword. Want to punt somebody off a cliff? Hammers work just fine for that. (+) Offensive Support - Warriors are no slouch when it comes to supporting allies, and they really shine when it comes to adding to your party's damage output, using a number of shouts and banners to add more raw damage to any party. (-) Shallow Bag of Tricks - Plan A: Attack them Head On. Plan B: Same as Plan A. Not to say they dont have their fair share of control conditions or ranged weapons, but if you cant trade blows with a foe you dont have many alternatives. *Elite Specialization: Berserker* An offensive spec that gives you access to Berserk mode, which you can use when your adrenaline is full to give you a temporary boost in attack speed as well as spammable Primal Burst skills to use instead of your normal Burst Skills. Berserkers also gain the ability to carry torches for added condition pressure, and Rage skills which give you some offensive oomph as well as give you more Adrenaline. ----- **Guardian** Medium Learning Curve Based on the classic paladin archetype, Guardians are an armored hybrid class that specializes in bolstering themselves and allies with boons while still be effective in direct combat. *Class Mechanic: Virtues* Fitting with the theme of buffs and boons, guardians have a special mechanic know as Virtues. Virtues provide a guardian with three always-on buffs to strengthen them. These buffs can be temporarily sacrificed to empower nearby allies, turning a personal source of power into potent support tools. (+) Survivability - There are three things that will survive a nuclear blast: Twinkies, Cockroaches and a Guardian. The Virtue of Resolve provides constant health regeneration when active, Virtue of Courage allows guardians to block attacks periodically, and a number of weapon and utility skills provide added regeneration, protection and healing. They also wear heavy armor to mitigate whatever damage does manage to get through. (+) Strong Boons - One of the best support classes in the game, guardians stack boons on themselves and allies with ease. Beside the quantity of boons they can throw out, guardians have ready access to nearly every boon in the game, allowing them to buff allies however it's needed. (+) Healing and Damage Prevention - Possibly their strongest feature, guardians have a number of skills that remove conditions, restore health or straight-up deflect enemy attacks. A well timed skill like Shield of Absorption can save your entire party from certain doom. (-) Long Cooldowns - To offset the potential impact of all their powerful blocks and heals, many Guardian skills have very long recharge times  so if you mistime your skills, you may not get a second chance. (-) Awkward Ranged Combat - Guardians are much more comfortable in close ranged combat than they are at range. While still capable of dealing good damage at range, Scepters have slow projectiles that make hitting moving targets difficult and the Longbow from Dragon Hunter specialization is clunky and immobile. *Elite Specialization: Dragon Hunter* This spec might not be what you expect from this archetype, but its still highly effective. Dragon Hunters gain access to Longbows for ranged damage, traps for large area control and replaces your Virtues activated effects to be less supportive and more suited to direct confrontation with foes. ----- **Revenant** Medium Learning Curve The new kid on the Block, Revenants are able to channel the legends of old to imbue themselves with new abilities. Able to shift their strengths and weaknesses by switching legends Revenants can excel in many combat roles. Revenants are only available to those who own Heart of Thorns. *Class Mechanics: Legends and Energy* Their first class mechanic is channeling Legends. Based on the legend you are currently channeling you will gain a preset Healing Skill, Utility Skills and Elite. Revenants can swap Legends like most classes swap weapons, letting them have access to two sets of Utilities. Revenants also use Energy as a secondary resource. Energy regenerates very quickly while in combat or resets to 50% when you swap legends. Energy is required to execute any of your skills other than your basic auto-attack, so proper management of it is crucial if you want to make use of all your skills. Revenants also have a number of skills that can be toggled on or off, providing you persistant power but cutting into your Energy regeneration. (+) Low cooldowns. - Although limited by their Energy costs, many Revenant skills have very low cooldowns for what theyre capable of. Letting your Energy build up for a short while can let you use powerful attacks several times in a row. Switching Legends also sets your Energy pool to half full and gives you access to a totally different set of cooldowns, so in a pinch you can always make use of your second Legend to keep fighting. (+) Im good at everything! - Revenant Legends are self contained kits with very specific purposes. Equipping the right legend lets you excel in whatever role you fancy at the moment, whether it be Jais tankiness and staying power, Mallyxs mastery of conditions, Ventaris area healing and protection, Shiros mobility and aggression, or Glints ability to apply boons to many allies. (-) ...except the stuff that Im not good at. - Each legend you equip is powerful, but the scope of what it allows you to do is very narrow. If you dont equip a Legend that is specifically good with conditions then conditions are going to be a big problem, equipping offensive legends will leave you wanting for a decent healing skill, etc. Although you can equip two legends at a time there will always be holes in your build somewhere. You have to be very careful not only playing to your strengths but also playing around your weaknesses. (-) Managing many systems - Playing a Revenant requires you to perform a careful balancing act with your resources. Being caught with the wrong Legend active at the wrong time can be disastrous, and your weapon and utility skills all require the same energy pool so you must choose when to use what. *Elite Specialization: Herald* A powerful support specialization that doesnt sacrifice personal effectiveness, the Herald gives you access to the Glint legend which has abilities that can be toggled on to pulse AoE boons and reactivated for powerful effects (which put them on cooldown so you cant toggle them back on again). Heralds also gain the Aspect of Nature which can be turned on to give themselves and nearby allies increased Boon Duration at the cost of some energy regeneration, and can use a shield for some powerful defense skills. ----- **Ranger** Easy Learning Curve Rangers are a jack-of-all-trades class, with weapons and skills to help them adapt to anything they might face. Fighting at melee or range, rangers use quick movements and agility to outmaneuver foes in a fight. *Class Mechanic: Pets* Rangers can charm a variety of juvenile pets they find in the open world, and once he does so can switch to it or any other pet he's charmed whenever he's out of combat. Your animal companions come in a variety of shapes and sizes ranging from tanky bears and hounds to swift and deadly hawks and cats, each with unique stats and skills. Though not always reliable, pets can provide a boost to your damage output and protect you from harm. (+) Mobility. - Rangers have a number of jumps, rolls and evades built into their weapons, allowing them to skirt around the edge of a conflict or dance around an attacker with ease. Kite like a boss. (+) Ranged Combat - Rangers have effective melee weapons, but their ranged combat abilities are especially noteworthy  rangers have arguably the best ranged single target damage of any class. (+) Adaptability - If you ever find yourself in a situation you're not prepared for, you're playing the class wrong. Rangers have well rounded skillsets that make them well suited for many situations, able to deal with a variety of threats without having to specifically prepare for them. (-) Awkward AoE - While still able to deal damage to multiple targets, rangers have a hard time doing it  usually requiring them to line up multiple foes and hit them with a single arrow, or getting in close and laying traps at their enemy's feet. (-) Pets are unreliable - While they can certainly save your butt in small skirmishes, pets can be downed very quickly in some situations. Recent changes to pets and minions have done a lot to alleviate this in PvE by making it so that unless theyre being specifically targeted they take reduced damage, but if the enemy shifts focus to them they can die super quick. *Elite Specialization: Druid* Gaining access to a completely new mechanic, Druids can activate a Celestial Form to gain access to powerful support skills regardless of what weapons theyre currently wielding. If you want to go even more of a support, Druid can use a staff with many healing and utility skills. Druid also use Glyphs that shift in functionality depending on if theyre in Celestial Form or not. ----- **Thief** Medium Learning Curve Thieves are your classic assassin or rogue type characters, boasting superior damage output and mobility. Thieves are adept at moving in and out of combat, striking down a target at the instant an opportunity presents itself and then getting away safely. *Class Mechanics: Stealing, Initiative and Dual Skills* Thieves have a number of smaller unique mechanics to them. First is that thieves can steal from opponents  activating your Steal ability teleports you to your target and grants you a single use of one of several special skills, depending on what type of creature you stole from. Thieves also have no cooldown on their weapon skills, instead they use Initiative which is a resource shared between all your weapon skills. You can use Initiative to repeatedly spam a weaker attack or spend it all to use a powerful skill several times in a row. Last, when a thief is wielding two one-handed weapons they can use both of them for a Dual Wield attack that changes based on what specific weapon combination you use. (+) Burst Damage - Using their Initiative system thieves can unload a large amount of damage in a very short amount of time. Combined with their naturally opportunistic fighting style, thieves are very good at spiking down targets. (+) Mobility - Thieves have access to a number of teleports and dodges, allowing them to engage and disengage their enemies with ease. Because they can cover a lot of ground quickly, thieves are very good at catching foes when they're weak and unprepared. (+) Stealth - More so than any other class, thieves can utilize stealth. A number of utility skills  and even a healing skill  allow you to cloak you and nearby allies to let you slip away from dangerous situations or sneak up on enemies. (-) Fragile - Although they wear medium armor thieves have a very low amount of health, so you'll have to make good use of your mobility to make sure take as little damage as possible. (-) Group combat is difficult - Thieves are much better at dueling or picking off lone opponent than they are in large scale combat. Even their ranged weapons don't have a very long reach, and they only have a handful of AoE skills. *Elite Specialization: Daredevil* Because apparently they werent slippery enough already, now the Daredevil makes them more so. Daredevils can use one of three unique Dodge enhancements to supplement their physical damage, condition damage, or just make them super hard to pin down. They also gain a third charge of Endurance so they can dodge more than other classes. Daredevils also can use staffs for melee combat that has heavy sustained damage for trading blows with opponents and gain Physical skills which excel at disrupting and disabling foes. ----- **Engineer** Difficult Learning Curve Engineers are one of the most unique classes in GW2, and in MMOs in general for that matter. Although only able to equip a handful of conventional weapons engineers have access to a number of specialty weapon kits like flamethrowers and grenades, giving them a deceptive number of combat options. *Class Mechanic: Tool Belt* When an Engineer equips Healing, Utility or Elite skill, you will automatically equip a corresponding skill to a special skill bar called the Tool Belt. For instance when you equip the Healing Turret skill, Regenerating Mist will be added to your Tool Belt, so you essentially always equip a pair of skills instead of just one. Tool Belt skills have their own separate properties and cooldown times, giving Engineers an enormous amount of versatility. (+) Weapon Kits - Engineer cannot weapon swap and only have a handful of equipable weapon types, but it's hard to notice that when you're switching between a flamethrower, twin pistols and elixir guns on whim. Activating a weapon kit replace your current weapon, turning one utility skill into 5 separate attacks. You can swap between weapon kits freely and there's no cooldown like there is with other class' weapon swapping, ensuring always have access to the right tool for the job. (+) Conditions and Boons - Engineer have access to a very large arsenal of skills that heal allies or provide beneficial boons, as well as being able to lay down a large variety of combo fields. They also have one of the greatest varieties in conditions they can apply, give you ready access to however you feel like screwing with your opponent at that day. (+) Huge number of skills - Between weapon kits and tool belt skills, engineers have access to an impressive number of options in how you want to approach a situation. It will take some practice to manage all those skills though - In the chaos of battle it can be easy to forget about your Elixir Gun when you need some healing, or remember what buttons you need to hit to get it. (-) Melee is awkward - Engineers much prefer to keep foes at arms length. Dealing with closing enemies can be quite difficult as an engineer as your close combat tools are limited, youre often better off trying to fight while running than trading blows at close range. The new Scrapper specialization does give you tools to alleviate this though. (-) Does poorly under pressure. - Almost all of the engineers defensive tools are proactive and preventive, so when things start to go south its hard to keep it from getting worse. Basic defensive tools like stun breaks or condition removal usually require fancy setups or combos rather than being quick fixes, so when things go bad they go real bad. *Elite Specialization: Scrapper* Engineers who prefer to smack opponents outside the head with a hammer can choose to take the Scrapper spec, making them much more brawly than your standard fare engi. The aforementioned hammer has many great defensive and disabling tools, and Scrappers can also use Gyrocopters summons that will provide helpful effects over time. They even get a permanent Gyro that can be used to revive allies or finish off enemies at range. ----- **Elementalist** Difficult Learning Curve At first glance you may think of an Elementalist as your typical stand-and-deliver magic caster, but if you try to use them as a back line artillery piece you won't get very far. An Elementalist is a complex and intricate class, and getting the most out of them is difficult, but when mastered the results are incredible. *Class Mechanic: Elemental Attunement* The unique mechanic of an Elementalist is their ability to channel four elements  Fire, Water, Air or Earth. Depending on what element you're currently channeling you'll have access to a completely unique set of weapon skills (with their own separate cooldowns), and the properties of many of your utility skills will change as well. (+) Attunements - Instead of swapping between weapons, Elementalists can attune to one of four different elements - each with its own unique strengths. Learning when to swap to each element and using your full arsenal of skills is essential to playing an elementalist  if you only stay in Fire the whole time you're locking yourself out of the elementalist's full potential. (+) Lots of Combos - Elementalists are the masters of 2 + 2 = 7. An elementalists can use many skills in tandem to produce results much greater than the sum of their parts. Not only can elementalists combo with their own skills, but they also lay down a number of elemental combo fields to help allies as well. (+) Mobility - To compensate for their low survivability elementalists have both a good number of defensive skills and some pretty impressive movement capabilities to get themselves out of trouble. Much QQ has been had from players trying to chase down a wounded elementalist in PvP. (-) Very Fragile - Elementalists are far and away the squishiest class in the game, wearing both the lightest armor and having the lowest possible health pool. If you can't mitigate or avoid damage you'll be spending a LOT of your time admiring the floor. (-) Terrible in a Straight Fight - Elementalists rely on the variety and synergy of their skills to get the job done. If you dont use your skills correctly and eek out their full potential then theyre actually fairly weak. *Elite Specialization: Tempest* Harnessing the powers of mighty storms, Tempests can overcharge their elemental attunement to put it on a moderate recharge in exchange for channeling a powerful area effect for several seconds. Tempests also use shouts as potent support skills, can wield warhorns to lay down long duration area effects, and have an affinity for applying elemental auras to themselves and allies. ----- **Necromancer** Easy Learning Curve Necromancers combine a large and versatility skill set with an amazing amount of staying power, enabling them to either handle things with dark magic or get their hands dirty in melee with equal facility. Necromancers win through attrition and pressuring opponents into submission, able to inflict an impressive number of conditions and shrug off counter attacks  the longer a battle goes, the more of an advantage a necromancer builds over their opponent. *Class Mechanic: Death Shroud* A necromancer has use of Death Shroud, which provides a them with a unique set of skills as well as acting as a secondary health pool. As nearby creatures die or as a necromancer uses certain skills, your Life Force bar will fill up. A necromancer can then use their accumulated Life Force to activate Death Shroud. While in Death Shroud damage you take is subtracted from your accumulated Life Force and not your health, and you can make use of special skills that they have access to only in Death Shroud. (+) Heavy Control - No other class can render an opponent helpless quite like the Necromancer. Constantly applying Fear, Chill and Cripple to keeps your foes right where you want them, and ample amounts of Poison and Vulnerability keep their defenses weak. (+) Unique Support - Often cited as being a weak support class, nothing could be farther from the truth - Necromancers just use a different style of support than all other classes. Syphon conditions from your allies to yourself and them transfer them all to the enemy! Or heck, just convert all your foes boons into conditions. You can even pull downed allies to your location to get them out of a certain death situation and have some pretty impressive group heals. (+) Survivability - Between Death Shroud, their large health pools, their great healing skills and traits that allow you to leech health from enemies, necromancers are very sturdy. They do wear light armor though  otherwise they'd be unkillable. Necromancers also have access to a number of skills to help them defend against particular enemy strategies  for instance Spectral Armor can help you survive burst damage, or Consume Conditions can alleviate a lot of condition pressure. (-) Limited Mobility - Once they have someone in their grasp, necromancers can toy with them at their leisure. The tricky part is catching them in the first place. Their lack of mobility also makes escaping from a losing situation more difficult as well. (-) Lack of Boons - While they do feature a ton of unconventional support possibilities, the most common form of support is pretty lacking. They do have some decent ways of putting boons on themselves (especially Might) but if you want to beef up your allies youll have to look elsewhere. *Elite Specialization: Reaper* Reapers are slow methodical damage dispensers that love to wade into the middle of huge groups of enemies. They gain the ability to wield Greatswords for massive AoE attacks, Shouts that gain power the more enemies are nearby, and a new melee oriented set of Death Shroud skills. Reapers also have a knack for inflicting Chill to further hinder their enemies. ----- **Mesmer** Difficult Learning Curve Mesmers are the trademark class of the Guild Wars series and are one of the most unique, subtle and deadly classes in any game. Specializing in manipulating foes and countering their opponents strategies, a good mesmer will generate more hate in PvP chat than all other classes combined. *Class Mechanic: Illusions* A mesmer specializes in creating Illusions to either confuse, damage or otherwise hinder their foes. These summoned pets resemble their owner and come in two varieties: Clones look just like their creators and have low combat abilities, designed more to trick opponents momentarily. Phantasms are noticeably transparent and magical, and have powerful attacks to add to a mesmer's damage output. All Illusions can be used by the mesmer with their Shatter skills, which causes Illusions to self destruct in exchange for one of several powerful effects depending on which Shatter is used. (+) Tons of Tricks - Whether it be creating barriers that send projectiles back to their owners, stealth, making decoys, or just creating a portal to warp people between spaces, Mesmers have always have something up their sleeves to shape the battlefield. (+) Powerful Summon Play - You know what's more frustrating to fight than a mesmer? Fighting four mesmers. A mesmer can summon Illusions as temporary allies, so your enemies always have multiple opponents to worry about. If you're lucky you can even get your opponent to waste powerful attacks on your Clones. (+) Control - Nothing brings your enemys party to a screeching halt quite like a sneaky mesmer. Stip all their boons, reflect projectiles back at them, or just make yourself invulnerable at the right time and watch their big attacks pass right through you. Make your foes fight on your terms. (-) Fragile - Mesmers sport a medium health pool, but the price they pay for their extreme fashion sense is their low armor values. Youll have to make good use of your mobility and defensive skill, as your only defense is not getting hit in the first place. (-) Ineffective in Direct Combat - If you exhaust your bag of tricks mesmers are very poor at exchanging blows with opponents. Mesmers can't dish out much damage without their Illusions and other tools, so if you find yourself in a corner you're going to be at the mercy of a very, very angry warrior. *Elite Specialization: Chronomancer* As you might infer from their name, Chronomancers are all about messing with time. Chronomancers gain the unique Continuum Split ability which after a few seconds will revert them back to the state they were in when they activated it, allowing crafty Chronomancers to undo damage they take or use powerful skills multiple times. They also gain a number of Wells, which slow down and hinder enemies or speed up and help allies, as well as a shield to block attacks and further lock down enemies. Chronomancers also have unique access to Alacrity, an effect that speed up the recharge of skills for themselves and allies. Edit: Why can I never spot typos until *after* I post these things? Edit: Caved in to peer pressure and changed Revenant to Medium learning curve. Also elaborated on Learning Curve at the top. "
242,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Meta Change between Qualifier and WC,231,54xeqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/54xeqt/meta_change_between_qualifier_and_wc/,2016-09-29 03:10:48,"During the World Championship Qualifiers, viewers definitely saw the absolute powerhouse that the Scrapper/Reaper combination was. The devastating offense of the Reaper was kept in check only by how easy it was to focus down. However, the Scrapper was able to offset this weakness almost completely with near instantaneous rezzes. After the qualifiers, everyone was expecting most teams to run this dynamic duo. However, when the Championship came around, most teams were running a Tempest instead of a Scrapper. What brought about this change? To analyze why the change occurred, we have to first look at what made Scrapper strong in the first place. That really boils down to the rezzing power. Tempest offers more heals and peels, and while Scrapper puts out slightly more offensive pressure, that isnt quite as important when youre running a Reaper/Herald comp with so much offensive pressure. Scrappers, however, were able to immediately get on the rez at double speed with the Function Gyro. Perfectly Weighted gave them near permanent Stability, and popping Gyros before going for the rez popped that up to 3-4 stacks with Final Salvo. Add to that a four second invulnerability through Self-Regulating Defenses and an AoE daze when you cleave out the Function Gyro and you get an almost guaranteed rez. Scrapper relied on this to retain the spot, but it was essentially unstoppable. Or so it seemed. As far as Im aware, the first Reaper to start running Well of Corruption was Noscoc of Astral Authority in scrims versus Denial Esports. While not an immediately obvious choice, the theory behind it is sound. For those of you that dont know, Well of Corruption corrupts one boon from each foe each second. The Stability on the Scrapper and Function Gyro gets corrupted, taking both of them off the rez. This completely bypasses the Invulnerability and AoE daze functionalities, since it gets both off the corpse before the cleave even starts. Even an additional second or two of cleave was enough to prevent the guaranteed rez from the Scrapper. After that, most teams deemed it not worth running, so they ran Tempest instead, choosing to rely on keeping the Reaper up instead of rezzing it when it died. But Vermillion saw a lot of success running the Scrapper! Why were they able to make it work? The answer to that lies in another utility change out of Argi. Scrappers before ran Bulwark Gyro, Purge Gyro, and Elixir Gun. Argi, however, swapped out Purge Gyro for Elixir S. The on-demand invulnerability from the active Elixir S allowed him to avoid the Well of Corruption, thus getting the rez anyway, even if it took a bit longer. This build change made him more able to get those clutch rezzes, but also left him more vulnerable to conditions while facing a Reaper and a Chronomancer. The increased vulnerability probably means that Tempest would still be objectively stronger, but it put Scrapper in a usable place, which is very important to Argi as a Scrapper main. This is one of the more obvious examples of how the meta progresses over time. Eventually, the meta does tend to stabilize, but it takes a lot longer than most people think. For example, given more time between the qualifier and the actual event, I would have expected more Warriors in the meta. Warriors were pushed out largely by Scrappers, since all of the Stability on the rezzes meant they were almost useless for cleave. With Tempest back in the meta, Warrior would be strong again. That might push more Scrappers back into the meta, and we could see more diverse comps when it balanced out. Most of this information isnt really that useful to the average player. The main take-away would be to think critically about why top players run what they do. Its not always a cookie cutter build. It is often used to counter specific things run in competitive play (like how Noscoc ran Spectral Wall in the qualifier). (Cross-post from my thread on /r/gw2esports)"

245,vulnerability,Guildwars2,What if more or all boons could stack in intensity?,0,55yg1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/55yg1j/what_if_more_or_all_boons_could_stack_in_intensity/,2016-10-05 19:02:15,"My favorite update to Guild Wars 2 since release involved the removal of the conditions cap. This immediately made a great many more builds viable in the game, at least in open world PvE. Build diversity and customization has always been one of the strongest pillars of the Guild Wars franchise. I believe Guild Wars 2 could push this even further by changing the way boons and some other conditions like vulnerability work. Right now most boons only stack in duration, and if they do stack in intensity, they cap out at 25 stacks. If you have a hammer Guardian in your party, you'll receive permanent protection. Add another hammer Guardian to the group, and the extra protection is utterly wasted. Imagine if each Symbol of Protection granted 3 (or some other number) stacks of protection, protection gave -1% incoming damage per stack, and protection could stack infinitely. A skill like ""Hold the Line!"" could grant 30 stacks of protection. Of course, there would need to be diminishing returns on the effectiveness of the boon to prevent certain strategies from becoming game-breaking. The core idea here is that certain boons which are currently trivial to max out on your party would now require more customized team configurations to max out on. Have a party that stacks tons of protection? Well, then you could struggle to stack a lot of might. Opportunity cost creates interesting choices for the player. I would propose changing every boon to operate in this same way. A single stack of fury or swiftness would be much weaker, but they could stack in intensity and for infinite amounts, but again with diminishing returns. Any stacks of these boons past perhaps 30 or 40 would yield negligible benefits. The point at which the diminishing returns is reached could be tweaked based on the boon. I think vulnerability, while not a boon, falls into the same category. Right now it's a given that any raid group will reach 25 stacks of vulnerability. No one has to tune their builds to achieve more vulnerability, which means it might as well not exist. It never affects player decision-making. If vulnerability could stack infinitely, and it required special tuning for a 10-man group to reach the point of diminishing returns, then suddenly classes that have ways of applying more vulnerability become much more useful. The downside I envision here is for classes that apply vulnerability would become less powerful in a solo setting. I'm not quite sure how to get around that problem. Perhaps scaling vulnerability whereby the more players engaging the unit, the less effective each stack of vulnerability becomes? I haven't thought this point through very carefully. I'd welcome any constructive criticism of this proposal. I'll admit most of my thinking in this area has to do with the raiding meta, so perhaps there's something pertaining to WvW or PvP that I overlooked. This would be a huge change to the balance of the game, and I can only begin to imagine how much work would be required to implement it. Do you think this would be a good change for Guild Wars 2? "

249,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[SUGGESTIONS] Improving the Engineer's Medkit,3,57xy89,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/57xy89/suggestions_improving_the_engineers_medkit/,2016-10-18 02:35:47,"Hey guys! So on the forums there's a topic all about [improving the medkit and it's usability](URL I believe it was a year ago when the devs attempted to make it worth using but it ended up in mediocrity yet again due to the Healing Turret outshining it in utility. Heck even the A.E.D gets more use that the Med-kit. So in order to help suggest ideas to fix the medkit, some of us engies have taken to pulling out ideas from our creative backsides (ahem). So without further ado, here are some ideas for improving the Engi medkit: **JERUS SAYS:** ""If I could design it Id do something like this: **5 skill = Mist field, 4s duration water field that applies regen. On a ~15-20s reuse** **4skill = Large group heal, ideally range capable but only heals allies not self on a ~15s reuse** **3skill = medum elixir heals on a 8-10s reuse, smallish radius but solid range.** **2skill = multiple med packs** **1skill = same but add some form of damage, or rebuild into something with better range and more control.** Id also make these reliant on healing power stat, so playing the support while being full damage isnt really possible, but helping would be. If you built for support though you could play a quality healing role at least near the level of a healing Ele, but again without the personal sustain matching. With all this Id probably still run healing turret usually, or gyro when I currently run gyro, but Id have the option to help the healer or play the healer role. Right now we can basically be an Ele without any of its burst healing through Super Elixir and Elixir Shell regens and some traits, but thats just not good enough."" **WONDOROUS WALL SUGGESTS:** ""Going with what Dirame said on suggestions rather than buffing mediocre skills, Id like to see Med Kits 2-5 done in more interesting ways to mix things up while keeping some of the current aspects that (I think) are unique. * **2) Healing Beacon:** Fire a beacon into a foe that heals nearby allies for two pulses, then detonates, granting Regeneration (4s) and removes a damaging condition. (600 range,180 radius) * **3) Stimulant Field:** Dispense a water field (3s) that heals allies, grants Fury (6s), and removes a debilitating condition (weakness, blind, vulnerability) on impact. (600 range, 240 radius) * **4) Acceleration Wave:** Send out a cone of energy that heals allies, grants Swiftness (8s), and removes a movement-impending condition (cripple, chill, immobilize). (600 range) * **5) Antidote Spray:** Release a mist around yourself that heals you and nearby allies, grants Resistance (2s), and removes a controlling condition (taunt, fear, slow). (300 radius, instant cast) **DIRAME SUGGESTS:** ""STEP 1: Make all Med-kit skills, cooldown abilities. No auto attack, no spammable attack, just useful abilities that make sense for someone who carries a med-pack and is an engineer in the crazy world that is Tyria. * **SKILL 1: Explosive Elixir Dart** *Elixir. Cast Time: half a second. Recharge: 20s* Fire an explosive dart at the target location that heals allies when it explodes. If they are downed, heal them for 5% health (increased by 2% per 70 healing power). Water Field: lasts for 2s. * **SKILL 2: Rescue Acceleration Device:** *Cast Time: Half a second. Recharge 30s* Leap to target location (600 range) and gain 5s of super speed. If an ally is downed near you, also gain 10s of protection, regeneration and 15% increased revive speed. Leap Finisher. * **SKILL 3: Covert Rescue Apparatus:** *Cast Time: Instant. Recharge: 35s* Apply 2s stealth to you and 3 other nearby allies. * **SKILL 4: Cleansing Blast** *Cast time: Half a second. Recharge: 35s* Throw a grenade at a target location that removes 3 conditions from you and allies within a 600 radius. *Blast Finisher.* * **SKILL 5: First Aid Packs** *Cast Time: 3 quarters of a second. Recharge: 40s* Throw 3 medpacks at the target location. or * **SKILL 5: Quarantine Perimeter** *Cast Time: 3 quarters of a second. Recharge: 40s* Create an area at the target location that enemies cannot enter. *Unblockable* **THINK OF THE COMBO POSSIBILITIES!** The Engie is a utilitarian profession. Without the ability to use a particular tool multifaceted-ly, it loses a lot of the things that define the class. This rule obviously doesnt have to be obeyed all the time but it really makes the engie shine when it is obeyed. The above skills will not only be used for landing rezzes but also for the utility the skills will have outside of healing and rezzing people."" If you want to get in on the discussion, just drop your thoughts and ideas for how you would like to improve the medkit below. I think it's best we tell the devs what we want rather than hope they have clairvoyance."

In a realistic scenario, the build evens out at around 21.5k DPS after having set up phantasmal warlocks. When your group manages to keep at least 7 conditions active on the boss you're fighting on average, phantasmal warlocks (staff) seem to be preferable over phantasmal swordsmen (sword off-hand). In the realistic scenario for the staff mesmer video, 8 conditions have been placed on the golem as an estimate of a raiding scenario (bleeding, burning, confusion, poison, slow, cripple, vulnerability and blind for example should be fairly easy to maintain). The same build with phantasmal swordsmen instead of warlocks will even out at around 20.5k DPS in a realistic scenario, no matter how many conditions are on the boss. Gear was min-maxed to hit exactly 100% crit chance with all buffs through a mix of Berserker's and Assassin's gear (using Truffle Steak, Toxic Sharpening Stones, Scholar Runes, Air/Force Sigils). The used trait lines were domination, illusions and chronomancer. Because of the lack of dueling (and thus Phantasmal Fury) in this build, I use Signet of Inspiration at the beginning to keep my phantasms at 100% crit chance. The chronomancer line was chosen over dueling because of the DPS advantage shield #5 has vs. torch #4 when fighting mobs with large hitboxes as well as the possibility to take Well of Calamity, which is a significant DPS boost over sword AA. Also, setting up phantasms and thus getting your DPS up is way faster when you have access to continuum split and the Chronophantasma trait. --- **EDIT:** As others have pointed out, the realistic attempts weren't really realistic because of the use of Signet of Inspiration which copied all of my boons to my phantasms, which would normally never happen since there would be other players receiving these boons instead. Therefore, for realistic scenarios, taking dueling over domination or illusions (for Phantasmal Fury) might be the smarter choice. I've added a video of this more realistic scenario in the table above. --- **EDIT 2 (BUILDS):** I tried to reproduce the used builds on gw2skills.net for easier viewing. For gear, it really comes down to hitting 100% crit chance while keeping as much power as possible. I've added them to the table above. --- **EDIT 3:** I was actually able to crank the DPS for the optimal scenario up to 30.2k by making use of Well of Calamity and Well of Recall on my phantasms to up their attack speed. A video and build link have been added to the table above. "

I know a meta build exists, I know it's the best option out there. Still, I felt like making one of my own. I didn't think it'd be better than the meta, I still thought it could be pretty good. I posted it so people would give me feedback and advice, and instead a big part of you just got pissed off. I'm relatively new to the game, and felt like being a little creative. What you guys are doing is discouraging people from trying out new unique builds, and sharing for feedback. Which is bad, because I think different playstyles are more fun than clones. Even if it's not the absolute best. Things don't have to be perfect.** I also posted a defensive no retaliation build I made but I deleted it after realizing protection and generally all boons also get stolen at T4 fractals, making that build pointless. URL This is my first real build, I'm not the most experienced player but I spent quite a while playing as a Guardian so hey, maybe it's good :D *Virtues:* Activating virtues gives you according boons. **Being under Aegis gives a 20% increase in damage.** Virtue of Resolve heals better and removes conditions from allies. When you **apply a Virtue, you get retaliation.** Which lasts longer now. Virtue of Justice's passive effect now also has AoE burns, you gain **1% more damage for each boon you have**, and virtues recharge faster. *Zeal:* When you're struck below 75% health, you drop a symbol that **gives you retaliation.** This is important because you'll have traits that **increase your damage against enemies in your symbols(10%), burn enemies who are in your symbols, and increase your damage against burning enemies(7%) and when under the effect of retaliation(10%).** Symbols will now apply vulnerability to foes. **Damage with GS is increased (5%)**. *Radiance*: Virtue of Justice active now blinds foes too. You gain Fury when hitting a foe with more than 3 stacks of burn (which is very often the case with bosses). **Attacks against burning foes have 10% more crit chance.** Retaliation increases your damage by 10% (already said that above). Burn damage is increased, and you burn enemies whose attacks you successfully block. **Weapons**: I use GS and Scepter/Focus. I know my 2nd set isn't a popular choice but I find it's pretty fun and correct me if I'm wrong it's still high damage. **Skills:** Shelter for blocks and heals - blocks burn enemies. Purging Flames - good burning, and removes conditions. Burn is important for more damage and more critical chance ""Save Yourselves!"" - 7 boons = 7% more damage, retaliation is one of those boons=10% more damage. Generally it's a good skill Bane Signet is power ""Feel my Wrath"" - low recharge and the quickness is awesome. **Rotation:** I start with the GS because it's burst damage and has slower recharge than the Scepter/Focus. Basically if you want to keep damaging decently you use up your GS skills and instantly switch. I start battle with Aegis - 20% damage. I use Save Yourselves for 7% more damage and it has retaliation so that's another 10%. I use Purging Flames just before I reach the target. Burn damage adds 7% overall damage. So far we have a 44% increase, 49% with the permanent +5% GS damage. Aegis is fragile and I'll take that into account. Then I use my elite skill for quickness. **Everything has to happen fast to combine all bonuses together.** After that skill #3 to launch at the foe - and blind. Blind will hopefully make the foe miss and save your aegis for another second. Still fragile, I know. Skill #4 - a symbol that also gives retaliation. That will preserve your +10% dmg bonus from retaliation and give you another 10% if the enemy is in your symbol. Quickness is still active when you use #2 - Whirling Wrath which is a very powerful skill especially with the damage bonuses. If you lost your aegis or the enemy is no longer burning, decide for yourself if it's worth using F1 and F3 for instant burn blind and aegis. If you are going to use them for a short yet meaningful DPS increase, this is the skill to use it for. After that I swap sets. I use #3 to immobilize the foe and then #2 - a symbol that's pretty powerful and applies vulnerability because it's a symbol. Skills 4 and 5 are defensive and use them as you see fit. Then I spam #1 until GS is ready. By the time you can swap again, GS would have recharged. You won't have the elite skill yet but use the other utility ones as you see fit. When you use up the GS, repeat and swap to 2nd set. Personally I also have a superior sigil of rage on my scepter. I know it's not a popular choice but I like the quickness. I have a 50% chance of getting it on a critical hit and enough things to increase my critical hit chance to make it happen pretty often which results in a nice DPS. The key is to remember all the things that increase your damage - like enemies in symbols, # of boons, enemy burning, retaliation, Aegis which is 20% more damage and way easier to preserve when you're using a focus and scepter because they're ranged. Thanks for reading, I hope you liked it. Please give feedback P.S: I know in high tier fractals you can't use retaliation, you'll need a different build for these."
254,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"[Discussion] Fresh Air Staff Tempest is improved by using Lightning Hammer when Alacrity uptime is less than 100% (still not enough to replace Fire Staff, though.)",47,525htw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/525htw/discussion_fresh_air_staff_tempest_is_improved_by/,2016-09-11 08:18:36,"**TL;DR at the bottom** Hello, I want to share something I've discovered that may or may not end up being important, but it has relevance to current optimal builds for Tempest. I have created a conjurer build for Fresh Air Staff Tempest that revolves around using Lightning Hammer in between Meteor Showers. Lightning Hammer has a few potentially useful features: * Autoattack is higher DPS than most filler skills, and is a blast finisher (usually applying Swiftness but possibly Might+Fury or others depending on ally field timing) * Lightning Leap applies Daze when used inside a Lightning combo field (Overload Air, Static Field) * Wind Blast is a strong single-target CC * Lightning Storm scales well against large hitbox enemies, which is the primary role of Staff Tempests * Static Field is another strong CC that will apply if the player positions themselves so that the edge of the ring spawns inside the target's hitbox. This is easily followed up with Lightning Leap due to being a Lightning field. * Lightning Hammer grants 180 Precision to the wielder, which allows the use of Sigil of Air over Sigil of Accuracy. Now, for the DPS tests. This build has been tested under conditions identical or as close to [qT's benchmarking standards](URL as possible: * Realistic test includes 2 stacks of Grace of the Land, Spotter, Assassin's Presence, Empower Allies, Banners, Frost Spirit, 25 Might, Fury, Quickness. Alacrity not used because it is not possible to maintain Alacrity permanently on 10 players. * Large Hitbox 4,000,000 HP target golem; only Burning and 25 Vulnerability are relevant to this build, I chose ""all of them"" to save time in testing. * Realistic +Alacrity simply adds Alacrity to the Realistic set of buffs. * All Buffs includes every profession buff and boon available. Differences: * [The build I used for testing](URL * qT's Staff Tempest benchmarks were performed with 18 Mighty Infusions, which grant 90 Power. I used 2 Mighty Infusions for 10 Power, and used [Plate of Steak and Asparagus](URL for 80 more Power to match. * **I did not use Seaweed Salad.** To factor in Seaweed Salad, I will perform a small additional calculation. Seaweed Salad uptime is dependent on how often Meteor Shower is cast. Estimated casting time is ~2 seconds, and is cast once every ~30 seconds without Alacrity, and once every ~23 seconds with Alacrity. This gives a Seaweed Salad maximum uptime potential of 93.3% without Alacrity, and 91.3% with Alacrity. Build | Realistic Buffs | Realistic +Alacrity | All Buffs ---|----|----|--- [qT FA Staff Tempest](URL | 27,674 | 34,655 | 41,982 [FA LH Staff Tempest](URL | 30,271^1 | 34,428^2 | 40,561^2 Raw Testing Data | [27,688](URL | [31,548](URL | [37,168](URL ^1 Raw data multiplied by 1.0933 to factor in Seaweed Salad. ^2 Raw data multiplied by 1.0913 to factor in Seaweed Salad. **Analysis** I would like to stress that this is just a preliminary step in theorycrafting, and I am making no claims whatsoever about this build's performance or relevance within the meta. However, I will emphasize a few things about my test results: * This build appears to be significantly stronger than standard Fresh Air Staff with only Quickness. * This build does not scale as well with Alacrity as other builds; at 100% Alacrity it is just a tiny bit behind standard Fresh Air Staff. * In a realistic scenario with less than 100% Alacrity uptime, it would therefore perform better on average. * The build is heavily impacted by the [autoattack aftercast bug](URL However, in my testing, I found that mashing 1 was in fact the *best* way to get around the bug. Here are some additional notes I would like to add as discussion points about the advantages and disadvantages of the build: * The build contains a lot more CC than a staff tempest would otherwise have access to; this may or may not be important depending on group composition * It is easy to fall back on standard Fresh Air Staff rotations if you need to drop the hammer * High movement fights require predictively placing your second hammer up to 30 seconds in advance, so you may retrieve it without moving far away from the boss; this may be difficult or impossible in some scenarios **TL;DR** I made a build ([link](URL and it is realistically potentially better than Fresh Air Staff when you have low Alacrity uptime, but still not as good as Fire Staff.

255,vulnerability,Guildwars2,In Depth DPS Beastmaster Guide (PVE fun) 14k Jaguar Bites!,58,53f3tn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/53f3tn/in_depth_dps_beastmaster_guide_pve_fun_14k_jaguar/,2016-09-19 10:45:50,"*Edit* I'm not good at Reddit formatting, forgive me! Hello All, I've been a Ranger main since GW1 and in that game i had a second Ranger who specialized in Beastmastery, he was sneaky good and running through Factions with him I got the survivor title and realized his DPS was on par or better than my axe warrior. So i've always wanted to make pet-focused builds in GW2 and I've got a few worth sharing! First, a note that this build is entirely flexible with what runes/stats you run for yourself, it's all in the utilities and traits. Nothing you do there will affect your pet, it's up to you if you want to tank it up while your pet does all the damage, or as I prefer to play it add in your own impressive damage alongside theirs. There's also several variations you can do, such as going into Druid for a less bursty but more sustain playstyle. Also, this will be an in-depth write up sharing all the tips i can think of! Build and best rotation will be at bottom.. I. THE PETS The perfect place to start! I see 3 main options for a DPS beastmaster build: The Jaguar, The River Drake, and the Smokescale. Jaguar's stealth lasts 6 seconds and increases it's critical hit chance and critical hit damage by 25% each, instant cast- Use this to synchronize your burst and get the juiciest numbers. The River Drake and Smokescale are similar with high HP, good dmg, and good utility. both have a hard hitting bouncing attack that's best used with only 1 target for max damage to them. Drake has a blast on a really hard hitting skill that they predictably use upon entering combat/after pet swap, Smokescale behaves the same and use their bouncing skill then, but also has a smoke field you can fire through for blind or blast for stealth. For the best dmg combo, i go Jaguar/River Drake. II. THE WEAPONS Longbow- everybody knows everything about this weapon by now, but here's a few things about it regarding this build. Rapid Fire's got 10 vuln on it. Vuln is SO easy to get but remember how potent it is for your big numbers. 25% increased dmg at the cap, starting a fight out with rapid fire, double opening strike with you and your pet and the enemy is already at 20% extra dmg taken in no time. Later on in traits we'll see that we'll gain access to critical hits granting might to your pet. Rapid Fire, Barrage, and Hunter's Call from the Warhorn are constantly pumping out might, proccing sigils, and of course just killing stuff Axe/Warhorn- The auto grants more might, the secondary hits a bunch to proc more sigils and might, the third attack is a nice chill, weakness debuffer. Hunter's Call adds another 16 hits to proc sigils of Rage and Generosity and adds on 16 vulnerability, and Call of the Wild is the beginning of the insane Boon sharing that gives this build a second look! Long lasting might, fury, swiftness, regen and even longer durations for your pet. III. THE SKILLS Heal: Heal as One- a must for the build, it heals for a nice chunk but more importantly it copies all boons from yourself to your pet, and from your pet to yourself...This allows for upkeep of all the boons you care about, and instant stacks of 25 might that go from your pet to yourself, and it lengthens durations of everything, most notably quickness and stability. It's insane. And the cooldown is short so you can focus on constant upkeep of boons you care about, like swiftness for travel, fury/might/regen in battle. Utilities: there are two here that are locked into the build, and the third can change depending on what type of player you want to be: Locked #1: Sic' em! 40% dmg, 40% movement speed. Hell yes Locked #2: Signet of the Wild: the passive is a heal that's stronger for your pet than yourself and while small it combines together with the constant regen, and Natural Healing trait for your pet giving it 3 sources of healing regen at all times(until SofW is activated). Way more important, is that upon activation it grants a 25% Damage boost, alongside 5 stacks of stability(10 for your pet) and a 50% movement increase. This will be activated alongside sic em when looking for the biggest bursts when some of the other conditions line up right. Option #1: Quickening Zephyr: for Yolo dps builds. more quickness for yourself and your pet, to get off long attacks like rapid fire, barrage, cast your stuff quicker, and for your pet just to get as many big attacks in as possible while the Best Burst time window is open. Option #2: Signet of Renewal: if you dont choose this, you have basically 0 condition removal besides the 1 every 9 seconds from Axe/Warhorn's sigil. your call. Both options are a stun break, but you also have lots of stability Elite: Strength of the Pack: Pulsing stability, might, swiftness. Most important, your hits grant might to your pet and their hits grant you might. activating this, and then barrage/ or rapid fire/or hunter's call( all of them is overkill) followed by the heal skill is an INCREDIBLY easy, fast 25 stacks of might for yourself. IV. TRAITS MARKSMANSHIP-FOR MAX DPS The build works without Marksmanship, so if you're looking for more sustain it's the one i drop for druid.....but i think it loses it's fun, juicy numbers too. Therefor i stick with my Bottom/MIddle/Top choice for these bonuses: -call Call of the Wild when you swap pets(AOE 15s fury/might/swiftness/10s regen and 3s Quickness and a blast finisher) ready every 30s. doesn't sync up with pet swap, so if you swap on cooldown you're missing out on some of them. -10% more dmg when your endurance is full. so your opening Rapid Fire is usually what will benefit from this, at the least -15% more dmg when your foe suffers from Cripple(from barrage) and Chill, from Winter's Bite on axe(relevant ones on this build). Another way to think of this trait is see Barrage's wide AOE area? everything in it you do 15% more dmg to while barrage is up, or you do 15% more damage for 4s when you hit a foe with Winter's Bite. of course in more populated areas these conditions will also constantly be on things. Option for farming: Use Lead the Wind, for peircing Longbow arrows. Rapid Fire -&amp;gt; loot NATURE MAGIC - For the boons! this build would BARELY work without fortifying bond, the minor. Any boon you get is shared with your pet (which you can then transfer to yourself and double up with the heal) Go for Top/bottom/middle - 1% extra dmg for every boon on you. I generally have 6 boons on me, so 6% extra dmg -regen on Hunter's call, and faster warhorn skill recharging. the regen helps your otherwise very glassy build stay in it -Protective Ward: protection and weakness when hit, the protection is shared to your pet, and you can extend it with heal. BEASTMASTERY- Because we're beastmasters! Minors summarized: Your pet does more way damage, and you can swap faster Go for Middle/Bottom/Middle. -Might on critical hit. it's only 5 seconds, but there are soooo many little hits on ranger that it takes only a skill or two to get to that 25 might for your pet, and stays there because it's also being bolstered by your war horn, heal, etc. -good health regen to combine with regen and signet -Quickness on pet swap is an amazing quality of life improvement i can't go back on. Use it to extend your quickness from other places, or when you're doing your own rapid fire burst, or to cut down on cast times of bulky skills like barrage and hunters call. Also, obviously helps your pet get it's own burst off better If you're still with me at this point, congratulations. hang in there lol. V. SIGILS AND RUNES not much is locked in! I definitely have been enjoying sigil of rage( 3s of quickness) on my warhorn. Hunter's call hits 16 times in a few seconds so is basically a guaranteed proc of it, so add that to what the skill does. I also use sigil of generosity to cleanse condis, and Air/Fire on longbow For Runes i have Runes of the Ranger from my other build. extra 7% dmg and some nice offensive stats. anything you want can work here though! FOR PVP/WVW VARIANT( you must be brave lol) GO WITH RUNES OF THE SOLDIER! much needed condi removal for more serious competition! it's even AOE so more group support to go with your boons VI. The Burst Rotation To start off a fight, this is my usual rotation on a high HP boss that wont die before i can finish a rapid fire lol. Hide your pet so that when it comes out on first hit, Hunter's call is auto-used and you gain Quickness, fury, 6 might, swiftness, regen (+5% dmg) 1. strength of the pack 2. barrage 3. Signet of the Wild 4. Use Jaguars F2 5. Sic em 6. We Heal as One 7. Rapid Fire 8. Basically anything you do from here on out will boost you pets damage, make sure you use We Heal as One and pet swap before you use Rapid Fire because it almost always gives you the 25 might to go along with the quickness and fury to hit hard. I focus on getting in as many hits as possible to proc sigils/might, managing my boons and when to heal to double them up, and making sure to line up my utilities for when my Pets F2s are ready for the burst. Lightning Drake's F2 on a single target can be about 4k each tick on lightly armored mobs, and Jaguar routinley hits for 6k with his basic attack under quickness, his heavy bite skill did 13.8k the other day on Nyle the Compassionate in Bloodstone Fen and routinely hits 9 or 10k. You just pump up their might, make sure they're attacking crippled/chilled things, try to keep your health over 90%, and hand out Sic ems and Sig.Wilds to really boost that damage! My personal playstyle is to use this build with Near-full zerker stats, some toughness, some vitality thrown in while my pets are doing their thing, it really melts things quickly toghether URL *Edit If i knew how to add the screenie of my 14k Jaguar bite for proof, i would lol* *Edit I think i got it. Here's a screencap of a big Jaguar bite, you can also see the 6.5k slash in there. that's his auto attack! that will be done several times in quick succession during the burst so his damage really adds up. URL If you read the entire write up, I'm very impressed! ;) "
256,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"[Fan-made] Elite Spec: Elementalist ""Spellblade""",11,4uevmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4uevmd/fanmade_elite_spec_elementalist_spellblade/,2016-07-25 06:28:14,"Sup reddit I've been lurking for a while and have yet to post anything until now. So Ele is a complicated class, I tried it when I first started playing and promptly dropped it for my Guard to eventually complete the maps and do the majority of the content with. But its undeniable that Ele one of the most rewarding classes to master. Tempest took the Ele in new direction, less dependent on quickly cycling through attunements, more about committing to an attunement for a powerful overload. While I have thought about what a new spec would look like, this is what I came up with, a mechanical diversion from the current elite spec we have that could also interact with it should the dev's allow for elites to bleed into each other. So here it is! Elite Specialization: The Spellblade Weapon: Sword main hand Skill category: Mantra's Mechanic: Spells when changing attunement. Sword/Fire: 1). Auto Attack chain -&gt; 3rd Auto attack whirl finisher that hits up to 5 foes. 2). Flaming sword buff (extra Dmg and Condi Dmg for X sec's). 3). Vaulting Attack, Leap finisher that burns foes passed through. Sword/Air: 1). Auto Attack chain -&gt; 3rd Auto attack ALWAYS crits 2). Direct-able dash attack 3). Channels a blocking animation, blocks an attack, then teleports up to 500 to counter attack Sword/Water: 1). Auto Attack chain -&gt; 3rd Auto attack applies Chill and vulnerability for x secs 2). 2 sec wind up animation, if the spell connects it freezes/stuns the foe for 2 sec's 3). Pistol Whip/Blurred Frenzy style attack Sword/Earth: 1). Auto Attack chain -&gt; 3rd Auto attack immobilizes for x sec's 2). strike the ground opening a fissure that blast finishes, fissure bleeds and cripples in a rectangle AoE 3). Summon stone plates to block up to 5 attacks, after 3 sec's plates seek nearest target and are launched as projectiles one at a time. Mantra's Mantra of Ether: 3 Charges. Heals better per boon on self Mantra of Fire: 2 Charges. Burn and Damage the Target Mantra of Air: 1 Charge. Knock the opponent away from you by 100 Mantra of Water: 2 Charges. Cleanse 2 Conditions Mantra of Earth: 1 Charge. applies 1 stack of bleed, 2 stacks, 3 stacks, then finally 4 stacks after 4 seconds. Mantra of Fusion: 1 Charge. For 5 seconds you blend each of the attunements skills on your weapons. Each skill 1-5 casts all four versions at the same time. Aimable skills such as AoE's and Lines would still be manually targeted. Attunement Spells When the Spellblade swaps attunements, they create a spell specific to the two attuments. I Imagined the flavor behind it being the mixing of the two attunements briefly as you swapped. Fire &lt;-&gt; Earth = Creates a mobile lava font with the spellblade as its center, causing damage around them. Fire &lt;-&gt; Water = A cloud of steam burst from the Spellblade, granting healing based on outgoing damage for a few seconds Fire &lt;-&gt; Air = A trail of smoke is left by the Spellblade blinding nearby foes and destroys up to 5 projectiles. Air &lt;-&gt; Earth = The Spellblade becomes the center of a moving dustdevil that pulls nearby foes toward them (Can only hit the opponent once per cast) Air &lt;-&gt; Water = Brews up a storm cloud that generates fury for every spell cast during this spells duration to self and nearby allies Water &lt;-&gt; Earth = Muddy terrain spews from the Spellblade causing foes to enter it to become weakened and crippled. I haven't played around with coming up with traits because that's a game designers job. The goal of this spec was to hearken back to the D/D Ele days when players had to utilize CD management while being rewarded from anticipating attacks and juggling skill combinations. The spells generated from switching attunements are not going to be as powerful damage wise as the Overloads for Tempest, and they shouldn't. This spec addresses a couple of gripes that I have had with the class for a while. First off it grants the Ele a true melee weapon, and with 3 other off hand weapons to choose from this gives Ele players a healthy amount of weapon combos to choose from with out being bogged down with choices. Secondly, mantra's are perfect for a class that is going to be casting alot of channels and auto attacks in combat. While auras were powerful with Tempest, a surprise burst from a quick combination of key presses can make a munchkins day. Lastly, Tempest is all about going from Overload to Overload, which is great from a DPS/Support perspective. Now if you 180 that mentality and encourage players in being flexible and having a tool for each situation, the class you get out of that is suddenly completely different."
257,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Calculating the value of Epidemic,10,4vivo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4vivo3/calculating_the_value_of_epidemic/,2016-08-01 06:33:58,"It's generally understood that a perfectly played Condi Engineer will out-damage a perfectly played Viper Reaper, but the immediate response to this is that the Reaper will pull far ahead when there are two or more of them and a target to epi bounce off of. It's difficult to determine the value of Epidemic, and to my knowledge no one has really made a serious effort, and so this response goes unchallenged and everyone just assumes that Reapers are the practically higher DPS class. Using some relatively generous assumptions (i.e. leaning toward a *higher* DPS value when uncertain), I have calculated the value of Epidemic, and thus ""epi bounce"", assuming full Viper's gear and condi food. Hopefully, these numbers should allow a more rational comparison of Reapers to other damage classes, rather than just blindly assuming that Epidemic automatically catapults them to the top of the charts. **tl;dr: Each use of Epidemic deals a bit less than 196k total damage (per target hit). Accounting for alacrity, two necromancers bouncing *on cooldown* will achieve a net single-target DPS gain of ~~11k DPS, which is 5.5k per Reaper~~ 14.8k DPS, or 7.4k per Reaper.** --- With that out of the way, here are the gory details. Please check my work. More importantly, please check my *assumptions*, since theory crafting is, at all times, simply an outgrowth of one's assumptions and simplifications. - Condition Damage (gear + food): 1615 - Condition Duration (all condis): 100% - Average bleed stacks: 90 - Average bleed duration: 9 seconds - Average burn stacks: 20 - Average burn duration: 3 seconds - Average poison stacks: 20 - Average poison duration: 3.75 seconds - Average confusion stacks: 10 - Average confusion duration: 4.25 seconds - Average alacrity uptime: 40% - 25 stacks of might (750 extra condi damage) - 25 stacks of vulnerability Please check the above very carefully. If you disagree with my conclusions, it's *probably* because you disagree with one of my assumptions. A bit of quick justification: - I'm assuming a relatively standard setup with two necromancers and no other condi DPS. If you have an engineer, bump up the burn and poison stacks a bit; if you have an A/T druid or condi guardian, bump up the burns. - Condition stacks fluctuate considerably in a fight. The stack counts above are just a general guess based on watching debuffs in various fights and knowing how many conditions are generally applied by each class. - Durations are *really* hard. I calculated average durations by looking at the 7 most common sources of each condition (4 in the case of Confusion) and averaging them out. I didn't weight the averages, but I did round *up*. All durations are baseline (i.e. not considering attribute/talent bonuses). - I'm ignoring Torment and other conditions simply because they're far less common in any volume. Epidemic is limited to transferring 25 stacks of each condition. With our assumptions, this limit is only relevant to bleeds, but it could be relevant to burns as well depending on your comp. Now, with all of this in mind, we can calculate the total value of a single Epidemic transfer to a single target as being the following: ``` (25*(22 + 0.06*2365)*18 + 20*(131.5 + 0.115*2365)*6 + 20*(33.5 + 0.06*2365)*7.5 + 10*(10 + 0.035*2365)*8.5)*(1+0.25) ~= 196000 ``` So 25 stacks of Bleeds transferred, and the rest at the maximum. Condition coefficients were drawn from the wiki, and the durations are based on the previously calculated averages multiplied by 2. Now again, this is the damage value of Epidemic *per target hit*. There's no question that Epidemic is the highest damage AoE ability in the game. But all we're trying to calculate here is the value of bouncing back to the primary target (e.g. epi bounce off seekers in VG), which is 196k. Epidemic has a 20 second cooldown. Alacrity is a 33% cooldown reduction, and we're assuming 40% uptime. That's an effective CD of 20/(1+0.33*0.4) = 17.67s. Assuming that you can epi bounce exactly on cooldown (which is a very generous assumption), that means a single bounce between two Reapers adds 11k DPS, or 5.5k per Reaper. If you have three Reapers, you'll get 22k DPS added, or 7.34k per Reaper, and so on. Again, this is only single-target DPS. Epidemic is unrivaled in truly multitarget situations (e.g. Sloth), but the single-target impact appears to be lower than is generally believed. **Edit** With Master of Corruption, Epidemic has a baseline CD of 20/(1+0.33) = 15s, and with alacrity, that's 15/(1+0.33*0.4) = 13.25s. Thus, the DPS increase when used on cooldown is 14.8k, or 7.4k per Reaper."
258,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Discussion on a class idea: Ley Walkers,0,4vklb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4vklb0/discussion_on_a_class_idea_ley_walkers/,2016-08-01 13:28:16,"Hey everyone, with the direction LS3 has decided to start with, Ley Lines seem to be a pretty big deal in the GW2 lore right now. They've been a thing since the first season of the Living Stories but also appear to be incredibly key to whatever is going on with Glint's Egg. With that said, Heart of Thorn brought Revenants, who can utilize the Mists to give different boons that Guardian or Warrior don't keep up. This can possibly leave the next expansion, if there is one, to have a Medium or Light armor class added to the docket. While I imagine it should be light armor, I wonder if a new class themed with the expansion could be released, utilizing ley lines as their power source, since Tyria is apparently littered in them underground. The explosion at Bloodstone Fen showed power crazed sufferers of the bloodstone explosion, and possibly explosion of that section of leyline, considering the severity of it. Could there be a possible class that can survive whatever happened and use it safely? If this is somehow keeping you interested, I'd propose that this class mainly be a focus on close range AoE damage, having multiple burst like abilities that could leave either boons such as Protection, Retaliation, or Fury while also having some that drop conditions. i.e Torment, Vulnerability, and Weakness or Fire Damage. While our melee focused classes are able to live because of a mix of their armor and abilities, a light armored tank like character would fill a niche like the Spectre elite spec does, able to survive off their abilities. Here's where I leave the dicussion, if you like it and have ideas on how to specify the class' abilities, great. If you hate it, also great. Be sure to leave a reason why, I'm sure it's not perfect. TL;DR: Melee Burst AoE class, likely light armor for next expansion. Thoughts."
259,vulnerability,Guildwars2,The Changes that NEED to happen for the Engineer,73,4vuhtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4vuhtj/the_changes_that_need_to_happen_for_the_engineer/,2016-08-03 06:01:24,"Note: This is a long read. The purpose of this post is to bring together all the suggestions on how to improve the Engie in all game modes, not just PvP. This post is from Padre on the forums: I spent a fair bit of time trying to figure out different builds this weekend and encountered a fair amount of inconsistencies in our traits, skills, and wording of tool-tips. 1. Turrets, Gyros, and Explosions Currently, Detonating Turrets has a chance to proc the trait Shrapnel. However, Gyro self-destruct does not trigger this trait. There needs to be more consistency is language and keywords in the engineer traits and skills. Perhaps Explosion should be underlined and next to it should be the amount of explosions a particular skill causes? 2. Gadgets and Gadgeteer Gadgets need to be buffed. They take up a slot and for skills with one or two uses with low synergy over kits they need to provide more utility than what they currently do. The Gadgeteer trait is simply not enough to invoke create uses of Gadgets. I see Gadgets as more-or-less a way to provide utility where the Engineer lacks. An engineer would make a gadget to assist them in things they could not normally do. With this in mind, how could we make gadgets unique and/or improve their utility? I think Gadgets need a unified mechanic similar to explosions above or maybe give them a similar mechanic with boons like Alchemy? Perhaps Gadgeteer should be Gain boons for each Gadget Equipped (Might for Rocket Boots, etc) . Boon duration is increased for each Gadget Equipped (+2 seconds). 3. Gyros and AI The idea of Gyros and how they fit in with the other trait lines needs work. We need some kind of cohesion, honestly, with other trait lines, in general, but Gyros in particular feel like they are outsiders. The Blast Gyro only works about 50% of the time. For example, I summon the Blast Gyro and it just sits there and does nothing. I have reported this bug multiple times. In addition, the other Gyros at times, will just disappear even though I have hit the self-destruct. The pathing on Gyros is better than where it was but there needs to be improvement there. I hope ANet reads this and even discusses it internally. My goal is to provide a means to bring these items to light. Im frustrated; very frustrated at the state of my profession but its important to channel that into constructive ideas. -Padre This old post from Chaith details a bunch of things that needs to happen for the Scrapper in order to improve that: URL 1.) Functionality changes to Gyros &amp; Final Salvo. Gyro Self-Destruct  Gyro Self Destruct Daze &amp; Damage now occurs on the Scrappers location. This increases the responsiveness and accuracy of Gyro dazing. Final Salvo  Field Effect is established on the Engineers location as he travels. Visual noise reduced! This allows the Scrapper to be mobile without being punished, and apply super speed to allies better. 2.) Improved Crippling ability to Elixir Gun. Glob Shot  Projectile Speed increased 20%, projectile tracking added so projectiles wont be walked away from. These changes will allow the Engineer to catch fleeing opponents better. 3.) Shocking Speed never being used in any game mode  Instead of the current effects, When hit while under the effects of super speed: stuns nearby attacking foes with an electric shock (only once per 10 seconds for each attacker). This trait could be utilized well by offensive non-hammer Scrappers to recover some slipperiness/counter pressure. 4.) Expert Examination never being used in any game mode  Stunning or dazing a foe causes damage in addition to its current effects. 400 base damage at level80, (1000 power), .40 power scaling. Providing a damage option for offensive Scrappers not wanting to stack healing effects / Stability in the Master Tier 5.) Buffs to accuracy / power / cooldowns of various Pistol/Rifle/Shield skills. Goal is to have interchangeable weapon options outside Hammer. Non-Hammer weapons are completely lacking in overall budget, even with recent pistol tweaks. Hammer leading in damage, utility, and defense really highlights this. Here are my posts in the same topic suggesting things to improve the Engie as it stands right now: URL ADEPT TIER Minor remains the same, Grenadier remains the same. Merge Explosive Descent and Glass Cannon.  Do this in order to make Explosive descent feel like less of a useless trait in almost all game modes. New Trait: Thermite powder Explosions apply twice the vulnerability. You explode when downed, knocking targets back  This trait is an enabler to another trait that I concocted in the Grandmaster Tier. MASTER TIER: Modify Minor trait Steel-Packed Powder to include Thermobaric Detonation  Thermobaric Detonation on its own, is not a good trait that does anything for the engineer. Its currently not even used for style points either. Moving it to being a minor trait in the Master tier just feels right. Merge Aim-assisted rocket with Shaped charge, gives us space for another new trait. Sticky Grenade: Hitting targets in Melee range places a sticky charge on them that explodes after 1s. The explosion applies 5 stacks of vuln dazes them and is unblockable. ICD (10s).  I suggest this mainly to have something that rewards us for how we play on different ranges. This trait would also synergize with Grenadier and Thermite Powder. Modify Short Fuse; Bombs Explode faster and have a faster cooldown. Big Ol Bomb now applies 10 stacks of vulnerability. GRANDMASTER TIER Minor trait Explosive Powder remains the same. Siege Rounds remains the same. Replace Shrapnel with Forceful Explosives: Successful blast Finishers knockdown (2s) and apply 3 stacks of bleed, 3 stacks of vuln and cripples foes in the area of its activation. Blast Finishers also strip 2 boons. (Reasoning: With the rise of the Warrior and even the Necro, Ive come to find that one of the things lacking in the engineers kit is boon stripping. Giving them the potential to strip boons can be crucial for them to stay in the meta without getting schooled.) Move Thermobaric Detonation to Minor trait master tier, merged with Steel-Packed Powder as said earlier. This gives us space for a new trait. Concussive Blast; Hitting a foe that has vuln above the threshold [15 stacks] with an explosive applies 5 stacks of Bleeding, 5 stacks of confusion, weakness for 5s. [ICD 10s] Foes that block your explosives when they have 15 stacks of vuln are dazed for 1s. - (Reasoning: I felt that there was no incentive to use skills like the Bomb Kit and some other obscure utilities and traits. This trait synergizes with my suggested trait in the Master Tier, sticky grenade, it allows for almost any build to use this trait as long as it can reach 15 stacks of vuln, solving the issue of incentive.) I think the suggestions above would do wonders for the Engies build viability. If you imagine them on the trait table right now, you can see how synergistic the traits are with current traits and utilies. For example; Flamethrower gets a knockdown with Forceful explosives. Im not sure about meta viability but making changes like this to any class, puts it into the meta. Especially if those changes allow for a cool combination. And here is my suggestion for fixing the Firearms line as well; lets do what weve done for all the other classes, have each trait synergize with the next trait on the same level. So the first line: Chemical Rounds  Pinpoint Distribution  Incendiary Powder would be the line built for Pistol/Conditions Second Line: Heavy Armour Exploit  Skilled Marksman  Modified Ammunition but in order for the line to synergize. Skilled Marksman has to do more. Heres a suggestion for there to be more synergy; Skilled Marksman  Reduce Rifle/Harpoon damage by 10%. Rifle skills now apply additional conditions, attack faster and have lower cooldowns. Hip Shot applies Bleed, Net Shot applies 5 stacks of Vulnerability, Blunderbuss applies blind, Overcharged shot Applies 10 stacks of Vulnerability and Jump Shot no longer applies vuln but now applies Cripple and Bleeds. Calculating each unique condition from the above trait using Modified ammunition (immob, vuln, bleed, blind and cripple) without counting the damage added by vuln, you pretty much get your 10% damage back, barring any condi removal from your target. I think it would be the perfect solution to making Rifle and Modified Ammunition an interesting choice. It doesnt fix the problem with Rifle, which Ill get to in a bit, but it definitely makes the rifle a great power weapon and potentially a good condi weapon because of the diversity of cover conditions. Third Line: High Caliber  No Scope  Juggernaut Juggernaut can remain the same, I dont have any qualms with it but the other traits need to change because they do nothing for the viability of the engie. And they definitely dont synergize with ANYTHING in this line, talk less of any other trait on the engie. So heres how I think it should change; Replace High Caliber with Bullet Penetration (move this to master tier and bring No Scope to adept): Your flamethrower and projectile attacks become unblockable for 5s after they are first resisted (30s cooldown) (Reasoning: This is me trying to get to the core of the Rifles viability problem. In the meta now there is so much projectile reflect, deflect and blocks that its extremely difficult for the Engie to play anything other than Hammer. Creating a trait that targets that meta, gives the Engie a fighting chance.) Replace No Scope with Steady Marksman: Whilst you have stability, your attacks have 15% critical chance. (Reasoning: It synergizes well with the GM trait, Juggernaut and consequently, quite a few other builds on the engie. Also gives the engie more gearing options by reducing the need for crit chance if this trait is selected.) For Turrets: Apply a change to Experimental Turrets: Healing Turret applies Resistance instead of Vigor (Reasoning: In PvP and WvW, I believe the resistance would be more useful) Apply a change to Advanced Turrets: Using Healing Turret whilst other turrets are active gives your other turrets a 5k damage shield and Resistance for 3s. Turret Overcharge have 100% crit chance. Turret Cooldowns are reduced by 3s when their toolbelt skills are used. (Reasoning: With a skill on a short cooldown that can apply a shield to your turrets, they wouldn't die as quickly. The 100% crit chance on turret overcharge means that players can use turrets just for that reason only and you could even give them 25% crit chance while active to make leaving them active somewhat worthwhile.) These are my thoughts (and the thoughts of Chaith and Padre obviously) but lets bring all our thoughts on what needs to improve for the engie in all game modes here. That way we can make sure Anet sees all of them."

261,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Light fields are just bad,183,4xe3em,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4xe3em/light_fields_are_just_bad/,2016-08-13 01:32:00,"Boon thief hurting guardian's viability in fractals has been discussed a lot, but in my opinion, the real problem is just how bad light field are. Light combos produce lackluster effects, to the point that spamming light fields weakens all finishers your party may use. First of all, let's discuss retaliation. Retaliation has no place in pve, simple as that. If old confusion was bad, retaliation is a lot worse. And in pvp content, combos are not something you can count on, and guardian has quite a few sources of retaliation already. For the same reason, the light aura is useless. Retaliation aside, vulnerability is spammed in such huge amounts in party content, that 1 stack of vulnerability only when struck is laughable. Projectile and whirl finishers giving condition removal is interesting, but impractical. That been said, those two are at the bottom of the barrel already, regardless of combo field, and they quite honestly need an overhaul of their own. So, instead of removing boon thief, my suggestion is a change to the light+blast combo and light aura's functionality: **Blast:** Apply aegis to nearby allies (capped at 5 targets) **Light Aura:** Acts as a thematic opposite to Chaos Armour. When struck, Light Aura removes 1 boon from the attacker and 1 condition from you. (1 sec ICD per attacker)"
262,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Personal thoughts on elite specialization for the new expansion,0,4xnqpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4xnqpd/personal_thoughts_on_elite_specialization_for_the/,2016-08-14 21:21:15,"There was another thread regarding this but everyone was just throwing here and there small ideas and I got kinda carryed away and wrote a wall of text I'm kinda proud about. So, since I am a selfish and egoistic being in search for approval, I decided to get my own thread cause my thoughts got kinda lost and I really wanted to know opinions on what I wrote. I thought these elites bearing in mind what classes actually need, what some players actually want (according to what I read here and there, so I might be heavily biased) and what I would like to have. Not last, I tried to think about elite spec wihtout *adding* things to the existing ones (no power creep) but rather *replacing* the old ones with new ones (like reaper and DH). **Engi**: main hand mace, not solely power based (but mainly) but also condis. I'm thinking of confusion on interrupt as a mace weapon skill, to keep the toolkit theme around. Instead of function gyro engi would get four ""mecha-virtues"" without passive effects to replace the toolbelt skills (lets stop the power creep \o/ ) but that would inherit the toolbelt skills related traits. Something like: F1: slam your weapon into the ground, crippling and damaging foes, 240 radius, aoe, 15s CD F2: daze your target (1s, single target) and inflict 5 stacks of confusion (5s) if you interrupt your enemy, 20s cd. F3: break stun and give protection to yourself and allies (5s) and inflict weakness and vulnerability to foes around you (5s, 5 stacks of vuln), 360 radius, 30s CD. F4: breakstun, stand still in place, blocking attacks and cleansing one condition every second during the channel (kinda like revenant shield #5 but instead of healing it cleanses condis), 3s duration, 45s CD. **Ele**: main hand sword, not tanky at all, pure power set. Something like a squishy thief/spellcaster, with deception skills as new elite's utilities. The special thing would be having a 5th attunement which would work like a transform skill (death shroud/berserker) granting stealth-like *selfish* abilities, so to not replace engi and thief abilities to group stealth, and movement skills but it would have very long CD (thinking of at least 30 seconds). **Guard**: warhorn off hand, bard/monk style, with a focus on boon sharing but not tanky at all (offensive support, so that you have to invest in the core spec to get defensive abilities). Core virtues get replaced by new virtues more focused on supporting allies (was thinking about alacrity) with absolutely zero self sustain. New utilities would be tomes, acting as kits. **Mesmer**: main hand axe, with focus on power damage (glass cannon) and self and only self sustain. Was thinking about very dps focused meditations as utility skills, to get a somewhat dps but selfish feeling to the elite spec. The special ability would be replacing current shatter skills with other shatter skills more focused on self mobility and defense, to compensate for the additional dps provided from meditations: F1: shatter all your clones inflicting cripple and vulnerability at your target and gaining swiftness and vigor (3s) for every clone you shatter 15s CD. Mainly because mesmer without chrono is slow as fuck. F2: shatter all your clones, gaining superspeed (1.5s) and reflecting projectiles for 1s for every clone you shatter. ICD 20s. F3: shatter all your clones gaining stealth (2s) or every clone you shatter.CD 45s F4: shatter all your clones, blocking attacks for 1.5s for every clone you shatter **Necro**: torch offhand, dar support healer softly focused on conditions. I would be very intrigued by an elite spec with huge sustain and no deathshroud to compensate but with additional ""evil-virtues"" as special mechanic. Something like: F1: passive: transfer 1 condition from allies to yourself (ICD per player: 10s), active: convert 3 conditions into boons for yourself and 1 condition into boon for your allies. CD: 25s F2: passive: heal yourself based on the number of conditions on you (no conditions = no heal) 1 condition: 125hp, 2 conditions: 250 hp, 3 conditions: 500 hp. Ticks every 3s. Good scaling with healing power. Active: unleash a burst heals to allies based on the number of conditions on you: 1 condi 500hp, 2 condis: 1000 hp, 3 condis 2000 hp. Base values once again, very good healing scale (so that with 1000 healing power the third tick reaches ~4k hp heal) 240 aoe range, max target 5, 40s CD F3: passive: ignore poison -33% healing. Active: you and your allies gain resistance based on the number of conditions on you: 1 condi: 2s resistance, 2 condis 4s resistance, 3 condis: 8s resistance. CD at the very least 50s. **Thief**: duelist elite spec with off-hand sword. Something like brawler bruiser like elite spec, to give thieves a chance to not to only be +1 and decappers in pvp. I was thinking about stances as utility skills based on pulsing blinds and debilitating condis (immob/weakness/poison in primis) around the thief himself, to further highlight the ""constantly in fight"" aspect of the elite spec, and as elite special feature a sort of buffing stance instead of steal (with same icd and that would inherit the traitline buffs such as sleight of hand so to say) that would function alike berserker/celestial form changing the stances into a more dps version kinda like celestial avatar changes glyphs into a more supportive version but without modifying any weapon skills(like berserker form, a part from the burst skills). **ranger**: this is very biased towards what I'd like rsngers to get, i.e.: no goddamn fucking pets. A petless elite spec with aspects functioning like elementalists attunements based on nature spirits (sun, frost, wind, lightning) which would change new utility skills (wells) instead of weapon skills kinda like revenant (and would have no effect on old utility skills). New weapon: focus off-hand. **warrior**: I would like to keep the melee theme for warrior and let it evolve into a more adventurer/explorer version of it with melee staff (or offhand focus, still melee) as weapon. I would like the elite spec to be the very image of the bold and adventurous soon-to-be hero, with survival skills like rangers. The special mechanic would be replacing burst skills with selfish mobility/defensive skills so that the spec doesn't focus on dp only like berserker. Basically a 1v1 elite spec with not so much support. **Revenant**: despite the GS thing with trahearne as legend does actually sound cool, it simply isnt feasible because people who didnt play HoT sfory would get massive spoilers. So I was thinking about off-hand torch focused on magical spells that would inflict burning, with a flame legion charr from the siege of ascalon as legend (was it flame legion? Im not good at lore) and condi focused utilities. The special mechanic would be transform skill which would transform the revenant into a flame legion effigy (idk the correct name, but Im thibking about the final cof p1 boss, fyi) locking utility skills, like death shroud does, and giving it heavy dps and condi abilities.

263,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Engineer Elite Specialization Idea: Staff and Mode Swap,11,4y35i5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4y35i5/engineer_elite_specialization_idea_staff_and_mode/,2016-08-17 11:54:38,"For a while now, I have thought of engineer using staff as a mid-ranged tesla cannon... thing. I have also thought of what would happen if engineer had a weapon swap. Eventually those things came together to make my idea for this elite spec. Unique mechanic: Mode Swap The engineer gets a special weapon swap, that rather than giving the engineer a second weapon to use, changes the mode of the current weapon between the usual one and a more supportive one. New weapon: Staff Engineer uses the staff as either a mobile mid-ranged harasser, or a less-mobile mid-ranged single-target support. (You'll get what I mean.) Offensive mode: 1: Tesla Beam Fire off arcs of electricity from your staff in a cone, dealing 3 stacks of vulnerability for 10 seconds on the final channel strike. 2: Shock-Shot Fire out 3 projectiles that will home in on up to a single target per, placing a debuff that deals DoT. (Works somewhat like revenant sword 2, projectiles can home in on a single target, stacking the debuff to increase the damage by up to 100%.) 3: ??? (Not sure what to call it) Works like the dredge resonator skill, a brief cast that knocks down all enemies around you in a radius, also dealing damage. 4: Current Jolt Teleport a short distance to a target location, dealing damage in an area around where you teleport and where you teleport from. Can break stun. 5: P.A.G (Projectile Acceleration Gate) Create a wall that dazes enemies that pass through it, and grants swiftness to allies that pass through it. The wall will also slow down enemy projectiles and speed up ally projectiles. Defensive Mode: 1: Restoration Shock Similar to Tesla Beam, but deals less damage, and gives minor healing to allies, giving a slightly larger healing on the final strike. 2: Electron Transmitter Connect a beam of electrons between an enemy or an ally in a small, targeted area (basically select a target in range to apply the beam to). On an enemy, pulse small damage and a single condition onto them that is on you every second. On an ally, pulse healing and a single boon onto them that is on you every second. Synergies with Overcharge Battery. (The beam will break if target leaves range) 3: Power Recharge Send out a bolt for every enemy/ally nearby (up to 5) that copies an ally boon onto you, and steals an enemy boon. 4: ??? (Not sure what to call it) Similar to the skill Vale Guardian uses when he gets the breakbar, thrust your staff upward, firing out projectiles that, when they land, heal allies and apply vulnerability to enemies, dealing minor damage. 5: Overcharge Battery A channel skill that, as long as you're channeling, makes you invulnurable. If you have a target attached with Electron Transmitter, that target shares the invulnerability If it's an ally, and receives pulsing damage and chill if it's an enemy. If this skill is used when there is less time on the channel for Electron Transmitter, it will extend the time for the duration of the channel. So, that's my general idea for unique mechanic and weapon. I'd like to hear your ideas for the other weapon modes and possible utility skills!"
264,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Regular condition Necromancer vs Reaper condition necromancer,0,4y8nqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4y8nqy/regular_condition_necromancer_vs_reaper_condition/,2016-08-18 08:39:53,"I've played a lot with my kinda new condi necro to make it raid ready and it works well. At first i used a minion/condition-transfer build (did mostly bleeding dmg) with bloodmagic (for some team suport), curses and deathmagic. It worked really well against VG (only boss i had killed at the time). Then i thought id try a reaper build because every time i joined a group everyone kept asking ""no reaper build?"". So i made a condi reaper build with reaper, bloodmagic and curses. It did the job kinda good. But i wasnt sure it was the better of the two so i ""benchmarked"" both with the cat-golem (portal found in raidlobby), set hp to 1m and 25 vulnerability. Tried with food and utilities to mimic a raid and found that the non-reaper build killed it faster by about 6-10 sec. I tried a few times (atleast 3 times each) to make sure i had good results. The builds change a little depending on what boss you encounter. I did the tests with full vipers build. My thoughts: As the standard necro preformed better dps-wise, i can see that the reaper is more versatile and fits more encounters than a standard reaper. Example; The reaper chills from shouts and shroud 5 is nice on gorseval split-phase, witch the standard condi does not have. So i wonder a bit if people who play necro as there main know this and pick reaper for the reasons above, or have no one compared the two builds? BTW, my main proffesion is war, and i got a total of about 1500h ingame playtime. Would be great to hear what the rest thinks. :) Edit: Forgot to mention weapons, i used scepter/dagger when not in shroud and kept this consistent with both builds. Edit 2: The kill timings on the golems where (on average) 108-110 sec for non-reaper and 117-121 for reaper."
265,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Revenant Elite Specialization Idea: Greatsword,0,4yqcl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4yqcl6/revenant_elite_specialization_idea_greatsword/,2016-08-21 04:16:48,"Heyo! It's me again with another idea for a future elite specialization! This time it's for the revenant, and as we know by now, warriors and guardians have greatswords, so why not revenants? Revenant will become a mid/close-ranged marksman with a greatsword, so let's see some abilities! 1: Mist Slash A 3-chain auto attack. Each part shoots off a blade that passes through enemies. (If you've watched any anime where they put magic into swords and swing them to shoot a blade, it's basically that.) the first two inflict vulnerability, and the third inflicts a brief cripple. Range of 900. 2: Dividing Streak A short leap forward followed by a swing of the sword that shoots out a widening blade trail. Small at first when it's just fired, but harder to avoid the farther away you are from it as it expands the farther it travels. Inflicts chill on hit. Range of 1,200. 3: Rift-Quake Are you familiar with the mordrem Teragriffs that stab their spikey things into the ground to fire out those projectiles? This is that. The revenant stabs his sword into the ground to fire out a rupture that homes in on the target, causing cripple. If there are enemies close to the target, up to two additional ruptures will be shot out and home in on those nearby the target. Finally, you can choose how long this skill is used. Tap it to fire the rupture once, or hold it to fire off up to two more barrages. The reason I he this is that the skill roots you for the channel duration, so use it accordingly, taking safety into concideration. Range of 1,200. 4: Chaos-Bound A tricky but cool skill, throw your greatsword and fade into the mists, avoiding damage for the duration of the attack. The sword will bounce off of enemies and try to reach your target, delivering a large attack if it does hit the target. If your target is far away, and there are enemies that you can chain the sword bounce with, the sword will be thrown to the closest enemy and proceed to make its way to your target. Bounce distance of up to 600 units. 5: Collapsed Space Spin around to create a quickly expanding ring of mist energy, dazing and immobilizing enemies it hits while expanding. When it reaches the max radius, it stops and begins to to slowly draw inward, knocking back and crippling enemies that try to escape it. The ring will only draw in about halfway before ceasing to exist. Radius of 360. I can't think up a unique mechanic or utility skills for this, so I'm open to ideas! Post your additions/suggestions below!"
266,vulnerability,Guildwars2,My thoughts on how Power Necro should be buffed.,0,4yzknk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4yzknk/my_thoughts_on_how_power_necro_should_be_buffed/,2016-08-22 18:31:07,"So, this was originally a reply to [a comment in another post](URL that ended up being way longer than I initially intended. So I thought, hey, I went through the effort to write all this, why not make it an actual post? I wouldn't. GS is designed to be slow, that's what makes it unique. Buff it in ways that make it more reliable, without being faster (with a few exceptions). For the PvE side of things, give it some damage modifiers, like Unholy Fervor affecting all Necro skills. IMO these are the changes I'd make. Some of these changes probably shouldn't be a thing in WvW, but I don't play that so I can't say for sure what should and shouldn't be a thing. \#1: Second strike applies 0.5 seconds of Chill and third strike aftercast reduced. \#2: Split into two hits (like the animation shows) to help deal with Blind or Aegis. Range increased to 220 and aftercast reduced. Such a slow and telegraphed skill should have higher range to compensate. The aftercast reduction increases PvE DPS, but isn't a big deal in PvP. \#3: Cast time reduced to 0.5 seconds. The main LF generation skill NEEDS to be reliable. \#4: This is actually just a solid skill. Not much to say here. \#5: This skill is, in theory, good. But in practice, it's very unreliable. Terrain needs to not eat it, it needs manual targetting, cast time reduced to 0.25 seconds, and a projectile speed increase. A lower cast time lets you use this on reaction and prevent foes from simply running away. Soul Eater: Health steal removed, replaced with some Immobilize application. Perhaps equal to 25% of Chill applied while wielding a Greatsword (so it doesn't work with most Fear, Shroud skills, Staff, etc). This will assist in locking down opponents and prevent them from landing hits. Only particularly problematic effect I can see is Executioner's Scythe (don't stay in the AoE) and ""Suffer!"" CTTB would be powerful, but it's already a long cast time so it's not so bad. This'll mainly be good for following up stuff like Grasping Darkness or Chilling Scythe with Gravedigger. Pulls function on Immobilized characters, so no contradictions there. The 0.5 second Chill I suggested on Fading Twilight won't last long enough to matter. This could also pair pretty well with Chilling Darkness, making Nightfall apply Immobilize, but that'd need an ICD reduction to really be effective, and even then not an especially long duration, just frequent. This might be overpowered in WvW though. Unholy Fervor: Make the damage increase affect all skills. Enough said. Wells need some PvE and PvP specific buffs. No changes in WvW. Well of Suffering: Increase Vulnerability duration to 10 seconds, reduce cooldown to 25 seconds, and overall damage coefficient increased 7.5. I like the idea of it being an area denial skill, as it lasts for a full 6 seconds, but it has too little up time to really be effective. The damage increase might seem overkill in PvP, but it is easy to avoid, so it forces enemies out of the way. Well of Corruption: Cooldown decreased to 30 seconds and overall damage coefficient increased to 1.25. Same problem as Well of Suffering, just not quite to the same extent. These changes to Wells make power a much stronger option. This combined with the Immobilize additions, also means Necros can combine the Immobilize and wells to spike down opponents. However, this is still counterable with Shadowsteps and, for the slower skills such as Dark Pact, Blind. Beyond this however, there still need to be some more changes to make Power Necro viable. I want to see the melee playstyle be viable. Axe: Yes I realize I just mentioned melee, shut up. #2 should take 1.5 seconds long and only give 8% Life Force. To make up for the LF decrease, #3 will give 2% LF per foe hit, is now a blast finisher, and damage coefficient increased to 1. This is simultaneously a buff to axe and a buff to Spiteful Spirit. Axe has been getting a fair bit of buffs for some time now, so it actually doesn't need a huge amount to really work. Focus: #4 projectile needs to be faster, cast time reduced to 0.5 seconds, and projectile finisher added. #5 cast time reduced to 0.75 seconds. Focus has some pretty solid skills, it just happens to be too unreliable compared to, say, Warhorn. Dagger: #2 channel time decreased to 2 seconds. I think Dagger mainhand is actually pretty solid, the main problem is that Necro can't really survive in melee range. The healing being faster will help with that. There also need to be buffs to Necros durability for melee to work. The life steal traits need much higher healing coefficients, say around 0.02. This would make Last Rites more useful (it gives Healing Power) and would make healing power stats work. This alone would increase the durability of Necro and make Blood Magic more useful. Transfusion should heal the user. Decrease the base healing to 240 and healing coefficient to 0.2, cause this trait actually heals a lot. Soul Comprehension in Death Magic is fucking awful. Seriously, there is no situation where this is useful. Merge it with Gluttony in Soul Reaping and replace it with something else. How about ""Reinforcing Decadence""; each unique boon or condition removed, transferred, converted, or corrupted by you grants 50 toughness, up to 5 times. Each stack lasts 6 seconds. More toughness is nice. Beyond the Veil should apply to nearby allies. Unholy Sanctuary and Unholy Martyr should swap places, healing fits Blood Magic better and synergizes with traits better. The condition removal and synergy with Necromantic Corruption in Death Magic also makes sense for Unholy Martyr. While we're at it, Unholy Sanctuary needs a base healing of 200. The coefficient is good, the base amount is not. For Unholy Martyr, make it draw 1 condition from up to 2 targets at 900 radius. Furthermore, make it decrease condition damage for how much Toughness we have, say 1% for each 100 points of Toughness. The main weakness of Death Magics toughness increase is that it doesn't cover conditions, and this would help. Assuming you have that ""Reinforcing Decadence"" trait at its maximum stacks, have toughness amulet, and are in Shroud for Armored Shroud, you're at 2630 Toughness, which is around 26% condition damage reduction. This seems high, but keep in mind you're not always gonna be maxing that out. Also keep in mind that Corrupter's Fervor already gives up to 20% condi damage reduction, and gives more toughness. Also, the increase in conditions drawn means it gives more Life Force and is better at upkeeping Reinforcing Decadence at its own, and it works better for support. Shrouded Removal can effectively half the conditions drawn, so you're getting 3 stacks of Reinforcing Decadence every 3 seconds. The base LF degeneration rate should be 3% and decrease the Vital Persistence LF degeneration decrease to 33%. With Vital Persistence it's the same, but without it your sustain just got that much better. Makes Soul Reaping less mandatory by extension. I don't think this would really push Power Necro into the meta, but it would be some much needed help. EDIT: Since some people don't seem to realize this, these are also PvP suggestions."
267,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[CONCEPT] Ranger's new specialisation: the (Accursed) Archer!,0,4rkdt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4rkdt4/concept_rangers_new_specialisation_the_accursed/,2016-07-07 05:48:30,"Hello everyone, I was bored, so I decided to think about a new specialisation for the Ranger. Don't mind too much % and damage, as there are many tweaks to apply to this specialisation, but feel free to let me know what you think about it. P.S. Pets are DISABLED when using this specialisation. Traits: - Ethereal Archer: attack speed increased by 10% (?) while wielding a longbow/crossbow/harpoon gun. Longbow will deal max damage, no matter the distance. New set of skills unlocked when entering Ethereal Archer form. (major trait) - Blessed by the Spirits: break stuns, get 3s invulnerability, stability and quickness, remove 3 conditions when entering Ethereal Archer form. - Riftwalk: converts dodge skill into a flash, which will still count as an evade for 0.5s (?); gain superspeed and quickness for 2s after cast and cleanse 2 conditions. - Wisdom of the Ancients: Longbow/crossbow/EA skills now deal 40% (?) additional damage, out of their total damage, as random condition damage (e.g.: if the autoattack deals 1k dmg, with this trait, it will actually deal 1k damage as physical damage + 400 damage as a random condition among burning, poison, bleeding and torment. This bonus applies on every skill of both crossbow and longbow). - Smite from afar: longbow/crossbow/harpoon gun/EA skills recharge 10% (?) faster. Conditions applied by those weapons last 20% longer. (major trait) -  Whispers from the Void: spectral skills recharge 10% faster and grant swiftness, ferocity and 5 stacks of might when used. - Doomed Faith: spectral skills can be cast twice to the cost of 25% current hp. Second cast is unblockable. - Bond of the Spirits: ignis fatuus recharge time is halved. Ignis fatuus is activated when dropping below 30% HP and grants quickness and superspeed for 3s. - Blood Brothers: tether yourself with a chosen partner. Heals and boons applied on you, will be applied on him as well and vice versa. Both will gain 10% damage reduction. Conditions applied on one will be applied on his partner too. Damage dealt on one of the two will be shared between both partners (e.g.: X and Y are bonded. Z deals 2k damage to X, but this will be split in 1k to X and 1k to Y. This trait is actually a toggle ability on F1 with 5mins CD and 3s cast time. External sources healing one of the partners wont heal both of them. When toggled off both partners will get 5 (?) stacks of vulnerability). (major trait) - Blood Pact: Blood Brothers cooldown is halved. Both partners health will be restored to 100% when toggling BB on. - Gift of the Specters: next attack after weapon swap will deal 25% extra damage and fear the target for 1s. - Triple Alliance: 20% of power is converted into vitality. 20% of vitality is converted into condition damage. Crossbow skills: 1) (?): deals 1.2k damage 2) (?): wields crossbow in 1 hand and delivers a powerful shot, dealing 1k damage and crippling the enemy hit for 1.5s. 1s cast time. 6s CD. 3) (?): fires a lethal dart, dealing 800 damage and blinding foe for 2s. 9s CD. 4) (?): evades backwards, firing a shot that deals 900 damage and dazes enemy for 1.5s. 12s CD. 5) (?): focus for 1.5s and fires a deadly shot to deal 1.5k damage and immobilizing foes for 2s. 18s CD. Ethereal Archer Form skills: 1) fires a shot to deal 1k damage and applying a mark. After 3 marks are applied, the next attack/skill will pop those to deal 2k damage. 2) fires a series of 8 shots dealing a total of 2k damage. The first and the last one will leave a mark on the target. (empowered version of Rapid Fire) 5s CD. 3) fires a shot to deal 1k damage and blinding foe for 3s. (empowered version of crossbow skill 3) 9s CD. 4) evades backwards, firing a shot that deals 1k damage and dazes enemy for 2s. (empowered version of crossbow skill 4) 12s CD. 5) cast a powerful AoE to deal damage 4 times (1k damage each impact). Each impact will apply a mark and the 4th one will pop those. 25s CD. (empowered version of Barrage Shot) Ethereal Archer Form conjures a spectral longbow on his hands while performing an ability/autoattack. EA form lasts for 15s. Recharge bar works like CA for Druid. The cooldown on abilities you read until now doesnt take count of Smite from afar trait. Same goes for cast times. Both crossbow and EA form skills have 1600 range. All the skills listed down below will be part of the spectral category. Heal: - Will of the Undead: heals for 4k HP. For the next 5s, youll heal for 2% (?) of direct damage dealt to enemies. 20s CD. 0.5s cast time. Utility: - Ignis Fatuus: invokes the power of the spirits to clear 5 conditions on you and your allies (max number of targets: 5). In addition youll gain invulnerability for 5s and 10 stacks of stability for 5s. 60s CD (?). 0s cast time. - Cursed by the Deads: open a portal to the Afterlife to a target location, immobilizing every foe on it for 3s and dealing 1.5k damage for the duration. 30s CD. 1s cast time. - Virulent Plague: infect the terrain around you (800 range) to grant you quickness until you stand on it and to cripple foes until they stand on it, making their heals 20% less effective and applying weakness on them. 5s duration. 50s CD. 1s cast time. Elite: - Impale: calls down a spear from the Afterlife to stun enemies on impact for 2s and slowing everyone around the target for 5s. Deals 1k damage + 1k damage as random condition."

It just felt .. weak. I now have another character slot so I rolled a new one because I do find the profession very intriguing but again it is seemingly weak - I recently got a warrior, thief and revenant through to the mid-twenties (Why yes, I *am* an alt-o-holic, why do you ask?) and they all just blasted their way through the content. My latest is about level 8 and I came away from a Level 6 veteran with ~10% health and depleted Death Shroud. Using Dagger / Focus at present as that is all that has dropped for me so far, will buy better Dagger/Warhorn and swap with staff when available. I'm finding the cooldowns on weapon skills too long so I seem to spend most time just hacking 1. Also 3 (and Focus 5) seem pointless except to stop runners. 4 is nice (12 stacks of vulnerability yeah!) 2 looks cool but doesn't do give a whole lot of health or do much damage. Pointers on how to maximise use of Death Shroud would also be much appreciated. So what could I do that will maximise the fun in teleporting to a mob as a dark blob and sucking out it's vital essence? What point did you say to yourself, ""Oh yes this profession rocks!""? Aside: I have read various guides and done some research into this but could not find anything yet that would help me really ""get"" the class. This one particularly: URL has lots of words but I was no wiser after reading it than before; less, even."
269,vulnerability,Guildwars2,An idea to balance out condi meta,0,4lwf2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4lwf2y/an_idea_to_balance_out_condi_meta/,2016-06-01 03:32:58,"Firstly, English is not my mother language so pardon me if the way I write is eyes-bleeding. So currently what I have seen from my various gameplay is that condi cleansing would remove a &lt;number&gt; of random condition on player, the random aspect destroys the balance element, leaving player no control over what they play. ***For example :*** I get hit with the following condi : [15 Bleed], [6 Burn], [Cripple], [2 Vulnerability] [Weakness] So if I use Revenant Staff 4 which remove 2 conditions, but the cleanse mechanic would priotirize cleansing Cripples and Vulnerability instead, leaving Bleed and Burn melting me down while Weakness imparing my damage. And since I have a very limited amount of condi cleanse, I get destroyed by that random aspect. My idea is letting the player to prioritize which condition they can cleanse for example. In the 'cleanse menu' I prioritize these conditions for cleansing. 1. Confusion 2. Weakness 3. Burn 5. Bleed ... In Scenario 1: A Mesmer hit me for [10 Confusion] [10 Vulnerabilty] [1 Burn] [9 Bleed] [Blind] And I use use cleanses 2 condis. As I prioritized Confusion the be top priority on my cleanse, one of the most threatening condi is away, but I also cleanse only 1 burn, leaving the other condis behind. What's great about this is that it let they player control on their gameplay while not severly hammer the condi gameplay, because that prioritization can also be a double edged knife, for example if I only get hit for *[1 Confusion] and [1 Burn]* while having [10 Poison] as the main threat, I still get punished for that. Tl;dr : Allow player to prioritize which condi they want to cleanse. Please let me know what you think about the little idea I made up . "
270,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Guardian Rework Suggestions,98,4nh6w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4nh6w9/guardian_rework_suggestions/,2016-06-11 02:43:30,"#Who am I? I've been playing Guard as my main basically non-stop since BWE1. I play every game mode but I have played WvW less than the other two. Guard is my main in PvE and in PvP (even in this meta). I have tried to consider all game modes while working on the below suggested adjustments to guard but I am by no means perfect. The whole reason for this section is just to show that I didn't just start the game yesterday and I understand the Guardian. #State of the Guardian The Guardian has been welcome in almost any party since launch but over the years and the release of HoT the Guardian is no longer up to snuff when compared to the other classes. Guardian used to be the go to bunker in sPvP, the preferred frontliner in WvW, the party savior in PvE dungeons. Now they are at the bottom rung in sPvP and see much less use in PvE (raids) as well. They may still have a place in WvW at the moment but if the tides continue as they are, even that may change. Guardian needs some love and it needs it quick. Why have things gone this far? Inattention. The Guardian was always overlooked because they ""are in a good spot"". While the other classes got skill fixes and functionality adjustments, we were mostly given tooltip updates and some minor QoL adjustments. We have bugs that have been around for years and questionable functionality for weapons. We also have tons of useless traits and skills which were never looked at because we have a few options that worked well. Why does anyone need a Guardian nowadays? Each class should have something that it is the best at while being able to do most other things at least decently well and maybe having a weakness or two. What is the guard best at? Healing? Nope. Damage? Nope. Group Support? Nope. Utility? Nope. We used to be at or near the top for Group support and Utility but not since HoT came. What happened? Mainly power creep and a lack of identity due to HoT. Many other classes got something that raised their potential in one area or another. Guard got a playstyle change with Dragonhunter. Ranged damage with traps. Most people rejoiced when we got longbow as we needed a reliable ranged option. However, the dragonhunter elite spec does not have any synergy with our other traits and severely limits our defensive capability. This was fine to a degree as basically we were giving up defense for more offense. However, damage nerfs to traps and longbow further displayed the flaws of dragonhunter and guard. Wasn't dragonhunter supposed to be our ranged damage option? If you take that away without sufficient defensive compensation, the result is our current state. This brings me to my next point. Condition damage mitigation. When I am trying to devise a build for sPvP, the first thing I try to compensate for is condition damage. With Guard's low hp, condition damage mitigation needs to be swift and plentiful. This basically means I need to go into Virtues for Absolute Resolution and Probably Valor for meditations. This means that the last line is Dragonhunter due to power creep. Yay, build diversity. I've always thought that the condition removal on Absolute Resolution should be baseline. I mean really... is our small heal and regen really worth it anymore? If they just did this one thing, I think it could open up some different builds. With our base HP so low, is it really that bad to have one built in condition removal? You know what else is bad for professions with low base HP? Stuns. I really love going into a group fight at mid and being focused. The pattern is almost always the same. Stun, stun, stun, stun, stun... dead. Stabilty doesn't last long these days. Get where I am going here? We need more stabilty or stun breaks. Another major problem is our base specializations. Most of our base specializations are formed around being able to use 3 base specialization lines for trait synergy. With the elite spec, you cannot really do that as you can only get two. You want increased symbol functinality? Go into Zeal and Honor. We have a lot of useless skills. Spirit weapons? The shield sees some minor use in PvE the others are horrible. Signets? These mostly see use for the extra stats on the passives and have horrible actives. Consecrations? Half of them need some love (Sanctuary and Hallowed Ground). Shouts? They used to be good but they needs some minor love now. So what should happen to correct this? Ideally, nerfing all Elite specs down to base specialization levels would be the ideal first step but this won't happen for two reasons. One, all classes except for guard had a place in the most recent PvP meta. Two, raid balance is based around the powercreep. So it seems likely that we will simply get a buff during the next balance patch. Unfortunately due to years of neglect, the best way to fix the Guard is also the hardest way. The best way being to redesign the Guardian's base specializations and the Guard in general. I almost guarantee that they won't want to do this and instead will try to come up with a rigged solution to a few skills in the dragonhunter line that we already use to compensate. But ANet if you are reading this, you shouldn't do this. Why not? Well when the next specialization comes out, you are more than likely going to see similar issues with that specialization. You would be better off future proofing the Guard than making a quickfix. #The issues and potential fixes ##Aegis +Aegis gets removed also when a block skill is used. Example: using Mace 3 while having Aegis up. Skill spam is up and aegis gets removed with a love tap. Either aegis from justice needs to come up every certain number of hits the guardian takes or it needs to be able to absorb a set amount of damage before going away. Another option is to make it stackable like stability. ##Retaliation is weak +The only time relatiation is a threat is when using aoe on multiple enemies with retal or when fighting a PvE boss that has it. I think this should completely change as it is a cornerstone of the guardian and it is beyond lackluster. Instead of it just doing retaliation damage everytime a hit lands on you, it should also mitigate that portion of the damage on the person being hit. This should activate on condition damage too but only once per tick no matter how many conditions are on you. Numbers might need to be adjusted for this. ##Condition related issues +Our low healthpool requires us to trait heavily for condi removal. This generally requires at least virtues or valor (usually both) to achieve the level required to sustain for a bit. I suggest Absolute Resolution be made baseline. This and the retaliation change should help. ##Problems with Weapons +Projectile relfects are rampant now. First impression might be ""Well don't shoot projectiles"" but this is much harder than it may seem. Sword auto 3 is a projectile. Sword 3 launches a set of 3 projectiles. Greatsword 2 has several projectiles included in the spin. Greatsword 5 shoots projectiles. Mace is actually the only mainhand weapon that doesn't have a projectile on it and the auto's 3rd attack doesn't cleave. Remove the projectiles on GS 2 and up the damage a bit. Remove the projectile on the auto for the 1H sword and make it melee and easier to land. As its hard to hit anything moving with the 1H sword, add chill to sword 2. Make sword 3 a symbol (preferably a fire field). Make Mace hit at least 3 targets on all attacks. The cast time on hammer 5 should should allow you to move... same with true shot on LB. It is hard to land attacks on moving targets with most melee weapons because of the lack of soft cc. Another thing... why can't the staff do more damage on the auto attack if it is only hitting one target? Also reduce the amount of might given on Staff 4 and just make it last longer. Shield 4 should also have a short knockback or stun. Torch 5 should be changed completely to be a small burn, a stunbreak and transfer 2 conditions from you to an enemy. ##Our new specialization is supposed to be all about damage +I understand the nerf to trueshot (longbow 2) as it could be used in a pretty nasty spike combo but the dispersal of the damage to the other skills on longbow was not thought out. They added damage to longbow 3 the skill that you can't target with and it shoots in a line. They added damage to longbow 4 which is a SMALL symbol that people just walk out of if it hits at all. And they added damage to skill 5 which is on a really long cool down and is best saved for CC. I would have preferred it to have just had the auto damage adjusted. ##Traps aren't defensive at all +I get that they are supposed to be offensive but the core of the guardian is active defense. When you sacrifice a utility, heal, or elite spot for pure damage you severely cripple your ability to survive. Maybe adding a self heal on laying a trap or add some condi removal to one of the less used traps could help. ##Spirit Weapons +These should be changed completely. I think these should become our healing/support option. Remove all damage from them and make them invulnerable. Make the weapons come up by default if they are equipped. Make them cast ground targeted AoE with different boons per weapon when using the skill and also have an AoE heal when traited. Give sword offensive boons like Might/Fury/quickness. Give Hammer protection and retaliation or maybe stability. Keep shield as projectile destruction or reflection, make the bow remove conditions and grant resistance. ##Signets +Change the passive for each to a Guard specific boon and have it apply to everyone in the party. Bane gives a damage boost to the party, judgement reduces damage to the party and so on. Make the active selfish and for the guardian only. Like quickness for Bane, condi removal or resistance for the condi one, Judgement a stunbreak and several stacks of stability. The heal removes 1 condition per 10 seconds on passive for the whole party and has the same large heal for the guard on active. The elite already sort of works this way although the activation time should be reduced a bit. ##Consecrations +For Sanctuary and hallowed ground. Severely reduce the cooldown and the lenth of the effect. I would rather have a low cooldown and not last as long. Make hallowed ground also add retal and a taunt to those in range. Make sanctuary large and just be an aoe targeted knock back. ##Shouts +Shouts need a little love but not a lot. Adding resistance to Save Yourselves makes sense. Adding a short invuln (like 2 seconds) to Stand Your Ground for the Guard only could work also. Adding Fury to Hold the Line might be interesting. Retreat should also remove any soft CC or immobilize to your party. The elite is fine. The heal needs a reduced cooldown and turned into AoE heal for the party instead of the cone. ##Base specializations +Put all related skills in the same line. Burning and symbols are the main offenders. If there is a skill that is an inherent ""I take this line for this and the other options are horrible"", turn it into a minor and open up the choices (like Fiery Wrath in Zeal). Move all symbols to Zeal. Move burning related skills to radiance. Move signet related skills to virtues. Move spirit weapon traits to Honor. Below are my suggestions for the Base specializations. ##Zeal Minor Adept|Fiery Wrath|Increases damage against burning foes.| Major Adept|Glacial Heart|Critical hits with hammers chill enemies. Hammer recharge is reduced.| Major Adept|Protector's Impact/Zealot's Speed|Create a Symbol of Protection when you take falling damage. You take less damage when falling.

Sword skills recharge faster.| Removals are denoted by strikethrough. Additions are noted by bold letters. If 2 traits were merged, there is a slash between the name of it. #What my proposed changes should do for the Guard Build variety is the main thing. This should give a better opportunity for several decent builds to arise. This allows for the use of both AH and Meditations which could potentially bring back the bunker builds for Guard. This also merges most of the burning related traits into Radiance which allows you to take that and go for an offensive condi build or even a condi bunker. If the redo to the spirit weapons goes well, that could lead to a healing role as well. The redo to signets might make us more of a staple in raids as well. As you may have noticed, I didn't do much to improve the soft cc issue of guard as I think that moving symbols in Zeal will help a lot with this. #Caveats Now I'm not one of those people that wants my main class to be OP (You don't believe me... I know) and some of these changes could do that. I could see some major tuning needed for Retaliation. I could see a Zeal, Valor, Honor Guard having really good dps and sustain and that might need to be adjusted. However, if the parts that are OP are adjusted and things are tuned properly I could see this working for us well. Remember over 95% of the traits that I moved are already there somewhere. #In Conclusion Whether or not you agree with my suggestions, most reasonable people can see that the Guard needs some attention and I think this merits some discussion. Do I expect anything major to happen to Guard as a result of me posting this? Nope. I've seen good suggestions posted on the Guard forums for a long time and nothing has ever come of them. Some of which may be included in here. ANet seems to have their own vision for the Guardian but a defensive themed class in an offense driven game is counter-intuitive to the rest of the game so I think they need to budge a little on their ideals of what the Guardian should become. I also know that some people might think that I have gone completely overboard with all the suggestions. And my reasoning for that is... I don't think ANet will use most of them. I think the trait movement would be for the best but I think making Absolute Resolution default alone might open things up more. I am fairly certain that Guard will see a buff during the next balance patch and I am really just hoping that ANet knows what needs to be addressed. tldr: Guard suggestions and stuff."

The skill used to be Shoot and Apply 8 stacks of vulnerability. Now it's Shoot your foe, then evade backward. This give the player an uncontrolled leap backwards. There have been numerous times in PvE where I have to avoid this skills particularly cuz of the evade backwards. Situations in Thaumanova Reactor Fractal's final boss, Uncategorized Fractal and in particular in pve where I just want to range the foe not jump way back only to run forward cuz I went out of range Furthermore the rifle is doesn't work in PvP. The builds don't require rifle in the meta and also the uncontrollable aspects of it makes it worse to make proper play. Couldnt we just get the rifle to provide immobilize and vulnerability on it?"
272,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"Malyck's Tree's ""Vulnerability""",29,4ija9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4ija9r/malycks_trees_vulnerability/,2016-05-09 22:16:35,"*Disclaimer!! Sorry if this theory has been posted before!* *Taken from Malyck's page off the GW2 Wiki:* ""Caithe believes that Malyck's value to the Nightmare Court was that, should he be discovered, they would decide that **Malyck's Tree would turn more easily to nightmare than the Pale Tree, lacking the protection of Ventari's Tablet** and being therefore closer to the ""true"" nature of the sylvari. In turn, it is feared that the Nightmare Court would then seek to destroy the Pale Tree rather than convert it."" If what Caithe is saying is in fact true, that Malyck's tree would be more susceptible to the Nightmare Court's influence, wouldn't it also be to Mordremoth's? And if that's true, Malyck's Tree would've lost many more Sylvari to the dragon than ours did. Mordremoth potentially has almost an entire civilisations worth of an army, *somewhere*. Zhaitan's minions didn't die after he did, so I assume Mordremoth is the same. Sort of a White Walker threat from Game of Thrones scenario. We don't know how far, or how *close* this hypothetical army is. Also, why stop at two Sylvari trees? Ventari's tablet being unique to our tree, any other trees have a chance to also be vulnerable to Mordremoth. (And the Nightmare Court too, but their reach isn't as far or as strong as Mordremoth, right?) The last we hear of Malyck is him heading home, to his tree. Either he comes back with help for the rest of the dragons, or he comes home to a nasty surprise and *leads a supposedly buried threat, right to us.* "
273,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Guardian trait line overhaul,0,4ixqqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4ixqqm/guardian_trait_line_overhaul/,2016-05-12 09:14:25,"This is my stab at a Guardian skill tree rework. Guardian skill trees suck. Always have, back to when you got stats out of them. (Do I want a bunch of weird condition-oriented stuff on top of a pile of power? Do I want a bunch of healing power to unlock AH?) Even without that insult on top of injury, though, the trees are just a hot mess. There's no cohesion in any of them either in terms of mechanics or theme, and frankly it is just incredibly unsatisfying to trait a guard. Your skill trees really just come down to ""what GM trait do I want to build around and what are the least bad options to get there?"" And on the flip-side there's no real core to what those trees *do* for you. Do points in Zeal make you more of a damage dealer? Well, sorta, I guess, maybe. Do points in valor make you more of a tank? Again, it's squishy. And how do any of these lines correspond with any of the class mechanics or abilities? Even the Virtue line has precious little to do with Virtues, and everything else really feels like a tacked-on afterthought. So, with that said, here's my attempt to fix that- to give each of the lines both mechanical and thematic cohesion and some actual synergy, to make it feel like a clear and rewarding choice between the trees. Thoughts? (h/t to /u/OdiIon616 for the post that got me thinking about this to begin with.) **Zeal** Line notes: This take on the Zeal tree is intended to focus it on offensive melee. Secondary focus is on *symbols*, trying to make these things that weapons sort of poop out by default actually meaningful and a consideration in combat for both the guardian and their opponents. Two mechanics tweaks also apply here: First, the active effects of Consecrations become symbols- functionally and thematically theyre the same thing (creating a specific effect in a specifit area) and that would improve synergy substantially. Second, Symbol of Wrath changed from allied retaliation (mechanically problematic in PvE and a thematic miss on an offensive weapon) to allied Fury. Rank | Name | Description ---|---|--- Minor Adept: | Zealots Speed | Create a Symbol of *Swiftness* when you are struck while below the health threshold. Major Adept: | Right Hand Strength | Critical hit chance with one-handed weapons is increased. Sword skills recharge faster. | Binding Jeopardy | Immobilizing or blinding a foe also applies vulnerability to them. | Unscathed Contender | Deal more damage while under the effects of aegis. Minor Master: | Symbolic Exposure | Symbols apply vulnerability to foes. Major Master: | Zealous Heart | Attacks with your two handed melee weapons deal extra damage and heal you. Two handed melee weapon abilities have reduced recharge. | Strength of the Fallen | Lose conditions at a set time interval. Health degenerates more slowly while downed. | Wrath of Justice | Striking an enemy with justice's active effect triggers signet of wrath. Minor Grandmaster: | Symbolic Power | Symbols have increased damage and a chance to burn enemies. Major Grandmaster: | Symbolic Avenger | You deal more damage to enemies standing in your symbols. | Empowering Might | You and nearby allies gain might when you land a critical hit. | Master of Consecrations | Consecrations last longer and have reduced recharge. **Radiance** Line notes: Radiance here is the burning tree, the go-to place for condition damage. This one required quite a bit of tweaking- on live the burning is frequently tied to fury or crit chance, which doesnt make a whole lot of sense for a condi based setup. I also tried to accommodate the problem of burning-immune mobs here- this would not apply to immune-to-everything scenarios in PvP, to be clear. Finally, I tried to shore up one of the major weaknesses of DoT-based builds- AoE. Zealots Flame does a decent job for PBAoE, but I wanted something more fun- like, say, fiery explosions. Finally, I also put the spirit weapons here- they very much fit the damage-over-time aspect, and the trait even as it is on live has them apply burning. Rank | Name | Description ---|---|--- Minor Adept: | Justice is Blind | When activating Virtue of Justice, nearby foes are blinded. Major Adept: | Fiery Wrath | Increases damage against burning foes. | Inner Fire | | Gain might when you strike a foe that has burning stacks over threshold. | Zealous Scepter | While wielding a scepter, gain might when your justice passive effect triggers. Minor Master: | Holy Fire | | Your burns can be applied to burn-immune enemies. If a target dies with your burn stacks on it, gain a portion of those as Might. Major Master: | Kindled Zeal | Gain condition damage based on your power. | Radiant Fire | Gain zealot's flame when you critically hit an enemy. Burning duration is increased. Torch abilities recharge faster. | Expeditious Spirit | Spirit weapons burn foes they strike. Spirit weapon summon and command skills have reduced recharge. Minor Grandmaster: | Radiant Power | When you apply Burning to a target that already has that condition, you have a chance to cause damage and apply burning to all foes in an area around the target. Major Grandmaster: | Amplified Wrath | Burning damage is increased. Burn enemies whose attacks you successfully block. | Radiant Retaliation | Retaliation damage scales from condition damage instead of power. | Permeating Wrath | Virtue of Justices passive effect no longer only burns your target, but also burns the area around your target each time it activates. **Valor** Valor, as Ive laid it out here, is kind of the brawler gimme yer worst! tree, or as it lives in my head, active offensive tanking. Youre in the thick of it basically daring people to hit you, so Aegis and retaliation are very much the name of the game here. I think Pure of Voice fits here very well also, both thematically (shouting fits this role), and mechanically (conversion is fantastic when youre up front setting yourself up to get targeted). Finally, the Taunt mechanic was added in HoT for Revenants, but it fits too well here to overlook. I even like Focus Mastery here as Shield of Wrath basically screams hit me or else! Rank | Name | Description ---|---|--- Minor Adept: | Valorous Defense | Gain aegis when you are struck while below the health threshold. Major Adept: | Wrathful Spirit | Aegis gives retaliation when it ends. | Retaliatory Subconscious | Gain retaliation and aegis when stunned, dazed, knocked back, pulled, knocked down, sunk, floated,launched, taunted or inflicted with fear. | Healers Retribution | Gain retaliation when using a heal skill. Minor Master: | Virtue of Retribution | Gain retaliation when you activate a virtue. Retaliation you apply lasts longer. Major Master: | Shattered Aegis | When an aegis you applied blocks an attack, it damages nearby foes. | Retribution | Gain increased damage while under the effects of retaliation. | Focus Mastery | Gain protection when using a focus ability. Focus abilities have reduced recharge. Minor Grandmaster: | Might of the Protector | Gain might when you block attacks. Major Grandmaster: | Retributive Armor | Gain toughness for a period of time when blocking an attack. Gain ferocity based on your toughness. | Pure of Voice | Allies affected by shouts have conditions converted into boons. Shout abilities have their recharge reduced. | Lights Champion | When an aegis you applied blocks an attack, the attacker is taunted. **Honor** Line notes: If youre the sort that always lamented the lack of a dedicated support tree a la Druid for Guardians, this is your tree. This is all about boons and healing. However, I didnt want it to be a passive healbot, so the changes and emphasis here is on doing things- attacking, dodging, applying boons, etc- to give support. The changes to Altruistic Healing and Monks Focus here are intended to make both a little less selfish- it also gives a solid choice between shouts as a big source of burst healing (from all the boons at once) or meditations for more of a sustained healing (lower CDs overall and regen over spot heals). Rank | Name | Description ---|---|--- Minor Adept: | Stalwart Defender | Heal allies around you for a small amount each time you attack. Major Adept: | Smiters Boon | Smite conditions when you use a healing ability. | Protective Reviver | Activate a shield of absorption when you begin reviving an ally. Upon successful revival, you and ally each gain aegis, protection, and regeneration. | Vigorous Precision | Grant vigor to nearby allies when you deliver a critical hit. Minor Master: | Selfless Daring | The end of your dodge roll heals nearby allies. Major Master: | Communal Defenses | Grant aegis to allies when you block an attack. | Strength in Numbers | Nearby allies gain toughness based on your effective level. | Honorable Staff | Boon duration is increased while wielding a staff. Staff recharges are reduced. Minor Grandmaster: | Altruistic Healing | When you apply boons, the target is also healed for a small amount. Major Grandmaster: | Pure of Heart | Aegis heals when it blocks an attack. | Force of Will | You have increased vitality. Healing effectiveness to other allies is increased based on a percentage of your vitality. | Monks Focus | Using a Meditation skill grants regeneration to allies in a radius. Meditation skills have reduced recharge. **Virtues** Line notes: Ok. Lets be real. Virtues are really just another set of signets, and they really arent that interesting. Compared to things like attunements and toolbelts or kits or even pets, theyre pretty thin. So this is the most modified of the trait lines here- if youre dedicating an entire trait line to them, they should be a much more dynamic, interactive mechanic than they are by default. Make them available more often, make their effects more interesting, etc. Signets actually make for a fun synergy here as well. Rank | Name | Description ---|---|--- Minor Adept: | Inspired Virtue | Virtues now also apply the following boons to allies when activated: Justice: Might Resolve: Regeneration Courage: Protection Major Adept: | Protectors Impact | Create a Symbol of Protection when you take falling damage. You take less damage when falling. | Courageous Return | Virtue of Courage is recharged when you revive an ally or when you rally. | Perfect Inscriptions | Signets have improved passive effects. When you activate a virtue, reduce the cooldown of signets. When you activate a signet, reduce the cooldown of virtues. Minor Master: | Lingering Virtue | When virtues are on cooldown you gain stat bonuses. Justice: Power &amp; Condition Damage. Resolve: Toughness Courage: Vitality &amp; Healing Power Major Master: | Battle Presence | Nearby allies gain Virtue of Resolve's passive effect. | Supreme Virtue | Virtue passive effects trigger more frequently. Virtue active effects are improved. Justice: Longer duration Resolve: Larger heal Courage: PBAoE blind | Shield of Virtue | Reduce the remaining cooldowns of all virtues by 1s when you attack while wearing a shield. Shield abilities have reduced recharge. Minor Grandmaster: | Eternal Virtue | Reduce remaining cooldowns of all virtues by 5 seconds when you kill a foe. Major Grandmaster: | Unshakable Resolve | Create a water field when you activate Virtue of Resolve. Virtue of Resolve's passive effect is stronger. | Indomitable Courage | Create a light field and grant stability to nearby allies when you activate Virtue of Courage. Virtue of courage's passive effect triggers more frequently. | Power of the Virtuous | Create a fire field when you activate Virtue of Justice. Virtue of Justice recharges faster. "
274,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Druid Theorycrafting: Sun Spirit vs. Glyph of Alignment,20,4j7b75,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4j7b75/druid_theorycrafting_sun_spirit_vs_glyph_of/,2016-05-14 03:07:46,"I often see the recommendation of Glyph of Alignment over Sun Spirit in Zerker Druid guides. But is it really better? Below I'm gonna make a mathematical DPS comparison between these two utility skills in a raid scenario. First let's look at the DPS buffs these skills provide: the spirit gives your party a buff that triggers burning on hit. The resulting DPS increase is very consistent because you only have to hit the boss with a 8 sec cooldown. Whereas the glyph gives your party a Grace of the Land (GotL) stack which is a 3% damage modifier. The resulting absolute DPS increase directly depends on your DPS you are doing without this buff. Our goal is to compare these DPSs: DPS_s = DPS_g DPS_s ... total DPS with Sun Spirit DPS_g ... total DPS with Glyph of Alignment Now we elaborate this equation to get parameters we know: DPS_b * 1.03^GotL_s + DPS_so = DPS_b * 1.03^GotL_g DPS_b ... base DPS without GotL and Sun Spirit DPS_so ... DPS provided only through Sun Spirit GotL_s ... average GotL-stacks at rotation with spirit GotL_g ... average GotL-stacks at rotation with glyph When we convert this equation, we can calculate the base DPS (DPS_b) where both buffs provide the same DPS increase: DPS_so = DPS_b * 1.03^GotL_g - DPS_b * 1.03^GotL_s DPS_so = DPS_b * (1.03^GotL_g - 1.03^GotL_s) DPS_b = DPS_so / (1.03^GotL_g - 1.03^GotL_s) Before we can calculate the base DPS we have to find values for the given parameters. To get values for the average GotL-stacks I recorded two rotations at the new test area: one with Sun Spirit (URL and one with Glyph of Alignment (URL With this rotations I calculated the following average GotL-stacks: GotL_s = 2.26 GotL_g = 2.56 The DPS provided only by the Sun Spirit can be calculated as following: DPS_so = (D_b + C_b * CD) * 1.03^GotL_s * Vuln * St_b * Dur_b * U_s / I D_b ... base damage of burning C_b ... damage coefficient of burning CD ... condition damage Vuln ... damage modifier provided through vulnerability St_b ... stacks of burning per trigger Dur_b ... duration of burning per trigger U_s ... uptime of spirit buff I ... trigger interval We assume the following values for the listed parameters: D_b = 131.5 C_b = 0.155 CD = 750 (might) + 170 (Banner of Strength) = 920 Vuln = 1.25 (25 stacks of vulnerability) St_b = 2 Dur_b = 3 (0% condition duration) U_s = 0.9 I = 8.5 (effect recharge 8 sec; so just an approximation) When we fill the values in the equation we get: DPS_so = (131.5 + 0.155 * 920) * 1.03^2.26 * 1.25 * 2 * 3 * 0.9 / 8.5 DPS_so = 232.71 Now we can use these values to calculate the base DPS (DPS_b): DPS_b = 232.71 / (1.03^2.56 - 1.03^2.26) DPS_b = 24,437.61 This result means that you have to do ~24.4k base DPS (without GotL) to get the same DPS increase from Glyph of Alignment as from Sun Spirit. If your base DPS is lower the spirit provides a better DPS increase. If your base DPS is higher the glyph provides a better DPS increase. This number is calculated for builds that have neither condition damage nor condition duration. If you play a condition build this number is even higher. So for a real raid scenario I would always choose Sun Spirit over Glyph of Alignment unless you need the heal from the glyph. Even if your whole sub-group (including you) plays zerker builds the DPS increase from Sun Spirit is better in almost all cases. **tl;dr** Unless ever party member does over ~24.4k DPS (without GotL) with a zerker build, Sun Spirit provides better DPS than Glyph of Alignment for your squad. For condi builds this number is much higher. So if you don't need the heal from the glyph just use the spirit instead."
275,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Power Creep in Weapon Skills,102,4km0g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4km0g7/power_creep_in_weapon_skills/,2016-05-23 13:19:35,"Recently there was a post on the Guild Wars 2 subreddit complaining that the game wasnt fun despite balance being relatively good. I started typing out a reply, but it got long enough that I think it deserves its own post, since it also comes with a message/solution. It comes down to a specific kind of power creep with the new elite specializations. I think the main cause of it is the new weapon skills having too many effects. First, lets give a run-down on the main classes this affects or has affected. Starting with the Chronomancer we look at the shield. Echo of Memory and the following Deja-Vu both summon a Phantasm that grants Alacrity, applies Slow, and deals damage. Any other weapon set would have that as a skill on its own. Echo of Memory, however, takes it one step further and gives two blocks that players can use while moving. Next we look at Tides of Time, which damages, stuns twice, applies AoE Quickness, destroys projectiles, and is an Ethereal field. One thing Id like to direct specific attention at is the fact that it destroys projectiles, as it seems to be a go-to side effect of skills released with Heart of Thorns. Next, lets look at the Herald. The only weapons Ill be looking at are the ones being used right now in the meta, and none of them are even unique to Herald. However, the core Revenant was released with the elite specializations and runs into the same problems. Unrelenting Assault is a port, evade, high-damaging, might stacker. Warding Rift, on top of being a mobile block, sends out a blinding projectile that forces opponents to dodge the block if they want to continue damaging. Then we get to the biggest offender, Surge of the Mists. It is a mobile evade that deals high damage along with repeated crowd control. Now, the biggest offender, Scrapper. Scrappers can build squishy as hell and survive for extended periods of time because every skill on their bar doubles as a defensive skill while putting out lots of damage. Electro-whirl reflects projectiles along with dealing high damage. Rocket Charge leaps twice, evades, and deals lots of damage. Shock Shield deals massive damage and applies Vulnerability while also being a mobile block. Thunderclap stuns, applies Vulnerability, deals high damage, and acts as a Lightning field if you want to chain daze with Rocket Charge. Because every skill deals lots of damage while also being defensive, Scrappers are just hell to deal with. Druid is slightly different from the others. Staff is actually a relatively simple weapon. The only skill that does multiple things is Ancestral Grace, which is an evade, heal, and Blast finisher. However, its not over the top because the rest of the weapon is fine. Druid finds the same issues as the other classes, however, in Celestial Avatar. Seed of Life heals when it is used primarily as a condition cleanse, and then blinds opponents. Lunar Impact heals, dazes, and blasts in a massive radius on a short cooldown. Natural Convergence damages, cripples, slows, immobilizes, and grants Stability. It honestly wouldnt be bad if it made the Druid vulnerable during the long cast time, but too often thats not the case. The movement impairment makes it hard to reach the Druid to put out enough pressure to punish it, and the Stability makes it difficult to interrupt without coordinated effort. Tempest gets a special mention here. In PvP, people dont use the new weapon and the Overloads are honestly fine. However, the new utility skills have too much synergy with current and new traits. Each skill cleanses conditions, reduces incoming damage, applies Protection, applies Regeneration, applies Vigor, and heals. This can be balanced if the person using those skills is a viable target, but the Tempest is sustained just as much by its own skills. It needs to have to choose what it wants to be: a bunker or a support. This class alone slows down gameplay a ton with the passive sustain it brings. Now, at the start of the post I mentioned that I had a solution. However, its really not going to make people happy. When the developers created these new weapons, they designed them as being fun to play, and so people have grown accustomed to these new weapons. However, the only way to speed up gameplay and make the game fun again is to take away some of the bonus effects of these skills. People get upset when their class takes numerical nerfs, but Im sure theyll throw a fit if skills lose specific utility that they found enjoyable. However, I think its going to be a necessity if we want enjoyable gameplay again. I honestly dont see any other way, as the current class design leads to everybody running jack-of-all-trade builds instead of more specialized roles that allow you to punish people for their mistakes. TL;DR - Don't be too upset if your new toys lose some utility in the name of proper balance. -Olrun, NL Team Captain"
276,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Specializations (A few ideas - Wraith),7,4dpp3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4dpp3a/specializations_a_few_ideas_wraith/,2016-04-07 15:22:22,"**Wraith** **Necromancer Lore/brief description** With the way to Cantha accessible, new forms of magic have taken hold. The necromancers have taken to this by becoming wraiths, altering their forms to become a terrifying force from the mists. Taking torch in hand they call forth the vilest souls from the past to wreak havoc upon their opponents. **Class Mechanic** The Wraith shroud replaces the usual Death shroud, allowing access to a more mid ranged, condition based skill set. The wraith wields an axe and torch, with many burns, blinds and stealth. Most skills are fire fields or smoke fields. **Torch  Off-hand** **Skill 4  unholy Beacon** Raising their torch into the air, the wraith causes opponents to both be blinded and flee. This skill would apply a short duration fear and a mid-ranged blind. **Skill 5  Hell Fire** Encircling the area in dark flames, the wraith envelops their surroundings in hell fire. This skill would create a fire field that sacks both burns and torment. **Skills** **Healing Skill  Bind Gluttonous Soul** The wraith calls forth a gluttonous soul to be bound to a location; the soul gorges itself on nearby opponents health before bursting, transferring this health to the wraith. This skill would summon an immobile soul, which would attack nearby opponents and after a set duration, explode damaging opponents and healing the caster for amounts determined by the amount of attacks performed. If killed early or dispersed, simply does the same but at lesser amounts. **Utility Skills** **Skill 1  Bind Slothful Soul** The wraith calls forth a slothful soul to be bound to a location; the soul will project its slothfulness upon the wraiths opponents. This skill would summon an immobile soul, which would intermittently apply slow and cripple. This soul may be dispersed to apply immobilization in its area. **Skill 2  Bind Envious Soul** The wraith calls forth an envious soul to be bound to a location; the soul then rips boons from the wraiths opponents, causing excessive pain with each boon taken. This skill would summon an immobile soul, which would attack nearby opponents, if the opponent has a boon applied; the boon will be transferred to the wraith and extra damage dealt. This soul may be dispersed to remove all boons from opponents in its area. **Skill 3  Bind Wrathful Soul** The wraith calls forth a wrathful soul to be bound to a location; the soul will project its wrathfulness in a given area around itself, strengthening allies, whilst also attacking opponents. This skill would summon an immobile soul, which would attack nearby opponents. The soul would also apply might stacks to allies with each attack. This soul may be dispersed to apply fury in its area. **Skill 4  Bind Greedy Soul** The wraith calls forth a greedy soul to be bound to a location; the soul will project its greed in a given area around itself, causing allies to steal health for the wraith. This skill would summon an immobile soul, which would attack nearby opponents. The soul would also apply an effect to allies that causes attacks to steal health but transfer it to the wraith, not to the ally. This soul may be dispersed to damage opponents in its area. **Elite Skill  Bind Prideful Soul** The wraith calls forth a wrathful soul to be bound to a location; the soul will project its greed in a given area around itself, giving allies better control of their boons, whilst also attacking opponents, weakening moral. This skill would summon an immobile soul, which would attack nearby opponents applying weakness and vulnerability. The soul would also apply an effect to allies that increases boon duration. This soul may be dispersed to damage opponents in its area giving short boons of stability and retaliation to allies for each hit; stacks durations. **Traits** **Adept Traits** **Minor Trait  Shroud Caller** You can equip torches and use wraith bindings. Death shroud is replaced with wraith's shroud, which has more condition oriented skills. **Major Trait 1  Cold Flames** Reduce recharge of torch skills, torch skills now apply chill. **Major Trait 2  Leaping Flames** Burns you apply also apply to adjacent targets. **Major Trait 3  Joyful Pain** Conditions on you now give life-force on each tick. **Master Traits** **Minor Trait  World Unseen** You can no longer be blinded. **Major Trait 1  Insatiable Hunger** Life stolen is increased. **Major Trait 2  Purging Flames** Burning opponents have a chance to remove conditions from you on attack. **Major Trait 3  Hidden Dread** Stealth applied while in shroud lasts longer. **Grandmaster Traits** **Minor Trait  Armour Burn** Burns you apply also apply vulnerability. **Major Trait 1  Unbound** Souls are now unchained and can move. **Major Trait 2  Corrosive touch** Souls attacks apply poison. **Major Trait 3** Dispersing souls applies burns to opponents."

Thanks for your participation here.** ---- So with the new [DPS-Testing-Area](/r/Guildwars2/comments/4fif91/they_added_an_ultracustomizable_dps_testing_zone/) in the [raid lobby](URL (entered through the portal south of Fort Marriner) we can now actually compare the damage our meta-builds do. I am very interested in what a perfect rotation does to a golem, so everyone is invited to post your ~~setup (Armor/Weapons/Trinkets *(exotic or ascended?)*, Runes, Sigils, Traits and settings of the golem and you, like buffs, *etc.*)~~*build* and the DPS you achieve. Please mention a brief summary of how your skill-rotation works, too. I will try to summarize the data in a table in this post. Thanks in advance, I am really looking forward to it. I determine 'ideal' raid-settings like this: *Buff food and utility, 25 stacks of might, fury, vulnerability (on target), Banner of Strength, Banner of Discipline, Quickness, Alacrity, Empower Allies, Facet of Nature, Spotter, Assassin's Presence, Grace of the Land, Glyph of Empowerement, Frost Spirit and Sun Spirit.* * Keep in mind that the numbers listed below are not too realistic in a fight, you will never have a 100% uptime of all boons and bosses have a tendency to disturb your perfect rotation. * I removed the colons with gear-quality and used buffs since everyone is either using the same or not mentioning it. * Realized that no boons on the golem isn't the solution to compare the numbers. Your build does apply boons to yourself, so a better baseline is indeed the option ""all boons"" instead of none. Just go on posting numbers *and screw you, skeptics*.

279,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Let's talk about effective DPS testing,81,4fo5jm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4fo5jm/lets_talk_about_effective_dps_testing/,2016-04-21 02:24:17,"Now that DPS testing is out, players will inevitably be posting and comparing numbers. I wanted to start a discussion about effective DPS testing practices. This isn't supposed to be a comprehensive list of rules for raid testing, but I figured this could get the ball rolling. If there is anything you'd like to add/remove/discuss, leave a comment! 1. Know what realistic numbers are. Different players using the same gear, traits, and rotations should get roughly the same numbers. If you hit 30k DPS on your mesmer, it's not because you're such a good mesmer player, it's because something in the test was off. 2. Start on a full HP Golem. Numbers are inflated if the golem has already taken damage. This leads me to my next point... 3. Trust videos, not screenshots. There are probably a few ways that a player can inflate DPS numbers, so be wary of screenshots as evidence. 4. Do not test with full raid buffs. Test with optimal, but realistic raid buffs. Not all attacks on all professions scale the same. Testing with full raid buffs will give you an unrealistic picture of what you should expect from certain classes, and is misleading. That said, certainly there is some merit to testing with full buffs to gauge the theoretical max of each profession. My point is that max buffs should not be the yard stick by which we gauge our DPS expectations. 5. Test with raid rotations, not max DPS rotations. Use the rotations you would in a live battle. If you're testing a condi druid, use your glyphs on cooldown like you would in a raid. The reasoning is the same as not testing with full raid buffs. While it's useful to know the theoretical max of a profession, dps testing should be used to give you realistic expectations of what you should be aiming for in a raid scenario. This should also include testing with occasional healing skills if you're a profession that relies on self healing. You may want to consider turning on pulsing damage. 6. Test a variety of golem sizes and movement options. Size and movement is important for more classes than just the ele. Golem size can make a significant difference for a jalis revenant, for example. Run a variety of tests. 7. Always try to reproduce your results. 8. Watch out for passive buffs like signets and virtues. Some of them may be bugged or broken. Edit: Adding suggestions from comments Generally agreed upon raid buffs from the comments: - 25 might - Fury - Swiftness - Protection - Quickness - Regen - Banner of Strength - Banner of Discipline - Empower Allies - Spotter - 2-3 stacks of Grace of the Land - Frost Spirit On Boss: - 25 Vulnerability - Cripple - Bleed - Burning Other notable boons to toggle on/off based on group composition: - Alacrity - Sun Spirit - Assassin's Presence"
280,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Herald PvP Tips - For and Against,61,47ypd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/47ypd4/herald_pvp_tips_for_and_against/,2016-02-28 09:41:32,"**Tips for Herald** 1) Swapping legends counts as a weapon swap for the purpose of on-swap sigils. Try to swap legends before weapon swapping to get the most out of your on swap sigils. 2) The animations for the Herald elites are all very large, so people tend to dodge them. However, you can stow your weapon after you see players dodge them to force the dodge roll without actually expending the energy (Jade Winds) or giving up the protection (Chaotic Release). 3) If you're using Unrelenting Assault in Legendary Dragon Stance on a stealth class (Daredevil, Druid, or Scrapper), use Gaze of Darkness before they get the chance to stealth. It will Reveal them, so they can't negate the skill with a stealth. 4) Get to know the range on Unrelenting Assault. You can mitigate some damage and reduce the chance of it being interrupted by walking away from your target during the cast, but you don't want it to cancel the skill by taking you out of range. 5) Punishing Sweep has a long cast time, but if you have a down and no other interrupts up, it can be used to stop the res with the AoE daze on the follow up attack, Debilitating Slam. On top of that, it deals significant damage. 6) When you have Enchanted Daggers up, be sure to play aggressive. You lose damage and sustain if they time out of their 15 second duration. 7) Your next two attacks after Phase Traversal are unblockable. When fighting Scrappers or other Heralds, you can chain this with an interrupt to break their block. It's also very useful against classes with reflects so they can't reflect your Precision Strike. 8) Start each game in Legendary Dragon Stance. You can use all of your Facets except for Facet of Chaos to pre-stack boons. If you have a second Herald, they can activate Facet of Chaos as well. You can also do this every time you respawn. 9) Make sure the traits that proc on CC are on cooldown before you try to hit a Surge of the Mists if you don't have Stability. You don't want a taunt or fear on the first hit to completely negate such a powerful skill. 10) You can pop Facet of Light before you want to heal, or even if you have no intention to do so. Showing that the cooldown is up will often cause your opponents play more cautious around you, resulting in less pressure. On the other hand, if you want to use it soon, it can be better to not show that it's up. People tend to go for heavy bursts if they think that it's about to get up, hoping to kill you before you get a potential full heal. Based on this meta Herald build: URL Note: Another popular build (and the one that I actually prefer to run) uses Invocation instead of Retribution. Objectively, that build is stronger, but the Retribution build is one you'll see used more frequently in organized play. It just fits the role that Herald tends to fill better. **Tips against Herald** 1) Infuse Light can completely turn a fight if it results in a full heal. Play carefully if you think it's off cooldown and they're under 50%. Do things that would normally initiate a burst, such as a Phase Traversal, but then stow your weapon and walk away when they pop the heal. 2) A lot of a Herald's damage currently comes from Precision Strike. This is a strength, as well as a vulnerability. Well timed reflects on this short cooldown skill can result in the Herald killing themselves. 3) Unrelenting Assault goes on cooldown but fails if the target walks out of range while the precast goes off. Depending on positioning, you can literally just walk out of range. However, port skills are much more effective. Just be sure to use the port before the cast finishes or you'll use the cooldown and the Herald will just follow you. 4) Every hit on Unrelenting Assault causes damage from Confusion. If you can stack Confusion when they swap into sword, they'll either do more damage to themselves than they do to you or will be unable to do anything other than Precision Strike and play passive. 5) If a Herald uses Jade Winds, pressure them hard. They likely just swapped into Legendary Assassin Stance. Jade Winds uses all 50 energy they get when swapping into the stance, so they are unlikely to have much available in terms of defense. 6) Renewing Wave is a very important condition cleanse when facing condition-based opponents. Try to save a fear or interrupt for it after loading them up with conditions. 7) If you're out of dodges and you see a Herald swap to Staff and use Phase Traversal, walk towards them. This will put them behind you, so they'll either have to turn around to use Surge of the Mists or they'll only hit a couple times if not miss entirely. 8) Try to CC the Herald if it uses Impossible Odds. It will waste tons of energy for no benefit. 9) Learn the anti-port spots. Utilize them when the Herald goes into Legendary Assassin Stance. Still be prepared to respond to Precision Strikes, though. 10) Phase Traversal makes the Herald's next two attacks unblockable. Don't try to block when you see them casting it. You might end up eating an entire Surge of the Mists, but at a minimum you'll eat two Precision Strike bolts. An evade is much better. Note: This is a cross-post from my threads on /r/gw2esports"

The [metabattle build](URL is pretty good and has been a good starting point, but I disagreed with the rune choice. As I investigated, I found the [Superior Rune of Thorns](URL Seems like a good choice right? So, I continued my research(before I invest 1500 Airship Parts + 12g) and found [this thread](URL posted about a month ago. Reading through the comments, it didn't really seem like there was any definitive answer found. So for those that don't like the read... **TL;DR** - ~~Does the thief's Potent Poison trait factor in to the condition duration cap? I know there are situations for other classes with a similar trait where it doesn't, hence the question.~~ **EDIT**: So we've established(from people that have tested it) that the trait does factor in to the total cap. So now the question is which runes to take? The ones I'm currently considering are Berserker runes, Thorns(even if poison gets capped the 6th bonus is still good), and Krait. Thoughts? **Bonus Question**: ~~Why would you take Skale Venom over Needle Trap traited with Deadly Trapper? With the latter, you still get the vulnerability plus the additional poison and bleed stacks(and some might). When sharing Skale Venom is it really stronger?~~ Turns out I wasn't doing math, so this was a stupid question. Sry about that and thanks for the clarity. **Verdict:** Correct me if I'm wrong, but what we've decided: 1. Potent Poison factors into the total cap. 2. (It was a stupid inquiry but...) Due to the sheer number of stacks applied by Skale Venom, it's superior to other options. 3. The difference between the runes is small, but important. Thorns puts you over the poison cap but provides extra condition dmg(if you're getting hit&lt;--maybe for a tank-thief build???). Krait is ok, but still a dps loss. Berserkers seems to be the optimal choice. "

284,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Mesmer DPS Calculator V. 1.4 - Rise of the Condi Mesmer?,77,43ixzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/43ixzz/mesmer_dps_calculator_v_14_rise_of_the_condi/,2016-01-31 23:49:47,"Hello /r/Guildwars2/, it's /u/TheRealC again! I don't expect many or any of you to remember this, but back in the pre-historic days before HoT I made a little [Mesmer DPS calculator](URL As HoT was released shortly afterwards and everything changed, it proved largely irrelevant, and as I myself was heavily invested in real-life business I was unable to update it. However, as I've been coming back to the game and enjoying it immensely, I figured I'd start to dust the old thing off. However, the real reason for my interest was [this recent patch](URL In particular, the following three lines stood out to me: - Ether Clone: This skill no longer generates a clone if the player has the max number of illusions. It instead applies 2 stacks of torment for 5 seconds. - Duelists Discipline: The chance to bleed has been increased from 33% to 50%. Bleed duration has been increased from 5 seconds to 6 seconds. - Malicious Sorcery: The attack speed increase from this trait has been increased from 15% to 20%. Most Mesmers scoffed at the changes, and especially the Malicious Sorcery change was largely ridiculed. Although individually the changes seemed unconvincing, together they finally enabled a build that had always been so close to working  Scepter/Pistol. How well *is* it working, then? Well, Spreadsheet Maths to the rescue. Now, before I give any concrete results, I'll give the same warnings as I've given before: The spreadsheet calculates *infinite-state DPS*, that is, the DPS you'll get once you've set up your phantasms and are just maintaining your (extremely simple) Scepter rotation. It does not take skill rotation or setup time into account; if there is interest, running DPS calculations with skill rotations may appear later. In either case, the rotation is simple: Time Warp (with Continuum Shift shenanigans with the second build), set up three Pistol Phantasms then use Scepter 3 on cooldown and fill with Scepter autos. A second warning: The builds presented below are *weird*. No Viper's? Rampager's everywhere? Rune of the *Krait*? However, I'm not insane, and I'm not trying to cut corners  this is, legitimately, the setup I could find that had most DPS. Suggestions for improvements are welcome! Okay, boring stuff out of the way, time for numbers. Two main builds will be considered. The first is [a more support-oriented setup](URL that, in addition to doing high personal damage, has access to quick Time Warps and a Well from Chronomancer. As an added advantage, this build can quickly set up three Phantasms due to Continuum Split. Sad example: With PSEA Warrior and two banners: [**19 719 DPS**](URL Dreamworld example: With PSEA Warrior and two banners + Druid with Spotter, Frost Spirit, Sun Spirit and maintaining five stacks of Grace of the Land + Revenant with Assassin's Presence: [**24 106 DPS**](URL The realistic example is obviously somewhere between these two extremes, so let's cautiously estimate the number as ~**20k DPS** The second build is [selfish DPS build](URL with only Time Warp and one utility skill for support  it does not even use Chronomancer, instead gaining some extra damage and duration from Chaos. The build's main problem is the time it takes to set up three Pistol Phantasms, but once it's set up it has a slightly higher output than the first build. Still, this build is probably inferior to the first one and is more of a and that's how high we can theoretically go proposition. Sad example DPS: [**20 439 DPS**](URL Dreamworld example DPS: [**25 044 DPS**](URL Again, a cautious estimate for the DPS would be ~**21 k DPS** Assumptions: - Team provides 25 stacks of Might and Vulnerability and permanent Fury. - You have on average 5,5 boons on you (reasonable since you self-apply Vigor). This is just an eyeballed estimate, and may be too high, although the esimate is fairly conservative  it's an important size for the second build, since condition duration depends on the number of boons on you via [Chaotic Persistence](URL - Enemy has 2600 armor  although I'm not sure what armor raid bosses have, so this may be a bad assumption. - Enemy is not moving and attacks at a rate of three attacks per ten seconds (both these assumptions are extremely conservative). - Quickness and Alacrity have **not** been accounted for, as doing so is a pain. Obviously they're DPS increases, though. So what is my point here? Well, ideally I'd spark some amount of debate. Could Condi Mesmer finally go from a troll/solo build to an actual raid spec, as it brings comparable Condi damage to other classes but also retains some of the team support that standard Chronomancers are so well-liked for? Or are my calculations completely unrealistic, and Condi Mesmer is doomed to failure? Is my maths just plain old wrong? Thought, opinions, anything? Myself, I'm a theoretician most of all, so I often don't see the practical issues - so any outside observation would be valuable. Also, I have no guarantee that the examples I set up are the highest possible DPS, so any suggestions to build tweaks would be great. For those interested, my Mesmer DPS spreadsheet has been updated to [Version 1.4](URL (don't ask where Versions 1.2 and 1.3 went, we do not speak of them). It should, in theory, be updated and usable for any Mesmer spec, but I could easily have messed something up somewhere, so shout if something seems odd. For use instructions, see my [original DPS calculator post](URL Most issues with the previous versions have been fixed now, although some have been fixed in a lazy manner. PS 1: No, /u/TheRealC hasn't gone crazy  Rampager instead of Sinister is indeed the choice even though it stacks a ridiculous amount of Precision. Although the Mesmer gets a needlessly high crit chance, the Phantasms gain much-needed crit chance, as [Phantasmal Fury](URL is not available in this build due to competing with [Duelist's Discipline](URL and Precision very significantly increases the damage done by Pistol Phantasm attacks and the number of bleed stacks from [Sharper Images](URL Number tweaking confirms that each Rampager's piece is a DPS increase over having Sinister in that slot, while Viper's is mostly unneccessary as you overcap on condition duration. Yes, I have run the number for Viper's variants too (with Runes of the Berserker or Nightmare). PS 2: To /u/xsai  I'm sorry it took so long, and it's probably too late now, but here we are. Edit: Google Docs link seems funky, here's a [direct download link](URL Edit 2: From anecdotal evidence and some thought experiments, it may actually seem like, outside of extremely long fights, the ""selfish"" build will do *significantly less DPS* than the ""support"" build, simply because setting up three Pistol Phantasms takes so much longer. Something to ponder. Edit 3: After listening to feedback, I did some ""real"" tests. I added the conclusions in [this post](URL In short, simple tests are acting pretty much as expected."
285,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[Suggestion] DPS Meter via a guild hall upgrade,0,43pnft,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/43pnft/suggestion_dps_meter_via_a_guild_hall_upgrade/,2016-02-02 04:56:40,"It seems that, almost daily now, there's a post on this subreddit about DPS meter's and all the crazy shit people are doing to try and get some kind of understanding about what they're doing in PvE, particularly in Raids. Here we have Enrage timers (Hard DPS checks) without any ingame means of actually finding out what our group is doing DPS wise. A month ago or so, in a thread asking for guild hall upgrade suggestions, I posted about adding a DPS golem. After watching Tea Time yesterday, I started thinking about it more critically and actually forming ideas. To me, there are two potential ways to address it, and I'll cover both. **Adding to the PvP Arena** I'm not particularly fond of this idea because it seems quite limiting to me (and also thematically weird), but I think it's the easiest way to do it. Effectively, you could add the ability to unlock a DPS golem similar to those in HotM but they would compile actual numbers for you similar to the Masters of Damage in Guild Wars 1. You could damage them for however long you wanted, then speak with them after and they'd tell you the amount of damage you did over the period of time you attacked. However, if this is the method Anet choose, I hope they consider the following things as well: * Traps that pulse boons - In particular, 25 might, Fury, and Quickness would both be exceptionally good, as they'd allow us to see the difference these buffs make. And if you're testing for a raid environment, these things should be a given. * Debuff Turrets - While most are included, the big one missing would be vulnerability. It is indeed pretty easy to just multiply damage up manually, but that defeats the entire purpose of this idea in the first place as we can already do that. **PvE Simulator** I would prefer this idea because we can tailor it SPECIFICALLY to training in PvE Environments instead of attempting to force a PvP system to accomodate PvE needs. Call it the Taimi FightSim5000 or something, I don't know. * Would spawn it's own instance area for testing either solo or as a team. * Record damage for the length of the 'encounter', then spit it out afterwards for everyone to see, with breakdowns for each individual player * The ability to having a breakbar spawn occasionally on the boss so we can teach new people how to actually deal with this stuff (as 90% of the population seem to have no idea what it actually is or how to remove it). * A console outside the instance that would allow you to set some custom parameters, such as full buff stacks, permanent Quickness, etc. Perhaps even the ability to apply buffs like Spotter or Empowered Allies as a 'room effect' so you're not going in to test with people specifically to get a buff. * The possibility of 'unlocking' raid mechanics to train and practice on, such as Sab's Firewall or Gorseval's Stomp. These are just some of the ideas I've had and I hope people enjoy them. If you have any further ideas for this topic, please post them! I don't know if it will make a difference, but I'd rather have something ingame that is highly accurate and detailed as opposed to relying on what we are right now."
286,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Why would you pick Guardian over Revenant?,0,45gej5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/45gej5/why_would_you_pick_guardian_over_revenant/,2016-02-13 06:33:34,"Hi there! I'm looking for opinions on why would anyone want a Guardian/DH over a Revenant/Herald. I'm a Guardian player since game day 1, and recently I've leveled my Revenant to 80 and got Herald, and now I'm looking for reasons to play my Guardian. My impressions so far: - Revenant's Hammer auto attack hits hard and it's not easily avoidable simply by strafing. +1 Rev - Coalescence of Ruin hits almost as hard as True Shot, has the range thing which isn't much of an issue in WvW, but it's much harder to see and evade. +1 Rev - Hammer also has an Evade, AoE, a 15s CD CC and an awesome projectile projection (only 6 secs of downtime) easier attainable than a Guardian's. +1 Rev - Legends' utilities CD (considering energy cost) are on short CDs, but most importantly, they don't have/require traits to improve them and they're all well balanced - you'll get a Stun Breaker, Gap Closer, defensive, etc While my Guardian requires traits for improvement and I find it harder to balance utilities (like always keeping at least one Stun Breaker). +1 Rev - Herald is simply... broken? Battle Presence on demand, with a better heal, Empowering Might simply by having any Herald skill up, permanent Swiftness for groups, better group buffs than any build I could bring with my Guardian. +1 Rev - Builds/Roles can be switched as easy as swapping Legends, also, this gives more versatility overall. Guardian's can't be that versatile, they usually fill only one role. +1 Rev - DpS is hard to measure, but it seems the Rev's DpS is not that far from a Guardian's, or could even be higher since it's easy to keep 100% crit chance. For PvE Herald also brings massive Vulnerability, just like my DH. +1 both. - Sword &amp; Shield on Revenant's actually works and is useful. Not that a Guardian isn't, but other weapons generally perform better than S&amp;S. +1 Rev - Guardian's melee is unparalleled, on par with Reapers. Fighting on point is a DH's strong point. +1 Guardian Well, that's it. For me, mostly, it's better ranged, better buffs, better utilities, more versatility and equal or arguably better group support at the cost of not being a melee monster. I really like my Guardian, I even crafted a Legendary for her, and I like the concept, but I'm having a hard time finding the reasons to play it over my Herald - I may enjoy Guardian but if I know I can/have a better performance, why wouldn't I?"

Two of the new Ranger pets are insane, Smokescale and Bristleback compared to any other available pet. Some condition classes, well, *Reaper* is where all the problems are as it's seen huge buffs and has ridiculous levels of damage and control though things like 900 damage Chill that stacks up to 30 seconds but stacks from so many sources that it's unfeasible to cleanse and hilarious to convert *2 seconds of Resistance will save you!* Now so many things don't just remove boons, they convert them. Conditions though have seen huge escalations vs power damage for over a year, since Weakness was buffed to affect all power hits, normal and critical. Since critical damage was nerfed by around 20% with the ferocity change. Since conditions were given the ridiculous ability of stacking. Since Vulnerability was buffed to also increase condition damage. Since conditions still require one less stat than power damage to do high damage leading to a defensive stat allocation disparity. And recently more tellingly since conditions have a food that extends their duration by 20%, equivalent to +300 expertise while also granting 70 condition damage. Something you won't find at all for power damage."
288,vulnerability,Guildwars2,The difference a DPS druid makes: By the numbers,83,3zrwl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3zrwl9/the_difference_a_dps_druid_makes_by_the_numbers/,2016-01-07 08:22:12,"A current prevailing opinion is that druids should take minimum heal/tough//vit stats, spending most of their time in sword and camping staff only when necessary. The theory is that higher DPS = faster kill = less mechanics to deal with. I wanted to see the difference between this DPS druid and a full heal staff-camping druid actually was so I did some quick numbers. I took a look at vale guardian's final phase. In this phase VG has 7,333,333.33 health ([source](URL Let's say you clear this phase in 120 seconds, or two minutes. This is a decent time for a clear, but not particularly fast. If we made this phase quicker it would further minimize the impact of the druid and I want to be generous with my assumptions. To beat the final phase in 120 seconds you need to do: 7,333,333.33/120 = 61,111.11 DPS as a party. - Situation 1: You have an out of this world godly DPS druid. He wears full zerk. He brings a staff for emergencies, but never uses it, camping sword the entire phase. This druid has 100% uptime on all of his DPS boosts, including scholar runes and max GotL stacks. He always crits. He also has an unusually intelligent pet tiger that uses a max DPS rotation and always crits. This druid is so good he has zero down time on his DPS, not even for green circles or celestial form. Under these condition's the druid and his pet are hitting a DPS of 10,310.27 (calculations [here](URL under the sword tab. I could throw in calculations for other party boons like quickness, alacrity, vulnerability, but I think I'm being generous enough. In this scenario the Druid is clearly doing more than his fair share of DPS, whereas in reality the druid is doing some of the lowest DPS. - Situation 2: Now let's replace Druid with Derp. Derp uses magi's/clerics, carries two staffs, and keeps his pet on passive at all times. Derp is literally dead weight. He does 0 DPS. So whereas the party's DPS in situation 1 was 61,111.11, because of Derp it now drops down to: 61,111.11 - 10,310.27 = 50,800.84. Dammit Derp. What will this cost the team in seconds? Lets take VG's HP in the final phase and Divide it by the new party DPS: 7,333,333.33/50,800.84=144.34 That's a total time difference of: 144.34 - 120 = 24.34 seconds So by replacing the most godly of druids with the most retarded of druids, we're shaving just over 24 seconds off of our final phase time. What happens in 24 seconds? One lightning strike and one sectional rotation. I've been pretty generous in my assumptions. The reality is that the DPS difference between a full zerk druid and a full magi druid is much smaller than what I showed here. The difference between zealot druid and magi Druid is even smaller still. By taking a DPS druid over a healing druid you are saving yourself, at most, a single mechanical rotation in the final phase. In reality, you're probably not even saving that because the full heal druid will provide greater up time on GotL, scholar runes and other health bonuses, and allow party members to tank more hits/dodge less to keep DPSing. This probably won't change anyone's mind on the subject, particularly those that already invested in Zealot's gear, but I thought I would throw it out there anyways. tl;dr- The time saved on dealing with boss mechanics by bringing a DPS druid over heal druid is either very small or non-existent. The margin of error a heal druid provides to your team is very large. Almost all groups are probably better off bringing a full heal druid. As usual, point out any glaring errors I've made. Edit: I should point out, don't pay attention to the actual DPS numbers. The number here are significantly different from what you would find in an actual VG encounter. Instead, pay attention to the *proportions*. The idea was to set up a scenario in which the druid was doing far more damage *proportionally* than it would in reality, and then remove that DPS. It's not necessary to get exact numbers to figure out relative impact of a party member's DPS. Edit 2: Had a few more replies so I'll explain further what I mean by proportions. Ignore the specific DPS calculations if it helps. Under my assumptions, the DPS druid is dealing 1/6 of the entire parties damage during the 2 minute phase. Obviously no druid is doing nowhere near that much damage, so I don't think I'm underestimating the druid's contribution even though I'm leaving out some of the more variable boons. I am still grossly overestimating the proportional contribution of the druid, which supports the argument that little is gained by the druid focusing on DPS rather than healing."

The roll the arrowhead use is a skill, minis don't use skills ingame. Same reason why Mini Wyvern doesn't fly. * Glide in WvW? No plan right now. It would change the way core WvW functions * QA get 400-1000 bug reports a day. Most are duplicates of things they already know. Dont contact customer service when it is more fitting for a bug report (i..e something is broken, a skill/item isnt working or you find an exploit). **General Overview of Balance Changes** * Quickness/Slow no longer affects stomping/rezzing. Trivialized too many things. * Quickness/Slow turned defensive abilities into faster abilities, which is not useful. We turned the time scaling off for these abilities (i..e shield block no longer hastened with quickness or extended with slow). There are some exceptions like Blurred Frenzy which are pseudo defensive/offensive and are not touched. * Modifying or removing some of the more defensive amulets in PvP. Adding in some new stat combos to PvP that you dont normally see. **Guardian** *** * Protective Reviver  added a speed increase in revival. * Smite Conditions  Increase the number of conditions removed from 1 to 2. This works with the utility and traits like Smiters Boon. * Test of Faith  Right now 66% of the full damage comes from when player first cross the rings and the sword comes up. It felt too spike oriented. It will be reduced to 50% of the full damage. * Piercing Light  Reduced the daze duration from 1s to 0.5s. It will no longer daze enemies in an unblockable way. **Engineer** *** * Power Wrench  Recharge reduction was 20% before. We increased it to 33%. * Takedown Round  Damage increased by 33%. * Scrapper felt a bit too defensive so the following changes were made * Rocket Charge  Increased recharge by 2s (going from 10 to 12s). * Stealth Gyro  Increased recharge from 20s to 40s. **Necro** *** * Corrupt Boon  Reducing the amount of boons you can corrupt from 5 to 3. Recharge reduced from 40s to 15s. You can corrupt boons more frequently instead of corrupting a large swath of boons at once. * Putrid Curse (scepter autoattack chain 3)  Corrupt one boon with every attack. So every third autoattack you can corrupt one boon. * Unyielding Blast  No longer adds piercing but Life Blast and Plague Blast now pierce by default. **Elementalist** *** * Diamond Skin going from condition immunity to condition removal (1 condition removed on a 1s internal cooldown). Health Threshold is now 75% instead of 90%. So rapid conditions applications will spike you down. * Auras  duration and overall availability of auras too much since HoT. Overall uptime too high. We are reducing all the auras activated from skills/traits to 4s. * Fresh Air  In addition to its refresh mechanic, everytime you reattune to air, you get 250 Ferocity for 5s. This bonus doesnt stack in intensity. So you will be critting and then critting hard. * Shatterstone (Water Scepter) Reduced the timeit takes for the shatterstone to explode from two seconds to one. It has a small radius so the explosion would often miss. Cooldown increased from 2 to 3s. **Mesmerm(rip)** *** * Mesmer will be getting a reduction in both defense and offense (via alacrity changes). * Alacrity caused too much overall damage increase. Basically you had a mesmer or you had 66% damage loss. We didnt want to reduce the amount of alacrity as you can just bring more mesmers to bridge the gap. We brought alacrity brought down from 66% to 33% so it is not useless. * Well of Precognition - Gone from granting invulnerability to applying 3s of aegis every pulse. * Malicious Sorcery - This trait applies attack speed while wielding scepter. Increased from 15% to 20%. * Chaos Armor - This was applying too much blind. It will apply weakness rather than blind. Swiftness/confusion duration increased from 3s to 5s. **Ranger** *** * Search and Rescue  Will now give ally in the area regeneration but if there is an ally down in the area (1200 range), the pet will teleport the downed person to you and then revive them. * Protect Me  Now will break stun on nearby allies, giving you protection and cause the next foe that attack you to be taunted by your pet. * Hidden Barbs - Bleeding damage increase changed from 20% to 33% * Predator's Onslaught - Increased damage for you and your pet on inhibited targets changed from 10% to 15% **Revenant** *** * Sword autoattack damage going down 10%ish. First auto attack gone down by 10%, 2nd autoattack gone down by 20%, third autoattack down by 10%. Damage will be put back in Precision Strike * Precision Strike - now always launch 3 projectiles regardless of how many targets (if there is only 1 target it will receive all 3 projectiles). Reduced the chill duration from 2s to 1.5s per projectile. * Unrelenting Assault. Reduced the number of strikes from 7 to 5. Increased the damage of each strike by 10%. This skill had a weird issue with animation scaling under quickness/slow. This has been fixed. * Facet of Light - Initial activation of the facet will now have a cast time. This means that you can no longer use it as a stun breaker. We now want you to preemptively activate this and make a commitment to use this heal before you can use it. * Coalescence of Ruin - It had too low cooldown. Cooldown increased from 2s to 4s. It will no longer double hit. **Thief** *** * Our goal with Acrobatics is to boost the regenerative ability of the thief and remove conditions more frequently. * Fleet Shadow changed to Instant Reflex (gain evasion for 2s when struck below the health threshold 50%, 40s CD). * Upper Hand  Changed to give regeneration when you evade an attack (in addition to the initiative gain). Cooldown also reduced from 3s to 2s. * Basilisk Venom  Your attacks are unblockable in addition to turn foes to stone. This works with Venomous Aura so all your ally attacks will be unblockable. * Withdraw healing has been increased by 10%. * Autoattack damage for sword not changed but the frequency has increased. Overall damage increased by about 30%. * Black Powder has its aftercast removed. * Dagger autoattack damage increased. * Bandits Defense, you can now block for the full duration of 1.5s. * Staff got some damage increase as well. **Warrior** *** * Warriors are getting a more defensive buff via more healing and cooldown reductions. * To the Limit had its healing increased by 40%. Other heals similarity had their heal increased by a certain margin. Signet had its HP increased by 20 HP per second. Adrenal Health also has about a 15% increase. * Some damage increases and some aftercasts removed so you can activate skills quicker. * Cyclone Axe was previously split between PvP/PvE with it dealing less damage in PvE. We unsplit it now so it deals more damage in PvE. * Rifle rework: Crackshot no longer grants piercing by default. It will instead apply additional adrenaline per shot. Piercing is now default on a few select skills like Volley, Killshot, Forceful Shot and Repeating Shot. Brutal Shot (rifle #4) will now evade you back by 400 range and immobilize for 1.5s. * Aimed Shot will now applies 5 stacks of Vulnerability for 8s. Damage increased by 20s. * Berserker  King of Fires  Changed to give a fire shield on critical hits with a cooldown of 15s. Using a berserker skill will detonate any fire aura on you, giving 3 stacks of burning on nearby enemies for 3s. "

[READ THIS](URL ^(This hyperlink to the wiki is copyrighted by me; original content, do not steal under penalty of international copyright law) If a condition is listed under soft or hard control, then it depletes break bars. These only work when the break bars are BLUE. ********************* Easy way to remember: If the condition does damage *before traits*, then it doesn't move break bars. **All other conditions** (except vulnerability) DO deplete the break bar. ************************* So if people are saying ""NO CC"" or ""NO CC UNTIL XXX,"" then Poison, Bleed, Burning, Confusion, Torment, and Vulnerability are okay to use. Everything else, no-no. Be sure to check all your skills, traits, and PETS to make sure you're not that one asshole who ruins things for everyone else. Some classes even have *autoattacks* that take down break bars, including Thief sword, Warrior sword and mace, Reaper greatsword, and Ranger sword. All of these classes have highly viable alternatives to use. During burn phases (right when break bar is broken), please use a real weapon that does good damage.

Sort of. I had been working on this for a while, but [this thread](URL prompted me to wrap it up and post it. Also thanks to /u/that_shaman for reminding me where he posted the Specialization backgrounds. What a swell fella! ANYway, this is my attempt at the Thief class; a class archetype that is always dear to my heart in every game I play despite my complete lack of skill in playing said class. So without further ado, here, have some visual aids: * [Deadly Arts](URL * [Critical Strikes](URL * [Shadow Arts](URL * [Acrobatics](URL * [Trickery](URL #PREFACE: * I basically reworked and refocused all the Core Specializations. Personally I think Daredevil is 'fine' so I did not bother with it. * Nearly everything has a range of values or ""???"" where I had no idea what would seem fair. Let your imagination fill in the blanks. * Also, terms enclosed by square brackets ""[ ]"" with an ""OR"" in between indicate exclusion choices; it's a ""one-or-the-other"" type of thing. #WEAPON SKILLS &amp; UTILITIES: * I did not want to go crazy over these, so I changed as little as possible. I also did not do tooltip mockups for these because bleh. * _Steal_ - Recharge reduced to 25 seconds, which becomes 21.25 seconds when taking the Trickery line. The 20% reduction from the old _Sleight of Hand_ trait was removed. * _Infiltrator's Signet_ - New passive: Reduces damage taken from foes beyond the active effect's range. Range is still 900, reduces damage by 10%. * _Haste_ - Recharge lowered by 15 sec (60 -&gt; 45); Grants Quickness, Superspeed and [Fury] OR [Vigor], all in equal durations. * _Roll for Initiative_ - Recharge halved if used to successfully evade an attack. * _Vital Shot_, _Body Shot_, _Unload_, and _Sneak Attack_ all pierce. _Headshot_ could too... I guess. I dunno. * _Body Shot_ - Duration of Immobilize and number and duration of stacks of Vulnerability applied increases based on range, being more effective on close targets. (0-300 | 300-600 | 600-900) * _Unload_ - Each successive shot fires further, up to 1,200 range. Range of the first shot could start at 600 or 900. #CORE SPECIALIZATIONS: * Each Specialization line recieved a facelift: * The top branch (rightmost in the images) typically has the most offense-oriented traits. * The middle branch has traits most in-line with the 'theme' or 'flavor' of the Specialization. * Finally the bottom branch (leftmost in the images) usually has defense/sustain-related traits, or whatever did not fit as well into the other categories. ##[DEADLY ARTS:](URL * Overall fine, but had some weird stuff in it. * Top line has direct damage, pure offense traits. * Middle line has traits dealing with condition application and upkeep, mostly dealing with poison. * Bottom line revolves around lifesteal and sustain via poison. ##[CRITICAL STRIKES:](URL * Needed some cleanup, some redundant/overlapping traits. * Top line has offensive Signet-based traits and critical damage. * Middle line has traits dealing specifically with effects from critical hits and fury. * Bottom line revolves around sustain through taking or dealing damage. ##[SHADOW ARTS:](URL * Core theme of the line still exists, but lots of stuff shifted. **Venomous Aura is baseline.** * Top line has offensive support traits mostly based on entering/exiting stealth. * Middle line has traits dealing with personal stealth application and various bonuses your stealth applies. * Bottom line revolves around anti-stealth defenses and deceptions. ##[ACROBATICS:](URL * This poor line was a casualty so we could have Daredevil. I tried. I really did. * Top line has offensive enemy control and personal offensive support traits. * Middle line has traits dealing with vigor and swiftness application and benefits from their upkeep. * Bottom line revolves around initiative and cooldown management. ##[TRICKERY:](URL * Equivalent to the Virtues line for Guardians in that most Steal-based traits are options here, as well as some new ones. * Top line has interrupt-based bonuses and traits. * Middle line has traits dealing entirely with Steal and boon application/management. * Bottom line revolves around tricks and condition management. #THE GOOD: * Group utility ahoy! Unique support through the new Signets of Power, baseline Venomous Aura, a class-specific aura (Sinister Presence), more access to boon-stripping (Sticky Fingers, Unburden), and access to boon-sharing (Wealth Distribution). * Better organization and distribution of traits. A place for everything and (mostly) everything in a place. * In general, new toys and more interactions and synergy between traitlines. * _Heightened Resistance_ (any combination), _Protective Refuge_, and _Revealed Reversal_ both help give some flat, not-dodge-related survivability to the profession. * Very little was actually discarded. Most things that seem to have been removed were merged into other traits, sometimes in other lines. Although, see below... #THE BAD(?): * _Trapper's Respite_, _Last Refuge_, and _Practiced Tolerance_ removed entirely. The latter I sort of wanted to repurpose as a 'Toughness/Vitality from Power/Condition/Precision' trait, but ultimately ran out of room... * Pehaps too much unique utility. Signets of Power could be reverted to its original version, leaving Signets as a purely self-supporting option while the baseline Venomous Aura, Sinister Presence, and Wealth Distribution remain group-support options. * Shadow Arts no longer has traits for both Venoms and Deceptions, so you can't get double reductions from one line. * Trickery might be a tad overboard. For example, _Trickster_ + _Improvisation_ could lead to some absurd combinations with Tricks: Any utility -&gt; Withdraw -&gt; Steal -&gt; if Withdraw reset (50-50 shot) -&gt; Withdraw -&gt; Trickster procs, putting Withdraw on a 6 - 9 sec recharge. That's potentially 3 heals in ~10-12 seconds. SO yeah. Might be a bit much. This could, however, be avoided by making Improvisation only affect Utility (7-9) skills. #THE UGLY: * _Assassin's Reward_ (now in Critical Strikes) has nothing to do with the line. It got bumped out of Acrobatics and I tried to think of ways to adjust it, but ultimately came up with nothing. * Still no _Ricochet_ for Pistols. I considered working the behavior into the new _Powder Rounds_ (or completely replacing my idea with it), but ultimately decided not to. I think baseline piercing behavior on most Pistol skills and some partial 1,200 range on Unload works out fine, though it is not as unique... * No auto-stun-break on _Hard to Catch_. I did want to keep it (and it could still probably work), but I liked the idea of getting some superspeed more. It would probably be better off with an auto-break though... * Not sure which way to go with _Fleet Shadow_/_Perpetual Motion_. * I love the concept of _Efficient Killer_ but am sure it makes some things overpowered. Especially in conjunction with some/any of the added initiative regeneration sources. #SUMMARY: I am SURE there are a bundle of OP interactions I am not aware of but since I primarily do PvE (if anything at all) and this is a matter of making the class more *fun*, this should really only be taken as a general idea of what I would like to see from the Thief profession. Also I worded the tooltips in traditional ArenaNet vague, so if something is hard to understand, I will try to explain it better. **TL;DR? Go look at the pretty pictures, ya lazy sod. I did a thing, look at the thing I did before telling me I suck.** For the sake of discussion: * Is there anything you see here that you like? What do you dislike? * What build would you run with these Specializations? (With or without Daredevil) * Provided you do not think so already, what is the bare minimum that would have to change for you to find the Thief profession fun?

The vessel changes at random every 30-60 seconds, and each time the entire party leaves combat. * **Vessel of Fear** As Agony, but with 5 secs of fear for approaching the vessel. * **Vessel of Weakness** See above, but with 20 seconds of weakness. * **Vessel of Metagaming** See above, but with 20 seconds of Taunt. * **Business as Usual** You gain stacks of agony when not within 100 units of another friendly player. * **You Cant Touch This** Approaching downed allies while in combat will launch you and the downed ally 200 units away from each other. * **Number One Stunner** The player with the most HP, calculated as a percentage of total HP, is stunned every 20 seconds for 20 seconds. If multiple players are tied for most HP, the stunned target is chosen at random. This stun can be removed normally. * **Mistlock Instability Instability** The party is afflicted with a random mistlock instability whenever a member enters combat, or the entire party leaves combat. * **Combo Breaker** Performing a combo finisher deals 10% of your maximum HP as agony damage. * **Mawdrey III** When enemies are killed, they spawn an elite Mordrem vine in a random space within 1000 units * **Down the Rabbit Hole** Fractals are filled with a large number of rabbits. When killed rabbits become Spectral Vaettir hostile to the party. * **Through the Looking Glass** Reflect skills also reflect friendly projectiles. * **Grave Digger** Enemies will regain HP when killed over time. Enemies must be buried with the Shovel to prevent revival. There is only one shovel. * **Stack Exchange** When killed, enemies revive allies within 400 units at full HP. Moving within 50 units of another player kills you instantly. * **Closer** Enemies are immune to ranged attacks. * **Farther** Enemies are immune to melee attacks. * **Game of Zones** Red and blue zones randomly appear in the fractal, and change places every 20 seconds. You may not use skills outside of red zones. Skills and resources only recharge in blue zones. * **CITIZENS!** Your party is immune to enemy attacks and you are accompanied by a non-combatant Consortium survey team. When a member of the survey team takes damage, suffers a condition, or is granted a boon, it is in stead applied to a member of your party at random. (Custom VO?) * **Smile!** Your party is granted an experimental Consortium Aggression Mitigator (C.A.M.) The holder of the C.A.M. may use it to Place the Smiling debuff on a target once every 10 seconds. Only targets with Smiling take damage or are affected by conditions. Targets afflicted with Smiling become neutral until struck. (Custom player VO?) * **Crab Battle** All enemies are replaced with a Veteran Karka. * **Madness Deux** Your party is persued by Scarlet Briar (As she appeared during the invasion events) who will appear and disappear at random intervals. (Custom VO?) * **Phase Two** Every time the party leaves combat, Horrik appears and bombards the fractal for 20 seconds with cannon fire as in the cannon phase of the Mai Trin fight. (Custom VO?) * **Apples** The fractal rains fruit. Enemies or allies that touch the fruit are healed. All other heals have no effect. (Custom Tibalt VO?) * **Adventures in Babysitting** The Lupikids join you in the fractal. If the Lupikids fear meter becomes full, they and you are extracted immediately. Maintain control of their zone of influence to stave off fear (Same mechanic as the event, Custom VO?) * **All for one** If Frostbite dies, your party dies as well. * **Vote for Kiel** If Inspector Ellen Kiel dies, your party returns to the Mistlock Observatory. All progress will be lost. * **Special Snowflake** One player is designated the Special Snowflake. All other players can not deal damage. The Special snowflake can not heal or grant boons. When the entire party leaves combat, a new player becomes the Special Snowflake at random. * **Nope** All attacks, both enemy and ally, cause 2 seconds of fear on hit. * **Not in the Face!** All conditions are in stead blinds. Missing an attack causes damage. * **Sweep the Leg!** Enemies are immune to damage and conditions unless knocked down or launched. Dodging knocks down nearby enemies for 1 second. * **Outrun a Centaur** Your party is persued by a Mistlock Centaur. The centaur is invincible and only uses basic melee attacks. Being struck by the centaur kills you instantly. * **When Its Ready** All skills have a 180s cooldown. * **Tip of the Iceberg** Receive damage over time when Chilled. Boons are converted into conditions when Chilled. * **Nothings Off the Table** Specializations, Traits, and Utility skills are randomly selected for the player and locked for the entire fractal. * **Overheal** Use of a healing skill heals nearby enemies as well. * **Decay** Every minute, one item of armor takes damage as if the player had died. * **Fractals on Ice** All surfaces are slippery. * **Lag-fest** Skills activate 2-5 seconds after you activate them. * **Easy does it** Running is disabled.

(Same icons at catbot fight) Enemies and allies with matching polarities reflect attacks and abilities. Enemies and allies with opposite polarities are pulled toward one another 50 units when struck (not launched, no CC) * **Do a Barrel Roll** Skills and resources other than endurance do not recharge as normal. In stead they recharge in five second increments whenever you dodge, or an ally dodges within 100 units of you. * **Annihilator 3: The Golem Uprising** All enemies are replaced elite Golems. Corporal Bane joins you in the fractal. Golems will repair one another, but can not repair a golem that is Tazed by Corporal Bane. (Custom VO is a must here) Corporal bane has downed skills and a downed state. If Corporal Bane dies, you are returned to the Mistlock Observatory, and the future belongs to the machines. * **Body Swap** Character control is shuffled such that no party member is playing as their own character. * **The Floor Is Lava** Standing on the ground causes stacks of burning to appear on you. Standing on objects/furniture prevents this. * **Voodoo** Enemies take damage whenever they cause damage to you, and take no damage from your own attacks. (In other words, Go full healing mode) * **Temporal Distortion** All enemies have pulsing quickness, alacrity and super speed. Enemy attacks cause slow. * **Zerg Rush** This fractal now has about 10x the mobs it normally does. Enjoy! * **Heavy Rain** Meteors rain from the sky, causing AOE damage at random areas. * **Vampiric Curse** Your whole party is invincible, but cannot be healed normally, and your health slowly drains. Your attacks siphon health from enemies. * **Angry** Everyone has perma-rampage transformation. * **Professional foes** Enemies have player profession skills (like the ones used by the PvP training NPCs) * **Tentacles!** Jade Maws Tentacles randomly spawn in and out of the fractals. * **Masque of the Red Sylvari**  Scarlet Briar replaces the end-fractal boss.

There are no reflection crystals. * **Trahearne Ahoy!**  Whenever a fractal boss (legendary foe) is defeated, a copy of Trahearne in a pirate outfit is spawned and must be defeated to complete the fractal. * **Thats Strong Stuff**  The fractal is full of pools of Toxic Pollen. * **Hammering the Sky**  The Skyhammer periodically fires, targeting the party. * **Instant Death**  There is no downed state for players. Players that would be downed go instantly to defeated. * **Glass Cannons**  For every piece of damaged armor, you gain 2% power and condition damage. You gain 10% for each piece of broken armor. * **Power Overwhelming**  You deal 25% extra damage, but take 1% damage every second. * **Like a boss!**  When an NPC defeats a player, Dessa shouts Thats the boss! and the NPC gets a buff increasing their power, condition damage, boon power, condition duration, gets permanent quickness, and makes all their attacks apply agony, however they have reduced toughness and vitality. * **Minion Apocalypse  Anytime a player or NPC dies, a hostile Flesh Wurm spawns.** * **Lone Wolf**  If you are less than 800 distance away from an ally, you deal 10% less damage. If you are, you deal 15% more damage. * **Antisocial** Players can not see or by affected by allies, their abilities, or their combo fields. Allies still deal damage and normally affect enemies. * **Moletariat** Players are transformed in to dredge. All damage, healing, and condition timers suffered by an ally are split up and equally distributed among all allies. Players transformed this way do not become immune to blind. * **Mesmerized** Enemies randomly generate phantasmal copies of themselves with 20% of their HP and damage. These phantasmal foes shatter when killed, dazing nearby foes for 2s. * **Guarded** Enemies grant Aegis to allies within 400 units when struck once every 4 seconds. * **Loudmouthed** Enemies use a random shout once every 10 seconds. * **Best Friends** all enemies spawn with a random animal pet. * **Mistlock Blindfold** Enemies have 50% of their normal HP and are blinded. Enemies summon a random enemy with 120% of its normal HP when killed. These summons do not summon additional summons. (it would be hilarious if they actually wore blindfolds) * **Give and Take** Heal skills only affect targeted allies, not the caster. 600 range. If no ally is targeted, the closest ally receives the heal * **Fight or flight** Being struck by an enemy has a chance to grant 2 seconds of quickness but take 20% increased damage for 2 seconds. Chance: 20% * **Moa Morph** Players are occasionally transformed into moa. Up to two players may be transformed at any time. Moas do 50% more damage but take 20% more damage. Duration: 10s. * **United we stand** Enemy damage scales with the number of enemies nearby. 240 radius. * **Clumsy** Dodging deals damage to the player. Endurance regeneration increased by 500%. * **Copycat** Being struck by an enemy while casting a skill gives a chance for the enemy to copy the skill and use it against you. This effect has a 45 second cool down per enemy. Chance: 10%. * **Dont stop** Being stationary decreases damage dealt by 50%. This does not apply to skills that root you in place. * **Batteries Not Included**  Skills and resources do not recharge as normal. In stead, skills and resources are recharged in five second increments by collecting batteries strewn at random throughout the fractals. Enemies drop batteries when killed. Bosses have a chance to drop batteries when struck. * **Hammer Time**  The party is granted the cliffside hammer. Enemies must be finished with hammer skill 4 once defeated, or they will revive with full health in ten seconds. * **Blood Ritual**  Your skills deal their damage and conditions to you as well as enemies. * **Fan Fiction**  All enemy weapon skins are replaced with tomes. Slain enemies drop their tomes, which create an updraft at the location they died. The floor becomes deadly once every sixty seconds for ten seconds. Gliders are active for this fractal. * **Action Camera**  Enemies explode in a 1200 range aoe when they die after a five second countdown (bomb icon) This damage is unavoidable by normal means, but will not harm players who are not facing the explosion. * **Nevermore**  Enemies summon ravens when they deal damage, which attach permanently to the affected target, dealing damage over time. When an enemy is killed, or a player is downed, all nearby ravens within 300 units detach from affected players and attach to the corpse. Players can be affected by multiple stacks of ravens. Ravens attached to players who die fly away. * **Antihero** - You and your party become a famous Villains or antihero with their unique skills. * **Matchmaking** - Veteran and Elite Enemies are replaced with clones of your party. They have your skills, traits, cooldowns, and gear. They are, however, complete idiots. * **Riddled with Harpies** - Enemies are replaced with harpies (scaled as in the Uncategorized Fractal) These harpies are invincible unless afflicted with Harpy Pheremones, which spawn at random throughout the fractal. * **(Acquatic Ruins Challenge)Friggin' Lasers** - This version of the Acquatic Ruins Fractal replaces all enemies with Sharks with Friggin' Lasers attached to their heads. These sharks have normal shark skills and stats appropriate to their rank and fractal scale, but also fire Arcane Beam once every ten seconds at their target as an instant effect. * **Shinies!** Enemies are replaced with Skritt. Players must carry two shinies to the end of the fractal and place it in the chest at the end for safekeeping. If players drop the shiny, nearby skritt will attempt to pick it up, and after five seconds, burrow away with it. Allowing this to happen results in immediate evacuation, and ends the fractal. * **Well, Well, Well** Hostile Necromancer and Chronomancer wells have a 20% chance to appear when enemies are struck. * **Release the Hounds** Allied utility skills also summon one Hound of Balthazar. Enemy skills have a 33% chance of summoning a Mistlock Drakehound. Both types of hounds hounds last for 60 seconds, and will outlive their summoners. * **Flight of the Aviator** Your party is affected with an Aviator's Memory Box. All skills leap forward 200 units before executing. Also, you go ""NNNEEEEOOWWWW"""
294,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Guardian - Radiance Specialization tweaks and suggestions,4,3xvm4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3xvm4a/guardian_radiance_specialization_tweaks_and/,2015-12-23 07:39:30,"The [Radiance](URL specialization for Guardians is the backbone for the massive ticks of burning that a condition guardian can dish out. However, that's the only way this trait line will ever be truly effective. Some of the traits within this line are either too weak to ever consider taking or simply do not compete with the other . In this post, I will suggest a few tweaks to this specialization that will allow it to flow easier for more build variety while also suggestion new traits that could bring light to new playstyles. The traits regarding burning in the Radiance line are easy enough to identify and flow with each other. Inner Fire helps proc more crits to activate Radiant Fire, which makes burning that much more accessible with Amplified Wrath. The next major grandmaster, Perfect Inscriptions, revolves around signets, making their passive effects stronger while also granting light aura, an aura that grants the user retaliation and applies vulnerability to foes. Other parts of this tree work around retaliation, specifically Retribution, a 10% damage increase while the Guardian has the Retaliation boon on them. This could possibly sync well with signets, but another trait in the same category, Wrath of Justice, fights for a spot. Wrath of Justice would activate the light aura from Perfect Inscriptions, but it becomes a choice of 10% damage vs more retaliation uptime and a possible immobilize. In my opinion, this choice shouldn't even have to be made. They would synergize more together, not cutting off choices that a Guardian could have. My solution to this would be merging the Adept Major trait Healer's Retribution with the Master Major Retribution, then moving Wrath of Justice to the empty Adept Major category. With this set up, a signet Guardian doesn't have to choose one over the other and instead gets the extra damage boost while getting that combo of Perfect Inscriptions and Wrath of Justice. This leaves an empty slot in the Master Major traits. The last Grandmaster Major is [Radiant Retaliation](URL This trait conflicts with others on multiple levels. Perfect Inscriptions already works with Retaliation, so it's a choice once again between more damage vs more retaliation. However, it also combats with Amplified Wrath. Why would you have retaliation scale with condition damage when you can just have your burning, your only damaging condition as a guardian, be more effective? RR is an already weak trait that fights both of the stronger ones in its line. I suggest removing it for something new and more useful. With an empty Master and an empty Grandmaster major, a new set of traits could be added. To have this work more with the play on Radiance (something bright) and with the critical chance increase that Right-Hand Strength and Radiant Power give, I am suggesting a focus on blindness and critical hits for two new traits. **New Master Major** -A Light in the Darkness - Gain increased critical hit chance against blinded foes. (10% increased critical hit chance.) Critically hitting a blinded foe applies vulnerability to them. (1 stack for 8 seconds, no ICD) **New Grandmaster Major** -Blinding Blast - Critically hitting a burning foe triggers a blast of light on the foe that deals damage in an area and applies blindness. (Damage: 133 (0.375). Radius: 240. Number of Targets: 5. Blindness: 3 seconds. 10 second ICD.) Blindness doesn't last long on enemies, so the effects of A Light in the Darkness won't be too pronounced, but can be timed with various combinations for increased damage spikes. For example, with Wrath of Justice, the blindness would be applied with the immobilize, leading to a bunch of increased critical hit chances to a stuck target's back. A greatsword's pull followed by a blinding leap could leave enemies spinning (from Whirling Wrath, of course.) The blindness from Blinding Blast wouldn't activate nearly as much as a Thief's, a Mesmer's, or a burning Elementalist's, but it adds to the idea of 'Radiance', blinding piercing light, and a more damaging playstyle, like the rest of the specialization. These two together with the Zeal specialization's [Binding Jeopardy](URL would lead to vulnerability application rivaling a Necromancer's, but would have to push into two offensive specializations, rewarding more risky playstyle. With this post, I hope to bring more light to the situation behind the organization of the Radiance core specialization. With these suggestions, I hope to bring a brighter future to the older specializations that might not see as much love as the elite specializations. Note that all puns were deliberate. **TL;DR** - Move Wrath of Justice from Major Master to Major Adept. - Consolidate the Major Adept Healer's Retribution into the Major Master Retribution. - Remove Radiant Retaliation. - Add new traits in the empty slots. **Suggested traits** *Major Master* - A Light in the Darkness - Increased critical chance to blinded foes. Critical hits on blinded foes apply vulnerability. *Major Grandmaster* - Blinding Blast - Critically hitting a burning foe triggers a blast of light on the foe that deals damage and applies blindness in an area.

The Bard's new weapon would be the Warhorn. The Bard's new Utility skill type would be Song. I thought about including shouts, but based on how these skills are more ""ongoing"", shouts didn't seem fitting enough. * Each song has an effect that pulses every 0.5 seconds for the duration of the song. * These songs interact with the Bard's new class feature: ""Chord"", which causes the next pulse of the song to intenstify in effect or add new attributes. * You may only have one Song active at once (save for a certain trait, we'll get to that later). * Activating a new song ends the current one immediately. * If you have no Song active, Chord has no effect. * Chord has an Instant cast and a 10 second cooldown. **Warhorn Skills** Note that due to heavily varying damage numbers in regards to might and tooltips, I will be ballparking the damage of these skills based on skills the Thief already has. **Warhorn 3, Dagger Mainhand**: *Lethal Performance* Prepare a devastating stab against your target. If it dies, play your horn in victory, giving all nearby allies multiple boons. Damage: ~Backstab from behind Initiative cost: 5 Cast time: 1 second. If target dies, allies gain Swiftness, 5 stacks of might, and Protection for 10 seconds. **Warhorn 3, Sword Mainhand**: *Counterpoint Assault*. Unleash a flurry of blows in front of you.

Take a quick shot at your target. If a bardic song is active, the target also loses a boon. * Damage: ~Vital Shotx2. * Combo Finisher: Physical Projectile * Initiative Cost: 3. * Cast time: 1/4 second. * Boons Removed: 1 **Warhorn 4**: *Fortissimo*. Let out a deafening note on your Warhorn, dealing damage around you and dazing enemies. Enemies that were already dazed are stunned instead. * Damage: ~Shadow Shot * Initiative Cost: 5 * Cast time: 1 second. * Number of targets: 5 * Daze duration: 1 second * Stun Duration: 1 second. * Radius: 400 **Warhorn 5**: *Dirge of Doom*. Let out a forboding note on your Warhorn, creating a wave in front of you that steals boons. If the target has no boons, apply vulnerability instead. * Damage: ~Vital Shot * Initiative Cost: 5 * Cast time: 3/4 second * Range: 900 * Radius: 350 * Number of targets: 5 * Boons stolen: 1 * If no boons, apply 3 stacks of Vulnerability for 5 seconds. **Utility Skills** **Healing**: *Soothing Performance*.

Song. Begin playing an Inspirational Hymn that provides Might to allies and freezes the current duration of allies' boons while active. * Duration: 5 seconds. * Cooldown: 30 seconds. * Radius: 400 * Allies' boons do not count down if affected by this spell in the last second. * Might Per Pulse: 1 stack, 5 seconds. *Chord*: Applies 5 seconds of Fury and 1 second of Quickness to allies, in addition to its other effects. **Utility 2**: *Force and Verve*. Song. Begin playing a march that damages nearby enemies. The damage increases for each enemy hit. * Duration: 5 seconds. * Cooldown: 30 seconds. * Radius: 400 * Deals ~Vital shot x 0.5 damage every pulse with 1 enemy affected. * Deals ~Vital shot x 1.5 damage every pulse with 5 enemies affected. * Damage for any number of enemies in between 1 and 5 scales linearly. * Number of targets: 5 *Chord*: Deals damage to nearby enemies and knocks them back based on how long the bardic song has been maintained. * Radius: 400 * Damage: ~Cloak and Dagger if done instantly, * ~Backstab's high damage if done after 5 seconds of playing. * Knockback: 200 distance if done instantly, 400 if done after 5 seconds of playing, * Number of targets: 5 **Utility 3**: *Countersong*. Song. Begin playing an obnoxious tune that dazes enemies that attempt to use skills. Enemies cannot be dazed by this ability more than once every 2.0 seconds. * Duration: 5 seconds. * Cooldown: 30 seconds. * Radius: 400 * On skill use, the user is dazed for 0.5 seconds. if affected by this song in the last second. *Chord*: Daze and torment all nearby enemies. The effect is intensified if they were using a skill when hit by this ability. * Daze: 1 second, 2 seconds if interrupted. * Confusion: 4 stacks for 10 seconds, 8 stacks if interrupted. * Radius: 400. **Utility 4**: *Heroic Jaunt*. Song. Begin playing a heroic tune that copies any boons allies gain onto yourself. Maximum of one boon copied this way every pulse. * Duration: 5 seconds. * Cooldown: 30 seconds. * Radius: 400 * Whenever another player within range gains a boon, you gain that same boon. *Chord*: Break stuns and apply Protection and Stability to nearby allies. * Protection: 5 seconds. * Stability: 2 stacks, 5 seconds. * Breaks Stuns on yourself an any affected allies. * Number of targets: 5 **Elite**: *Glorious Finale*. Song. Convert random boons on your allies into more potent versions of said boons. Boons revert to their normal forms 3 seconds after being transformed this way. (Therefore, if an ally is within range for the entirety of this song, they'll have 5.5 seconds of super boons.) * Duration: 2.5 seconds. * Cooldown: 120 seconds. * Boons converted per pulse: 1 * Number of targets: 5 * Might -&gt; Legendary Might (Double the normal effectiveness) * Fury -&gt; Heroism (40% increased critical chance) * Aegis -&gt; Riposte (blocks and reflects the next attack.) * Protection -&gt; Stalwart (66% reduced damage taken) * Quickness -&gt; Dextrousness (Skills and actions are 100% faster) * Regeneration -&gt; Rejuvenation (Twice as effective) * Resistance -&gt; Absorption (Conditions on you are ineffective and one condition per second is converted to a boon) * Retaliation -&gt; Vengeance (Double the retaliation damage) * Stability -&gt; Defiant (Immune to such effects, does not have stacks.) * Swiftness -&gt; Superspeed (As implemented in the game currently.) * Vigor -&gt; Potency (Endurance Regeneration increased by 100%) * Effects that trigger upon gaining a specific boon also trigger upon getting the upgraded version of each boon. E.g. Guardian's ""Retribution"", which increases damage you deal while under retribution, also works when you have Vengeance.) *Chord*: Convert all boons on yourself into more potent versions of said boons. Boons revert to their normal forms after 3 seconds. **Traits** Baseline trait 1: Musical Supremacy: Gain access to the Song skill category and the Warhorn weapon type. You gain the ability to strike a *Chord* on a Song you are currently playing. * Trait 1-1: Fancy Fingerwork: Every skill you use other than a Song or Chord reduces the cooldown of all Songs by 1 second. * Trait 1-2: Marcato: After using *Chord*, your next attack is a guaranteed critical hit. * Trait 1-3: Upbeat Performance: Whenever you play a *Chord*, gain 2 initiative.

296,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"Druid SPvP bunker build, for those looking",8,3qn7l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3qn7l4/druid_spvp_bunker_build_for_those_looking/,2015-10-29 12:27:40,"I've had good results running this in unranked pvp, and quite a few people asking me what my build was so I thought I'd share. It's a strong bunker build with good defensive capability, powerful heals, and multiple aoe dazes and other control. Holding out points against 2 or 3 people for minutes at a time, with still enough offensive pressure keep zerkers/marauders on their toes ;) **Weapons**: Staff/Staff **Amulet**: Clerics Feels like the best choice here, tried running minstrels but you lose a lot of the pressure that you can put on cappers by not having the power, and the boon duration is mostly wasted. **Runes/Sigils**: Rune of Earth / Double Sigils of Energy &amp; Hydromancy Im definately open to suggestions on these ones, been trying a few different runes and quite like Earth but i think there are probably still better options. I like having Hydromancy for the chill to go with the daze that you get on staff swap, and Energy works great. **Slot Skills**: Healing Spring, Signet of Stone, Glyph of Equality, Glyph of the Tides, Glyph of Unity Healing Spring: Seemed like the logical choice for a bunker build, decent initial heal as well as pulsing regen/condi cleanse on top of your point beats out the other options. Signet of Stone: Staple ranger choice here, good emergency button and has nice synergy with your elite as taking 0 damage from enemy attacks still causes Glyph of Unity to deal damage to linked enemies. Glyph of Equality: Amazing AoE 4 second daze with Moment of clarity, stops bad guys in their tracks and breaks stun to boot. Pretty self explanatory here, use it to interrupt stomps/heals/channels, or if theres just too much heat on you for a chance to get some of your own healing off. Glyph of the Tides: This one is potentially interchangeable but i like it a lot as another interrupt in big fights or to shove people off your point. A nice combo with this in astral form is to pull a bunch of enemies into a Natural Convergence. Glyph of Unity: I was slow to warm to this over entangle, but the amount of kickback to attackers this can do when you have multiple people on you is great. Used at the right time this can put heavy pressure back onto your enemies, and when followed up with some well timed dazes can put down glassier builds surprisingly fast. Not to mention the extremely short cooldown means this will almost always be up when you need it, and allows it's use multiple times over drawn out fights. **Trait Lines**: Marksman, Nature Magic, Druid Marksman, DDU: This trait line is taken almost solely for Moment of Clarity. The amount of aoe daze you have available as druid can be pretty ridiculous and doubling the duration on them all is too good to pass up. It comes along with some passive vulnerability from opening strikes which is nice, as well as Clarion Bond for some buffs and another blast for your water fields. Predator's Onslaught for a grand master really doesn't give us much, but the other two choices don't work at all with this build. Nature Magic, DUM: The first choice here is really up to you, Allies Aid in my opinion is the best choice. Take instinctive reaction if you want another 180 power or so, the quickness proc however to me always felt too sudden to make good use of. Evasive purity and Natures Ward provide excellent passive cleansing and survivability, I wouldn't really want to not run this line as a bunker. Druid, DMM: This is where everything comes together. Running double staff with Primal Echoes gives you an AoE 2 second daze every 10 seconds. Verdant Etching gives all your glyphs some nice cooldown reduction, an additional heal as well as cleansing 2 conditions. It should be noted that the seed planted is a light field, a quick pet swap or staff 3 into this for retaliation after a Glyph of Unity works great in unison for punishing attackers. Just using the staff 1 and 2 consistantly gives Lingering Light to yourself and your pet, and provides a constant stream of blinds that can mitigate a huge amount of damage. Not to mention some passive healing to yourself and your team. **Points of Interest** Your staff 3 Ancestral Grace is a godsend. A massive escape/gap close, evade, blast finisher and AoE heal all rolled into one, make good use of this! Flying in from max range into staff swap daze to cancel stomps feels great. And if yourself or your team need some more AoE healing, Ancestral Grace + pet swap for a double blast finisher inside either your Healing Spring or Staff 5 field can save lives if you dont have Celestial Avatar available. Keep in mind as well that Vine Surge on staff cleanses immob, chill and cripple from yourself and allies. This along with Ancestral Grace is invaluable for chasing/escaping/racing for a point. As for Celestial Avatar, a Natural Convergence on top of an enemy team can be incredibly disruptive, and and Lunar Impact with it's huge heal and AoE daze is invaluable while under pressure. Also if you are under heavy condition pressure make sure to spam Seeds of Life as it has almost no cooldown. I hope this guide helps out someone trying to run druid in pvp but maybe hasn't quite found something that works. Its lots of fun holding out points against multiple people while they try in vain to bring you down. Id love to hear any feedback too to try and improve this build :) EDIT: Something I forgot to mention, Glyph of Unity in Celestial Avatar mode can link you to NPCs such a lords or your boss in stronghold and lets you do an ungodly amount of healing to them, it can save you the game!"
297,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Instructional Tangled Depths Nuhoch Lane leading guide,5,3rofbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3rofbl/instructional_tangled_depths_nuhoch_lane_leading/,2015-11-06 08:06:20,"Hi, /r/Guildwars2! I go by the name Heiden in-game and I play Chronomancer, and I've been participating in Tangled Depths meta event for the past week or so. I'm not a hardcore player like some commanders who do meta events religiously, but I *grudgingly* led Ogre and Nuhoch lanes due to lack of direction in the beginning and I've grown to liking the meta event! As all of us participate in the meta event, I believe, along with certain others who lead the other lanes, that we're improving and slowly getting better at handling the event but I think it's crucial that more people know how the meta works. There already exists an [excellent guide for this meta event](URL so please read and make sure you know what to do. The reason why I'm writing here is to impart certain knowledge about the lane, to learn more, and to improve upon so eventually we could beat the meta event and Tangled Depths meta event becomes more manageable in the future. *This is mainly for those who lead the event* but I think every player who participate in the event should know certain things. Nuhoch lane requires finesse. **Things that leaders should do before the meta:** * Prepare for the meta early and gather people to instruct them how Nuhoch lane works and tell them what to do. Have at least 20 people on the lane and if you require more, ask. * Divide into two groups and spread them around. One to take the northern side and the other to take the southern side. 2 people on bigger mushroom platforms and 1 on the rest of the platforms. * Create a 5-man party to take care of chak waves. This group would participate in the stomping but as soon as chak waves start flooding toward the cannon, they have to jump in and kill all the chaks then go back to stomping. Place them near the bottom platforms so they have easier time jumping in and out. * Take time and visit each places for Nodule stomping. Nodules spawn on mushroom platforms that have **purple glow** surrounding them. If you compare Nodule spawning platforms and ordinary platforms, you'll see the difference quickly. Take the tour with the group beforehand and make sure they know. * When the meta starts, stomp the nodules and kill the sporelings. This will make nodules spawn quicker thus leading to more stomping. Tell players to stay put on their own platforms and not move around. **Just like other lanes, the meta event hinges on getting the bonus level as high as it can get. Higher the bonus level, more vulnerability and increased incoming damage the boss stacks ergo more DPS.** * Leave the boss when you have 30 seconds left (plus minus 5 second depending on DPS) on the clock and move down the lane toward the center. Make sure people are well-spread and prepare for stomping. * Provide the players with some nourishment items for DPS and speed. * Instruct and urge dead players to use **WAYPOINT** and run back. For players who have Nuhoch Wallows mastery unlocked (lvl 2), it's faster to start from Teku Nuhoch waypoint. Otherwise, Ley-Line Confluence Waypoint and run back as fast as possible. * Not failing the lane event prematurely is a huge deal. Give your players a pat on their shoulder and do a better job next time. If you have more insight on how to better lead the lane, and if I have a false information, please feel free to contribute."

299,vulnerability,Guildwars2,My take on a Scrapper build focused at reaching a balance between a hardy fighter that deals respectable damage.,4,3rqiee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3rqiee/my_take_on_a_scrapper_build_focused_at_reaching_a/,2015-11-06 17:56:28,"Hello! This is my first time posting here, and the first time sharing a build as well, so I'm rather nervous. Even since Scrapper was announced I wanted to use that opportunity to change my favorite class' build into something more suited for close-quarter damage and flamethrower-usage in PvE. Without delaying myself further, I present you my Scrapper build: *Armor*: *Soldier* stats, with *Rune of Rage*. Soldier will help you with some survavibility, and some of the toughness will be converted to power later on. Due to the build acquiring *fury* rather easily, you can really benefit from the Rune of Rage's +5% extra damage. *Trinkets*: Those I run with the *Berserker* stats, for extra damage and crit chance as usual. *Sigils*: I run the *Sigil of Accuracy* and the *Sigil of Cruelty*. The former to make crits more frequent of course, and the latter for raising the overall PvE damage. And now for the fun part - traits! *FIREARMS* *Sharptrooper* - *Bleeding on crit*. Considering how often the Flamethrower can crit, this will be some good extra damage. *Heavy Armor Exploit* - *Chance of Swiftness and Vulnerability on crit*. This will help greatly with your overall ability to move around while in combat while also dealing some *weakness* for extra damage while you benefit from several stacks of *Might*. *Hematic Focus* - More crit chance! *No Scope* - Even more crit chance? Yes please. *Serrated Steel* - Makes the bleeding's extra crit chance last longer. *Juggernaut* - Gain *Stability and up to 6 Might* while wielding the flamethrower, though with Scrapper traits this will be increased to *up to 12 Might passively*. *ALCHEMY* *Hidden Flask* - Pretty straightfoward, though all those boons Elixir B will grant will help by granting you some *damage reduction*. *Invigorating Speed* - Sweet sweet *vigor when swiftness is applied*, increasing your ability to dodge the dangerous attacks, which you'll need as you'll be deep into the fight often! Also is another way of stacking *damage reduction* *Transmute* - This is straightfoward, but just in case you missed any boons, this can also help you get even more *damage reduction*. *Backpack Regenerator* - While I do think that *Self-Regulating Defenses* is quite good, I've also found that it tends to proc when I don't want it to, especially when I have all my boons up. I tend to go with *Backpack Regenerator* instead for some minor healing which can help in extended fights - you'll be using the Flamethrower a lot! *Alchemical Tinctures* - Good old *condition purging*. If I'm not mistaken, with Elixir U, Elixir H and Elixir X and their throwables you'll be able to cleanse up to *6 conditions*, though in the case of Elixir U's toolbelt skill that's a bit unpratical - at least you can drop X's toolbelt close to yourself and still hit a few enemies. *Iron Blooded* - Our main defensive trait! Considering all the several boons we've been getting so far, this will grant quite a bit of *damage reduction*, around 10%, depending if you're stacking boons intensively or not. Between the constant Might, Stability, Swiftness and Fury you'll be getting, that number is nearly guaranteed not to drop bellow 8%, but that's without all the boons from Elixir B's passive proc, or the Vigor that other elixirs grant, not to mention their own boons. *SCRAPPER!* *Function Gyro* - Ranged reviving in PvE, quite useful! *Recovery Matrix* - This not only grants you *Protection* when you heal, it also contributes towards *Iron Blooded*. *Decisive Renown* - Boons for allies when you revive/finish something. The Function Gyro will help you keep your hands busy on smacking while that happens! *Mass Momentum* - Now this is quite important. With this and *Juggernaut*, your *Might goes up to 12 stacks while you wield a Flamethrower*. Out of combat. That adds quite a bit of damage which you can benefit, especially if you manage swapping betweem hammer and flamethrower really well! *Impact Savant* - Increases the duration of Dazes and Stuns. You can triple-daze an enemy with your 5+3 Hammer combo, which is *quite good at breaking defiance as well*. The final choice comes to either *Perfectly Weighted* or *Adaptive Armor*. I run the former usually, for that 10% extra damage, but if you find yourself filling in for a more tanky role, then Adaptive Armor is more than fine. And now, our *Skills*. *Elixir H* - This will grant you *Vigor*, *Protection* and either more Protection, *Regeneration* or *Swiftness*, _and_ purge a *condition*. This will help with *Iron Blooded* quite a bit. *Bulwark Gyro* - Our tanky little friend! Just like dodging, this buddy gives you a short windows of qutie a lot of tankyness. Each 3 seconds, he applies a boon that makes him absorb *50% of the damage you recieve*, lasting for a total of 15 seconds! It's toolbelt skill is also quite significant, creating a large reflecting bubble around you for a few seconds, big enough to fit your party under. *Elixir U* - Quickness is _really_ dangerous when the Flamethrower hits and crits so often. With U, you'll be able to stack more than *one minute of Fury and Swiftness* if you hit multiple enemies close. It's toolbelt is quite useful as well, either making a blinding wall or a reflection one. Again, Quickness works with *Iron Blooded*. *Flamethrower* - A good DPS tool. While the Hammer is your weakness-applying single-target damage, the Flamethrower works wonders against multiple enemies in an area. Not only burning enemies take 10% more damage from it, but if you line up correctly and use the elixir U, all your enemies will soon be bleeding and burning and you'll have more swiftness and fury than you'll ever need to finish them off! *Elixir X* - Finally, a good amount of damage. Elixir X already hurts on it's on, but with all the boons you'll be getting it can work even better for yourself. The toolbelt skill also deals heavy damage to the Defiance bar! Okay, so a quick tl:dr of how the build works. It relies on Iron Blooded, Bulwark Gyro and several boons for tankyness , while still dealing some good damage due to the Berserker Trinkets, good Might stacking and bonus damage from traits, skills and the constant critting. I thank you for taking the time to read all of this, and I hope I've interested you into trying this out!"

URL Now that monsters in high fractals have such high toughness, it seems unlikely that non-condition builds will be used at all unless something is introduced to help their damage. Armor penetration probably wouldn't be overly hard to implement (attach it to vulnerability, give some skills innate armor penetration) and would greatly increase the damage done by power classes. It also wouldn't be overpowered in lower level content as the armor of monsters there doesn't make much of a difference."
302,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Since Necromancer gained some more crit chance modifiers with Reaper. Would a new stat spread of Power/Ferocity/Condition be usable if implemented.,3,3sbhdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3sbhdz/since_necromancer_gained_some_more_crit_chance/,2015-11-11 07:32:57,For a while now Necromancer had a trait that increased crit chance by 50% while in Death Shroud [[Death Perception](URL Not necessarily in PvE but mixing in Valkyrie/Cavalier stats has been something of note in DS builds. Since with fury it was easy to break over 100% crit chance and that extra precision was wasted when you were doing your biggest damage. Reaper now has a trait that increases its crit chance by 2% for each stack of vulnerability [[Decimate Defenses](URL So even when not in deathshroud it's can be very easy to break over 100% crit chance. Reaper is fairly decent at applying vulnerability and with Engineers becoming more prominent in the Meta. It shouldn't be hard for a party to maintain about 20 ish stacks of vuln with fury and a banner that's about 68% crit chance before you stack precision. So a Necro could potentially min max by swapping out some Berserker/Sinister pieces for a new stat line that's Power/Ferocity/Condition Damage. With either Power or Condi damage as main depending on which is implemented or is better. It would mean you had less wasted stats and instead of taking defensive gear you can ramp up your damage more with this newer stat line.

305,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Auramancer Tempest- Full Tank,33,3th3xd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3th3xd/auramancer_tempest_full_tank/,2015-11-20 06:58:08,"As much as I respect Wooden Potatoes build that people have been talking about it's not a tank build, it's a support build and Imbued Melodies is SIGNIFICANTLY better than Elemental Bastion. I've made this point across a LOT of posts already and was suggested to make a mini guide so here goes. Going forward with Traits first, what you actually want as a full tank is: Water 331, Earth 333, Tempest 321. Dagger and Warhorn as weapons. &gt; Please do note this is primarily a PVE build not necessarily for PVP or WVW but it does have aspects and combos you may want to look up. **WATER** * *Stop, Drop, and Roll*: Burning and Chill cleanses for free every 10 seconds on dodge. Can be substituted for *Piercing Shards* if the fights do not have burning or chill. Remember we haven't seen the rest of the wings yet so this may come in handy later. * *Aquamancer's Training* Damage boost if you're above 90% HP, Recharge rate of Water abilities is the big reason we want this. *Cleansing Wave* isn't a bad substitute but it shouldn't really be your concern because of the next trait. *Soothing Disruption* will not be used because you aren't looking to run Cantrips * *Cleansing Water* Alone it's pretty lack luster but it's the synergy it provides with the Tempest traits and Aura's themselves that make this important. Can be substituted for *Powerful Auras* (More on that later) or *Soothing Power* depending on the fight. *Soothing Power* is good for fights that you don't have to cleanse or reflect a vast amount and is just your general healing booster. **EARTH** * *Elemental Shielding*: This trait is the entire reason we're in Earth. Never subbing this out. * *Geomancer's Training*: The faster recovery is really nice and combining with Water's *Stop, Drop, and Roll*, you allow yourself to only use *Stop, Drop, and Roll* for burning cleanses which is a factor of consistency. The key thing that we want from this trait is actually the reduced recharge on Earth skills. More on this later. * *Stone Heart*: You want this trait if you're tanking because you're going to be attuned to earth most of the time and if you're tanking, you really want to be able to predict how much damage you're taking. A random critical hit can end your run or life if you're not careful. This CAN be substituted for Diamond Skin against single target condition damage bosses (ie: Their damage is primarily conditions and the conditions are only focused on you). **TEMPEST** * *Unstable Conduit*: Aura's are the name of the game. * *Invigorating Torrents*: This is key for keeping yourself topped off and since *Cleansing Waters* doesn't have an ICD, every time you have an aura applied to you, you get a condition removed which is good for bosses that do primarily power damage with some conditions thrown in. This is useful because of the next trait. * *Imbued Melodies*: Hands down, the better Aura applicator. Internal cooldown of 10 seconds rather than 30. Proc's on HP sub 90% instead of 75%, Counts as a blast finisher, applies Magnetic Aura to yourself; protection to 5 members of your group WITHOUT being forced to take Powerful Aura's to force the Aura on them, increases the duration of boons already applied to the 5 targets in range. You're not getting the burst heal from Elemental Bastion or the -10% incoming damage (which by the way doesn't affect condition damage) but you can get PERMANENT Magnetic Aura and PERMANENT protection for 5 players. As most conditions are applied from range, you effectively protect your allies from conditions with cleanses and Magnetic Aura and protect your allies from power damage with 40% damage reduction from Protection while giving them the ability to dodge out of condition fields or bigger power attacks with the vigor granting and giving them some regeneration if they were hit by any collateral damage in the first place. **PERMANENT MAGNETIC AURA AND PROTECTION** Imbued Melodies trigger has an ICD of 10 seconds. Aura's (with exception to Frost Aura) last 5 seconds. As a tank, you want to be in Earth to raise your toughness to make it easier to grab agro and because your gear stats aren't going to be focused on Power, you want to be in Earth for it's condition damage abilities. So, while you're in earth, as soon as you see the first Imbued Melodies trigger, you get 5 seconds of Magnetic Aura (MA from now on). As MA wears off, you can manually pop Sand Squall from Earth Warhorn 4 (denoted as SS from now on) granting yet another 5 seconds of MA. Guess what? The Imbued Melodies (hence for IM) ICD is done and you can trigger it again as long as you're taking damage sub 90%. So now IM triggers again and you get ANOTHER 5 seconds of MA. By now you've been in Earth long enough for Overload Earth to be used and it should be used about 1 second for human reaction time after the last IM trigger. &gt; *There is either a bug or an incorrect tooltip as when you hover Imbued Melodies there's is the internal cooldown as well as the Sand Squall ability's cooldown. In all other cases of spells on auto cast (ie: From the Reaper/Necro's Curses tree, Plague Sending, the cooldown is based on the cooldown of the spell and the traits have no ICD. It appears from some testing that it's using the skill's CD rather than the ICD but that doesn't really make sense as to why IM would have it's own separate ICD then. Hence it's either a bug or a very poorly designed tool tip. If it is supposed to use the skill's CD, then Geomancer's Training is even more important and you go from 100% MA uptime to 75% uptime unless you're running Superior Rune of Radiance which increases Aura duration by 33%* Overload Earth (OLE) naturally grants 3 stacks of Stability on activation meaning you're next to guaranteed to get the channel off. It is also a Blast finisher which is important for very much later. *Unstable Conduit* turns that overload into an MA applicator. That's yet another 5 seconds of MA that will last you long enough until IM's ICD is up again which means you get IM to trigger once again and another 5 seconds of MA. So to recap, SS on cast gave you 5s, IM gave you another 5s, OLE gave you another 5s, IM gave you another 5s all linked together. Now you've spent 20 seconds with MA on. Guess what's off CD now? As a result of Geomancer's Training, SS is off CD. What's the CD for OLE? Same thing. 20 seconds. So you can chain together IM, OLE, IM, SS to obtain permanent magnetic aura for yourself AND since 3/4 of those are SS activations whether manual or auto trigger, 5 of your allies get Protection (3*boon duration+2)*3 which you ideally want to reach 7 seconds and is doable with *Imbued Melodies*, Cactus Candy Cornbread and Rune of Durability (see Runes Section); Want 100% uptime for your allies? Then and only then do you run *Powerful Aura* to spread the *Unstable Conduit* aura off OLE, there's a with 100% up time of MA AND with Elemental Shielding, 3x3 seconds of protection+2x3 seconds of extended boon duration because of SS+2x3 seconds of protection as a result of SS's base ability. That's 21 seconds of protection where you can repeat the loop in 20 seconds that doesn't require boon duration increase. Now protection is the shortest duration boon compared to all the goodies you get from *Invigorating Torrents*. The entire time while you grant auras with the *Powerful Auras* trait, you provide Regeneration and Vigor as well; meaning every 5 seconds, because of *Cleansing Waters* you are cleansing a group of 5 people of one condition. All this is done with ONLY traits and Warhorn weapon skills. So investigating Heal, Utility, Elite and Dagger skills.... **HEAL, UTILITY, ELITE** &gt; Healing * *Arcane Brilliance*: Blast finisher is the important part of this skill. **mandatory** &gt; Utlity * *Aftershock!*: More magnetic aura that's applied in a group, cripple which is useful as CC, Immobilize which is again useful as CC, some damage aspects, Blast finisher. **mandatory** * *Glyph of Storms*: All around a really good skill considering you're spending most of your time in Earth and maybe Water. Sandstorm: Blind &amp; Bleed. Blind is great for damage mitigation and acts as a CC to help you with break bars. Bleeds are important because again, you want condition damage as a full tank because it's not affected by armor. In Water it's primarily used for CC. In Air, even though you have Overload Air already, you can still get some mileage out of the flat damage and vulnerability. In Fire, the decent condition damage. Primarily you're wanting to play in Earth or Water though. * *Flash-Freeze*: This is for emergency power damage reduction so if you know a boss has a phase that does heavy damage, this is where you'd use Flash-Freeze for that extra 10% of damage mitigation. * *Arcane Wave*: Blast finisher. That's pretty much the extent of usefulness of this skill. Not recommended but if you find you need more Blast finishers it's not terrible. * *Lightning Flash*: Mobility while channeling, Mobility to get to circles. This skill is indispensable and is an absolute must. **mandatory** &gt; Elite * *Firey Greatsword*: Apply some condition damage and give yourself some power and an allies damage if they choose to pick up the second one. Specifically during phases that the boss you're fighting has had it's bar broken. * *Rebound!*: An aura applicator and a panic button. The reason for taking so many blast finishers is that they can hold value outside of just Area Healing combos. Say you've stunned the boss, now your blast finishers can be used on your Fire fields instead of Water field (combo is Attune Fire, Wildfire, Arcane Brilliance, Aftershock, HeatSync, Attune Water, Frozen burst, Attune Air for power damage.) Speaking of Blast finishers, a reminder that if your allies put a Fire field under you while you're in Earth and chaining SS's and IM's, you're still getting might because those trigger blast finishers as well. **BURST HEAL COMBO** The build uses Regeneration as a method to keep everyone topped off but if say something really big happened and your group is now all sub 50% HP, you still have the ability to pull off some burst healing. What's important to note is when to use it. The only time you want to swap is if you've JUST finished OLE. Now you have 5 seconds from the OLE, 5 seconds from the IM trigger, 5 seconds from Aftershock, 5 seconds from the second IM trigger to do what you want before you need to swap back into Earth for the next Sand Squall. So, as soon as you finish OLE, swap out of Earth into Water for your burst healing, you get Water's *Healing Ripple* trait for some flat healing. Then you cast Warhorn Water 5 *Water Globe* which creates a Water Field that does flat healing. Walking with it, *Arcane Brilliance*, *Aftershock!* and *Frozen Burst* for 3 blast finishers and Area Healing take effect. Note that you also get access to *Tidal Surge* which is yet more flat healing and more regeneration application. So to chaining this back to the Permanent MA and Protection, After OLE (Earth on CD 20): Attune Water, Cone of Cold, Tidal Surge IM triggers (Earth on CD 15): Overload Water (Earth on CD 10) As Overload Water ends, Water Globe, Aftershock!, Arcane Brilliance, Frozen Blast (this duration you have Frost Aura and Magentic Aura active) IM triggers (Earth on CD 5): As Earth comes back off CD, instantly swap and pop SS. You can now rotate into a double overload before Aftershock! will be available again for another burst heal rotation. Remember that if you took *Soothing Power* from the water tree, you're giving even more passive healing just from the swap. **CONTROL COMBO** This particular combo is meant for use as a precursor to the Burst Heal combo if you don't need the huge burst heal combo immediately. From Earth after the OLE, *Magnetic Grasp* to immobilize/extend the immobilize from OLE, Attune Air, cast Cyclone walking backward &amp; Lightning Orb, As you're moving Forwards attune Water and cast Tidal Surge. The root gives you time to line up the Cyclone, Cyclone is aimed to hit your target as the immobilize wears off to bring it back to where you shot the Lightning Orb and as you walk forward to Tidal Surge, Tidal Surge will push your target back a little to gain more time for Lightning Orb to hit it. **RUNE AND SYNERGIES** * *Of Durability*: Probably my favourite rune right now. Vitality, Toughness, +25% boon duration (the tooltips on the rune are bugged, stat window shows +25%) * *Of Water*: A fine choice if facing off against a high Condition damage based boss. Also adds to burst healing combo because of the 6th tier effect * *Of the Monk*: A good choice for facing off against high Power damage based bosses. Works best with *Soothing Power* as the selected water trait. I suggest Minstrel, Nomads for this full tank style. For some added damage you could go with Cleric's or Apothycary but you really want a high HP pool via Vitality, you want high Toughness to maintain aggro, and high Healing power to heal you and allies with the Regeneration and blast finisher heals. Minstrel is good as well because you can extend boon duration even longer in the event you miss a trigger. **EDIT**: You can use WHATEVER you want for stat'd equipment. I primarily wanted to highlight the strength of Warhorn, Tempest Auramancer and Imbued Melodies over Elemental Bastion. I additionally want to note that this is strictly a full tank PVE build. It is NOT what I personally run. I personally run a variant but use Air121 instead of Water and Marauder's. I just didn't feel like going over every single iteration because I swap traits a LOT depending on what I'm doing and the Earth/Water/Tempest covered the most situations as well as reference the build that advocated Elemental Bastion **EDIT 2**: Updated information on SS; Also noted where there may be a bug between ANet or tooltip."

Do they have a flat base damage that scales with weapon damage only? Do they scale off Power stat at all? What about Ferocity? I've been fiddling around on my mesmer/chronomancer and came across a pretty neat combo/set of tricks involving Continuum Split/Rift. Staff+ Scepter/Torch. Staff+Scepter Torch is important for timing because of cast time. Inspired by /u/l4in. Running the trait trees: * **Domination**: Rending Shatter, Blurred Inscription or Shattered Concentration, and Mental Anguish * **Illusions**: Persistence of Memory, Maim the Disillusioned, Master of Fragmentation * **Chronomancer**: Time catches up, Illusionary Reversion, Chronophantasma With utility skills: Phantasmal Disenchanter, Signet of Illusions and Mimic. Elite: Time Warp The concept (for large HP pool enemies) is to use the Continuum Split/Rift the entire kit as a synergy for performing 6 consecutive sets of shatters. I DO believe that the best way to do this is under the effects of Quickness though. Here's what I've been doing for the combo. **EDIT**: Removed whole combo because of length; please check this spreadsheet URL for specific time line and calculations of why this works Cry of Frustration cripples making your target easier to hit in combination with Time Catches Up granting your illusions super speed to close the gap. Diversion with the Domination tree if you manage to use it as an interrupt(s) is 25 stacks of vulnerability. Basically you summon Phantasms that will be re-summoned due to Chronophantasma off sync, it doesn't matter if they're dazed because daze doesn't stop movement so chaining shatters with a continuum split lasting 6 seconds, you have the ability to pop mimic, signet of illusions twice to get another 2 rounds of shatters off before everything gets reset again for another 3 rounds of shatters. There's a LOT of confusion and torment applied as well due to the Illusions traits **EDIT 2**: Updated Combo spreadsheet to /u/L4in's method which is easier to pull off."
308,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[Suggestion]Elite specialization: Spellslinger,0,3mopv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3mopv8/suggestionelite_specialization_spellslinger/,2015-09-28 21:04:16,"Note: This a work in progress. Any suggestions and constructive criticisms are welcome. TL;DR **Profession**: Elementalist **Weapon**: MH Pistol (range: 900) **Utility Skill Type**: Mantras **Changed mechanic 1**: Combining attunements **Changed mechanic 2**: F5 combo field **Theme**: Mixer of elements. **Role**: Combo master. Changed Mechanic Changing to an attunement once changes your first 3 weapon skills to those of that attunement. Changing to that attunement again changes your last 2 weapon skills to those of that attunement. On attunement effects only happen when changing your first 3 weapon skills. Note: This means that if, for example, your first 3 weapon skills are fire attunement skills and your last 2 weapon skills are water attunement then Pyromancers training affects your first 3 weapon skills and Aquamancers training affects your last 2 weapon skills. However, Soothing Mist only applies when your first 3 weapon skills are attuned to water attunement, a trait like Arcane Abatement uses the attunement of your first 3 weapon skills and a trait like Healing Ripple only activates when attuning your first 3 weapon skills to water. Traits *Minor traits* **Adept**: You can equip a pistol in your main-hand and use spellslinger mantras. You gain the ability to use two different attunements at the same time. **Master**: You gain an f5 spell. The effect of f5 depends on the two attunements you currently have. It is only available when using two different attunements (i.e. when not using fire + fire or earth + earth). Range: 1200. Radius: 240. Recharge time: ? o Smoke Field: Fire + Water or Water + Fire o Lightning Field: Fire + Air or Air + Fire o Fire Field: Fire + Earth or Earth + Fire o Ice Field: Water + Air or Air + Water o Water Field: Water + Earth or Earth + Water o Poison Field: Air + Earth or Earth + Air **Grandmaster**: You deal 10% more damage while using two different attunements at the same time. *Adept major traits*: **Trait 1**: All your fields last 1 second longer. **Trait 2**: Critical hits made with your pistols autoattack have a chance of being blast finishers (chance: ?). Possibly an ICD? **Trait 3**: ? *Master major traits*: **Trait 4**: Using Prismatic shot while F5 is off cooldown will apply F5 to your target without casting time. F5 will then go on cooldown. **Trait 5**: All your fields have 60 more radius. **Trait 6**: When using a mantra, apply a 1 second field just before the spell hits. (water = water field, fire = fire field, earth = poison field, ice = ice field, air = lightning field, elements = ?) *Grandmaster major traits*: **Trait 7**: When using a combo finisher on an area with two or more fields, you execute two combos, instead of one. **Trait 8**: When executing a combo finisher on a combo field, F5s recharge time is reduced by x%. **Trait 9**: ?? Weapon Skills *Fire* **Skill 1**: This attack pierces. This attack burns every enemy it meets. 20% chance of being a projectile finisher. **Skill 2**: Fire a slow moving bullet towards your enemy. Surrounding this bullet is a small fire field (Radius: 120). When this bullet hits its target it explodes which counts as a blast finisher. *Water* **Skill 1**: This attack pierces. This attack applies regeneration to each ally it passes. 20% chance of being a projectile finisher. **Skill 2**: Fire a slow moving bullet towards your enemy. Surrounding this bullet is a small ice field (Radius: 120). When this bullet hits its target it explodes which counts as a blast finisher. *Air* **Skill 1**: This attack pierces. This attack applies vulnerability to every enemy it meets. 20% chance of being a projectile finisher. **Skill 2**: Fire a slow moving bullet towards your enemy. Surrounding this bullet is a small lightning field (Radius: 120). When this bullet hits its target it explodes which counts as a blast finisher. *Earth* **Skill 1**: This attack pierces. This attack applies bleeding and a short cripple to every enemy it meets. 20% chance of being a projectile finisher. **Skill 2**: Fire a slow moving bullet towards your enemy. Surrounding this bullet is a small poison field (Radius: 120). When this bullet hits its target it explodes which counts as a blast finisher. *Fire / Water / Air / Earth* **Skill 3**: Prismatic Shot (or prismatic bullet?). This attack treats you as being in all four attunements at the same time for the purpose of trait effects. This is a projectile finisher. Note 1: The recharge of this Prismatic Shot is shared across attunements i.e. it is not recharged when changing attunements and it is present no matter what attunement you are in. To compensate it has a relatively low cooldown time (and it can be affected by multiple xmancers trainings, see point 2). Note 2: The effect of Prismatic Shot means that traits like Pyromancers Training and Pyromancers Puissance apply to it, no matter what attunement you are in. This also means that if you have two trainings equipped (such as Pyromancers Training and Aeromancers training) both apply to it. Arcane Precision would have 33% to apply each of the four conditions, however the chance of each condition would be separate. *Utility Skills* **Healing skill**: Mantra of Water: Meditate, charging a spell that will heal you when activated and leap you to target area where you apply AOE regeneration. Leap Finisher. **Utility skill 1**: Mantra of Fire: Meditate, charging a spell that will ?. Blast Finisher. **Utility skill 2**: Mantra of Earth: Meditate, charging a spell that will ?. Leap Finisher. Breaks Stun (?). **Utility skill 3**: Mantra of Ice: Meditate, charging a spell that will fire a spear of ice to an enemy. Projectile Finisher. **Utility skill 4**: Mantra of Air: Meditate, charging a spell that will ?. Whirl Finisher. Breaks Stun (?). **Elite skill**: Mantra of Elements: Meditate, charging a spell that will cause an elemental storm at target area. Blast Finisher. Projectile Finisher. Whirl Finisher. Note: These mantras function the same as mesmer mentras i.e. they have a long initial activation time. After that, it changes to a different spell which can be used twice with instant activation."

Is there a tool available for that? As well, the build I'm working on could use a little help. I'm a tad stuck on the specializations to take and some of the utilities, but here's what I have so far. URL The goal of the build is to keep up constant vulnerability (About 25 stacks of it with constant shatterstones and crits on auto) while dealing out solid damage in water attunement, with Soothing Power constantly keeping my health in check. With the healing power bonuses, the heal skill will pump about 9k worth of healing into me with 30 seconds of regeneration in the event that I get caught out. Any advice on how to better bolster this would be extremely helpful! EDIT: Added a GW2skills link. My bad."

I understand that new professions greatly impacted pvp meta but I have a feeling people are glossing over pve implications, mostly because everyone is too busy celebrating buffs and new builds for their main classes. Our guild ran few ""normal"" dungeon runs using elite specializations, namely chronomancers, druids, reapers and tempests and I have to say... I've never had an easier run. Practically nobody even gets downed, you can pull everything and burst it down in a matter of seconds with very long and easily applied quickness, constant 25 might / vulnerability stacks, healing / complete damage negation from druid and huge dps from reapers. I just don't see a way core-only builds will ever coexist with current elite specializations, the power increase is tremendous. I imagine they will be even better in higher level fractals, probably making it a new meta - except this time instead of the obligatory zerk gear, you'll have to own the expansion so you don't get booted. My questions: is that necessarily a bad thing? Would you accept the expansion if it meant that it brings a new power level to the game, making old builds obsolete? Or would you prefer a huge nerf to (most) elite specializations to bring them in line with core specializations? In case you don't care about dungeons (and by extent, fractals), do you think these will trivialize world bosses? Maybe people finally start clearing Triple Trouble just like Tequatl. Thoughts?"

Explanation - That's 6 seconds of lockdown right there. Lots of evasion, condition removal, weakness. Very high burst. I'm in staff 90% of the time, when I'm not targeted I dash out and unload. Interested to see what other builds come out of this. The rapid strike style of Daredevil really lends itself to vampire builds. The physical utility skills feel like awesome street-fighter combos. Just overall a lot of fun to play, thanks Anet :) --Other Tricks-- * Dash + Jump to strategic locations, like from window to mid in Kyhlo. * If the damage from Finishing Blow would've put someone into a downed state, it SKIPS downed and stomps them instantly. Try using it when your target is at 20%. * Fist Flurry / Staff Auto / Sundering Strikes can net close to 25 stacks of vulnerability * Really worth using some combination of Invigorating Precision / Signet of Malice / Assassin's Reward / Leeching Venoms. Combined with Staff 2 and dodge is great sustain. * Think of Bandit's Defense as Marth's Counter-Attack in smash bros."
315,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Revenant WvW roaming video + BWE3 feedback on Revenant,22,3nzf76,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3nzf76/revenant_wvw_roaming_video_bwe3_feedback_on/,2015-10-09 02:39:13,"Hey everyone, I'm hoping some of you guys still remember me from my previous posts similar to this one, giving detailed feedback on the revenant, accompanied by revenant WvW and PvP videos. I will be writing in depth feedback on the revenant again so prepare yourself for a wall of text. If you just want to watch the video: here it is: URL I spent quite a lot of time on the revenant this time, and this time it felt quite similar to what it was in the previous beta weekend, apart from the condition and celestial build, but more about that later. Ill start by systematically going through each legend, traits included, followed by the assorted weapon(s). ___________________________________________________________________________________________ Starting off with Mallyx. Mallyx used to be my favorite legend since the first testing weekend. The corruption line seems to still be in a good place, as it offers an interesting mix of traits, and this hasnt changed that much since the first beta weekend. Mallyx used to be one of the most thematically fitting legends with a distinctive high risk reward principle, but the recent changes made Mallyx feel like something way more bland and way less unique as a class to play. The healing skill used to be able to heal for 10k if you played aggressively, but now they just increased to base heal and decreased the additional healing for each condition on you, it was made less interesting to play with. Dont get me wrong though, the changes to the displacement of Unyielding Anguish were needed, because the displace mechanic messed up a lot of stuff, and the mechanic was quite broken, but when they changed this skill, they nerfed it in its torment application too. It used to be able to apply 6 stacks of torment in the first hit (if you had 3 conditions on you) but now, even if someone stands in it for the entire duration, theyll only have 5 torment, thats not how its supposed to work, is it? Banish enchantment had its confusion application normalized, which made it feel like there is even less play to it, and this weakens your burst skill. The changes to the elite are sad, using a 7 energy upkeep skill to pulse torment is just not worth it, the only reason you would activate it would be to proc on elite traits and runes, or to get it for the stat increase, which is more important for power builds. The elite was what made Mallyx this iconic, and its sad to see it in its current state. Mace and axe feel quite good, but while all weapons got access to new evades during their mist skills, mace and axe feel a bit left out as they get no evades or anything, but this might not be a bad thing as theyre certainly not weak in their current state. The removal of the significant defensive part on Unyielding Anguish made you a vulnerable target that has no way to escape focus, or to stall, which is also an issue now when playing Mallyx. tl;dr The reworked Mallyx feels undertuned and makes the condi builds feel weak compared to the power builds. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ Lets look at Jalis now: Jalis feels like its in the spot it should be in, the legend offers good party wide damage mitigation through the Elite, and the taunt is a bit more spammable now. The Jalis legend feels like a solid choice, but it gets outshined by other legends that are more vital in many builds, in short, glint feels like a better version of Jalis, offering aoe protection uptime, aoe swiftness, aoe boon duration and even some might for damage. . If you can however make good use of the party wide damage reduction, I can see this getting picked up by lots of people in raids for example. The trait line is extremely strong, giving access to lots of damage reduction, healing, stability, extra endurance and even protection. This trait line makes you feel quite tanky even if youre running berserker builds, and this is what makes revenant feel too strong in my opinion, combined with the protection and heal overload in Glint, in some instances in my video I manage to survive against 4+ people running a zerker build, this feels wrong. The grandmasters are a bit weak, but the other traits are extremely strong. On to hammer: Im loving the hammer, although the damage is quite easily avoided in theory, youll find that the low cooldowns make it impossible for enemies to avoid everything, it even offers good evade uptime with the Phase Smash. Staff might compete with hammer if youre aiming for 1v1s, but if youre planning on doing outnumbered stuff in WvW, the hammer feels like the superior pick. The damage is top notch and might be a bit too high on the coalescence of ruin (hammer 2 skill), whereas the other feel way weaker in terms of raw damage. tl;dr Jalis as a legend feels okay, the trait line feels too strong, and the hammer feels great, but might be a bit too strong on the damage side. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ Lets discuss Ventari now. I have tried to run a clerics revenant again in some instances, and the healing was quite but you ran out of energy really quick, offering heals in short bursts when you had energy again, or offering no heals if you wanted to upkeep the projectile deflect, but you were quite vulnerable while you were in Ventari, as you didnt have any stunbreaks or a reliable way to avoid taking damage, you also dont really get a second heal like the other legends would offer, but your second heal just becomes summoning a tablet which made Ventari feel not useful enough if people found out you were actually quite vulnerable while healing others. The trait line that accompanies Ventari is in a healthy place, offering lots of modifiers you really need, but this line is only worth taking if youre running a healing oriented build, it doesnt feel like this trait line can be used without picking up the actual legend or weapons like the other trait lines can. which is rather sad, but at least its not bad at doing what its supposed to do. The staff is a good weapon and it feels like its a great swap, because of the great damage on the fifth skill, and the reliable block, the autoattacks felt a bit weak compared to hammer and sword, but the rest of the skillset makes up for that. The block is great, the heal and condi cleanse is very helpful as revenant is very weak to conditions (if you decide not to be immune against them by speccing Mallyx) A solid option as a weapon swap, a weapon to pick up as your secondary weapon. tl;dr Cleric's rev feels a bit lackluster, the trait line is okay, and staff is definitely a solid and balanced pick now. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ Time for Shiro! Shiro is the most vital legend if youre running around in world versus world because of the mobility that is indispensable for running around in world versus world, and the stunbreak that saved my life more often than I would like to admit. Every single skill is excellent in this legend, but while riposting shadows is not that much of a balance offender, phase traversal is. This now offers a 1200 range shadowstep without a cooldown as long as there is something you can target. I think the energy cost and the range of the skill were balanced based on the way it worked before it was changed to work like infiltrator signet, so, while it is fun to be literally uncatchable and being able to go from the mid point to the home point in PvP in a second, this is not balanced. And I feel like either the energy cost should be increased, and/or the range should be reduced. There is absolutely no need for tactical gameplay if you can get from home point to Mid in seconds, I was in fact very surprised to see it in this overpowered state again in this beta weekend. The healing skill is still in a controversial spot, but I think this skill too is borderline overpowered, the initial heal is low, but the total heal is quite good, but more importantly, this heal does about 5300 additional damage, giving you access to crazy burst when you use that skill. This heal is the only thing that makes you able to burst really hard. I still like the trait line, its well balanced and I like the lifesteal and vulnerability idea, it is strong, but the lifesteal idea is a nice way to sustain yourself. Revenant sword feels like the main damage weapon for power oriented builds, the precision strike even feels very useful. The autoattack chain still suffers from the setback that its got a blockable projectile in its chain, which makes you unable to progress your autoattack if someone decides to stand in a Ventari tablet deflect for example, or when someone is getting ressed up by a guardian. I would therefore suggest to make this part of the chain unblockable so you can actually cycle through it in these situation. Unrelenting assault still felt too strong in 1v1s, the cooldown got upped, but I feel like it would not be too big of a nerf to get rid of the might generation on that skill, as it really does everything in its current state. Offhand sword is one of the better offhand options, but there is almost no situation in which you would get a sword instead of a shield. Shield offers lots of sustain combined with blocks. Sword 5 is not reliable, so you just feel like youre just wasting energy if you use that skill quite often, the concept for the sword 5 skill is nice though. tl;dr Shiro's got way too much mobility, the heal might be too strong, sword is the bread and butter of power builds, and it feels nice. Sword offhand feels like a lesser version of shield. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ Time for invocation. This trait line is focused on fury, which is not a bad theme, but it doesnt benefit conditions nearly as much as it benefits direct damage which is a shame, a trait that would add condition duration during fury or anything that benefits conditions too would be nice, similar to the 150 condition damage trait during fury warriors get access too. The trait line offers a bit of everything, like on condition cleanse on a 10 second cooldown gated on your legend swap, and okay traits, it doesnt really stand out as much as it did when you needed it to make your legend swap instant. This feels good if youre running power builds, but it feels underwhelming on condition builds. And it really feels like condition and hybrid builds need some love to get to the same level as the power builds. Now, lets go on to herald. The facets were already really strong in the previous beta weekend, this has not really changed. The legend itself was very, very strong. It felt like one of the strongest legends (if not the strongest) even if you were alone, although all the boons get shared out to 5 people in range. The heal offered useful regeneration and a heal similar to defiant stance, turning all incoming damage (including condition damage) into healing. The skill was better than it was on paper, and was better than defiant stance for several reasons. The main one is the fact that it doesnt have a cast time, this is what made defiant stance useless and makes this viable. The other one is a less positive one though, the complete lack of a tell when infuse light was on you. You can obviously see an orange glowing aura when a warrior uses endure pain, which tells everyone hitting him is useless during that time. But infuse light lacks this tell, all it has is some small blue-ish ray flowing into you at the start, but other than that, there was no way to tell if a revenant had that heal up except for the tool tip stating he had. so if people didnt have the revenant selected, they had no way of telling they were actually healing him. This could use some proper aura or a tell that is more obvious. The elite also has a quite peculiar issue, Ive gotten comments from some people telling me: the Herald is the true chronomancer, as it bends peoples frames. Every single time the glint elite was cast, the ground particle effect caused everyone to lose more than 20 fps. I guess the animation could be toned down a bit for people with animations on low? Shield was good, very good, now that the counterplay against the shield block is gone, this felt like a third healing skill on the revenant, rivaling the power of 30s healing cooldowns like shelter as it comes close to the amount of healing offered by shelter, and also offering a 4s block. Shield 4 was quite good, although its not that unique of a skill, it was a nice extra heal. The trait line had some good minor traits, and good adept traits, although hardening persistence seemed to be giving more stacks than you should be getting (I was getting 8 stacks where I should have only been getting 3. I think its quite striking that the protection on healing skill trait is still there which just pretty much made your glint heal worse (as the protection reduces the heal you get from the glint heal. I would therefore suggest changing it to granting a boon based on the legend you are in when using a healing skill, giving might/fury in Shiro and protection/retaliation in Jalis, this would make the trait good without changing the general concept. The shared empowerment seemed to be rather weak, but it was you only option if you were not playing in big groups so you were obliged to take it. The boon duration increase from soothing bastion also did not seem to work when I tried it out. All in all the most striking thing about the Glint legend was how it was hard to get rid of your energy. The upkeep costs were quite low, and the activations were free. So if you desperately needed the second part of the upkeep, you had no way to get rid of your energy. This just doesnt feel like it is as it is supposed to be. Other legends have an initial starting cost to start an upkeep which would not be out of place, giving the activations a cost would also not be surprising and even justified. Making it so the passive part has to be active for at least a second before being able to use the second part and not allowing doubletap might also help balancing it out. In general, herald makes the vanilla revenant feel weak, the herald trait line and facet of nature feels like the arcane specialization line for the elementalist, as invocation doesnt really fill that niche. It feels like revenant with boons where you would otherwise have none, it feels like nothing but an upgrade, even if you just get the specialization for the new facet of nature. The additional boon duration also helps greatly with the resistance uptime. Even for soloing, the boons from facet of nature seem to be your best option even though it shares those boons out to 5 people. tl;dr herald is a revenant with boons (so a superior revenant), heal skill is extremely strong because of the lack of a tell, herald also offers too much sustain. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ Some bugs I encountered were: - Mace 2 and hammer 2 not working on slopes. - The boon duration increase from soothing bastion did not seem to work when I tried it. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ This class went from pretty underpowered to over the top quite fast, being overpowered is not fun, there is no glory in winning. This is why I wont be asking for buffs from a PvP perspective. Its not like the whole revenant concept is too strong for WvW and PvP, but the sustain felt too good. I felt like I could out sustain about every build, while I still put out some good damage. Feel free to tell me what you think of the Revenant and my feedback, thanks! Thanks for reading this 'till the end. Cheers! General tl;dr: Revenant currently is overtuned, it's got too much ways to completely avoid taking damage and heal back up, the damage generally feels fair, apart from coalescence of ruin, permanent stability makes it difficult to play against. Condition revenant however feels weaker, lacking the same amount of sustain, lacking the Glint heal, and the evade uptime a power revenant has. Condition revenant is okay, but it feels undertuned compared to the power build."
316,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Tempest Elite Specialization - Opinions and Ideas,5,3oakb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3oakb3/tempest_elite_specialization_opinions_and_ideas/,2015-10-11 14:20:23,"Hey guys! With BWE3 being over, and with HoT coming out in just 13 days, I felt it was time to explain my opinions on the Elementalist's Elite Specialization - the Tempest. For anyone interested, I have mained Elementalist since launch and have played actively for that entire time. With that in mind, these opinions come from someone who really loves the class and really wants this specialization to blow him away (see what I did there :P ). To start off, I just want to say that Tempest as an Elite Specialization has come a long way. It went from a specialization that didn't excite me at all to the one that I am most looking forward to. This is due largely to ANet's continuous QoL they have been pouring into it, and I thank them for it. However, before the Tempest can be fully viable, I believe a few changes are in order. So here is my breakdown of every aspect and what I think needs to be looked at. ***** #Weapon# The warhorn was a weapon that at first I absolutely HATED the idea of. However, after playing with it it rapidly grew on me (though I do think the sounds NEED to be changed, as they should really sound like storms, lighting, etc.). As a front-line team support weapon, it gives great utility, both offensive and defensive, to your entire group. It also has great boon sharing and manipulation. In fact, of all the elements of the Tempest, the warhorn seems to me to be the best balanced. However, one thing that does need to be altered a bit is Water Globe. For the cooldown it has AND because you have to move with it to get healed, it really needs to heal for more. Either upping the heal over time, or making it a bit like the overload effect where it heals for a little and then explodes with a large heal. In its current state it is barely a noticeable heal, and since it only heals and provides no other function (unlike Tidal Surge, which also knocks enemies back), it needs to have more to it. ***** #Unique Mechanic# Overcharge in itself is a very cool idea. The idea of taking time to charge up attacks with big payoffs has always been a cool idea, and the feeling of successfully channeling one of them is very satisfying. When Tempest first came out these were very lackluster, but since then ANet has really been trying to make them more viable/useful. Have they succeeded? In my opinion, for the most part, yes. The buffs you give/get when charging the overloads are great and make sense thematically, and the utility they provide through stunbreaks can be life saving. However, the payoffs are not quite there yet. While water is great (with its condi clear and burst healing) and air is terrifying (with its enormous spike and AoE vulnerability), both earth and fire feel very WIP. As both of them are relatively small AoE fields, they are easy to avoid and don't even do that much if you don't avoid them. A way they could change this could be to up fire's damage or burning, and increase the size/duration of earth's AoE blinds. While this may be not quite the right solution, at least it makes them a bit more viable to cast. When I was playing as Tempest, the only time I ever overcharged fire or earth was for the channeling buffs, not for the final payoff. ***** #Utilities# Giving Elementalist shouts was a neat idea (at least I thought so), but there are a few things about them that still need to be ironed out. While *Flash-Freeze* and *Feel the Burn* both seem to be in a good place, *Eye of the Storm*, *Shock and Aftershock*, and *Rebound* need a bit more QoL. First off, *Shock and After Shock* - considering the lengthy cooldown (the highest of all the shouts), it needs to do more than just immobilize, cripple, reflect. The immobilize and cripple, while useful in some situations, are usually ignored by most enemies (especially in PvP), leaving its only real benefit being the aura. However, you already get a Magnetic Aura using *Sand Squall* on warhorn, and that skill has a 20 second LESS cooldown. Perhaps incorporate a longer aura, or maybe some protection into this? I don't know if either of these is a solution, but at least its a start. For *Eye of the Storm*, it really needs to give players a shocking aura. It makes sense too (as all the other shouts give auras), and it would make this more viable to run as an auramancer (seeing that we already pretty much have to run this in PvP due to our large lack of stun breaks). Unlike *Shock and Aftershock*, I really think an aura is all this skill needs, and other than that it works great. Finally, lets talk about *Rebound*. This skill seems to have gone through more changes than any other skill in any other specialization. Now completely different from what it originally was (and rightly so), it is in a much better place than where it used to be. However, it definitely needs a bit more work before it becomes very viable. For the 75 second cooldown, it NEEDS to heal more. Even in healing power builds, it rarely gets above 4k. And also, if it DOESN'T negate damage, it should do more than just give 5 seconds of an aura. It feels terrible to cast a skill with this cooldown, take TONS of damage and either 1) get healed for a minuscule amount that doesnt really save you (especially in pvp) or 2) don't take QUITE enough damage to kill you and so therefore all you get an aura that wont last any longer than any other aura you apply. Dont get me wrong, I love that auras are incorporated into this skill  as an auramancer, I appreciate them wherever I can get em. However, they NEED to be stronger than other auras, or it feels like you wasted the skill. Maybe boons AND auras? Longer auras? The solution probably isnt so simple, but there is no denying this skill still needs work. ***** #Traits# Last but not least, let's talk about traits. In general, the Tempest traits are pretty good. The potential aurmancing synergy is very strong, and very few of the traits feel completely useless. However, those few that do really need to be addressed. The two that seem to be the biggest offenders for me are *Harmonious Conduit* and *Tempestuous Aria*. *Harmonious Conduit* NEEDS to give more than just 1 stack of stability. 1 stack does nothing and can be broken through in a split second by almost any class (especially mesmers, engis, and warriors). It needs at least 3 stacks, or this trait is literally next to useless. The problem with *Tempestuous Aria* is that it needs to give more than just might and weakness. So many other classes do this better that you normally can't even tell if it did anything at all. I personally think this trait could be awesome if they made it so that it also dropped the cooldowns on shouts. Currently, there are no traits that do this (much to my theory-crafting chagrin), and this is a PERFECT place to do it. It would turn a weak trait into one that people would actually probably go for (especially if they are auramancers). ***** So, in summary, I think Tempest IS a really great elite specialization. It opens up support options that Elementalists previously never had available to them, while simultaneously not making the class itself more overpowered. I really want to run this specialization when HoT releases, and if these few problems were addressed I would be absolutely thrilled. If anyone at ANet reads this, you rock and thank you for all your hard work, and please take into consideration what I have said. And to everyone else reading, please let me know if you agree/disagree with my ideas, and add anything you think I didn't mention. #TempestFTW!"

There's always that Guardian spamming hammer auto in your Ele's Fire field and in most cases, that leads to an absolute waste of a good fire field. Group might is incredibly useful compared to blasting some retal. It'd be tough to beat out might in most cases, so I don't think improving the overall usefulness of Light Fields is the way to go. Instead, why not go into a niche use? I was thinking about the Commando profession (still waiting, Anet. Have the balls) and they had a skill called Flash Bang. That'd be how I would want my Light Fields: Blast: AoE blind + AoE reveal (360 radius or so?)

When I decided to take my Zerker Elementalist through the first few missions of the new HoT story quest line, I knew things would be more challenging but I didn&amp;#39;t realize _how it would be challenging_. *** **Why?** *** Combat mechanics are all pretty much the same as before, but now everything just flat out ***hits harder.*** You can still get by with a full Berserker setup, but from my experience in full Exotic gear with a few Ascended pieces, it&amp;#39;s pretty common for the new jungle enemies to hit you for half of your health if they get close. This gives us two options for how we want to approach combat in Maguuma: Keep the glass cannon build and spend a lot of time and effort focusing on kiting and dodging anything that gets into melee range, while avoiding large packs that can swarm and burst you down, ***OR*** sacrifice some DPS to switch to a slightly more tanky build. After dying once or twice to simple trash mobs as I ran around to waypoints and quest objectives, *I chose the latter.* *** *** ***TLDR -- [Click here](URL to see the build, or take a look at the image below:*** [URL *** *** After some careful deliberation I decided to go from my trusty _Fire-Lightning-Arcane_ build to a _Fire-Earth-Arcane_ one, focusing more on toughness and escapes than damage and crits. Things take longer to kill, but I don&amp;#39;t have to worry so much about dodging every heavy attack or carefully pulling one mob at a time. I&amp;#39;ll break it down for you in a wall of text: *** **Weapon: Staff** * * * Until you get the massive amount of Hero points you&amp;#39;ll need to unlock the full Tempest trait line, I believe the Staff is the best tool for PvE leveling and questing. It offers massive range, high AoE damage, solid utility and a lot of tools we need to stay alive. **Fire Attunement** -- This is where you&amp;#39;ll be doing most of your damage from 90% of the time. _**Fireball (1)**_ is a plain jane AoE missile, _**Lava Font (2)**_ is a ground-targeted AoE over time that generates a Combo Field Fire (more on this later), _**Flame Burst (3)**_ is an AoE that burns over time, _**Burning Retreat (4)**_ is a great escape/dodge with a little bit of damage, and _**Meteor Shower (5)**_ is a channeled AoE damage spell. You&amp;#39;ll also get a stack each of Might and Fury when you swap into Fire. **Water Attunement** -- You shouldn&amp;#39;t need to switch into Water too often, but when you do the important spells to note are _**Geyser (3)**_ and _**Healing Rain (5)**_. Both are ground-targeted area heals, Geyser being a short burst heal and Healing Rain being a heal-over-time while you stay in it. Swapping to Water also gives you a tiny heal over time, but don&amp;#39;t count on it to mean anything. **Air Attunement** -- This is your travel attunement, for the most part. Swapping to Air gives you 5 seconds of Swiftness, _**Windborne Speed (4)**_ gives a nice long 11 seconds of Swiftness, and _**Static Field (5)**_ stuns enemies while creating a Combo Field Lightning which you can use for more Swiftness (again, I&amp;#39;ll explain Combos shortly). **Earth Attunement** -- Your get out of jail free card. Swapping to Earth gives you 5.5 seconds of -33% less damage, and thanks to Specializations makes you immune to Crits until you swap out, and boosts your Toughness. Important spells are _**Eruption (2)**_, a slow burst damage/bleed Blast Finisher, _**Magnetic Aura (3)**_ will deflect projectiles for 5 seconds, _**Unsteady Ground (4)**_ which will create an impassable line for enemies for 3 seconds, and _**Shock Wave (5)**_, a .75 second channeled Projectile Finisher that bleeds and immobilizes targets. *** **Utility Skills** * * * For our utility skills, we have plenty of room to play, but the ones I chose are as follows: **Arcane Brilliance (6, Heal)** -- I like this heal because it&amp;#39;s a decent AoE burst heal that does a little bit of damage but more importantly, it&amp;#39;s a Blast Finisher. This synergizes well with some of our Combo Fields, explained below. You could swap this out for Glyph of Elemental Harmony or Signet of Restoration, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend Ether Renewal as it often takes way too long to be useful. **Signet of Air (7, Utility #1)** -- This slot can be pretty much whatever you want, I chose this one for passive movement speed, as well as a handy blind and stun-breaker in combat. In a map as large as the new Maguuma ones, being able to get from point to point quickly is neat. **Arcane Wave (8, Utility #2)** -- Of all the utility spells, this is the one I recommend most for this build. Like the Heal it&amp;#39;s a Blast Finisher, and it also does respectable AoE damage from range. **Signet of Earth (9, Utility #3)** -- Passive toughness, as well as a bleed/immobilize on activate. This could easily be swapped for _**Mist Form**_ for moving through enemies safely, or _**Lightning Flash**_ as an additional damage source/small teleport, or even _**Conjure Frost Bow**_ for damage or _**Arcane Power**_ for crit power. There are so many great choices, and really whatever you pick should be fine. **Glyph of Elementals (0, Elite)** -- Really the only decent Elite for this build, it&amp;#39;s a decent DPS increase and an off-tank if you&amp;#39;re getting pressure from several enemies. I typically just use it in Fire form as pure DPS, but you can also pop it in Earth attunement for a sturdier tank or in Water as a pocket healer. *** **Specializations** * * * **Earth (1:3:3)** -- _**Stone Flesh**_ gives you passive toughness, _**Armor of Earth**_ is the best option in Tier 1, gives you a free Armor of Earth (Protection/Stability/stunbreak) when your health goes under 50%. _**Earthen Blast**_ damages and cripples enemies when you attune to Earth. _**Geomancer&amp;#39;s Training**_ in Tier 2 gives innate CC reduction and reduces cooldowns on Earth weapon skills by 33%. _**Geomancer&amp;#39;s Defense**_ reduces damage taken from close-range enemies, and _**Stone Heart**_ in Tier 3 makes you immune to critical hits while in Earth, though you could also use _**Written in Stone**_ to reduce the cooldown on your signets (and make passives permanent). **Fire (1:1:2)** -- _**Empowering Flame**_ gives you passive power, _**Burning Precision**_ in Tier 1 burns enemies when crit, though you could swap for _**Burning Fire**_ for passive condition removal. _**Sunspot**_ deals damage and gives you a damage shield when you attune to Fire. _**Pyromancer&amp;#39;s Training**_ in Tier 2 gives you a raw 10% damage increase and 33% less cooldowns on your Fire weapon skills. _**Burning Rage**_ deals more damage to burning enemies, and _**Pyromancer&amp;#39;s Puissance**_ gives you might for every skill you use in Fire attunement. **Arcane (1:2:1)** -- _**Arcane Fury**_ gives you Fury every time you swap attunements, _**Arcane Precision**_ in Tier 1 gives you a chance to apply conditions when you crit. _**Elemental Attunement**_ gives you a boon when you swap attunements, and _**Elemental Contingency**_ in Tier 2 gives you a boon when you&amp;#39;re hit (10 second cooldown). _**Elemental Enchantment**_ gives you longer boon duration and reduces attunement cooldowns, while _**Elemental Surge**_ in Tier 3 applies more conditions and gain Ferocity when you cast your (6) or (8) Arcane spells, though you could use _**Evasive Arcana**_ to cast an additional spell when you dodge. *** **Combos** * * * Combos in this build are as follows: **Fire Field / Blast** -- When you cast a Blast Finisher like your _**Arcane Brilliance (6)**_ or _**Arcane Wave (8)**_ skills in the Fire Fields from _**Lava Font**_ or _**Burning Retreat**_, you get 3 stacks of might, very helpful for quickly ramping up damage in long fights. **Water Field / Blast** -- Blast Finishers in the Water Fields from your healing spells _**Geyser (3)**_ and _**Healing Rain (5)**_ give you an additional burst heal, making this a great way to supplement your healing from water where needed. **Static Field / Blast** -- Blast Finishers in the Lightning Field from your _**Static Field (5)**_ give you an additonal ten seconds of swiftness, giving you nearly permanent Swiftness for getting around the map quickly, if you use your _**Windborne Speed**_ and then combo your two main Blast Finishers into a Static Field as you&amp;#39;re running. **Projectile Finishers** -- The only Projectile combo you have in this build is Earth&amp;#39;s _**Shock Wave (5)**_ ability, which you typically won&amp;#39;t ever use. If you do however your Fire, Water and Lightning fields will give you Burning, Regen and Vulnerability respectively. *** **Rotation** * * * Typically fights with this build will go like this: 1. Default to **Air attunement** when traveling between objectives, making sure to use your _**(4)**_ and _**(5)**_ abilities to keep Swiftness up. 2. When you enter combat, switch to **Fire** to gain might/fury, hit the enemy with a _**Flame Burst (3)**_ to start burning, then drop a _**Lava Font (2) / Arcane Brilliance (6) / Arcane Wave (8)**_ combo to give yourself 6 stacks of Might, hit your _**Elemental (0)**_ if he&amp;#39;s available, then spam _**Fireball (1)**_ while popping those cooldowns (2,3,6,8) again as they&amp;#39;re available. 3. If you need to kite an enemy out of melee range, make sure you&amp;#39;re not near an edge, then use _**Burning Retreat (4)**_ to gain some distance before resuming your combo. 4. If facing a heavily ranged enemy, or your heal is down and you need to defend yourself until it&amp;#39;s ready again, swap to **Earth attunement** to gain a big Toughness boost, as well as Protection and immunity from critical hits. 5. If you need to heal up some more, swap over to **Water attunement** and do a quick _**(3/5)**_ combo before switching back to **Fire** to restart your DPS combo. 6. Make sure you&amp;#39;re using all of your relevant abilities on cooldown, including your _**Elemental Elite**_ and your _**Signets**_ (Air at least, for the blind) That&amp;#39;s pretty much it -- _DPS combo on cooldown, Earth if you&amp;#39;re in trouble, Water to heal back up, pop cooldowns at will. It&amp;#39;s not the most exciting or flashy build but it works._ *** **Options** * * * Something else I want to mention are the new settings options available. Under the Options menu you&amp;#39;ll find the following settings: _**Autotargeting**_, _**Snap Ground Target to Current Target**_, and _**Allow Skill Retargeting**_. I personally have these three options checked. 1. Autotargeting will automatically target a valid enemy nearby when you cast a spell so you&amp;#39;re not attacking the air instead of switching targets during combat. Just make sure you&amp;#39;re not pulling additional enemies from outside the battle. 2. &amp;quot;Snap Ground Target to Current&amp;quot; will snap your ground targeted abilities to your enemies when possible. This can get in the way when an enemy is running around a lot and you&amp;#39;re trying to lead your shot, but for the most part this is really convenient for dropping Lava Fonts right under the enemy for you to run up and use your Blast Finishers. 3. Skill retargeting will assign a new target for your spells if the one you&amp;#39;re attacking dies or goes out of range so that you can quickly move onto a new enemy when one is finished. 4. Some people really like the new Action camera (located under Hotkeys) but I hate it for combat so I won&amp;#39;t mention it, aside from saying that it&amp;#39;s great to toggle for navigating jumping puzzles, narrow bridges or other highly movement-focused activities. Wow, this post was a lot longer than I was expecting initially. Still, I had fun writing it and I&amp;#39;m having fun with the build.

321,vulnerability,Guildwars2,GW2: Heart of Thorns Revenant Leveling Build (PvE),41,3q3jn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3q3jn0/gw2_heart_of_thorns_revenant_leveling_build_pve/,2015-10-25 12:03:37,"Note: I'm on my way out for the night but I wrote this guide today and I wanted to get it posted before leaving. I'll probably add more detail later tonight when I get a chance. *** Hey guys, I'm xylo. I'm currently leveling a Revenant and I decided that I would write a brief guide to leveling one, both for my own benefit and hopefully someone else will find it useful too. Yesterday I wrote [a really detailed guide for Elementalist](URL -- this one won't have as much detail since I'm still testing the class and different specs, but here's what I've come up with so far for a pretty nasty burst Revenant build: *** *** **TL;DR** *** *** [Click here to see the build.](URL It focuses on: * Stacking Vulnerability with Devastation traits * More Vulnerability with sword's (1) ability * Using Invocation traited-Fury and Assassin's Impossible Odds to spam crits * Swapping to Demon during downtimes *** **Weapons** *** _**Primary**_ -- Sword/Axe _**Secondary**_ -- Staff (5 skill for travel, 4 heal, 3 projectile shield) *** **Leveling/Hero Points** *** 1-21: 13 points into Assassin (4-2-3-4), 17 into Demon (4-2-3-4-4), 2 into Invocation (2) 22-29: 28 points into Invocation (3-3-3-4-5-5-5) 31-33: 9 points into Demon (9) for Elite Skill, 6 points into Invocation (6) 35-37: 24 points into Invocation (8-8-8) 39: 13 points into Assassin (4-9) 41-47: 44 points into Devastation (2-3-3-3-4-5-5-5-6-8) (up to Swift Termination) 49-55: 52 points into Corruption (2-3-3-3-4-5-5-5-6-8) (up to Diabolic Inferno) 56+: You should be at full build by 55 so fill in the rest of your traits however you wish. 80: Once you hit level 80 you will likely need a more defensive build, so feel free to experiment with new builds and unlocking the Elite specialization: Herald. *** **Specializations** *** _**Invocation (3-1-1)**_ -- Grant Fury on Invocation swap or heal, massive amounts of burst from crits while Fury is up. _**Devastation (2-2-1)**_ -- Stack vulnerability and vicious lacerations (% dmg increase) _**Corruption (3-1-1)**_ -- Debuff, poison, torment, burn with Elites **Optionally, replace Corruption with Retribution for more defensive traits:** _**Retribution (2-2-2)**_ -- Reduced ranged damage, Retaliation and Stability when dodging, chance to take 50% less damage when struck *** **Rotation** *** The basic rotation for the build is pretty simple. You won't have all of your abilities as you're leveling, but you can work without them, and once you get the crit spam at level 39ish you'll be doing massive damage. 1. Stay in Demon form when traveling, using Staff with (5) ability to dash 2. When approaching enemies, weapon swap to Sword/Axe, then use Demon's Unyielding Anguish (9) ability to jump onto target. Jumping in Demon then swapping to Assassin gives you Fury which generates a ton of crit damage. 3. Swap invocation to Assassin, toggle Impossible Odds (9) on, spam auto-attack til energy bar is at zero. This is your primary source of damage. 4. Swap invocation back to Demon, toggle Elite (0) on, use your Sword (3) ability to shadowstep for damage while Elite ticks 5. Heal if needed before swapping back to Assassin when it's off cooldown, then repeat steps 3-5. *** **Combos** *** This build doesn't have very much combo potential, but your combo abilities are: Assassin's Impossible Odds (9) - Dark Field Sword (2) -- Whirl Finisher Staff (1) -- Whirl Finisher Staff (4) -- Blast Finisher You'll rarely execute any combos in your own rotation but you may see some benefit by taking advantage of allied Fields. *** I hope you guys enjoy this guide.

322,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"Making WvW Mesmer Build, Could use Advice",3,3qbf5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3qbf5c/making_wvw_mesmer_build_could_use_advice/,2015-10-27 06:08:38,"So I love playing my Mesmer, and I love controlling the battlefield and my opponents. I'd also love to be tanky as I enjoy not having to worry every single moment about if my health is gonna fly away in the next half 'a second. Unfortunately gear does have its limitations, and I only get three talent trees, not four. So I've chosen to run a lot of manipulation. The build is intended for small roaming groups rather than full Zergs. A few notes: * I'm freshly 80, and have bought all of my gear off the AH, mostly as something to fill until I really find what I need. * I'm fairly new to WvW and really PvP in this game, but not new to the concept. * I take criticism well, but it always helps if I know _why_ things are bad. If I know why, rather than only what, I can more effectively understand how I should be playing. ###The Plan: - To inflict as many stacks of vulnerability as possible, while interrupting my opponents until I can roll in and slash-em-up. [Here is the build](URL the rest of this post is explaining my decisions, and options. Hopefully that will help you help me better. ###Gear: - At the moment I'm running Berserker's gear, though if I thought it would do me any good I'd run Zealot's, and wearing Cleric's before I moved out of the inspiration tree for this build. My gear is of varying quality, as the freshly-80 thing is keeping me back money wise. ###Weapons: ####Sword+Torch - Maximum deception. Because I don't have a ton of health, healing abilities, or armor I feel like I have to achieve maximum stealth time, Distortion, and movement. The Scepter feels slow and seems more prone to using condition damage. Honestly with how good the sword feels, I kinda wonder why the Scepter bothers to exist. I wish the Phantasmal Mage (Torch 2) was something else, as I don't have any investment into my Phantasms, and no one is going to confuse this purple idiot for me. Additionally he seems to rely on condition damage which is not a stat I've invested in to in any way. ####Sword+Gun - Once again I'm kinda upset that one of my skills only summons a Phantasm, but the second skill is just too valuable to pass up, offering two interrupts, and inflicting Vulnerability, and from range at that. I almost went with the great sword on this, because of its own AOE interrupt, but the cool-down was long, and the gun can work well with interrupts thanks to the perk ""Duelist's Discipline."" The Great Sword was also tempting thanks to the consistent ranged option. It'd just be the best if I could swap my first sword skill here for a gun-based auto. ###Skills: ####Healing Skill: - Mirror: Ether Feast and Signet of Ether depend on having illusions active to reach maximum effectiveness, and that is counter-productive because I want to shatter those clones to really dig into the enemy's health bar. Mantra of Recovery could be useful if I took Harmonious Mantras, but I haven't yet. ####Skill 1: - Blink: Trickery, and quicker movement across the map, not to mention catching up to people and closing the gap for when I'm ready to act on all of the Vulnerability stacks. ####Skill 2: - Mantra of Distraction: Important that I have some on-demand Interrupts. This seems like the best choice there. ####Skill 3: - Veil: Should allow me and my group to approach others without being spotted too quickly, and additionally allows me to weave through it repeatedly for extra deception. There are a lot of other options here, but this seemed valuable to me in a group, and solo. Totally open for suggestions. ####Elite: - Mass Invisibility: Signet of Humility has questionable usefulness when it has been activated, I am really not sure how un-threatening it is, and I don't know if casting this would act as an Interrupt. It also has a 1s cast time, and would only be useful in battle. Time Warp is awesome but it doesn't block projectiles, so I'm really not sure if it would be useful in a fight that's constantly shifting location. Once again, I'm open for suggestions here. ###Traits: **Chaos:** _Master of Manipulation, Mirror of Anguish, Chaotic Interruption._ - I went with _MoM_ because Descent into Madness sounds dumb, and Illusionary defense probably wont do me much good. My goal with this build is to apply Vulnerability, which means shattering my clones, which seems counter-productive. - _MoA_ because I have no Toughness on my gear so I would only get 100 Condition Damage, and without a staff Chaotic Dampening is useless. - _CI_ was a tough choice here, Ultimately I went with it because of the might. If I can use this properly it'll give me a damage boost just before I slip into range, and destroy my enemies. Prismatic Understanding would be nice from the survival aspect, and Bountiful Disillusionment has Stability though, which would be amazing, it also has the potential to give might, but only if I shatter using my pure-damage shatter, as opposed to my Daze shatter, which gives interrupts, which is key to the whole build. This decision is one of the ones I'm least sure of, and would really like someone to look at. **Dueling:** _Duelist's Discipline, Blinding Dissipation, Mistrust_ - _DD_ was one of the harder choices for me, if I use this, I have to use a gun, but the faster recharge should be nice, the bleeding effect is nice and I definitely will be interrupting a lot so this should work right? On the other hand if I were to go with Phantasmal Fury and use a Great Sword, I would have ""useful"" phantasms, but I feel like this isn't enough investment in them to really make it worth it on its own. As for Desperate Decoy: I feel like this would take a fair bit of practice to actually use effectively, since the effect is based upon your opponents actions more than your own. - _BD_ seemed more useful for staying alive once I moved in than Evasive Mirror. Fencer's Finesse sounds rough as I only have one skill that would actually make use of it, additionally a little bit of extra ferocity seems a lot less important than staying alive does. - _Mistrust_ was one that I struggled with deciding, on the one hand if I ditch Mistrust and DD both, I can switch trees entirely, after-all, this tree is there exclusively for them, and switching back to Inspiration might give me more survivability in extended duels. Harmonious Mantras could potentially be taken for the extra charge on Mantra of Distraction, which is yet another interrupt, and Deceptive Evasion is also tempting as it could be useful in multiple ways. Please help. **Domination:** _Rending Shatter, Furious Interruption, Power Block_ - _RS_ is extremely core to this build, but that doesn't make it any easier to decide on. RS make every one of my Shatter Skills useful in some way to the identity of this build. Additionally, that extra Vulnerability button is presumably going to be extremely useful. Confounding Suggestions also sounds good though, as it turns some Daze's into Stuns, and I have Dazes for daysez (I'm so sorry). - _FI_ simply seems like the best option, I dont have signets so Blurred Inscriptions doesn't do anything, and Shattered Concentration might weaken my foes in a way, but it wouldn't allow me to move in and start piling on damage as quickly. - _PB_ is another one I'm not 100% sure about. With the option of Mental Anguish I'm really not sure which to take. Imagined burden is out as long as I'm not using a Great Sword. Mental Anguish could potentially combo well thanks to all the Dazing I can do, but _PB_ makes the Dazes themselves do damage. I have NO clue which one will result in more overall-damage. TLDR: It's a Interrupt mesmer build, and it needs refining. Thanks so much, I really do appreciate any help. Edit: Thought I was wearing Zealots Gear, turns out I was wearing Cleric's. Zealots would be more ideal IMO."
323,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Roaming Reaper?,2,3qfk7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3qfk7e/roaming_reaper/,2015-10-28 02:45:08,"While I've heard that Reaper isn't that good in group play, since it pretty much only gives personal DPS and no buffs/support to your party and such. I was wondering if Reaper's actually good as a WvW Roamer with its very high DPS and the semi-perma 25 might and vulnerability/chill on your foe. It might not be as mobile as a Thief or as effective as a Mesmer/Chronomancer, but I'm still wondering. If he is not, then what would be a good WvW Roamer? I'm leaning towards Herald/Dragonhunter/Scrapper/Offensive Druid."
324,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Why the Chronomancer will be really strong,0,3j7cp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3j7cp2/why_the_chronomancer_will_be_really_strong/,2015-09-01 20:34:39,"Hello guys, So I was really hyped about the chronomancer recently and i decided to try to find a nice build that i could use in PvE when it comes out in october. Turns out i made up a cool full berserker build and i ""found"" (a lot of people probably worked on that before me) that the chronomancer seemed a bit overpowered and I am gonna try to explain why... I may be completely wrong though! I don't pretend that i found the future mesmer metabuild but it must be pretty close. First of all let me show you the build that i made with gw2skills (this build editor is so much better than it was before, I was honestly surprised): URL As you can see I didn't go too crazy, the entire gear is berserker, with scholar runes and night/force sigils. It made me uncomfortable that the Crit chance were 49,76% so I added a precise infusion, and it turned out that i had exactly 50% crit chance wich was perfect. I put Sword/Sword and Sword/Pistol simply because this build doesn't favors the focus at all, and that is one of the reasons why this build will likely not be particularly good in Arah, since you need reflects. I found out, with some easy calculator EXPLOITS that the dmg of the mesmer are really increased. Basically since you don't need assasin's gear anymore, you have wayyy more Power because you can use berserker stats and have 100% crit chance wich is (I think) impossible right now, therefore, you deal more damage. As for traits, we may lose the utility of the focus and group invulnerability, but we gain a lot of personal dps. I take Dueling 1/3/1, standard dps increases. Then you have Chronomancer 1/1/1 wich turns you into a slowgod. With the condition duration that consummables give you, i think you can actually apply slow all the time, that way you get the 30% crit chance when hitting slowed ennemies. Combined with fury, you hit the 100% chance. Finally i take Domination 2/2/2 or 2/2/1 for some survivability and more dps. I use the same skills as we're using live, depending on the situation. Of course you need to keep Timewarp at all times. The problem is that i feel like these 3 specializations are necessary, so I can't find a way to put Inspiration. Again, I am not good at theorycrafting, just trying to have a picture of the future mesmer build that everyone's gonna use in dungeons. Now, let's assume that you're in a dungeon like coe, pretty simple, all you gotta do is use your dps rotation just like the other players in your group. Your stats in an optimal situation (25 stacks of vulnerability, 25 stacks of might, fury, consummables, warrior's strenght banner and empowered allies..) would be something like: 3,976 Power (=3,476+170+330 from consummables and warrior) 1,000 Toughness (1,967 armor) 1,000 Vitality (15,922 hp) 1,211 Ferocity (251,94%) with fencer's finesse 750 Condition damage 100% crit chance (1,966 precision or 50% crit chance, + 30% from ""danger time"", + 20% fury) +62,25% extra dmg with runes/sigils/vuln/fragility trait, +30% damage on shatter and +15% damage dealt by illusions. +50% condition duration (spicy beans and toxic sharpening stones, that would imo be pretty good, ofc we'd replace toxic sharpening stones with dungeon consummables i suppose) Basically in an optimal situation, mobs would be permaslowed (3 seconds of slow every 5 attacks, 4,5 seconds of slow on interrupt, 22 seconds of quickness, therefore, 33 seconds of slow (if you cast 2 timewarps in a row basically you will have 22 pulses of 1,5 seconds) and as for damages, the third autoshot (mind spike) would deal 7,838 damage, blurred frenzy would deal 14,918, and Pistol 4 would deal 15,152. I think that the mesmer could get a better dps than the guardian, and maybe a similar dps to warriors' if 3 Phantasmal Duellist summoned for example. Let me know your opinion on the chronomancer"

Shield 4 would also benefit from a damage increase and a blast finisher. Perhaps even some vulnerability stacking.

I've found myself exploring using some of the neglected stat sets and runes with some builds and thought I'd share. My takes on the specs so far: Chronomancer as a tanky condition build with overwhelming single target suppression: URL This build can perpetually slow a single target while punishing them for moving or attacking, and even if they do attack they'll likely be blocked or blinded. It has a damage ramp-up that becomes very respectable. The build is inherently tough thanks to rabid gear and the blocks from scepter and shield are devastating. Even evasion provides clones for shatters. You can tweak utilities as you see fit, but the extra condition duration/damage really help. Reaper as a relatively survivable DPS: URL Thanks to vuln stacking giving reapers crit, the high output of vuln in this build and death perception you're able to reach 100% crit chance without using any precision. Instead this build picks up vitality, giving it a large health pool (and subsequently death shroud) and letting it exploit exuberance runes. This build does near berserker levels of DPS after a short ramp-up time, nearly instant if opening a fight with axe/focus then going to greatsword. The spectral skills provide exceptional durability as the life force effect scales with vitality. A great build using the somewhat neglected Valkyrie stat set. Tempest as a pure staff support using the normally worthless Magi stat set (cleric accessories in builder only because you can't get full magi gear.) URL Very simple and straightforward build that maximizes group healing and boons while also allowing for constant vulnerability application through Ice Spike and critical hits. Heals, buffs and damage enhance. Warning, this build has the lowest personal DPS that may be possible in the game. Daredevil as a venom share enhancement, with a focus on sword/pistol gameplay and interrupts heavily enhancing DPS. I simply couldn't find a way for staff to outplay sword/pistol. URL Signet of Malice really makes this build shine. Each pistol whip is a 2k+ heal, over 6k with 3 targets. Every dodge roll hits up to 3 targets 3 times for nearly 2k healing with impaling lotus. Venoms can be triggered during pistol whip to further enhance healing. The build has a lot of interrupt potential which enables Impacting Disruption to contribute a lot of damage, and the lack of ability to crit with ID doesn't matter with this build as it doesn't carry any crit chance. I don't think there is another build in the game that can simply stand there and take it like a venom share tank and Daredevil just makes it better through evades allowing for cooldowns and initiative recovery. Still working on this build, but I am finding some success in WvW (hence snowfall runes, though they actually provide nearly as much healing as a healing rune set while also giving toughness.) And if you're wondering why cleric over apothecary, the power damage aspect of sword simply overwhelms the condition damage. Even in a group situation. I haven't found a berserker build I'm happy with yet, and Dragonhunter is looking like it might be a good candidate for a Carrion stat set build. Revenant is also something I haven't played much of, so I don't have any builds yet. What have you come up with?"

Likely against protection or something on enemies I would assume. But man the damage I was dealing was very weak.

328,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"Feedback and thoughts on Berserker, the warrior elite specialization.",2,3k88fz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3k88fz/feedback_and_thoughts_on_berserker_the_warrior/,2015-09-09 21:30:38,"Hey. [Edit- This thread is mostly about sPvP and WvW] I noticed a lack of people talking and discussing about Beserker and that can't be good. Feedback IS needed as seen per Revenant and other elite spec. So I played in the last beta mostly for the berserker and honestly it doesn't feel satisfying to play. I'll start off by saying some of the least used skills on core warrior are physical utilities. Some of them are used in certain situations but 90% of the time, they are useless. And now we get another bunch of them with the elite specialization. Let's have a look: **Outrage-** Break out of stun and gain adrenaline for each foe near you. **Shattering Blow-** Summon a rock in front of you, and then shatter it to gain adrenaline and send rock fragments at all foes in front of you. Foes bleed based on how close they are to the rock. The shock wave produced by this attack reflects projectiles. **Sundering Leap-** Leap to a location and gain adrenaline. When you land, deal damage and inflict vulnerability on all foes in the area. **Wild Blow-** Lash out with a critical attack that launches your target. Your target flies backward with such force that they knock back other foes in the way. Gain bonus adrenaline if this move hits. **Head Butt-** Stun your target. Stun yourself. Gain adrenaline if you hit. The only one I see myself using the most would be outrage (a 10s stunbreak). Rest are terrible, shattering blow maybe for condi builds. How to go about making them better? I have no clue, physical utilities are often not used (generally utilities are used for defence aka endure pain, berserker stance, stability, shouts ect) so they would have to be really fucking strong for people to even consider them. I was thinking of they doing additional effects while being berserk. For instance; (adding on top of existing description) **Outrage -** While berserk, gain 1s (or 0.5s) of Quickness and 2 might per enemy hit. This would be great from a melee perspective and would put the threat down for people seeing you go berserk. **Shattering Blow-** While berserk, enemies within 200 range gets stunned for 2 second, dazed if 300+ range. Bleed does twice as much damage. **Wild Blow-** While berserk, it cannot be blocked. Additionally adds 10 vulnerability. (Not sure how to up this skill). **Head Butt-** While berserk, additionally slows enemy. Gives a 20% damage increase if landed. (Why? because warrior has 3 amazing elites, if headbutt has no threat to it, it will not be used.) Those, of course, are tentative buffs, and I may be biased slightly since I have played warrior since launch. Feel free to discuss and propose changes. As for **torch**. \#4 Skill seems alright, albeit delayed and slow. #5 looks absolutely pathetic and needs changed, the current effect is a small aura which has barely a ""I am on fire"" element to it. And now **traits**. Honestly, most are lackluster (even moreso for power builds) and the fact you have to sacrifice either strength, arms, disciple or defence depending on your build makes it even less appealing. Sadly I have no idea what could be changed to make them be a good trade off. **Primal bursts.** I am kind of upset the direction they took with them, took key skills and made them in bleh version. For instance, Axe's Eviscerate. An extremely strong burst skill favoured by roaming or burst warriors. if landed, has the capacity of destroying targets in few seconds. It was never chosen for AoE which is what the primal burst makes it to be. ""Decapitate"", a fitting name for its weapon, however what it does, not fitting at all. I would have loved to see it become one of the best execute abilities in the game. Half the base damage of eviscerate if target is above 50% hp, double the base damage if bellow it. Others also need work. I'd say Hammer primal should be what longbow is, but instead of fire fields, shock waves that stuns. I wanted to write more, truth be told, but I need to do formatting and whatnot and have a head ache now, but please feel free to add. It is imperative Anet receives feedback. Cheers "

Most of the feedback will be from a World versus World and Spvp perspective. I will be writing in depth feedback on the revenant again so prepare yourself for a wall of text. If you just want to watch the video: here it is: URL Ill start by systematically going through each legend, traits included, followed by the assorted weapon(s). ___________________________________________________________________________________________ Mallyx still feels like it's in quite a good spot, although it might offer a bit too much resistance for a class that's supposed te be weak against conditions. There are some classes that just don't have access to boonstrip so it's almost impossible for them to beat a revenant that is running mallyx , but other than that I still like the high risk/reward playstyle. The corruption line seems to be in a good place except for the poison trait which I just can't see getting any use in any scenario. It's one of the most thematically fitting legends which does what it's supposed to do and it's one of the only specs in the game that can reliable strip boons. Unyielding Anguish is problematic though, there is no way to get onto a point as it fully covers a point in conquest. Something should be done about this, some of the best suggestions i've come across is making the first hit displace and letting the field then pulse torment, or something else. Making the field smaller would also help for conquest, but the skill itself would still be slightly problematic. Making it so stability works might also help. There currently is no way to counterplay the skill except for blocks, but these are limited for most classes. Mace and axe feel quite good, but while all weapons got access to new evades during their mist skills, mace and axe feel a bit left out as they get no evades or anything, but this might not be a bad thing as they're certainly not weak in their current state. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ Onto jalis now: Jalis got some major improvements this beta weekend with the changed upkeep skill which feels better (the heals are quite low in PvP however) but the damage reduction is very nice. The improvement to the elite casting time was also great as you could now actually use it during fights. The taunt might be a bit expensive, but i'd rather have it this way, spamming taunt and slow would not be fun to play against. The jalis legend feels like a solid choice now, but it gets outshined by other legends that are more vital in many builds. If you however can make good use of the party wide damage reduction, I can see this getting picked up by more people. The trait line is extremely strong, giving access to lots of damage reduction, healing, stability, extra endurance and even protection. This trait line makes you feel quite tanky even if you're running berserker builds. On to hammer: The hammer got a huge buff in the last patch by making phase smash an evade and giving you a way to handle focus. The damage is top notch and might be a bit too high, as doing 25k hits if you can find the sweet spot with a 2s cooldown might be too strong. I am aware of the fact that it is easy to evade, but you don't even have enough endurance to evade every 2 seconds. I showcase some of the damage at the start of the video. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ Lets discuss ventari now. Ventari got fixed so the healing modifier traits actually work now. I have tried to run a cleric's revenant with all the modifiers and monk runes in some stronghold games just focusing on keeping those doorbreakers alive, the healing was quite good although most seemed to come from regeneration ticks, but you were quite vulnerable while you were in ventari, as you didn't have any stunbreaks or a reliable way to avoid taking damage, you also don't really get a second heal like the other legends would offer, but your second heal just becomes summoning a tablet which made ventari feel not useful enough if people found out you were actually quite vulnerable while healing others. It is still quite hard actually heal moving people in roaming scenarios, I think its still a bit too clunky for those kinds fights. The trait line that accompanies Ventari is in a healthy place, offering lots of modifiers you really need, but this line is only worth taking if you're running a healing oriented build, it doesn't feel like this trait line can be used without picking up the actual legend or weapons like the other trait lines can. which is rather sad, but at least it's not bad at doing what it's supposed to do. The staff is a viable weapon and it feels like it's a great swap, because of the great damage on the fifth skill, and the reliable block, the autoattacks felt a bit weak compared to hammer and sword, but the rest of the skillset makes up for that. A solid option. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ Time for shiro! Shiro is the most vital legend if you're running around in world versus world because of the mobility that is indispensable for running around in world versus world, and the stunbreak that saved my life more often than I would like to admit. The Elite is also borderline overpowered. Although it has a high energy cost, a 3 second aoe stun is super strong. Every single skill is excellent in this legend, but while the energy reduction on riposting shadows is not a balance offender, the change to phase traversal is. This now offers a 1200 range shadowstep without a cooldown as long as there is something you can target. I think the energy cost and the range of the skill were balanced based on the way it worked before it was changed to work like infiltrator signet, so, while it is fun to be literally uncatchable and being able to go from the mid point to the home point in pvp in a second, this is not balanced. And I feel like either the energy cost should be increased, and/or the range should be reduced. The healing skill is still in a controversial spot, but I think this skill too is borderline overpowered, the initial heal is low, but the total heal is quite good, but more importantly, this heal does about 5300 additional damage, giving you access to crazy burst when you use that skill. I still like the trait line, it's well balanced and I like the lifesteal and vulnerability idea, only critique I have is the lack of a good option in the master category, as they all feel inferior too the adept traits. Revenant sword changes were good, precision strike feels like it's worth casting now, and the autoattack buff was welcome. There are 2 issues however, firstly the fact that if someone uses deflects and/or reflects they render you unable to use your autoattack chain, as you can't get past the projectile part of the autoattack chain, this is quite a big problem as you can't cleave at all when a revive bubble is procced by a guardian, and you almost can't hit people if they decide to fight on a guardian wall of reflection for example. I would therefore suggest to make this part of the chain unblockable so you can actually cycle through it in these situations. It's time for the big one now: unrelenting assault. A lot has been said about this already, but I would like to start of clarifying for those who are about to say it. DOUBLE DODGING IS NOT A SOLUTION. you shouldn't use all your endurance on a skill with a 10 second cooldown, as this enables the revenant to just kill you afterwards with his autoattacks or swap to hammer while you can't evade anything. Popping 60 second and 80 second cooldowns like signet of stone and endure pain also won't do as unrelenting assault will be up again in 10 seconds. This skill is strong at the moment, but that's not even the main issue, the lack of counterplay is (if you don't have access to stealth), the evade is longer than anything currently in the game, while it also does damage and stacks might. (except for the hammer's phase smash at max range). Solutions might be quite tricky, but I like the suggestion of putting most of the damage in the final hit of the skill. Off hand sword is one of the best off hand option, coming out on top of shield in bigger groups where you break bar would get destroyed in a fraction of a second. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ Time for invocation. This trait line is focused on fury, which is not a bad theme, but it doesn't benefit conditions nearly as much as it benefits direct damage which is a shame, a trait that would add condition duration during fury or anything that benefits conditions too would be nice, similar to the 150 condition damage trait during fury warriors get access too. The trait line offers a bit of everything, like on condition cleanse on a 10 second cooldown gated on your legend swap, and okay traits, it doesn't really stand out as much as it did when you needed it to make your legend swap instant. This feels good if you're running power builds, but it feels underwhelming on condition builds. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ Now, onto the shiny new herald. The facet idea turned way stronger than i thought it was gonna be. The facet of nature (f2) offered great uptime on some of the most important boons (protection, regeneration, fury) while offering 50%! boon duration aoe while upkeeping it for only 2 energy degeneration cost. The boon duration felt like it can use a higher cost, as 50% is a lot. It was a nice added profession mechanic. The legend itself was very, very strong. It felt like one of the strongest legends even if you were alone, although all the boons get shared out to 5 people in range. The heal offered useful regeneration and a heal similar to defiant stance, turning all incoming damage (including condition damage) into healing. The skill was better than it was on paper, and was better than defiant stance for several reasons. The main one is the fact that it doesn't have a cast time, this is what made defiant stance useless and makes this viable. The other one is a less positive one though, the complete lack of a tell when infuse light was on you. You can obviously see an orange glowing aura when a warrior uses endure pain, which tells everyone hitting him is useless during that time. But infuse light lacks this tell, all it has is some small blue-ish ray flowing into you at the start, but other than that, there was no way to tell if a revenant had that heal up except for the tool tip stating he had. so if people didn't have the revenant selected, they had no way of telling they were actually healing him. This could use some proper aura or a tell that is more obvious. The elite also has a quite peculiar issue, I've gotten comments from some people telling me: ""the Herald is the true chronomancer, as it bends people's frames"". Every single time the glint elite was cast, the ground particle effect caused everyone to lose more than 10 fps. I guess the animation could be toned down a bit for people with animations on low? Shield was good, quite good, bug the skills were very expensive, and a chill or cripple seemed to decrease it by as much as a stun or daze, this should be adressed, as there is way more chill and cripple than stuns and dazes, and I think stuns and dazes should affect it more than chill and cripple. Shield 4 was OK. The trait line had some good minor traits, and good adept traits, although hardening persistance seemed to be giving more stacks than you should be getting. The major traits were all pretty average. But the worst one has got to be the protection on healing skill which just pretty much made your glint heal worse. I would therefore suggest changing it to granting a boon based on the legend you are in when using a healing skill, giving might/fury in shiro and protection/retalliation in jalis, this would make the trait good without changing the general concept. The shared empowerment seemed to be rather weak, but it was you only option if you were not playing in big groups so you were obliged to take it. The boon duration increase from soothing bastion did not seem to work when I tried it. All in all the most striking thing about the Glint legend was how it was hard to get rid of your energy. The upkeep costs were quite low, and the activations were free. This just doesn't feel like it is as it is supposed to be. Other legends have an initial starting cost to start an upkeep which would not be out of place, giving the activations a cost would also not be surprising and even justified. Making it so the passive part has to be active for at least a second before being able to use the second part and not allowing doubletap might also help balancing it out. In general, herald makes the vanilla revenant feel weak, the herald trait line and facet of nature feels like the arcane specialization line for the elementalist, as invocation doesnt really fill that niche. It feels like revenant with boons where you would otherwise have none, it feels like nothing but an upgrade, even if you just get the specialization for the new facet of nature. The additional boon duration also helps greatly with the resistance uptime. Even for soloing, the boons from facet of nature seem to be your best option even as it shares those boons out to 5 people. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ Some bugs I encountered were: -Mace 2 and hammer 2 not working on slopes. -Gaze of darkness not revealing properly. -The boon duration increase from soothing bastion did not seem to work when I tried it. This class went from pretty underpowered to over the top quite fast, being overpowered is not fun, there is no glory in winning. As you can win some fights by only using unrelenting assault and literally no other skill. This is why I won't be asking for buffs from a pvp perspective. Feel free to tell me what you think of the Revenant and my feedback, thanks! Thanks for the great work Roy! \o/"
330,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Daredevil WvW roaming video and Feedback,0,3kfnxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3kfnxi/daredevil_wvw_roaming_video_and_feedback/,2015-09-11 04:18:38,"URL BTW I do not claim to be amazing at this game and keep in mind Daredevil is new and was in Beta so it may not be up to par with the current classes. Regardless enjoy the video and read my rant/feedback if you want below and leave any feedback you yourself have on the Daredevil. The Daredevil's martial arts take interested me from the get go. I enjoyed playing it, it can use some more work, make some of the movement skills more fluid, damage increase on the staff. The 3 different dodges were an interesting idea but i found myself only finding the dash useful as of now. Using the vault dodge i found myself more often getting into trouble with it rather than getting out of it. The other dodge I honestly did not use enough to give proper feedback on it. Lets talk about the staff. I liked the auto attack skills, it might need some more damage on it but the vulnerability at the end of the chain of autos was a nice touch and the knock down auto attack coming from stealth I found actually more useful than i thought it would be. I found myself using mainly only the auto attacks (stealthed and revealed) and the 5 skill on the staff. The 5 skill for its damage which i think is good but the skill itself may need to have its animation speed increased or something along those lines. The 2 skill I shouldve used more honestly as I can see its usefulness. The 3 skill I never found my self immobilized and within melee distance to actually use it. The 4 skill needs something to go with the blind, damage another condition anything extra really, for blinds I just switched do dagger/pistol. Most of the other times I found myself reverting to my dagger/pistol for more damage. The heal skill I honestly didnt think it would be worth using because by the time I need a heal I would have used a dodge or two making that heal less effective. As for Fist Flurry I loved this skill, I think it should get a damage increase for the second hit of the skill to reward you for getting all of those hits off in the first place or something along those lines though. Bandit;s Defense I didnt find this useful enough to keep on my utility bar, I traded it for some stealth. Distracting Daggers I used for a bit but found myself forgetting I had them active, and normally missed my timing to interrupt something. Impairing Daggers- I did not use enough to give any actual feedback on. Impact Strike (the elite) intrigued the shit out of me. The ability to finish enemies without doing the entire finish animation sounds freaking awesome. I found myself however at times feeling gimped for not having an elite to help me down them in the first place. When I would try and use it early to prepare to finish them quickly I normally did not have enough damage to follow up and I ended up wasting my elite."

332,vulnerability,Guildwars2,The reasons why Soft CC's DoT to defiance bars is a bad design.,0,3l5gjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3l5gjp/the_reasons_why_soft_ccs_dot_to_defiance_bars_is/,2015-09-16 19:21:56,"If you missed the news: URL A huge chunk of the instanced PvE profession imbalance comes from the imbalance between buffs and debuffs. Even if Icebows and Elementalists were deleted from the game (note: Im not actually asking this) it wouldnt make Necromancers, Rangers, Mesmers and Engineers more valuable. Make debuffs valuable in their advertised way without trivializing the content, reduce the effectiveness if they are too strong. **Yes, the defiance bar at least adds a use to currently ineffective debuffs, but if they do the same as hard CC why should I choose them? Bring a weapon or profession with a lot of hard CC and dont bother with debuffs. You will still hit the defiance bar while doing more damage and giving superior party support with buffs.** They finally had the opportunity to fix the unshakable garbage mechanic, bringing more balance between professions, and they do it only only halfway? Soft CC debuffs will be like Vulnerability: everyone has some so there is no place for a dedicated build or a profession with good Vulnerability application (e.g. Necromancers and Engineers). **I honestly dont understand why they fear debuffs when buffs are melting the hardest bosses in 20 seconds flat.** Debuffs should be as valuable as buffs, period. If they are too strong reduce their effectiveness, but they should stand on equal ground with buffs. It even goes against a.net stated philosophy that everything works as advertised in every game mode. We cant have split balance between PvE/PvP but its fine to make debuffs ineffective or completely change mechanic in high end PvE? Bonus complaints: Please add a small regeneration/heal to many/most defiant bosses, give the Poison debuff a dignity. Weakness should last for its full length too, it gives less damage reduction than Protection (25% vs 33%) and it's RNG based too."
333,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Scrapper Specialization Livestream Notes,274,3lgtuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3lgtuf/scrapper_specialization_livestream_notes/,2015-09-19 04:59:14,"* Twitch Vod: URL * Youtube Mirror: URL * Alternate format for notes: URL **Scrapper** * Scrapper is originally a negative name in the Charr society  applied to low class warbands, outcasts, and misfits. They were the people who were forced to pick up scraps and do junkyard work. They took their punishment and use it as a badge of honor and inspired the other downtrodden races to do the same. Scrappers are a master of improvisation, not only in the junkyard but also on the battlefield. * Scrapper is a melee bruiser with lots of good lockdown abilities. Very good at breaking Break Bars in preparation for raids. **Hammer skills** *** * Tooltips: URL * Autoattack: Three hit combo. Able to attack 3 targets. First attack give you one might stack per target hit, second attack applies vulnerability and third attack grants both. * Electro-Whirl: Spins around to create multiple whirl finisher at your location. Also reflect projectiles * Rocket Charge: Do multiple leap attacks on your target. If you do not have anyone targeted, you will leap forward instead for the full distance. Good for escape or closing in. Each leap is a leap finisher so you can load up on things that leap finisher do. Also evades attacks. * Shock Shield: Block for 2s and also applies 8 stacks of vulnerability while you are blocking. Both offense and defense at the same time. * Thunderclap: Crates a pulsating AoE lightning field. Initial strike is a stun so it give you opportunity to load up on something else like multiple dazes. **Utilities (Gyros)** *** * Tooltips: URL * These Gyros can be targeted and attacked/crowd controlled. They do have quite a bit of health. You can applies boons/buffs to them. They will last for a fixed duration. These gyros will follow you around with the exception of Blast Gyro that will home in on your target. * Each Gyro grant a toolbelt skill (F1-F5) that act as a field that can be comboed in. The fields do not move with you except for Defense Field. * Medic Gyro: Applies an bunch of AoE healing on you and other allies after it is out. It applies the heal every 2-3 seconds. It lasts 15 seconds. * Reconstruction Field (Toolbelt Skill): Grants a water field around you and applies Protection. * Bulwark Gyro: Applies a large AoE damage reduction (50%) to you and allies. It will also take these damage on itself. It has a very large health pool so you can step behind the gyro and let it take all the damage. * Defense Field (Toolbelt Skill): Straight up reflection shield that reflects projectiles. It follows you around. * Blast Gyro Tag: You launch a straight homing device to your target (projectile, can be intercepted). The Blast Gyro will home in on that target and explodes doing knockback and a hefty amount of damage. You can counter this by locking down the Blast Gyro so it cant reach you before it runs out of its duration. Engineers can apply stability to the Blast Gyro to prevent this. * Bypass Coating (Toolbelt skill): Grant superspeed to you and nearby allies. You can pop the Blast Gyro and pop this toolbelt skill immediately after to give the Gyro superspeed to get to where it needs to be. * Shredder Gyro: Straight placement gyro you place on the ground. It stays there and continuously whirl for the 12s duration. It is potentially create a lot of projectiles from all the whirl finishers. If it survives for any amount of time it can deal a quite amount of damage. One of the combos that is good to use is to use the Bulwark Gyro to shield the Shredder Gyro or other Gyros from damage. * Spare Capacitor (Toolbelt Skill): Sets down a lightning field to daze and damage foes. * Purge Gyro: Removes 2 conditions from you or nearby allies every 3 seconds with cleanse priority given to the Scrapper before allies. * Chemical Field (Toolbelt Skill): Drops an AoE poison around you. Can be used with a whirl finisher to fire off poison projectiles or a leap finisher to weaken foes that choose to stay in. * Sneak Gyro: Applies AoE stealth to you and other allies nearby. This gyro will remain visible however. Gyros daze enemies in its range when it is destroyed or run out of its duration. You can use this and the trait that grants superspeed when a gyro is destroyed to speed off where you need to go. * Detection Pulse (Toolbelt Skill): Remove stealth from up to 5 enemies in a 900 range. Targets are revealed for 6s. If you detect an enemy Sneak Gyro you can use this skill to reveal all the stealth players. **Traits** *** * Tooltips: URL Minor * Function Gyro: Grant you a ranged ability to revive or stomp a target. You can use Gyros to finish a foe or revive an ally for you that you have targeted. Basically you target someone and use this ability. The gyro will appear at your target and do its work. Can be used every 30s. Very dangerous ability. It will currently use whatever finisher you are using. * Decisive Renowned: You get 5 stacks of Might and Superspeed when you or your gyro revive an ally or finish off an enemy. * Impact Savant: Incoming stun duration reduced by 25% and outgoing stuns duration increased by 25%. Adept * Shocking Speed: Using a leap finisher or a blast finisher in a lightning field applies superspeed around you and up to 5 allies. * Stabilization Core: Grants stability to your Function Gyro and yourself when you pop it out. This means your * Function Gyro will less likely to get interrupted when stomping or reviving allies. Recovery Matrix: Using a heal skill give you 5.75s of Protection Master * Rapid Regeneration: While you have swiftness or superspeed or both, heal for ~100 base for swiftness and ~500 base for superspeed every second. Scales with your healing power at a decent rate. If you want to go really sustain tanky, you can with this trait. * Expert Examination: Stunning or daze a foe applies 5 stacks of Vulnerability and weakness for 9s. There is no internal cooldown so everyone you stun or daze is all vulnerable and weakened. * Mass Momentum: Gain power based on your toughness. Gain one stack of Might every second you have stability. This means if you are using Stabilization Core Function Gyro traited, you can get might stacks under that stability. It can get to 5 stacks of Might base but if you have boon duration it will go even higher. Flamethrower with Juggernaut give you constant stability and you will have both pulsating might from Juggernaut and Mass Momentum to get very high Might stacks. Grandmaster * Adaptive Armor: Gain stacking Toughness when you are struck up to 5 stacks (500 Toughness). Reduce 20% of the incoming condition damage. 1s internal cooldown does not apply to the condition damage reduction, it just limit Toughness stacks to 1 stack per second. * Final Salvo: Gyros grant a pulsating lightning field and superspeed to allies when destroyed. Lasts for 3 pulses with each pulse granting superspeed. * Perfectly Weighted: Deal 10% hammer damage and gain 3s of stability (2 stacks) everytime you evade an attack with an internal cooldown of 5s. Works really well with Rocket Charge and Mass Momentum. If someone tries to hit you while you are bouncing around in Rocket Charge you will return with stability and Might stacks. "
334,vulnerability,Guildwars2,How do you deal with Celestial d/d Elementalist in sPVP?,4,3lqkwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3lqkwd/how_do_you_deal_with_celestial_dd_elementalist_in/,2015-09-21 09:46:17,"Dagger/Dagger Elementalist is just super frustrating to fight against. It's not as if they don't take damage, but it usually takes multiple people to take one down in the games that I've played. Boon-stripping feels kind of pointless because of how easily and frequently they can re-apply all their bonuses. That leaves boon corruption and conversion which is [Necromancer](URL territory. This forces them to use skills to cleanse conditions? Chill is the only counter written on the [Metabattle](URL site, and I understand why ~ 66% movement speed reduction/ increased cooldowns. I guess the sort of logic that comes across when I find myself faced with celestial elementalists is this: **Why would you pick anything other than Celestial Elementalist if you want to win?** * High mobility - defensive Cantrips augment offensive power. * Simple regular condition removal via Water Attunement &amp; Cleansing Fire. * Gains consistent boons at regular intervals via Elemental Contingency &amp; Evasive Arca. * Amazing party support and access to weakness, cripple, chill, immobilize, burning, vulnerability, stability/vigor, bleeding and protection. * Hybridized damage that scales well with might - particularly burning which was buffed recently? * Enough damage to matter via self-combos &amp; might duration. It seems like they get so much more to work with than other classes and the worst part is that other than managing their attunements and chaining skills together for their rotations they gain far too much for ""passive"", ""lol I'm an Elementalist"" gameplay. Necromancer/Reaper is supposed to be based around chill, right? What can I do in the meanwhile to counterplay this ridiculously self-sustaining build. I'm getting tired of playing against it. It's not fun watching your opponent drag you underwater and drown you with cool down pressure and warmogs armor. As far as I know only Necromancer and Elementalist have access to Chill outside of weapon-swap sigils? Engineer might have some depending on the build, and the rest of classes definitely don't? It feels like rather than actively trying to out-play opponents Celestial Elementalist is all about biding your time, stacking as many offensive/defensive contextual boons as possible and out-sustaining your enemies waiting for them to outplay themselves when they use everything up? *Maybe* this appeals to someone, but I think it's really lame. I really hate the idea that the only way of fighting the celestial amulet is with more celestial classes -- it's backwards and broken? It's fighting fire with fire.

336,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[Suggestion]WvW areas should introduce timed vulnerability,0,3f8r4k,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3f8r4k/suggestionwvw_areas_should_introduce_timed/,2015-07-31 12:51:15,"Okay, I may be a minority - but WvW areas to me just don't provide much gameplay value. It's really just zerg from keep to keep and occasionally getting wiped out when you run into another zerg. There needs to be more strategy and one way to do that is create time frames where certain keeps become 'vulnerable' to attack and re-ownership. On the minimap - you can have an icon which shows how long until the keep becomes vulnerable again. Maybe you could say the power generators for a forcefield need maintenance lol. Anyways, the opposition must attack and succeed during that time window - otherwise the generators kick back in and kill everyone within range and the keep remains under control. The bonuses for having ownership of a keep could be extended to better loot when killing an enemy or something so that everyone feels a tangible effect for participating. You could even extend the buffs to characters in PvE - so that they have a visible buff on their character reminding them of how beneficial WvW can be for your world. It could play out to some strategic things where if you need more condi-resistance for a particular boss in PvE then you'd organise to make sure you claim that keep when it becomes vulnerable. Basically it would get everyone to head over to the keep to either try and defend, or battle eachother to be the first ones inside &amp; the first ones to kill the boss. In the periods of down-time - it would also encourage people to go roaming or taking smaller objectives. Making it feel more alive - but every 15-30 minutes or so, one of the big keeps becomes vulnerable again &amp; should get attacked. "
337,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Melee Ranger - For people bored of pew pew,1,3f9gh4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3f9gh4/melee_ranger_for_people_bored_of_pew_pew/,2015-07-31 16:58:01,"Never posted one of these guides before, or really done any theorycrafting at all, but I hope somebody gets something out of this. Perhaps I should have posted a little more elsewhere before making a thread (Hi Reddit!), however, this build is just so *fun*. I want to share it with everybody. URL The build relies around keeping your fragile pet alive, swapping at every possible opportunity (which keeps their health up) and using your heal as much as you reasonably can. The heal is *very* frequent, and thanks to traits, gives you some not unhelpful swiftness and regen. Maul hits fairly hard from the greatsword: with the sigils of intelligence, it's pretty nice right after you swap. I personally enjoy the quickness, too; you could probably swap it out for something else if you felt inclined! There's also the option of swapping the dagger for a warhorn or an axe. Playing from STRAYA, I find the dodges help me out a little when I need a little more time to think, which is often. It's obviously not everybody's cup of tea, as it relies heavily on the pet even with all the bashing you're doing; having it killed and the swap put on a huge delay puts you at an immense disadvantage: I like to have the jaguar for exactly this reason, being invisible helps it not die quite as much. In addition to all that, you get the boons from warhorn on every swap, as well as quickness, which isn't much, although it helps, as well as stupid amounts of vulnerability, a very reliable cripple, and a super-frequent heal, which pairs nicely with the life steal from the runes. I'll stop rambling anyway, sorry if I sound like some kind of know-nothing scrub (that's because I am), but if even a few people dissatisfied with the boring pew pew Ranger tried this out, I'd be very happy. If you got this far, thanks for reading! I look forward to all your feedback. (By the way, if anyone could come up with a clever name for this silly thing, I'd upvote the hell out of you, just sayin')"

339,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[Laments and Praise] Am I The Only One Feeling Like I Can't Play Without My Elite Spec?,99,3gd7cc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3gd7cc/laments_and_praise_am_i_the_only_one_feeling_like/,2015-08-10 03:16:17,"So, a bit of backstory about to lead into this: I've always loved Necromancers as a theme, as a thing. I've always loved the ""Death/Dark/Hell Knight"" as a theme as well (Almost as much as I love the ""Holy Knight/Paladin/Crusader"" as a theme!) A game having a Necromancer is an instant sell for me---No really, if your game has a playable necromancer in it, I am sold--And if it can summon an army of minions to do its bidding? Then I *will* have your game. I played WoW as a teenager, and I mained Paladin in the latter half of TBC (swapped from Hunter)---But when the Death Knight came out, it was immediately mine. I had to play---And I did. I mained that icy, angsty fuck for ages, and I still do (Thanks to WoW's ultra casual status I can main both my holy knight AND my death knight!) I am a blood death knight at heart. Now, leading into GW2, I bought GW2 solely for the Necromancer. I researched it beforehand and found that Necromancer was just the Warlock of GW2 (A.K.A. the ""bitch"" class that gets the shaft every patch ;P) but I wasn't deterred. It was a Necromancer, and I had to play it. I loved it. I hated (and still do) that Minions are just plain outright broken, but I still love my necromancer nonetheless. It's a bit wonky, sure, and certainly underperforming where it really matters, but I love it. Then they hinted the Reaper at PAX when announcing Elite Specs, and I was hyped. I was sold. I had to have Heart of Thorns just to get my Necromancer wielding a Greatsword. They they STREAMED the Reaper and my hype and desire reached critical mass---**It was like they were cuckolding me with the Reaper. They God damned blue-balled me.** I immediately lost interest in the game, solely over that. My hype had killed itself---It hyped itself into a heart attack. I played other games for awhile, mainly Black Desert Online and DMC4SE (Then back to DMC3SE when I realized just how fucking overpowered they made Vergil in DMC4SE and how fucking boring that made him to play.) Then, I came back about... two? three? weeks ago? Felt the itch to play my Necromancer, so i loaded up the Cele Signet build and PVP'ed (Because for me, Silverwastes has been Silverwasted and Necros are pretty much worthless in dungeons outside of simply filling an otherwise empty slot so you aren't missing damage) Then they announced the BWE, and that I was able to play the Reaper. I *had* to play it. I had a feeling playing it would ruin GW2 for me, but I had to play it. Well, the BWE came, and now it's going away. The Reaper, outside of its terrible Greatsword DPS and half their shouts being shitty, was *everything* I could have hoped for. Just playing it makes me feel giddy. I don't care that the Greatsword does such terrible DPS----It feels amazing, I love the animations, I love the mechanics, I LOVE it. DPS can be fixed, but the weapon itself is amazing. 10/10 best feeling greatsword in the game. I love the way the auto attack feels. It's slow, but it feels powerful, weighty, like there's some serious strength behind it. I love the way the third hit in the chain smothers my Sunrise in Ice before slowly slamming it into my victim. I love the way Gravedigger floats me off the ground, flares my robes out and spins around, striking as if reaping a harvest. It feels amazing, and it looks great with Sunrise. I love the way Death Spiral is, it's so god damned satisfying seeing it wind up, seeing the damage tick by... the entire animation is golden, and the vulnerability is amazing (Especially against three targets while equipped with Blood spec! hnnngg, the numbers themselves may be small but dear gods so much healing and so much number porn) I love the way Nightfall is, I love the pool of darkness at my feet, slowly creeping outward, blinding and crippling my victims. It's awesome, it feels awesome, it works awesome. I love the way Grasping darkness looks, I love the way it feels once I got used to its bugginess and figured out how to properly aim it on the fly (I wish they'd make it a true skillshot though and let us aim it like Whirlwind Attack. That would be amazing) And then the Reaper Shroud Dear gods yes the reaper shroud. I had an insant nerdgasm the moment I fired it up, it's amazing. Everything about Reaper shroud is glorious---The animations, the effects, the looks... everything. It's perfect-----Its effectiveness could use some fine tuning, but it still performs amazingly It's like Death Shroud, but it's truly a side-grade to it. The auto attack is beyond satisfying in its animations and is amazing for both Power and Condi builds. I love the pattern the scythe is swung in, the way the haze trails behind it, the pacing of the attack... everything. I love Death's Charge even though it tends to be a bit hard to aim the hit, and has sent me off cliffs more times in one weekend than I care to remember... But it's satisfying. I love the effect, I love the visuals, I love the way it feels. I love the way it lifts my character off the ground, propelling them forward like some macabre helicopter. It looks and feels amazing. I love Infusing Terror... I love using it, I love the way it functions. It is amazing. I love the raw amount of stability it gives (When traited it gives 1 stability every second for 8 seconds and has a 17 second cooldown, meaning 50% uptime on self-stability holy grim's dusty balls that's awesome) and I love exploding it at the last second for a clutch fear. I love the way Soul Spiral is---Everything about it---It's like the Auto Attack but even better (Though it doesn't replace it, as the animations are different and I love the auto attack) I love the way it bursts poison onto enemies, I love the way the animation looks, I love the way the spell feels, I love how it is absolutely amazing for both Power builds and Condi builds (Corrosive Poison Cloud and Soul Spiral 25 = stacks of Poison with only +40% condition duration and no poison sigils) I love having such a long whirl finisher with so many hits as I love using Blood Spec (Bottom/Bottom/Top), then dropping a well of Power on the enemy, then entering shroud, using Infusing Terror before spiraling my way to to a large amount of health---With no healing gear, that will typically heal me for 4-5k against one enemy. It's amazing. I love the way Executioner's scythe works----Its damage is a bit lacking IMO, and I wish it hit three or five enemies, but it's amazing. It's like the final hit of the Greatsword Auto Attack amplified exponentially. I love seeing that scythe fall, dunking a block of ice onto my victim, freezing them solid and leaving them in a pool of ice---A pool of ice that goes *very* well with Soul Spiral (But then, I truly can't sing Soul Spiral's praises enough----combined with Blood Spec it's amazing---It's exactly like I have my Blood DK in tyria. .... hhnnnngnnggg) I love the shouts. I said it. I love em (Well, 5 out of 6, damned ""Rise!"") ""Your Soul is Mine!"" is probably my favorite healing spell in the game, and the sheer amount of survivability it brings is absolutely astounding. While it could stand to have a slightly shorter cast time, I love this healing spell. I have never loved a healing spell the way I love this one---It's another notch in how my Reaper is my Blood DK. ""You are all weaklings!"" is a horribly cheesy name, but I'm the kind of guy with brie in his fridge and un-ironically listens to and enjoys things like [Manowar](URL [Iron Savior](URL [Helloween](URL [Edguy](URL and owns a DVD of [Caveman starring Ringo Starr](URL etc... You get the point---I love cheesiness and the shout's name is cheesy---Do the math Functionally, I find its Might generation redundant, but I consider that little more than a *boon*us to the skill's stunbreak and stability functionality, as well as its weakness generation. I love Suffer, though I think it needs a shorter cast time, the spell itself is quite nice---Chill and condi transfers are always nice! Not much more to say. I love ""Nothing Can Save You!""---This shout is damned powerful, and it's a damned worthy skill to have around. Potentially 9 seconds of unblockable attacks is an absurdly powerful thing to have on a thirty second cooldown---Particularly when it also rips boons and applies vulnerability and can have its cooldown shortened by 35% when traited and used against 5 targets. Holy fucking hell this shout is absurd. I'm 100% afraid it will be nerfed to a 1min cooldown---But even then it will be amazing. ""Rise!"" is my only downer, but oh well, it's just 1 skill in a sea of gloriousness---And my only complain is that minions are broken and it's a minion-oriented spell, otherwise I'd absolutely love it (and it's been hinted minion AI will be fixed in HoT so who knows?) Here's hoping they fix minions instead of changing this skills functionality. ""Chilled to the Bone!"" is such a fun, powerful spell---Though I do believe its cast time needs to go down to 1 second or shorter, and that its cooldown needs to go to 90 or lower----2 second cast time is just terrible and 120 seconds is too long, but otherwise it's an insanely powerful, insanely useful, insanely fun skill that has rightfully earned its place in my heart and my hotbar. The visuals are amazing I love the sea of ice. Its effects are amazing, tons of chill and a nice freeze (I consider the freeze to be more of a bonus to the stability, damage, and chill) Everything about the Reaper in terms of aesthetics and gameplay feel is amazing, and any flaws I've found are purely a numbers game---Higher Power coefficient on Greatsword (Please don't shorten the attack animations, just make their damage devastating. I love their speed, it's just the low damage that's the issue---I'll gladly take having the most blatantly obvious tells in the game if it means when I smack someone they're *really* going to feel it and I would be greatly disappointed if they turned it into ""Just another Greatsword"" by halving the cast times and calling it a day), shorter cast time on shouts, and a shorter cooldown here or there..... And yet, as the BWE winds down, I simply can't find myself enjoying the game anymore. I'm enjoying my Reaper while I still have it----By my experience so far it would be nearly impossible for me to not enjoy it---but it's tinted with a kind of bittersweet regret and disappointment. **I've become so wholely enthralled by the Reaper in such a short amount of time that the thought of playing anything else is just so... terrible. Like a slog. boring, soulless, hollow** ....And yeah. This was a hell of a lot longer than I thought it would be, or than I intended it to be, but there're my thoughts. Is anyone else just so thoroughly satisfied and in love with their elite spec that it has killed their interest in the rest of the game without it? I know we're looking at just 3.5 months down the line at the latest (They'll probably be pushed to release before Thanksgiving due to that being when people get the Christmas Rush), but damn does that seem like ages without the Reaper!"
340,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[Suggestions] Elite Specialization Traits: Dragonhunter,39,3gfyrm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3gfyrm/suggestions_elite_specialization_traits/,2015-08-10 18:27:32,"[Link to Tempest Suggestion Post](URL A lot of people have been discussing the Elite Specialization's Weapon/Utility Skills from the recent BWE, but it also gave us a good look at many of their traits. With the most recent Feature Patch, Traits were heavily streamlined and became Specializations. We saw a lot of combining of traits, making a lot of loose, unpopular traits, combined into more powerful traits. Obviously, there will always be favorites, and traits that are most suited to certain builds, but overall, it was more concise and efficient -- I felt like choosing traits actually made a big difference, unlike before. However, with the Elite Specializations, it feels like many of their traits are loose, like the old traits, and not nearly as concise and efficient as the base classes' new Specialization Traits. Many of the Elite Specs don't have traits for Weapon or Utility Cooldowns, and many have multiple traits to benefit their weapon or Utility -- before the Feature Patch, this was common in the Trait Lines, but after, they made an active effort to combine Traits to make them better and more efficient. With that in mind, here are a few suggestions I have for edits to the Elite Spec's Traits (For the most part, I am not renaming them. I actually really like most of the names): **Dragonhunger** **Adept Major** **Piercing Light** * **Current Trait:** *Piercing Light:* Trap hits bleed enemies. * **Suggested Trait:** *Piercing Light:* Trap hits bleed enemies. Traps recharge reduced by 25%. * **Reasoning:** Currently, Piercing Light is rather weak, and it only benefits condition builds. Adding a simple recharge reduction makes it useful for all builds, while adding a small amount of damage from the bleeds, even if you aren't a condition build. **Soaring Devastation** * **Current Trait:** *Soaring Devastation:* Wings of Resolve delivers an attack on landing. * **Suggested Trait:** *Soaring Devastation:* Wings of Resolve delivers an attack on landing. Increases the range on Wings of Resolve. * **Reasoning:** Wings of Resolve is already a powerful skill, but this trait adds a new side to the risk-reward play-style of the Guardian. You can use it as a gap-closer to increase your burst damage, or you can save it to use as a disengage when you are in a pinch. **Zealot's Aggression** * **Current Trait:** *Zealot's Aggression:* Deal extra damage (7%) to crippled enemies. * **Suggested Trait:** *Zealot's Aggression:* Deal extra damage (7%) to crippled, chilled, or immobilized enemies. * **Reasoning:** The Dragonhunter's access to Cripple is something I really enjoyed, but I found that, when I wasn't using the Longbow, I wasn't getting full use out of that trait. With this change, the scepter's Chains of Light, Signet of Wrath, Hammer's Zealot's Embrace, and the chill from Glacial Heart will all synchronize with the trait. * **Master Minor** **Defender's Dogma** * **Current Trait:** *Defender's Dogma* Blocking an attack causes Justice to reach its maximum charge. * **Suggested Trait:** *Defender's Dogma* Blocking or evading an attack causes Justice to reach its maximum charge. * **Reasoning:** Guardians have always had plenty of access to blocking, but with Virtue of Courage changed to Shield of Courage, Dragonhunter's have lost access to one of the staple, quick access blocks. The addition of evade makes this minor trait a bit more accessible for Dragonhunters who don't want to use Sanctuary, ""Retreat,"" or Renewed Focus. **Master Major** **Bulwark** * **Current Trait:** *Bulwark:* Shield of Courage is larger and lasts longer. * **Suggested Trait:** *No change.* Though, the duration increase may need to be buffed to make it a bit more desirable. **Dulled Senses** * **Current Trait:** *Dulled Senses:* Enemies you knock back are crippled. * **Suggested Trait:** *Dulled Senses:* Enemies you knock back, knock down, or pull are crippled. * **Reasoning:** Similar to the change to Zealot's Aggression, this change simply makes the trait have more synchronicity with other Guardian/Dragonhunter skills. Currently, only the Longbow (When traited), the Hammer's Banish, and the Shield's Shield of Absorption have knock back. This change allows the trait to activate with Bane Signet and the Greatsword's Binding Blade skill as well. **Hunter's Determination** * **Current Trait:** *Hunter's Determination:* True Shot grants stability for each enemy struck. * **Suggested Trait:** *Hunter's Determination:* When you apply Cripple to a foe, gain swiftness. * **Reasoning:** A trait that is based on a single skill is, frankly, rather weak, especially when stability is much more easily gotten in much larger amounts and much longer durations from other skills. This trait will give the Guardian more mobility in combat, making them more effective kiters. A short internal cooldown can keep this trait from giving excessive amounts of swiftness. **Grandmaster Minor** **Pure of Sight** * **Current Trait:** *Pure of Sight:* Deal Bonus damage to enemies beyond the range threshold. * **Suggested Trait:** *No changes.* This one is good as it is. **Grandmaster Major** **Big Game Hunter** * **Current Trait:** *Big Game Hunter:* Striking an enemy tethered by your Spear of Justice causes vulnerability and increases damage dealt. * **Suggested Trait:** *No Change.* But the damage increase should be increased to 20%, rather than 10%. * **Reasoning:** This should be a trait that really boosts damage for a short time. Right now, Spear of Justice is clunky for various reasons. This trait should make people go, ""Oh Crap,"" when they get hit by your Spear of Justice. **Heavy Light** * **Current Trait:** *Heavy Light:* Longbow arrows knock back when enemies are within the range threshold. * **Suggested Trait:** *Heavy Light:* Longbow arrows knock back when enemies are within the range threshold. True Shot grants stability for each foe struck. Longbow Skills recharge reduced by 25%. * **Reasoning:** One of the things I love most about the changes to the baseline Guardian Specializations were the weapon traits. They made me feel like having that weapon was a big deal. This combines the original Hunter's Determination with the original Big Game Hunter to make a powerful trait that makes the Longbow a force to be reckoned with. **Hunter's Fortification** * **Current Trait:** *Hunter's Fortification:* Apply Protection in area when activating a virtue. * **Suggested Trait:** *Searing Wounds:* When you burn an enemy, apply two stacks of bleed. * **Reasoning:** Hunter's Fortification would be an amazing trait on the base Guardian. However, the Dragonhunter is meant to be a damage class, not a supporting class. All of the other traits and skills are designed to increase the Dragonhunter's damage and survivability. Hunter's Fortification just feels out of place. Searing Wounds (Name up for change) adds a much needed addition to a condition build for the Dragonhunter."
341,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Why doesn't protection affect conditions?,10,3gpxqt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3gpxqt/why_doesnt_protection_affect_conditions/,2015-08-12 23:28:11,"Now that vulnerability affects condition damage, why doesn't protection give you more resistance to condition damage? With all the current condi builds in pvp and wvw I feel like my protection is rather useless. Edit: I know resistance is a thing, but it's not like it's as commonly available as protection. Maybe the solution would be to make resistance more accessible and make it pause the conditions that are already applied to you."

They are now made to evade while you are using them. * Sword damage has been increased, especially on #3 skill Unrelenting Assault. * Vengeful Hammer on Jalis felt more like a DPS skill upkeep rather than tanky themed. We lowered the damage a lot and now when hammers hit enemies they heal you and you take less damage from attacks while hammers are active. * Elite cast time reduced. * Weakness removed from Staff #2 skill and moved to Staff #1 skill. Staff #2 skill now inflict an AoE daze if you hit someone with it while they are using abilities. **Spear** *** * Tooltips: URL * First two skills (Spear of Anguish/Rapid Assault) on your bar are two different autoattacks. First skill is a ranged projectile attack that applies more torment the further out the target is from you. The second skill is a physical flurry that is a bit longer ranged than normal melee attacks and stacks vulnerability. * Venomous Sphere/Frigid Discharge is your third skill. Venomous Sphere sends out this poisonous orb that will attack creatures in its path, spraying out poisonous projectiles. While this sphere is out you get the flip over skill * Frigid Discharge that you can use to detonate the sphere to deal a burst of damage and chill foes. * Igniting Brand/Devour Brand is your fourth skill. Igniting Brand will throw your spear out and connect with an enemy. While the spear it is connected, it pulsates burning damage. The flip over skill Devour Brand allow you to teleport to the target and do a big burst AoE. * Rift Containment is your fifth skill. You create two rifts one above and one below the target. They will trap the target and pulsates damage while the enemy is trapped. * Mallyx/Shiro will work underwater in the next beta weekend, other Legends will be converted as well later. **Shield** *** * Tooltips: URL * Envoy of Exuberance  ground targeted skill, give protection to allies when it travels through them and release a burst heal when it reaches the target. Give protection to allies both on the way to them and on the way back. You only get the protection yourself when the skill returns back to you. You can use the skill on yourself to get a burst heal or use them on allies to maximize the protection. The skill will always return to you no matter where you are. * Crystal Hibernation  You are immune to conditions while channeling this skill but previous applied conditions will still damage you. You also get a defiance bar while using this skill and if the defiance bar is broken, you gain 25 stacks of Vulnerability for 2s and get stunned. You can use a stun breaker to break out of this stun. **Facets** *** * Tooltips: URL * First press is always an upkeep skill, which consumes energy constantly. Second press triggers the active skill and put both skills on cooldown. The active skill have a bit more longer cooldowns than other Revenant skills and it is a trade run we want you to make. * You can only have a max of 10 energy regen so you cannot have all the facet upkeep skills up. * Each facet animation shows a different piece of the dragon (i.e. Facet of Darkness shows Glints eyes). * You get a decal under your character with a marker for each facet upkeep skill you are currently running. * Facet of Nature (F2)  The upkeep skill costs 2 energy per second and pulsates to grant 50% increased boon duration to you and nearby allies. Works well with Glints other facets or other support characters/might stacking characters. Active skill One with Nature will take all the boons from the other Facets and apply them to you. So even if you are not running Glint legend, you can get access to the boons from all the Facets. * Facet of Light (Heal)  Upkeep skill pulsates AoE regen. Active skill will heal yourself for a bit and invert all incoming damage to you to heals. * Facet of Darkness (#7)  Upkeep skill grant nearby allies fury every 3 seconds. Active skill consume the facet and blind an area around you while pulling foes caught in it out of stealth and reveal them for 5s. It also act as a stun breaker. * Facet of Elements (#8)  Upkeep skill grant swiftness to nearby allies every 3 seconds. Active skill consume the facet to call down Glints breath to apply a different condition with each pulse. (Weakness, Chill and Burning). * Facet of Strength (#9)  Upkeep skill grant might to nearby allies every 3 seconds. Active skill uses Glints claw to swipe at the enemy, applying 10 stacks of Vulnerability per strike for a total of two strikes. * Facet of Chaos (Elite)  Upkeep skill grant protection to nearby allies every 3 seconds but has a much higher upkeep cost of 5 energy per second. Active skill blows back enemy in an area, dealing damage and giving allies in the area superspeed. **Traits** *** * Tooltips: URL Minor * Crystal Harbinger  Allow you to equip shield, use Legendary dragon stance skills and gain access to Facet of Nature * Vigorous Persistence  Gain 25% endurance increase if you have any upkeep skill. This applies to upkeep skill in other stances as well. * Envoy of Sustenance  Increase boon duration by 15%. Stacks with F2 50% duration increase. Adept * Swift Gale  Gain superspeed when you break a stun. Allow you to resposition quickly after breaking out of stun. * Radiant Revival  Place Infuse Light on an ally when you revive them. This will invert all the damage they take to heals for 2 seconds. This is something you need to look out for when playing against Revenants in PvP. * Hardening Persistence  Gain 40 toughness for each point of energy you are consuming. You can gain a max of 400 Toughness if you drain 10 energy per second. Master * Bolster Fortifications  Grant protection to allies when using a healing skill. Since you can equip two legends, you can heal twice in a short time and grant some burst Protection. * Shared Empowerment  Grant might to allies when you apply boons to them. Good trait for might stacking. * Harmonize Continuity  When you stun break successfully, you also stun break nearby allies. Grandmaster * Elders Force  2% damage increase for each boon on you. More of a DPS trait. * Soothing Bastion  Activate shield #5 when you are struck below the health threshold (25% HP). Increase current boon duration by 2 seconds in a 600 range around you when you use a shield skill. * Enhanced Bulwark  When stability is applied to you, you gain an extra stack of stability. "
343,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Berserker Elite Specialization Livestream Notes,242,3hvs32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3hvs32/berserker_elite_specialization_livestream_notes/,2015-08-22 05:00:19,"* Twitch Vod: URL * Youtube mirror: URL * Alternative link for viewing: URL Hugh is showing off his Hammer/Longbow warrior build with a RL Juggernaut. **Torch Offhand skills** *** * Tooltips: URL * **Blaze Breaker**: Hits the ground and create a cascade of attacks. Each rock that pops out of the ground inflicts cripple and burning and can hit up to 3 targets. It cascade 5 times in rapid succession and you can get multiple stacks of burning on a single target. Procs sigils frequently. * **Flames of War**: Sets you on fire (doesnt actually place burning stacks on you) and remove conditions. It turns you into a mobile fire field. Every second enemies around you are set on fire. You can swap weapons while using this skill as the fire field persists. So you can activate this skill, swap to Greatsword and spin through the fire field for combos. It works well with Sword #2 skill (leap finisher) which place a fire aura on you to place additional burning on your attackers. You can switch to rifle and shoot through it to get the Burning Bolts. With axe you have the whirl finisher on #2, throw the burning axe on #3 and a leap finisher on Eviscerate (F1). With hammer you can immediately switch to hammer after dropping the field, jump through it, blast finisher to burn everyone around you, whirl to knockdown, immediately hit Backbreaker. The whole time they are stuck in the fire field. If they try to run, swap back to Torch and drop the #4 skill. **Utility Skills** *** * Tooltips: URL * These Rage utility skills are all very short ranged so they do not work well in all situations. * Blood Reckoning: This heal works on your condition damage as well and you get more healing with crits. 30% of your damage is converted to healing and if you crit it is 50% of the damage. Critical hits also generate an extra adrenaline. Berserker mode will benefit the most from this skill. * Wild Blow: This is a critical attack that knock back your primary target and up to 4 additional foes behind your primary target as well if they are close. The first hit always crits. We dont currently have the technology to convert players to projectiles as there are currently skills that immediately reflect the projectile and would instantly kill the player. * Shattering Blow: You summon a rock and punch it to send rock fragments in an arc to up to 5 enemies. This skill also reflect back projectiles if timed right. This the only rage skill that roots you in place while casting it but has a short cast time to compensate. (If they allow you to move while casting this skill you wouldnt punch the rock properly). * Sundering Leap: Good for initiation as it give 10 stacks of vulnerability to enemies at point of impact. Give you adrenaline on the leap and more adrenaline when you land if you hit enemies with this skill. Good for generating adrenaline. * Outrage: Stun break on a 10s recharge. Has no other function other than stun break.Gain adrenaline based on how surrounded you are. Stun break is self only. * Head Butt: Crowd control elite on a 20s cooldown. Short range dash attack that stuns the enemy for 3s and also stun you for 1s. You can use Outrage to break out of it. Gain full adrenaline if you hit your target with it. **Primal Burst F1 skills** *** * Tooltips: URL * You get access to these new F1 skills only in Berserk Mode (F2 button). Berserk Mode can be only activated if you have a full bar of adrenaline. Berserk mode lasts 15s and will flip your regular F1 skills to the Primal Burst F1 skills. You immediately gain 10 adrenaline on activation and this will let you immediately use the new Primal Burst skills. Cannot be deactivated once it is active so if you want your regular F1 skills back you need to wait it out. Attack speed bonus is only 10% as opposed to the 33% from the datamine (/u/that_shaman shoutout!) * While in Berserk mode, your adrenaline bar goes down to 1 gauge (10 adrenaline) instead of 3 gauges (30 adrenaline). * Primal Burst skills have a shorter cooldown (5s only) so you can fire off 3 Primal burst skills while in Berserk. * Flaming Fury: Sword F1 skill. Change your standard sword flurry F1 skill to shoot fireballs. It will cut down any projectiles as well. This skill will not place Bleed or immobilize on the enemy so you will need to pick the regular sword F1 if you want those. * Arcing Sear: Greatsword F1 skill. Creates an expanding ring of fire. You can interact with this fire field to get combos. Much wider area than the standard Arcing Slice. Give access to fire field apart from the longbow. Each ring of this field creates burning so if the enemy tries to run through it they will take burning on each hit. * Scorched Earth: Longbow F1 skill. Fires a projectile that leaves behind a trail of fire fields. The arrow itself doesnt do any much damage, it is the fire fields it leaves after that will deal the most. The fire field lasts shorter than the standard F1 longbow fire field but you can cast this one more often and it has a total range of 1000. * Gun Flame: Rifle F1 skill. It is similar to the regular Rifle F1 but it also dazes the target and does less damage. When it hits the target it explodes so if you are running the piercing trait you can get a lot of hits. The number of targets may get toned down later. * Skull Grinder: Mace F1 skill. Applies lots of conditions  daze, blindness, weakness, confusing, cripple. Act as a blast finisher. Similar to Skull Crack but inflicts much more conditions. Since it also * Rupturing Smash: Hammer F1 skill. Doesnt stun anymore but creates shockwaves that cascades in 5 directions with each cascade acting as a knockback. Enemies only get knocked back once by the cascade. It is a great clear out move/displacement tool. * Decapitate: Axe F1 skill. Does less damage than Eviscerate but also hit up to 5 enemies behind your primary target. Works well with your Blood Reckoning heal skill. **Traits** *** * Tooltips: URL Minor * Primal Rage: Give you access to the Primal Burst skills and usage of Torch * Always Angry: Much like Opening Strike from Rangers. Give warriors 10 extra adrenaline when they enter combat. Recharge as soon as you exit combat. * Fatal Frenzy: Give you a short duration quickness (2s) when you activate Berserk mode. First line of adept/master/GM traits is all about going wild and beating the crap out of enemies. Second line is more focused on burning/condition damage. Last line focuses on survivability. Adept * Smash Brawler: Reduce the recharge skill of your primal burst skills by 5s when you kill a foe. More of a PvE trait since you are not killing enemies too often in PvP. Allow you basically use your Primal Burst skills back to back with no cooldowns as long you have the adrenaline. Even if you dont take this trait, you can reduce the recharge of your Primal Burst skills by picking Burst Mastery in the Discipline line. * Last Blaze: Set foes on fire when you use a Rage skill. Berserk is also a Rage skill so you can set foes on fire by simply activating Berserk mode. Adds lots of burning to foes. * Savage Instinct: Break stuns and remove conditions when you enter berserk mode. You can use this to break the stun from Head Butt by activating it first and then immediately go to Berserk mode. Major * Blood Reaction: Nice stat boost for ferocity. Gain 7% of your Precision as Ferocity. This doubles to 14% if you are in Berserk mode. * Heat the Soul: +150 condition damage and 20% reduced recharge on torch skills. * Dead or Alive: If you take fatal damage while Berserking, you will prevent the death and heal you for a flat amount + amount of adrenaline you have left. This will end the Berserk mode early. The heal can get up to 4-5k HP. Grandmaster * Bloody Roar: Summon cool maguma rocks around you when you activate Berserk. It will taunt foes and bleed them with rocks. Nearby foes will be taunted for longer and bleed longer. * King of Fires: Increase the burning duration by 20% and spread burning to nearby foes when you crit against burning foes. Has a 2s recharge. * Eternal Champion: Get pulsing stability in Berserk mode. Gain stability also when you break a stun. Make it harder for you to get restunned. "
344,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Suggestions for two Berserker changes,0,3i0ho9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3i0ho9/suggestions_for_two_berserker_changes/,2015-08-23 07:48:05,"Hey, I'd like to give two suggestion for Berserker - for Axe Primal Burst **Decapitate** and for Berserker Major Master Trait change - **Heat the Soul**. You can read everything if you're interested in my thought process or just skip to highlighted links to see the changes. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- #Decapitate -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Let's start off with Decapitate. In the previewed form, this skill, from my point of view, suffers from being too similar to regular Burst - Eviscerate. In general across all Primal Bursts we see lack of just incredibly heavy hitting attack. Why is that? Well, they can have bursts on basically 4s cooldown. Now, [Decapitate in Guild Wars 1](URL was heavy-hitter, but with a **trade-off** that isn't present in GW2 version - lose of all Adrenaline *and Energy*. How can we preserve the feeling of old GW1 skill, make it hit *potentially* very hard, have the trade-off and risk and make it different from Eviscerate while synergizing with other game mechanics? #[Suggested Change](URL It's quite simple: 1. *Make it shorter range (to match Arcing Slice's range)* - and replace Leap finisher with Blast one. You'll need to set up this one in order to score a good hit, probably. 2. *Change animation* - Decapitate uses almost the same animation as Eviscerate. Give it more ""powerful"" feeling. 3. *Make it feel powerful* - Basic numbers are always there to change. I've just made up some values. However, the strenght of this skill is it's interaction with Vulnerability. Every stack of this condition increases this skill's damage by **not 1%, but 2%**. Which means with 25 Vuln stacks it's +50% damage. 4. **Give it a trade-off** - Now that's mechanic I personally like - When you score the hit, all your utilities are unavalible to press for following 2 seconds. It doesn't play with cooldowns or passives/already activated effects. What it means for example is that after you score a hit with Decapitate, your Headbutt or Outrage will be unavalible for 2s no matter what. This downtime could be reduced to 1s or 1,5s if it was too harmful. 5. *Give it synergy* - This skill is obviously a Blast Finisher. Now it also gets great benefit from Vulnerability. What does it mean for Warrior alone? Well, Axe #2 stacks a bit of it, Arms traitline has it, but the best on-demand application is from...""On My Mark"", rather underused shout. It could possibly see more use! As a result we have a Primal Burst skill that feels different, powerful, synergizing and rewarding if you're willing to take a risk. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- #Heat the Soul -&gt; Boiling Blood -------------------------------------------------------------------------- As for this trait - It could've been more. More rewarding, more exciting. We already have plenty of flat stat increases all around Core Specializations - why should they haunt new and shiny Elite ones? Cooldown reduction stays. When it comes to playing with Torch cooldowns, sometimes it's better to keep it easy and simple, isn't it Mesmers? :) As for the Condition damage increase...Looking at the Revenant mechanics and ""vanilla"" mechanics used very often even by new Elite Specializations, I wonder why are new Revenant's not used more often. Here, I'm talking specifically about **Healing Orbs spawned by Revenant's Staff 3rd Auto Attack**. It's pretty cool idea, is less ""direct"" and less ""passive"" so the reward can be increased. So why don't we use this mechanic, but flip the concept? Now it helps with offense. But not only you, also your allies! #**[Suggested Change](URL After you use your Burst skill, you will spawn Blood Orbs around, which, when picked up, will increase Condition damage. You have to move in order to pick them up, so more effort=more reward, max stacked you would have 100 condition damage more than it's current boring passive version and your Condition damage dealers would love you for running this trait. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hopefully you like it. Big thanks for /u/that_shaman for creating his awesome tooltip creator tool : URL Cheers, Rym "
345,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Thieves who wanted rifle spec instead of staff,0,3igvbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3igvbb/thieves_who_wanted_rifle_spec_instead_of_staff/,2015-08-27 00:05:56,"Pouring one out for all those who held out hope for rifle thieves. How would you make the elite specialization? What theme would it be like? What skills or traits would you have associated the spec with? I would have called the elite spec ""Deadeye"", considering there are enemies in the game with that title (Risen Deadeye, for example). There's also two NPCs that have that title, one of them being a human bandit named [Deadeye Della](URL The elite spec could possibly cover the opposite end of daredevils. Whereas daredevils cover evasion and martial arts, rifle thief elite spec could focus on stealth and exploiting distance (not just with a rifle). Possible aspects of the trait line could be: * **Bonuses and benefits for long range scenarios.** Example would be making all your attacks deal some stacks of vulnerability (for a very short duration) if you hit your target beyond a range threshold. Ricochet trait could belong here. * **Benefit while having revealed debuff (like Revealed Training)**, as a defensive aspect. Example would be short swiftness/vigor when revealed debuff is applied. * **Debilitating conditions.** This aspect of the rifle thief could focus on applying cripple/immobilize/weakness/etc, and also gain bonuses against enemies inflicted with these conditions (varied crit chance vs. debilitated targets, like 25% vs. crippled or 50% vs. immobilized). Maybe the minor traits could be something like ""Gain a Lesser version of Haste when entering stealth"" or ""Your first (few?) strike when entering combat is unblockable"". As for profession mechanic, seeing how daredevil did something simple (+50 endurance to the dodge bar), it's safe to make one up that doesn't change the playstyle as much as other elite specs. Though /u/Ionith has the idea of an ""ammo"" swap that can imbue any of your skills with conditions. I propose that it affects any weapon skill (so you can use this mechanic with a dagger, for example), and that it has a low chance to inflict a debilitating condition of the player's choice, with its duration based on how much initiative the weapon skill cost. Something a bit similar to herald's facet of nature when activated. I'm not sure what healing/utility/elite skill type this elite spec could get, but I'd love to see gadgets from engineers. I'd like to give this elite spec a more modern tech flavor (building up from the pistol theme). A heartbeat sensor gadget that emits a pulse of slow and revealed debuff on nearby enemies would be helpful to a rifle skill set that relies on targeting. A smoke emitting gadget could place a smoke field AoE on the spot that gives an evading buff to all allies standing in it (similar to chronomancer's Well of Precognition), while also functioning as a stunbreak. There are a lot of ways the rifle thief spec could have been, and it's worth bearing in mind that we could get more elite specializations per profession in the future. At the very least, it'd be nice to have Ricochet trait back and also have a proper 1200 ranged dmg option with a sensible skill set. Looking at you, p/p."
346,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[sPvP] Current builds and their counters,0,3bogwz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3bogwz/spvp_current_builds_and_their_counters/,2015-07-01 07:20:53,"**TLDR:** Everything is OP, therefore nothing is.** We have had a week to test out the new trait and condition system, and PvP has been utter chaos, which I loved. Many people, however, are a little less positive to say the least. I have seen a lot of complaints of people saying 'X is too OP, Y needs to be nerfed.' I will list (most of) the commonly seen builds, and how they can be countered. Notable builds are listed per profession, all of these can be found on [Metabattle](URL **Warrior** * *Shoutbow*: Shoutbow is still a fantastic build, maybe even more so after the patch. With condi cleanse becoming more important than ever, this build is the king of group support. This build does not fare well against power builds, so use that to your advantage. * *Condi*: A condi build can be a pretty decent option. Good access to burning, bleeding, and even confusion if you opt for a Distracting Strikes build. Be aware that DS condi warriors might run Rampage. * *Power*: Speaking of Rampage, power Warriors eat babies. These builds are insanely strong, but lack utility. Interestingly, Rampage is one of the hardest things to counter (undermining my initial argument..). Hard to DPS down, hard to snare (decreased duration + good gap closers), your best of is blinds/blocks and/or range. The only full counter is the moa transform from Mesmers or Engis, as they override transforms. **Guardian** * *Bunker*: The problem with the previous bunker builds was that they were very passive, but with the improved ""Feel My Wrath!"", the bunker guardian has defensive *and* offensive support. Because of its many blocks and blinds, this build is also better suited against power builds. It can, however, be whittled down with conditions. * *Condi*: Guardians are the king of burning. It's a double-edged sword however, because you rely on only one condition. Strong cleansers (ranger survival builds, d/d eles and the shoutbow war) are a bad matchup for you. * *Power*: The medi guard builds still work, but you're heavily reliant on hitting Whirling Wrath (or Mighty Blow if playing with hammer). Heavy conditions wear you down quickly after you've popped your Virtue and Contemplation of Purity. You're squishy in general, but can hold off some direct damage with blocks and blinds. **Engineer** * *Cele Rifle*: Nade Barrage is actually broken. Other than that, this build is a good condi/power hybrid, and is still very weak to other conditions. * *Pistol Condi*: The engineer stood first in line when the condi patch hit. Access to every condition in a reliable way with ranged weapons to keep your distance, makes for a great build. Other condition builds can kill you fast, however. * *HGH Elixirs*: Elixirs rise in popularity again, because they provide might and some decent condi cleanse, which the engineer severely lacks. **Thief** * *D/P*: Y'all know how this works. It's either kill or be killed. Most Guardians can counter these builds reliably with Aegis and blinds. * *S/D*: Little more sustain through evades and less affected by snares because of 'Don't Stop' at the cost of some burst capabilities. * *Other*: Condition builds or trap builds feel gimmicky to me, but could work. **Ranger** * *Power Survival*: Pew Pew is back! Strong condi cleanse, good ranged DPS, dies when hit by a breeze (or when Signet of Stone runs out). * *Condi Survival*: Rangers have good access to poison, bleeding and burning. Coupled with a lot of evades makes for a very strong 1v1 build. Has almost no team support and dies quite fast if you get caught in the middle of team fights. **Elementalist** * *Cele Ele*: D/D is still very strong and the epitome of a Jack of all Traits. Great team support, condi cleanse and offensive presence after might stacking. The staff build plays very differently, but is also very good. Both builds have trouble with burst DPS. One can opt for a more defensive build by going in Earth, or more offensive by going in Fire. * *Burning Ele*: This could technically work, but feels a bit gimmicky to me and is heavily reliant on burning damage. Might also be outclassed by the burning guardian. * *Fresh Air Burst*: This patch was exactly what the burst ele needed. Besides Fire and Air, going in Arcana (or even Earth) let's you pick the much-needed defensive options so you don't die when someone looks at you. Keep in mind that you're still a one-trick pony, almost completely the opposite of the D/D ele. **Mesmer** * *All GS shatter builds*: Can go full burst with Greatsword + Sword/Torch or Staff. Domination has three very potent Grandmaster Traits, which greatly affect your build and playstyle. Mantras or a pistol can even be used for access to more interrupts. Can be countered by strong DPS and gap closers (medi guards and D/P thieves), or even strong condi builds, as this build lacks condition removal (even with the torch traited). * *Scepter Condi*: Again, this build feels very gimmicky. Besides confusion, the chaos traitline provides access to a lot of random conditions, which might make it hard stack up condition damage. Even when traited, the scepter feels slow and I can't help but see this build as wasted potential vs all the Greatsword burst builds available. **Necromancer** * *Power Necro*: Good damage and some much-needed sustain through Blood Magic. Transfusion is hilarious, but has to compete with Vampiric Rituals. Consume Conditions is is now a corruption skill: opting for it gives you a good condi cleanse, but the vulnerability it now applies greatly hinders your sustain. Despite the sustain from Blood Magic, still very squishy and easy to burst down. * *Minion Master*: Well, yea... * *Terrormancer*: Great vs builds that lack Stability or hard condi cleanse, this build might see a rise in popularity again, mainly because of increased sustain and better boon corruption through traits. Despite that, it's a squishy build and quite hard to play. Let me know if I missed any obvious builds. Let's discuss the PvP situation! *Note:* GW2's PvP has always had a hefty dose of rock-paper-scissors in its gameplay, even before the patch. Best example is the (old) medi guard being an almost full counter against D/P thieves. Matchups are never impossible, and still dependent on player skill, but on average, a guard comes out on top."
347,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Thief Specialization: The Assaulter! (Concept),0,3br7u9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3br7u9/thief_specialization_the_assaulter_concept/,2015-07-02 00:28:13,"Since we got no reveal this week, enjoy the blog entry for my idea of the Thief's specialization: We are proud to present the newest Guild Wars 2 Specialization: The Assaulter! Carrying his Rifle around the battlefield, The Assaulter will pressure enemies from a long distance with a rain of condition and unpaired resilience. Using a combination of venomous shots and strikes, once an Assaulter has you, hes not letting go. * Brand new class mechanic: **Assault!** The F1 steal has been replaced with the Assault skill. Once you assault an enemy, you will shadowstep to him and then back to your original position. But before you leave, they better check their pockets for a little gift. Body Mines are the newest form of havoc spreading the Assaulter is bringing. Once an enemy is assaulted, a mine will be left at his back, visibly ticking off for 3 seconds before exploding. Once it does, the mine will inflict the enemy with a variable set of conditions depending on what the Assaulter has previously determined with his F2 and F3 skills: **Mine Charge and Mine Set-up.** * **F2 skill: Mine Charge! Mine Charge** will work as follows: Every time you use it, it will consume all of you Initiative Points, leaving you in zero and charging your **Assault** skill, making it stronger the most IP you had. The number of condition stacks Assault will inflict will raise up by for every two Initiative Points you charge it using **Mine Charge**, so if you used it with a 10 IP, you next assault will inflict 5 stacks of conditions! * **F3 skill: Mine Set-up!** This ability is now your brand new F3 skill. It will cost 2 IP and will allow you to stack the conditions your Assault skill will inflict. It has a 1 seconds cool down and takes up to 4 stacks, going as follows: * 1st stack: Confusion * 2nd stack:. Bleed and vulnerability * 3rd stack:. Poison and cripple * 4th stack: Torment and Burn This set of skills paired with the use of the Rifle as a new weapon accessible for Thieves, makes the Assaulter a force to be reckoned with if given the time to prepare. Come back tomorrow to find out how the Assaulter will make use of Bundles! *(I hate when this happens)* In the meanwhile, you better watch your steps, because you might get Assaulted! See you in game."""
348,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Corruption Open World PvE/WvW Necromancer!,7,3bu0x9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3bu0x9/corruption_open_world_pvewvw_necromancer/,2015-07-02 13:39:33,"Hey all, I have always loved my corruption-mancer and felt the pain when ""Master of Corruption"" sort of worsened Corruption skills (I mean really, why would I want to be blinded and vulnerable when I heal?) But I digress, I still use my corruption-mancer and, frankly, I feel like my build got stronger! To begin, this is a hybrid. You'll want celestial gear. I know, why the hell would you want to cripple yourself so much? Well, I will explain. Take a look at the [build](URL ! So, as you can see, we are taking celestial armor and trinkets with Strength Runes. I understand that all of that is extremely expensive and time consuming to get, but allow me to make a case for it in the post to come. Also, note that the scepter/dagger are rabid and the dagger/focus is berserker; obviously, s/d will be the ""condition"" portion while the d/f will be the ""power"" set. We use Strength Runes because we can *easily* stack 25 might on ourselves in a fight. Between ""Blood is Power"", our dagger giving us might on crit (Sigil of Strength), Reaper's Might, and Siphoned Power, plus the might duration of our runes, our power and condition damage goes through the roof (as much as celestial will allow). I'm talking about casual, solo roaming 4k dagger AA's just doing map completion in Orr with no food. Finally, to finish off the gear, we need to know the sigils for our weapons. On the scepter, take Sigil of Earth (can't have enough bleeds, especially with the condi cap increase) and on the dagger, take Sigil of Corruption (heh) cause more condi damage is always fun. On the dagger, take Sigil of Strength, as previously stated, and on the focus, take Sigil of Torment, for more unique conditions. Now, let me give reasons for the traits. In Spite, we take: * ""Spiteful Renewal"" because we put a lot of conditions on ourselves and we need to get them off, and the heal that it gives is influenced by our decent amount of healing power. It gives a heal of about 1000. * ""Rending Shroud"" because we will usually stay in shroud for a little bit of time getting might and giving off burns, so more vulnerability in an area is helpful for us and allies. * ""Close to Death"" because it is a huge damage boost to already weak foes. Never change this. * Our minor, ""Reapor's Might"" gives 22 seconds of might per cast, our second minor ""Death's Embrace"" makes foes more vulnerable at low health, and our final minor ""Siphoned Power"" gives **TWO** stacks of might per attack (one second ICD) on foes with 50% or less health. Next is Curses: * ""Plague Sending"" gives us even more condition removal, by sending five conditions to a foe on our next critical hit when we have three or more conditions on ourselves. 30 ICD. * ""Master of Corruption"" because we usually have three Corruption skills, ""CC"", ""Blood is Power"", and either ""Epidemic"" (PvE) or ""Corrupt Boon"" WvW. And because it gives us more condis, we have more conditions to consume with ""Spiteful Renewal"", send with ""Plague Sending"", or even dagger #4 skill! * ""Lingering Curse"" is my choice for the final trait, as 100% increased scepter conditions and 150 condition damage is just too good and speaks for itself. However, I have used ""Parasitic Contagion"" in WvW and places such as the Silverwastes and the healing you can get with a well placed ""Epidemic"" makes me feel like a true death dealing, on the edge of life and death, Necromancer. *Minors for Curses give us ""Barbed Precision"", for more bleeding and increased bleeding duration. ""Furious Demise"" for ~57% critical hit chance for five seconds, upon entering Shroud. Finally, ""Target the Weak"", giving us 2% more critical hit chance per condition on our target, meaning 28% crit chance if the target has all fourteen conditions (unlikely but possible). Furthermore, ""TtW"" gives us more condition damage based on our precision. Finally, Soul Reaping: * For PvE, I normally take ""Unyielding Blast"" for piercing damage and two stacks of vuln to each enemy struck. For WvW, I usually take ""Speed of Shadows"" for decreased recharge of Shroud and increased speed while in Shroud. * ""Vital Persistence"" reduced recharge of Shroud skills and decreased passive drain of life force. Self explanatory trait, as we don't use Wells and fear isn't part of our damage. * ""Dhummfire"" is my choice for two reasons, first: it looks bad ass. Two, it burns for three seconds, meaning we can stack about three stacks of burning on each foe we hit. ""Foot in the Grave"" isn't really worth it for one stack of stability. ""Death Perception"" is good but it would put us over 100% crit chance because of fury and ""Target the Weak"". ""Dhuumfire"" gives more damage and more unique conditions for us, giving more crit chance. That is why I take it. *To wrap up the trait section, the first minor trait is ""Gluttony"", meaning our life force gain from dagger AA, focus #4, and scepter #3 are all increased. ""Last Gasp"" gives us spectral armor when we get low on health. ""Strength of Undeath"" gives a bigger pool of Life Force (getting us about 20k life force) and increased damage when above 50% life force. More damage? I'll take it. Take either ""Flesh Golem"" or ""Lich Form"" for your elite. I don't care that we are running a corruption build, ""Plague"" is garbage. Edit*- I forgot to make a case for full celestial: we obviously need condition damage, power, and precision, so why not use sinister? Because we need vitality to allow us to take our own conditions for long enough to transfer them. Furthermore, the healing power we get is really noticeable with ""Spiteful Renewal"", ""Consume Conditions"", and if you run a variant where you go into Blood Magic rather than Soul Reaping, ""Transfusion"" is a beautiful thing. The ferocity is also amazing, and something you dont get with sinister gear. That is how you'll see Life Blasts of 6000 or more, let alone gruesome dagger AA that shred foes who think you're a condition build and get in your face. The toughness is just a nice bonus. That's the build! If you hate it, I'm sorry. I don't run it where I need a ""meta"" build. I think the necromancer is an awesome, cool class and this build has done wonders for me for quite some time. If you have any questions, feel free to ask! If a video of it in action or explained better is needed, let me know. I think my voice sounds douchy but I'll be glad to help. "

It's not that time consuming, not to think of any concept. Just changes the number in some skills to help up damage or utility a little bit I didn't say it need to be buff to other classes level but just to relieve the problem Necromancers are facing for 2 years This is some changes that I can think of (Just the example of number changes) * Tainted Shackles - increase the Torment stack inflicted by this skill to 6 (from 3 stacks) * Rending Shroud trait - decrease the Interval time to 2 seconds (from 3 seconds) * Rending Curse - increase the bleed stack to 2 (from 1 stack) * Putrid Curse - increase the poison stack to 2 (from 1 stack) * Consume Condition - decrease the vulnerability to 3 (from 5 stacks) * Blood is Power - increase the Might duration to 15 seconds (from 8 seconds) * Mark of Blood - increase the bleed stack to 4 stacks (from 2 stacks) * Ghastly Claw - increase the base damage to 1500 (from 1072) , increase the Power ratio to 3.1 (from 2.8) * Necrotic Stab - increase the damage and power ratio to match the Necrotic Slash (from 235 to 302 and ratio from 0.7 to 0.9) * Feast of Corruption - increase the Damage per Condition from 8% to 15% and life force gained from 3% to 10% For some explanation : a. The condition that Necro can push out are going up for condition build to help compete with build like Condi Engineer b.The damage also going up a little for power build except for channel skill like Ghastly claw that going up by a considerable amount because it should reward you for not being interrupted It's just the number changes to make it better but still not optimal compare to other class (If something appear to be op you can easily tune this down later) Anet pls Edit for clarity : I don't say that the changes I implement is good because I'm not the dev. I just put up some examples to help you understand my concept easier. "
352,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Is this build cool? Or is it dumb?,0,3ct8lv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3ct8lv/is_this_build_cool_or_is_it_dumb/,2015-07-11 02:14:42,"I made a post in my gaming community forums about this build, but nobody replied... So I've decided to consult reddit! I'll just copy and paste what I put there... So, usually I suck at making builds. But I have made a (pathetic) attempt to make a (probably not) viable support build for PvE by adapting the one on metabattle. It focuses on granting auras which grants extra shit and conjures... which grant auras. The reason I think it is viable is because I have all the stats for high damage output as the build relies on auras and so is not affected by stats (I don't think) I'm looking for feedback? How can I improve this? should I scrap this and go straight back to another damage focused player? Should I go for the air trait line or the earth trait line? etc I dunno how to do this, guess I'll just write everything... So I've gone for staff, my heal is Arcane Brilliance. Utility skills are Lightning hammer, glyph of storms and Ice bow and my elite skill is fiery greatsword. I use berserker armor with Runes of fire.... My staff has Sigil of accuracy and Sigil of strength For the traits Fire: Empowering flame: Grants power whilst attuned to fire Conjurer: Increases conjure weapon charges and grants a fire aura when I use a conjure and pick it up... However I am also thinking of using Burning precision: 33% chance to burn on crit Sunspot: Flame blast and fire aura on attuning to fire One with fire: Fire aura gives 2 stacks of might Burning Rage: Grants 10% damage to burning foes Blinding ashes: Blind foes you burn... However I have also thought of using Persisting flames: which gives fury when I execute a blast finisher on a fire field Water: Soothing Mist: gives health to allies whilst attuned to water Piercing shards: Gives 20% damage to foes with vulnerability... OR Soothing ice: Gain regeneration and frost aura when crit Healing ripple: Heal allies when attuning to water Aquamancers training: Gain 10% damage whilst above 90% health Aquatic benevolence: Increase healing by 15% Powerful aura: When I gain an aura, I also give it up to 5 nearby allies &lt;--- basically why it is a supportive Last trait line I don't know whether to choose Lightning or Earth.... But here are the highlights of each Earth makes me tankier which is useful for when I use lightning hammer, I can also grant protection with each aura However for lightning has much better synergy with the rest of the build and is more damage based, if I use lightning I might swap lightning hammer for flame axe due to squishyness. Fist off, Bolt to the heart granting 20% damage to foes below 50% health I also have the choice between Zephyr's Boon which grants fury and swiftness with auras which fury is cool and all, but everyone plays berserker, so everyone has a higher crit chance then the chance of me still being a virgin in 40 years. Alternatively I could go for ferocious winds which grants ferocity based on precision. I also have Weak spot which has a 60% chance to inflict vulnerabilty on crit... great synergy with Piercing shards Finally there is tempest defense which grants a shock aura when disabled. So what do you Guild Wars SUPER META WARLORDS think? Also just real quick, is there a sigil that grants a chance to burn? So I can have Conjurer on and sleep at night Thanks for all the help  Edit: Just thought I'd add a quick explanation of the auras that I (without combo's with other players) will have access to. Fire Aura burns foes and grants might when struck Frost aura chills foes that strike you and reduces incoming damage by 10% Magnetic Aura reflects projectiles (maybe) Shocking aura stuns foes that stike you with a 2 second cooldown for each foe And just a reminder, when I get an aura, so do nearby allies, also I'll grant 2 stacks of might per fire aura and depending on how I build, either protection or fury and swiftness or nothing for every aura Again, Thanks, all help is appreciated. And sorry for my shit format "
353,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Revenant overhaul. Need feedback,1,3d3zhh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3d3zhh/revenant_overhaul_need_feedback/,2015-07-13 19:50:38,"In the world of Tyria where people run ridiculous bursts, insta abilities, a lot of stuns and conditions revenant cannot survive. At some point he really feels like hes coming from the other world sadly in not a positive way. I see what you did here, revenant vs revenant is actually fun and skillful but vs everything else he stands no chance. With current classes and their cheese mechanics revenant doesnt belong in this game. The potential is here, but some stuff needs rework/tweaks. Overall revenant animations are too clunky. He lacks of survival tools like blocks, evades, invuls, boons to reduce damage, stunbreaks, condition removal, mobility on weapon skills. Paired with poor healing despite having 2 healing skills doesnt allow him to sustain properly. Healing skills on it own needs a buff as they dont heal for much at all. Take a look at ""we heal as one"" and ""healing signet"" - both of them heal for far more, not olny that but ""we heal as one also"" provides aoe regen and swiftness when trained, even aoe condi removal with tropper runes. Revenant healing skills are not even close. Weapons seems to be made within just one legend in mind. Utility skills on it own arent that powerful either. Many of them are too situation and cannot be swapped at all for something more useful. I dont understand why unlike other classes we cannot insta swap legend without empty vessel trait. If we dont get this trait we cannot swap under cc at all nor while executing a skill.. It feels like someone made it on a purpose and force us pick up this terrible invocation line which doesnt have much connection to profession mechanic at all. Its really, really bad. Placing stunbreak on legend swap doesnt work. It reset energy, it changes our whole set of utilities..often its just better to wait out the stun than swap, not to mention that revenant rely on swaps so most likely we wont have access to stunbreak when we need it. Another thing is energy management, to be precise utility skills eat a lot of energy forcing us to spam aa just to collect enough energy for some utility skills. Everything revenant does consume energy to the point where we cannot continue using weapon skills as we have to collect energy for utility skills. That makes no sense, might as well just give weapon skills no cd at this point. Even healing skill consume small amount of energy...yet i i feel it should be opposite. A trait in invocation to actually provide a bit of energy by using healing skill would be pretty good. The concept of energy is similiar to a thief initiative. But the thing is thief is an huge advantage here. His healing skill doesnt cost initiative, his utiliy skills doesnt cost initiative, he also happens to have utility skills/trait to enhance initiative regeneration and increase the cap. If a thief runs out of initiative he can still use autoattack and his utility skills. Thats not the case of revenant where if you run out of energy you cant do anything but autoattack. I dont think it should work this way. I prepared a long list about stuff that is weak with sugegstions how to buff/rework it. I will start from general issues; * Remove weapon energy cost - please stop forcing us to build up energy for utility skills by not using weapon skill. The utility cost is already high enough on it own.If you want to keep up energy cost on weapon skills, remove their cd. * Weapon themes - consider modifing weapon skills based on legends, Mallyx causing conditions, protective boons on Jalis, healing on Ventari, offensive boons on Shiro. As it stands now weapons are too heavily tied towards one legend leaving another one subpar. Thats why people asking for unnecessary weapon swap. Fashion stuff - animations adapt to the color theme of channeled legend, like purple hammer swings while channeling Mallyx. Examples with how field of the mist and staff orbs could be modified; Jalis would continue blocking as it stands now and gain retaliaton for blocked projectiles. Staff orbs could provide protection Ventari would heal a percentage of incoming projectile damage. Staff orbs heals as it is right now Mallyx would reflect them instead. Reflected projectiles would cause bleeding. Staff orbs would would provide resistance Shiro reflect instead and gains vigor. Staff orbs could provide fury I made full list for hammer skills at the buttom. * Revenant need survival tools which you could roll into utility skills - these would naturally be stunbreak, condition removal. Revenant needs higher sustain than other classes considering the fact that hes pretty much melee oriented. I also think that revenant needs defiance bar like noone else in their elite spec. * Aftercast is too high, it need to be reduced across the board, there are also troubles with skill queue possibly for that reason. I press the key, i press it again..nothing. Feels like i have 1000ping or something. * Lack of mobility on weapon sets which will force everyone to pick up Shiro, and once we leave that legend we will end up without any mobility for 10 seconds. Shiro should help maintain to stay on top of enemy, but he shouldnt be necessary to have any sort of mobility. How we are supposed to close the gap to anyone without gap closers in weapon sets? * Instant legend swap should be baseline. No uh, ah but. It has to happen. Imagine ele being forced to trait for insta swap attunements..can you imagine that rage? * [Bug]Many abilities which causes effect on ground doesnt work on uneven terrain like coalescence of ruin, phase smash, temporal rift. That is game breaking and it must be fixed. * Utility skills - lets be honest, we need more utility skills to swap for something else. Current skills are not that bad but they need some tweaking. Thing is some of them are too situational, pain absorption is the best example of that. Decent in teamfights, useless everywhere else. I think we all can agree that we need a ways to customize our skills outside of a legend choice to make interesing builds or at least rework current ones. * Fashion stuff..legend should talk more often. Much more. Where are all that dialogues gone? No wonder revenant is weak when enemies cant feel the true ultimate power of Mallyx. Weapon; * Hammer Overall feel of this weapon feels clucky, it is supposed to be our olny one long range power weapon but as it stands now it doesnt do any damage at all, and thats not because damage coefficient is low but because how slow this weapon is. It also goes with theme the futher you shoot the more damage you does..so naturally you want to stay at maximum range. And here we got a problem - hammer has no abilities to kite foes. Its quite easy to stay on top of hammer revenant at all times as we cannot get away or knockback/launch someone. Ranger on longbow has low cd knockback with a decent distance, stealth and a pet to cripple/chill/immo/knockdown and lately when trained also taunt. As we can see hammer cannot compete. Hammer bolt - reduce casttime to 0.75sec, increase damage by 10% Coalescence of ruin - Eruption of energy should happen slighty faster. I feel like the whole damage of hammer is backloaded into this single skill at max range which then can be avoided by strafing. It wont work. If we make it deal current max damage at all times it will be broken, if we keep it in current state it wont be good either with so many gap closers people have nowdays. We need something in middle with slighty higher cd. Current damage at second eruption with 4 or 5 cd? Phase smash - As i mentioned hammer has no mobility. I propose to make this one our mobility skill so we can get some much needed breath room by leaping away with ability to shadowstep back similiar to thief sword 2 skill. This skill should also provide evade frames during leap. Increase cd to 10 seconds. Shadowstep ability last 3 seconds, can be used under cc. Field of the mists - Promotes backpedaling, but strong defense against projectiles as tradeoff. Sadly it useless against melee foes. My proposition is to reduce castime to 0.50sec with a small 240 knockback in melee range. The animations fits it perfectly already. Drop the hammer - Would be a fine, decent skill if...not that casttime. With current long animation we losing pressure on a target which can walk out of the radius before the cast even finish. That skills needs desperately some serious lowered casttime. It already has huge tell so i believe 0.75 sec casttime is more than enough. * Mace A condition weapon which was supposed to be fast paced and...doesnt work. The base torment duration on aa is too low considering the fact we have to apply it in melee range. Another problem is that while aa on it own is fast paced, searing fissue is simply out of place due to high casttime. Echoing eruption feels alright howered it could apply some condition along with damage. I know it main purpose is to mightstack but as it stand now its nearly impossible to do that in combat. That straight forward fire field combined with this skill is simply unreliable in a mobile game like GW. What i propose; Misery swipe and anguish swipe - Increase torment duration to 5 seconds. Buff direct damage. Manifest toxin - Should apply 2 stacks of poison. Reduce duration to 5seconds. Make the field longer (600 like jalis road) as backpedaling to use echoing eruption doesnt work in pvp at all on melee set. Echoing Eruption - apply 2 stacks of bleeding on each hit. * Axe Hybrid weapon created to work with mace. Overall this weapon isnt that bad but it need some tweaks. Frigit Blitz - Reduce cooldown to 8 seconds. Nothing less, nothing more. We need mobility and this skill is a good candidate for that one. We cannot escape fight with it so i believe its justiced at this point. Temporal rift - increase range of the pull, right now its too easy to walk out of range. Make it ground targeted ability like Into the Void. Buff direct damage by 20% * Staff Fun weapon but the damage is simply too weak, now i understand that staff is not designed to do dps but in this case it should provide a bit more defense outside of a block with 10cd if that is a support weapon. AA - The healing doesnt not make up for the low damage this weapon has. Punishing sweep&gt;debilitating slam - Completely useless skill. First i have to time it right and take damage from an attack just so i can apply 3sec weakness withamount of damage with huge 1sec windup? Useless. Rework it to provide counterattack instead similiar to ranger gs 4. I propose block duration 1.5 seconds, can be triggered in melee range olny. When counter land apply weakness to your foe. Counter block animation 0.50sec Warding rift - Awesome skill. I love it. Renewing Wave - Remove selfroot and decrease casttime to 0.75sec. Increase radius to 600. Surge of the mists - Interesing skill. Howered i believe it should apply evade frames for skill duration. After all we taking a mist form during this skill. Legend skills; * Jalis Jalis was supposed to be a tank legend yet failed miserably at his job. Rite of the dward doesnt work in current state and never will. It also happen to be his olny way to reduce damage on us, inspiring reinforcement is too unreliable to work and vengeful hammers are useless. What i would do assuming revenant will get build in class mechanic tools i mentioned; Soothing Stone - Current value is too low. Sweet spot would be 5500 or lowered cd. 2 second block duration, reset the skill if interrupted like Shelter. Increase casttimeme to 1.25sec. Inspiring reinforcement - Let it apply stability right once the skill goes off. Right now delay in which stability is applied kills this skill. I wasnt able to get stability in time to prevent cc simply due to the fact that i have to wait too long in a small field to get any stability. It wont work that way, stability must be applied instantly. Increase energy cost to 35. Make it a stunbreak ability. Vengeful hammers - Buff it damage, really just do it. As it stands now it damage is too low for the casttime it needs. Consider to buff it damage by at least 25% and let the hammers apply 1sec of protection to allies they pass. Apply pulsing retaliaton to revenant while this skill is up. Theres also one problem about this skill as well - hammers keep disappearing if they run into a objectice, its gamebreaking considering the fact how many obstracled we have in this game, not to mention the overall well know bugged ground. It happened few times to me where the hammers dissapeared on a flat terrain due to the bugged ground. Forced engagement - Reduce the cost to 35 energy. Remove 2 conditions on yourself upon skill activation (doesnt matter if it land or not) Rite of the dwarf - Remove it stunbreak function. Make it an upkeep skill effecting olny revenant. Keep casttime as it is. 10 energy/sec, 25 energy cost. Reduce casttime to 2 seconds. * Mallyx Overall this legend feels alright when it comes to animations and casttimes. Howered the condition threshold should be reduced to 2. Its quite hard to maintain 3 conditions on yourself when not fightng a condition build, and in teamfight condi cleanse flying everywhere nowdays. I dont think condition duration should have affect self inflicted conditions. Empowerering Misery - A worse version of consume conditions. It also doesnt heal for a lot if you dont fight condition builds. Make it heal for 6500 and apply 2seconds resistance for each condition on revenant. Reduce casttime to 1 second. Unyielding Anguish - Needs a nerf. It shouldnt keep displace foes over and over after initial leap. Allow this skill to continue applying 2 stacks of torment/pulse to foes in the field instead. Reduce self cripple duration to 4 seconds. Banish Enchantment - Increase range to 900. Otherwise fine as it is. Pain Absortion - Reduce energy cost to 30 and casttime to 0.75sec. Make it a stunbreak ability so it can find use outside of teamfights Embrance the darkness - No reason to stay for a longer periods of time.. Cast it, copy conditions, leave. 10% buff to all stats doesnt cut it. Make it pulse resistance once every 7 seconds. Removes resistance upon leaving and prevents boon application to yourself for 5 seconds. This skill should copy all stacks currently on revenant to foes instead of just 1 stack. Also change it to copy conditions every second. Reduce castitme to 3/4 sec. * Ventari ""I can outrun a centaur"" well im not sure about it. Ventari doesnt work, its sluggish, too hard to use as we have to focus and waste time giving orders the tablet while enemy beats us. Let the tablet summon on default once we channel Ventari and follow us. Increase the radius to 360 (except protective solace) and give it a proper healing skill. Energy expulsion should launch foes (450 distance) to justice it energy cost. While ordering commands i want to continue attacking or whatever , tablet control shouldnt interrupt my own actions. You tried to desing something new but it doesnt work and never will in current form. Protective Solace could become a stunbreak ability with increased cost to 30 energy. That would make it a bit more useful when there are no projectiles around and also help reduce the ridiculous block uptime Traits..most of them are weak and feels outdated, it also feels like many of them are a must have pick up over everything else leaving it never used.. * Corruption line - overall this line inst bad but it needs some tweaks; Repleshing Despair - increase the amount of healing to 70. Venom enhancement - also increase damage of poison by 20%. Demonic Defiance - swap it with opportune extraction to a minor position. I believe everyone going for corruption will pick up this trait leaving others in to be overshadowed by that one. Howered at some point i think it should become baseline. Opportune extraction - Make it a gm trait. Boons you remove during channeling Mallyx corrupt instead. Frigid precision - increase chill duration to 3.5 seconds. Spontaneous destruction - reduce cd to 20 seconds. Diabolic inferno - apply 2 stacks of burning for 4 seconds Maniacal Persistence - pointless trait. Rework it to provide a 33% chance to inflict condition on critical hit based on legend. Jalis 4 sec weakness, Mallyx 6sec poison, Shiro 3sec chill, Ventari 4sec burning. 15 cd. Make it a master trait Pulsating Pestilence - Useless ability when we are being attacked from range. Give it a target icd and copy condition to foe that hitted us. Just like embrance the darkness it should copy all stacks instead of 1. * Retribution - at some point i like the fact that it doesnt need Jalis legend to use, but at another point i dont understand why nothing in this line enhance Jalis abilities compared to salvation line. Enduring Recovery - buff to 25%. Improved aggresion - also gain energy when taunted foe strikes you. 10 energy, 1 icd. Unwarevering avoidance - also breakstun on legend swap. Eyes for the Eye - reduce cd to 30seconds. Retaliatory evasion - increase duration to 3 seconds. Reedeming Protection - swap with determined resolution. It will always be picked up over the other two traits. Determined resolution - Boring and null trait. Let it apply 2 second protection for Jalis abilities after skill use instead. Empowering vengeance - provide might for 15 seconds. 8 seconds is too short duration to make any use of it. Steadfast Rejuvenation - Terrible and boring trait. Make it heal for 500 instead whenever we use Jalis ability. * Salvation - too dedicated to healing, but let it stay that away, anyway..; Disarming riposte - reduce cd to 10 seconds per target. Nourishing roots - increase radius to 320. Hardened Foundation - swap with invoking harmony. Invoking harmony - invoking a legend creates a wave of healing centered on you in a 240 radius. 800 heal (0.90* healing power) Tranquil Benediction - increase regen and swiftness to 3 seconds. Momentary pacification - should apply daze in the same moment where we use elite skill instead being delayed by 2 (?) seconds after the elite skill is done casting. 15 cd. * Invocation - how come a professions line has literally no connection whatsoever to class mechanic, thats one of the reasons why this line is terrible. Lets fix it! Replenishing globes - combine with revitalizing breath. With the specialization changes it makes no sense to have them as separate traits. Cruel repercussion - useless as this trait is too unreliable. Delete it and make a new one which will provide a boon upon swapping to legend. Jalis 3sec protection, Ventari 5sec swiftness, Mallyx 3 sec resistance, Shiro 5sec fury Fierce unfusion - remove cd, reduce fury duration to 6 seconds. Equilibrium - swap with empty vessel, increase healing to 800. Invigorating flow - make it a minor in place of revitalizing breath Empty vessel - healing skills no longer cost energy and instead provide a small amount of energy - 15. New master trait - Recovering mists. Reduce energy cost on utility skills by 10%. Charged mists - Keeps the amount of energy upon legend swap if the energy was above 50% Shrouding mists - Remove healing increase per target above 50% energy and instead make it reduce incoming condition damage by 10% Modified weapon skills based on channeled legend, just an examples; Hammer; * Jalis Skill 1 - cause vulnerability for 5 sec. Skill 2 -gain 2x stacks of might for 5sec. Skill 3 -2 sec aegis. Skill 4 - gain 2sec retaliation for blocked projectiles. 1sec interval. Combo field changed to light. Skill 5 - cause 5sec weakness. * Mallyx Skill 1 - cause 3 sec torment. Skill 2 - cause 3 stacks of vulnerability for 6 seconds. Skill 3 - also cause 2sec slow. Skill 4 - reflect projectiles instead which cause 3 sec bleeding. Combo field remain unchanged. Skill 5 - cause 2 stacks of burning for 4 sec. * Ventari, Skill 1 - heal yourself for small amount and allies it pass through(100hp?) Skill 2 - gain regeneration for 2 seconds Skill 3 - removes chill, apply aoe vigor to yourself and allies Skill 4 - block projectiles and heals you and allies behind for 10% of incoming damage. Combo field changed to water. How it would working? Field of the mist changes projectiles to healing bolts. Skill 5 - also blind for 5 seconds * Shiro; Skill 1 - gain might for 5 seconds Skill 2 - gain fury for 2 seconds Skill 3 - gain swiftness for 5 seconds Skill 4 - reflect projectiles gaining 1sec vigor. 1 icd. Combo field remains unchanged. I believe changing it to smoke would be too strong due to blind on projectiles. Skill 5 - gain 4sec quickness. I plan to post it on official forum later today so any feedback is welcomed."

If we make it deal current max damage at all times it will be broken, if we keep it in current state it wont be good either with so many gap closers people have nowdays. We need something in middle with slighty higher cd. Current damage at second eruption with 4 or 5 cd? Phase smash - As i mentioned hammer has no mobility. I propose to make this one our mobility skill so we can get some much needed breath room by leaping away with ability to shadowstep back similiar to thief sword 2 skill. This skill should also provide evade frames during leap. Increase cd to 10 seconds. Shadowstep ability last 3 seconds, can be used under cc. Field of the mists - Promotes backpedaling, but strong defense against projectiles as tradeoff. Sadly it useless against melee foes. My proposition is to reduce castime to 0.50sec with a small 240 knockback in melee range. The animations fits it perfectly already. Drop the hammer - Would be a fine, decent skill if...not that casttime. With current long animation we losing pressure on a target which can walk out of the radius before the cast even finish. That skills needs desperately some serious lowered casttime. It already has huge tell so i believe 0.75 sec casttime is more than enough. * Mace A condition weapon which was supposed to be fast paced and...doesnt work. The base torment duration on aa is too low considering the fact we have to apply it in melee range. Another problem is that while aa on it own is fast paced, searing fissue is simply out of place due to high casttime. Echoing eruption feels alright howered it could apply some condition along with damage. I know it main purpose is to mightstack but as it stand now its nearly impossible to do that in combat. That straight forward fire field combined with this skill is simply unreliable in a mobile game like GW. What i propose; Misery swipe and anguish swipe - Increase torment duration to 5 seconds. Buff direct damage. Manifest toxin - Should apply 2 stacks of poison. Reduce duration to 5seconds. Make the field longer (600 like jalis road) as backpedaling to use echoing eruption doesnt work in pvp at all on melee set. Echoing Eruption - apply 2 stacks of bleeding on each hit. * Axe Hybrid weapon created to work with mace. Overall this weapon isnt that bad but it need some tweaks. Frigit Blitz - Reduce cooldown to 8 seconds. Nothing less, nothing more. We need mobility and this skill is a good candidate for that one. We cannot escape fight with it so i believe its justiced at this point. Temporal rift - increase range of the pull, right now its too easy to walk out of range. Make it ground targeted ability like Into the Void. Buff direct damage by 20% * Staff Fun weapon but the damage is simply too weak, now i understand that staff is not designed to do dps but in this case it should provide a bit more defense outside of a block with 10cd if that is a support weapon. AA - The healing doesnt not make up for the low damage this weapon has. Punishing sweep&gt;debilitating slam - Completely useless skill. First i have to time it right and take damage from an attack just so i can apply 3sec weakness withamount of damage with huge 1sec windup? Useless. Rework it to provide counterattack instead similiar to ranger gs 4. I propose block duration 1.5 seconds, can be triggered in melee range olny. When counter land apply weakness to your foe. Counter block animation 0.50sec Warding rift - Awesome skill. I love it. Renewing Wave - Remove selfroot and decrease casttime to 0.75sec. Increase radius to 600. Surge of the mists - Interesing skill. Howered i believe it should apply evade frames for skill duration. After all we taking a mist form during this skill. Legend skills; * Jalis Jalis was supposed to be a tank legend yet failed miserably at his job. Rite of the dward doesnt work in current state and never will. It also happen to be his olny way to reduce damage on us, inspiring reinforcement is too unreliable to work and vengeful hammers are useless. What i would do assuming revenant will get build in class mechanic tools i mentioned; Soothing Stone - Current value is too low. Sweet spot would be 5500 or lowered cd. 2 second block duration, reset the skill if interrupted like Shelter. Increase casttimeme to 1.25sec. Inspiring reinforcement - Let it apply stability right once the skill goes off. Right now delay in which stability is applied kills this skill. I wasnt able to get stability in time to prevent cc simply due to the fact that i have to wait too long in a small field to get any stability. It wont work that way, stability must be applied instantly. Increase energy cost to 35. Make it a stunbreak ability. Vengeful hammers - Buff it damage, really just do it. As it stands now it damage is too low for the casttime it needs. Consider to buff it damage by at least 25% and let the hammers apply 1sec of protection to allies they pass. Apply pulsing retaliaton to revenant while this skill is up. Theres also one problem about this skill as well - hammers keep disappearing if they run into a objectice, its gamebreaking considering the fact how many obstracled we have in this game, not to mention the overall well know bugged ground. It happened few times to me where the hammers dissapeared on a flat terrain due to the bugged ground. Forced engagement - Reduce the cost to 35 energy. Remove 2 conditions on yourself upon skill activation (doesnt matter if it land or not) Rite of the dwarf - Remove it stunbreak function. Make it an upkeep skill effecting olny revenant. Keep casttime as it is. 10 energy/sec, 25 energy cost. Reduce casttime to 2 seconds. * Mallyx Overall this legend feels alright when it comes to animations and casttimes. Howered the condition threshold should be reduced to 2. Its quite hard to maintain 3 conditions on yourself when not fightng a condition build, and in teamfight condi cleanse flying everywhere nowdays. I dont think condition duration should have affect self inflicted conditions. Empowerering Misery - A worse version of consume conditions. It also doesnt heal for a lot if you dont fight condition builds. Make it heal for 6500 and apply 2seconds resistance for each condition on revenant. Reduce casttime to 1 second. Unyielding Anguish - Needs a nerf. It shouldnt keep displace foes over and over after initial leap. Allow this skill to continue applying 2 stacks of torment/pulse to foes in the field instead. Reduce self cripple duration to 4 seconds. Banish Enchantment - Increase range to 900. Otherwise fine as it is. Pain Absortion - Reduce energy cost to 30 and casttime to 0.75sec. Make it a stunbreak ability so it can find use outside of teamfights Embrance the darkness - No reason to stay for a longer periods of time.. Cast it, copy conditions, leave. 10% buff to all stats doesnt cut it. Make it pulse resistance once every 7 seconds. Removes resistance upon leaving and prevents boon application to yourself for 5 seconds. This skill should copy all stacks currently on revenant to foes instead of just 1 stack. Also change it to copy conditions every second. Reduce castitme to 3/4 sec. * Ventari ""I can outrun a centaur"" well im not sure about it. Ventari doesnt work, its sluggish, too hard to use as we have to focus and waste time giving orders the tablet while enemy beats us. Let the tablet summon on default once we channel Ventari and follow us. Increase the radius to 360 (except protective solace) and give it a proper healing skill. Energy expulsion should launch foes (450 distance) to justice it energy cost. While ordering commands i want to continue attacking or whatever , tablet control shouldnt interrupt my own actions. You tried to desing something new but it doesnt work and never will in current form. Protective Solace could become a stunbreak ability with increased cost to 30 energy. That would make it a bit more useful when there are no projectiles around and also help reduce the ridiculous block uptime Traits..most of them are weak and feels outdated, it also feels like many of them are a must have pick up over everything else leaving it never used.. * Corruption line - overall this line inst bad but it needs some tweaks; Repleshing Despair - increase the amount of healing to 70. Venom enhancement - also increase damage of poison by 20%. Demonic Defiance - swap it with opportune extraction to a minor position. I believe everyone going for corruption will pick up this trait leaving others in to be overshadowed by that one. Howered at some point i think it should become baseline. Opportune extraction - Make it a gm trait. Boons you remove during channeling Mallyx corrupt instead. Frigid precision - increase chill duration to 3.5 seconds. Spontaneous destruction - reduce cd to 20 seconds. Diabolic inferno - apply 2 stacks of burning for 4 seconds Maniacal Persistence - pointless trait. Rework it to provide a 33% chance to inflict condition on critical hit based on legend. Jalis 4 sec weakness, Mallyx 6sec poison, Shiro 3sec chill, Ventari 4sec burning. 15 cd. Make it a master trait Pulsating Pestilence - Useless ability when we are being attacked from range. Give it a target icd and copy condition to foe that hitted us. Just like embrance the darkness it should copy all stacks instead of 1. * Retribution - at some point i like the fact that it doesnt need Jalis legend to use, but at another point i dont understand why nothing in this line enhance Jalis abilities compared to salvation line. Enduring Recovery - buff to 25%. Improved aggresion - also gain energy when taunted foe strikes you. 10 energy, 1 icd. Unwarevering avoidance - also breakstun on legend swap. Eyes for the Eye - reduce cd to 30seconds. Retaliatory evasion - increase duration to 3 seconds. Reedeming Protection - swap with determined resolution. It will always be picked up over the other two traits. Determined resolution - Boring and null trait. Let it apply 2 second protection for Jalis abilities after skill use instead. Empowering vengeance - provide might for 15 seconds. 8 seconds is too short duration to make any use of it. Steadfast Rejuvenation - Terrible and boring trait. Make it heal for 500 instead whenever we use Jalis ability. * Salvation - too dedicated to healing, but let it stay that away, anyway..; Disarming riposte - reduce cd to 10 seconds per target. Nourishing roots - increase radius to 320. Hardened Foundation - swap with invoking harmony. Invoking harmony - invoking a legend creates a wave of healing centered on you in a 240 radius. 800 heal (0.90* healing power) Tranquil Benediction - increase regen and swiftness to 3 seconds. Momentary pacification - should apply daze in the same moment where we use elite skill instead being delayed by 2 (?) seconds after the elite skill is done casting. 15 cd. * Invocation - how come a professions line has literally no connection whatsoever to class mechanic, thats one of the reasons why this line is terrible. Lets fix it! Replenishing globes - combine with revitalizing breath. With the specialization changes it makes no sense to have them as separate traits. Cruel repercussion - useless as this trait is too unreliable. Delete it and make a new one which will provide a boon upon swapping to legend. Jalis 3sec protection, Ventari 5sec swiftness, Mallyx 3 sec resistance, Shiro 5sec fury Fierce unfusion - remove cd, reduce fury duration to 6 seconds. Equilibrium - swap with empty vessel, increase healing to 800. Invigorating flow - make it a minor in place of revitalizing breath Empty vessel - healing skills no longer cost energy and instead provide a small amount of energy - 15. New master trait - Recovering mists. Reduce energy cost on utility skills by 10%. Charged mists - Keeps the amount of energy upon legend swap if the energy was above 50% Shrouding mists - Remove healing increase per target above 50% energy and instead make it reduce incoming condition damage by 10% Modified weapon skills based on channeled legend, just an examples; Hammer; * Jalis Skill 1 - cause vulnerability for 5 sec. Skill 2 -gain 2x stacks of might for 5sec. Skill 3 -2 sec aegis. Skill 4 - gain 2sec retaliation for blocked projectiles. 1sec interval. Combo field changed to light. Skill 5 - cause 5sec weakness. * Mallyx Skill 1 - cause 3 sec torment. Skill 2 - cause 3 stacks of vulnerability for 6 seconds. Skill 3 - also cause 2sec slow. Skill 4 - reflect projectiles instead which cause 3 sec bleeding. Combo field remain unchanged. Skill 5 - cause 2 stacks of burning for 4 sec. * Ventari, Skill 1 - heal yourself for small amount and allies it pass through(100hp?) Skill 2 - gain regeneration for 2 seconds Skill 3 - removes chill, apply aoe vigor to yourself and allies Skill 4 - block projectiles and heals you and allies behind for 10% of incoming damage. Combo field changed to water. How it would working? Field of the mist changes projectiles to healing bolts. Skill 5 - also blind for 5 seconds * Shiro; Skill 1 - gain might for 5 seconds Skill 2 - gain fury for 2 seconds Skill 3 - gain swiftness for 5 seconds Skill 4 - reflect projectiles gaining 1sec vigor. 1 icd. Combo field remains unchanged. I believe changing it to smoke would be too strong due to blind on projectiles. Skill 5 - gain 4sec quickness. I plan to post it on official forum later today so any feedback is welcomed."
355,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Revenant overhaul. Need feedback.,1,3d4axs,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3d4axs/revenant_overhaul_need_feedback/,2015-07-13 22:18:19,"In the world of Tyria where people run ridiculous bursts, insta abilities, a lot of stuns and conditions revenant cannot survive. At some point he really feels like hes coming from the other world sadly in not a positive way. I see what you did here, revenant vs revenant is actually fun and skillful but vs everything else he stands no chance. With current classes and their cheese mechanics revenant doesnt belong in this game. The potential is here, but some stuff needs rework/tweaks. Overall revenant animations are too clunky. He lacks of survival tools like blocks, evades, invuls, boons to reduce damage, stunbreaks, condition removal, mobility on weapon skills. Paired with poor healing despite having 2 healing skills doesnt allow him to sustain properly. Healing skills on it own needs a buff as they dont heal for much at all. Take a look at ""we heal as one"" and ""healing signet"" - both of them heal for far more, not olny that but ""we heal as one also"" provides aoe regen and swiftness when trained, even aoe condi removal with tropper runes. Revenant healing skills are not even close. Weapons seems to be made within just one legend in mind. Utility skills on it own arent that powerful either. Many of them are too situation and cannot be swapped at all for something more useful. I dont understand why unlike other classes we cannot insta swap legend without empty vessel trait. If we dont get this trait we cannot swap under cc at all nor while executing a skill.. It feels like someone made it on a purpose and force us pick up this terrible invocation line which doesnt have much connection to profession mechanic at all. Its really, really bad. Placing stunbreak on legend swap doesnt work. It reset energy, it changes our whole set of utilities..often its just better to wait out the stun than swap, not to mention that revenant rely on swaps so most likely we wont have access to stunbreak when we need it. Another thing is energy management, to be precise utility skills eat a lot of energy forcing us to spam aa just to collect enough energy for some utility skills. Everything revenant does consume energy to the point where we cannot continue using weapon skills as we have to collect energy for utility skills. That makes no sense, might as well just give weapon skills no cd at this point. Even healing skill consume small amount of energy...yet i i feel it should be opposite. A trait in invocation to actually provide a bit of energy by using healing skill would be pretty good. The concept of energy is similiar to a thief initiative. But the thing is thief is an huge advantage here. His healing skill doesnt cost initiative, his utiliy skills doesnt cost initiative, he also happens to have utility skills/trait to enhance initiative regeneration and increase the cap. If a thief runs out of initiative he can still use autoattack and his utility skills. Thats not the case of revenant where if you run out of energy you cant do anything but autoattack. I dont think it should work this way. I prepared a long list about stuff that is weak with sugegstions how to buff/rework it. I will start from general issues; * Remove weapon energy cost - please stop forcing us to build up energy for utility skills by not using weapon skill. The utility cost is already high enough on it own.If you want to keep up energy cost on weapon skills, remove their cd. * Weapon themes - consider modifing weapon skills based on legends, Mallyx causing conditions, protective boons on Jalis, healing on Ventari, offensive boons on Shiro. As it stands now weapons are too heavily tied towards one legend leaving another one subpar. Thats why people asking for unnecessary weapon swap. Fashion stuff - animations adapt to the color theme of channeled legend, like purple hammer swings while channeling Mallyx. Examples with how field of the mist and staff orbs could be modified; Jalis would continue blocking as it stands now and gain retaliaton for blocked projectiles. Staff orbs could provide protection Ventari would heal a percentage of incoming projectile damage. Staff orbs heals as it is right now Mallyx would reflect them instead. Reflected projectiles would cause bleeding. Staff orbs would would provide resistance Shiro reflect instead and gains vigor. Staff orbs could provide fury I made full list for hammer skills at the buttom. * Revenant need survival tools which you could roll into utility skills - these would naturally be stunbreak, condition removal. Revenant needs higher sustain than other classes considering the fact that hes pretty much melee oriented. I also think that revenant needs defiance bar like noone else in their elite spec. * Aftercast is too high, it need to be reduced across the board, there are also troubles with skill queue possibly for that reason. I press the key, i press it again..nothing. Feels like i have 1000ping or something. * Lack of mobility on weapon sets which will force everyone to pick up Shiro, and once we leave that legend we will end up without any mobility for 10 seconds. Shiro should help maintain to stay on top of enemy, but he shouldnt be necessary to have any sort of mobility. How we are supposed to close the gap to anyone without gap closers in weapon sets? * Instant legend swap should be baseline. No uh, ah but. It has to happen. Imagine ele being forced to trait for insta swap attunements..can you imagine that rage? * [Bug]Many abilities which causes effect on ground doesnt work on uneven terrain like coalescence of ruin, phase smash, temporal rift. That is game breaking and it must be fixed. * Utility skills - lets be honest, we need more utility skills to swap for something else. Current skills are not that bad but they need some tweaking. Thing is some of them are too situational, pain absorption is the best example of that. Decent in teamfights, useless everywhere else. I think we all can agree that we need a ways to customize our skills outside of a legend choice to make interesing builds or at least rework current ones. * Fashion stuff..legend should talk more often. Much more. Where are all that dialogues gone? No wonder revenant is weak when enemies cant feel the true ultimate power of Mallyx. Weapon; * Hammer Overall feel of this weapon feels clucky, it is supposed to be our olny one long range power weapon but as it stands now it doesnt do any damage at all, and thats not because damage coefficient is low but because how slow this weapon is. It also goes with theme the futher you shoot the more damage you does..so naturally you want to stay at maximum range. And here we got a problem - hammer has no abilities to kite foes. Its quite easy to stay on top of hammer revenant at all times as we cannot get away or knockback/launch someone. Ranger on longbow has low cd knockback with a decent distance, stealth and a pet to cripple/chill/immo/knockdown and lately when trained also taunt. As we can see hammer cannot compete. Hammer bolt - reduce casttime to 0.75sec, increase damage by 10% Coalescence of ruin - Eruption of energy should happen slighty faster. I feel like the whole damage of hammer is backloaded into this single skill at max range which then can be avoided by strafing. It wont work. If we make it deal current max damage at all times it will be broken, if we keep it in current state it wont be good either with so many gap closers people have nowdays. We need something in middle with slighty higher cd. Current damage at second eruption with 4 or 5 cd? Phase smash - As i mentioned hammer has no mobility. I propose to make this one our mobility skill so we can get some much needed breath room by leaping away with ability to shadowstep back similiar to thief sword 2 skill. This skill should also provide evade frames during leap. Increase cd to 10 seconds. Shadowstep ability last 5 seconds, can be used under cc. Field of the mists - Promotes backpedaling, but strong defense against projectiles as tradeoff. Sadly it useless against melee foes. My proposition is to reduce castime to 0.50sec with a small 240 knockback in melee range. The animations fits it perfectly already. Drop the hammer - Would be a fine, decent skill if...not that casttime. With current long animation we losing pressure on a target which can walk out of the radius before the cast even finish. That skills needs desperately some serious lowered casttime. It already has huge tell so i believe 0.75 sec casttime is more than enough. * Mace A condition weapon which was supposed to be fast paced and...doesnt work. The base torment duration on aa is too low considering the fact we have to apply it in melee range. Another problem is that while aa on it own is fast paced, searing fissue is simply out of place due to high casttime. Echoing eruption feels alright howered it could apply some condition along with damage. I know it main purpose is to mightstack but as it stand now its nearly impossible to do that in combat. That straight forward fire field combined with this skill is simply unreliable in a mobile game like GW. What i propose; Misery swipe and anguish swipe - Increase torment duration to 5 seconds. Buff direct damage. Manifest toxin - Should apply 2 stacks of poison. Reduce duration to 5seconds. Make the field longer (600 like jalis road) as backpedaling to use echoing eruption doesnt work in pvp at all on melee set. Echoing Eruption - apply 2 stacks of bleeding on each hit. * Axe Hybrid weapon created to work with mace. Overall this weapon isnt that bad but it need some tweaks. Frigit Blitz - Reduce cooldown to 8 seconds. Nothing less, nothing more. We need mobility and this skill is a good candidate for that one. We cannot escape fight with it so i believe its justiced at this point. Temporal rift - increase range of the pull, right now its too easy to walk out of range. Make it ground targeted ability like Into the Void. Buff direct damage by 20% * Staff Fun weapon but the damage is simply too weak, now i understand that staff is not designed to do dps but in this case it should provide a bit more defense outside of a block with 10cd if that is a support weapon. AA - The healing doesnt not make up for the low damage this weapon has. Punishing sweep&gt;debilitating slam - Completely useless skill. First i have to time it right and take damage from an attack just so i can apply 3sec weakness withamount of damage with huge 1sec windup? Useless. Rework it to provide counterattack instead similiar to ranger gs 4. I propose block duration 1.5 seconds, can be triggered in melee range olny. When counter land apply weakness to your foe. Counter block animation 0.50sec Warding rift - Awesome skill. I love it. Renewing Wave - Remove selfroot and decrease casttime to 0.75sec. Increase radius to 600. Surge of the mists - Interesing skill. Howered i believe it should apply evade frames for skill duration. After all we taking a mist form during this skill. Legend skills; * Jalis Jalis was supposed to be a tank legend yet failed miserably at his job. Rite of the dward doesnt work in current state and never will. It also happen to be his olny way to reduce damage on us, inspiring reinforcement is too unreliable to work and vengeful hammers are useless. What i would do assuming revenant will get build in class mechanic tools i mentioned; Soothing Stone - Current value is too low. Sweet spot would be 5500 or lowered cd. 2 second block duration, reset the skill if interrupted like Shelter. Increase casttimeme to 1.25sec. Inspiring reinforcement - Let it apply stability right once the skill goes off. Right now delay in which stability is applied kills this skill. I wasnt able to get stability in time to prevent cc simply due to the fact that i have to wait too long in a small field to get any stability. It wont work that way, stability must be applied instantly. Increase energy cost to 35. Make it a stunbreak ability. Vengeful hammers - Buff it damage, really just do it. As it stands now it damage is too low for the casttime it needs. Consider to buff it damage by at least 25% and let the hammers apply 1sec of protection to allies they pass. Apply pulsing retaliaton to revenant while this skill is up. Theres also one problem about this skill as well - hammers keep disappearing if they run into a objectice, its gamebreaking considering the fact how many obstracled we have in this game, not to mention the overall well know bugged ground. It happened few times to me where the hammers dissapeared on a flat terrain due to the bugged ground. Forced engagement - Reduce the cost to 35 energy. Remove 2 conditions on yourself upon skill activation (doesnt matter if it land or not) Rite of the dwarf - Remove it stunbreak function. Make it an upkeep skill effecting olny revenant. Keep casttime as it is. 10 energy/sec, 25 energy cost. Reduce casttime to 2 seconds. * Mallyx Overall this legend feels alright when it comes to animations and casttimes. Howered the condition threshold should be reduced to 2. Its quite hard to maintain 3 conditions on yourself when not with conditions cleanses around. I dont think condition duration should have affect self inflicted conditions either. Another problem with Mallyx is that he doesnt have access to anything else outside of confusion and torment, making him quite weak vs classes that doesnt spam conditions on you. Empowerering Misery - A worse version of consume conditions. It also doesnt heal for a lot if you dont fight condition builds. Make it heal for 6500 and apply 2seconds resistance for each condition on revenant. Reduce casttime to 1 second. Unyielding Anguish - Needs a nerf. It shouldnt keep displace foes over and over after initial leap. Allow this skill to continue applying 2 stacks of torment/pulse to foes in the field instead. Reduce self cripple duration to 4 seconds. Banish Enchantment - Increase range to 900. Otherwise fine as it is. Pain Absortion - Reduce energy cost to 30 and casttime to 0.75sec. Make it a stunbreak ability so it can find use outside of teamfights Embrance the darkness - No reason to stay for a longer periods of time.. Cast it, copy conditions, leave. 10% buff to all stats doesnt cut it. Make it pulse resistance once every 7 seconds. Removes resistance upon leaving and prevents boon application to yourself for 5 seconds. This skill should copy all stacks currently on revenant to foes instead of just 1 stack. Also change it to copy conditions every second. Reduce castitme to 3/4 sec. * Ventari ""I can outrun a centaur"" well im not sure about it. Ventari doesnt work, its sluggish, too hard to use as we have to focus and waste time giving orders the tablet while enemy beats us. Let the tablet summon on default once we channel Ventari and follow us. Increase the radius to 360 (except protective solace) and give it a proper healing skill. Energy expulsion should launch foes (450 distance) to justice it energy cost. While ordering commands i want to continue attacking or whatever , tablet control shouldnt interrupt my own actions. You tried to desing something new but it doesnt work and never will in current form. Protective Solace could become a stunbreak ability with increased cost to 30 energy. That would make it a bit more useful when there are no projectiles around and also help reduce the ridiculous block uptime Traits..most of them are weak and feels outdated, it also feels like many of them are a must have pick up over everything else leaving it never used.. * Corruption line - overall this line inst bad but it needs some tweaks; Repleshing Despair - increase the amount of healing to 70. Venom enhancement - also increase damage of poison by 20%. Demonic Defiance - swap it with opportune extraction to a minor position. I believe everyone going for corruption will pick up this trait leaving others in to be overshadowed by that one. Howered at some point i think it should become baseline. Opportune extraction - Make it a gm trait. Boons you remove during channeling Mallyx corrupt instead. Frigid precision - increase chill duration to 3.5 seconds. Spontaneous destruction - reduce cd to 20 seconds. Diabolic inferno - apply 2 stacks of burning for 4 seconds Maniacal Persistence - pointless trait. Rework it to provide a 33% chance to inflict condition on critical hit based on legend. Jalis 4 sec weakness, Mallyx 6sec poison, Shiro 3sec chill, Ventari 4sec burning. 15 cd. Make it a master trait Pulsating Pestilence - Useless ability when we are being attacked from range. Give it a target icd and copy condition to foe that hitted us. Just like embrance the darkness it should copy all stacks instead of 1. * Retribution - at some point i like the fact that it doesnt need Jalis legend to use, but at another point i dont understand why nothing in this line enhance Jalis abilities compared to salvation line. Enduring Recovery - buff to 25%. Improved aggresion - also gain energy when taunted foe strikes you. 10 energy, 1 icd. Unwarevering avoidance - also breakstun on legend swap. Eyes for the Eye - reduce cd to 30seconds. Retaliatory evasion - increase duration to 3 seconds. Reedeming Protection - swap with determined resolution. It will always be picked up over the other two traits. Determined resolution - Boring and null trait. Let it apply 2 second protection for Jalis abilities after skill use instead. Empowering vengeance - provide might for 15 seconds. 8 seconds is too short duration to make any use of it. Steadfast Rejuvenation - Terrible and boring trait. Make it heal for 500 instead whenever we use Jalis ability. * Salvation - too dedicated to healing, but let it stay that away, anyway..; Disarming riposte - reduce cd to 10 seconds per target. Nourishing roots - increase radius to 320. Hardened Foundation - swap with invoking harmony. Invoking harmony - invoking a legend creates a wave of healing centered on you in a 240 radius. 800 heal (0.90* healing power) Tranquil Benediction - increase regen and swiftness to 3 seconds. Momentary pacification - should apply daze in the same moment where we use elite skill instead being delayed by 2 (?) seconds after the elite skill is done casting. 15 cd. * Invocation - how come a professions line has literally no connection whatsoever to class mechanic, thats one of the reasons why this line is terrible. Lets fix it! Replenishing globes - combine with revitalizing breath. With the specialization changes it makes no sense to have them as separate traits. Cruel repercussion - useless as this trait is too unreliable. Delete it and make a new one which will provide a boon upon swapping to legend. Jalis 3sec protection, Ventari 5sec swiftness, Mallyx 3 sec resistance, Shiro 5sec fury Fierce unfusion - remove cd, reduce fury duration to 6 seconds. Equilibrium - swap with empty vessel, increase healing to 800. Invigorating flow - make it a minor in place of revitalizing breath Empty vessel - healing skills no longer cost energy and instead provide a small amount of energy - 15. New master trait - Recovering mists. Reduce energy cost on utility skills by 10%. Charged mists - Keeps the amount of energy upon legend swap if the energy was above 50% Shrouding mists - Remove healing increase per target above 50% energy and instead make it reduce incoming condition damage by 10% Modified weapon skills based on channeled legend, just an examples; Hammer; * Jalis Skill 1 - cause vulnerability for 5 sec. Skill 2 -gain 2x stacks of might for 5sec. Skill 3 -2 sec aegis. Skill 4 - gain 2sec retaliation for blocked projectiles. 1sec interval. Combo field changed to light. Skill 5 - cause 5sec weakness. * Mallyx Skill 1 - cause 3 sec torment. Skill 2 - cause 3 stacks of vulnerability for 6 seconds. Skill 3 - also cause 2sec slow. Skill 4 - reflect projectiles instead which cause 3 sec bleeding. Combo field remain unchanged. Skill 5 - cause 2 stacks of burning for 4 sec. * Ventari, Skill 1 - heal yourself for small amount and allies it pass through(100hp?)

356,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Revenant Overhaul. Feedback needed,0,3d4h27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3d4h27/revenant_overhaul_feedback_needed/,2015-07-13 23:21:03,"*In the world of Tyria where people run ridiculous bursts, insta abilities, a lot of stuns and conditions revenant cannot survive. At some point he really feels like hes coming from the other world sadly in not a positive way. I see what you did here, revenant vs revenant is actually fun and skillful but vs everything else he stands no chance. With current classes and their cheese mechanics revenant doesnt belong in this game. The potential is here, but some stuff needs rework/tweaks.* *Overall revenant animations are too clunky. He lacks of survival tools like blocks, evades, invuls, boons to reduce damage, stunbreaks, condition removal, mobility on weapon skills. Paired with poor healing despite having 2 healing skills doesnt allow him to sustain properly. Healing skills on it own needs a buff as they dont heal for much at all. Take a look at ""we heal as one"" and ""healing signet"" - both of them heal for far more, not olny that but ""we heal as one also"" provides aoe regen and swiftness when trained, even aoe condi removal with tropper runes. Revenant healing skills are not even close.* *Weapons seems to be made within just one legend in mind. Utility skills on it own arent that powerful either. Many of them are too situation and cannot be swapped at all for something more useful. I dont understand why unlike other classes we cannot insta swap legend without empty vessel trait. If we dont get this trait we cannot swap under cc at all nor while executing a skill.. It feels like someone made it on a purpose and force us pick up this terrible invocation line which doesnt have much connection to profession mechanic at all. Its really, really bad. Placing stunbreak on legend swap doesnt work. It reset energy, it changes our whole set of utilities..often its just better to wait out the stun than swap, not to mention that revenant rely on swaps so most likely we wont have access to stunbreak when we need it.* *Another thing is energy management, to be precise utility skills eat a lot of energy forcing us to spam aa just to collect enough energy for some utility skills. Everything revenant does consume energy to the point where we cannot continue using weapon skills as we have to collect energy for utility skills. That makes no sense, might as well just give weapon skills no cd at this point. Even healing skill consume small amount of energy...yet i i feel it should be opposite. A trait in invocation to actually provide a bit of energy by using healing skill would be pretty good.* *The concept of energy is similiar to a thief initiative. But the thing is thief is an huge advantage here. His healing skill doesnt cost initiative, his utiliy skills doesnt cost initiative, he also happens to have utility skills/trait to enhance initiative regeneration and increase the cap. If a thief runs out of initiative he can still use autoattack and his utility skills. Thats not the case of revenant where if you run out of energy you cant do anything but autoattack. I dont think it should work this way.* I prepared a long list about stuff that is weak with suggestions how to buff/rework it. I will start from general issues; * Remove weapon energy cost - please stop forcing us to build up energy for utility skills by not using weapon skill. The utility cost is already high enough on it own.If you want to keep up energy cost on weapon skills, remove their cd. * Weapon themes - consider modifing weapon skills based on legends, Mallyx causing conditions, protective boons on Jalis, healing on Ventari, offensive boons on Shiro. As it stands now weapons are too heavily tied towards one legend leaving another one subpar. Thats why people asking for unnecessary weapon swap. Fashion stuff - animations adapt to the color theme of channeled legend, like purple hammer swings while channeling Mallyx. Examples with how field of the mist and staff orbs could be modified; **-**Jalis would continue blocking as it stands now and gain retaliaton for blocked projectiles. Staff orbs could provide protection. **-**Ventari would heal a percentage of incoming projectile damage. Staff orbs heals as it is right now. **-**Mallyx would reflect them instead. Reflected projectiles would cause bleeding. Staff orbs would would provide resistance. **-**Shiro reflect instead and gains vigor. Staff orbs could provide fury I made full list for hammer skills at the buttom. * Revenant need survival tools which you could roll into utility skills - these would naturally be stunbreak, condition removal. Revenant needs higher sustain than other classes considering the fact that hes pretty much melee oriented. I also think that revenant needs defiance bar like noone else in their elite spec. * Aftercast is too high, it need to be reduced across the board, there are also troubles with skill queue possibly for that reason. I press the key, i press it again..nothing. Feels like i have 1000ping or something. Lack of mobility on weapon sets which will force everyone to pick up Shiro, and once we leave that legend we will end up without any mobility for 10 seconds. Shiro should help maintain to stay on top of enemy, but he shouldnt be necessary to have any sort of mobility. How we are supposed to close the gap to anyone without gap closers in weapon sets? * Instant legend swap should be baseline. No uh, ah but. It has to happen. Imagine ele being forced to trait for insta swap attunements..can you imagine that rage? * [Bug]Many abilities which causes effect on ground doesnt work on uneven terrain like coalescence of ruin, phase smash, temporal rift. That is game breaking and it must be fixed. * Utility skills - lets be honest, we need more utility skills to swap for something else. Current skills are not that bad but they need some tweaking. Thing is some of them are too situational, pain absorption is the best example of that. Decent in teamfights, useless everywhere else. I think we all can agree that we need a ways to customize our skills outside of a legend choice to make interesing builds or at least rework current ones. * Fashion stuff..legend should talk more often. Much more. Where are all that dialogues gone? No wonder revenant is weak when enemies cant feel the true ultimate power of Mallyx. Weapons; * **Hammer** **Hammer Overall feel of this weapon feels clucky, it is supposed to be our olny one long range power weapon but as it stands now it doesnt do any damage at all, and thats not because damage coefficient is low but because how slow this weapon is. It also goes with theme the futher you shoot the more damage you does..so naturally you want to stay at maximum range. And here we got a problem - hammer has no abilities to kite foes. Its quite easy to stay on top of hammer revenant at all times as we cannot get away or knockback/launch someone. Ranger on longbow has low cd knockback with a decent distance, stealth and a pet to cripple/chill/immo/knockdown and lately when trained also taunt. As we can see hammer cannot compete.** **1** Hammer bolt - reduce casttime to 0.75sec, increase damage by 10% **2** Coalescence of ruin - Eruption of energy should happen slighty faster. I feel like the whole damage of hammer is backloaded into this single skill at max range which then can be avoided by strafing. It wont work. If we make it deal current max damage at all times it will be broken, if we keep it in current state it wont be good either with so many gap closers people have nowdays. We need something in middle with slighty higher cd. Current damage at second eruption with 4 or 5 cd? **3** Phase smash - As i mentioned hammer has no mobility. I propose to make this one our mobility skill so we can get some much needed breath room by leaping away with ability to shadowstep back similiar to thief sword 2 skill. This skill should also provide evade frames during leap. Increase cd to 10 seconds. Shadowstep ability last 5 seconds, can be used under cc. **4** Field of the mists - Promotes backpedaling, but strong defense against projectiles as tradeoff. Sadly it useless against melee foes. My proposition is to reduce castime to 0.50sec with a small 240 knockback in melee range. The animations fits it perfectly already. **5** Drop the hammer - Would be a fine, decent skill if...not that casttime. With current long animation we losing pressure on a target which can walk out of the radius before the cast even finish. That skills needs desperately some serious lowered casttime. It already has huge tell so i believe 0.75 sec casttime is more than enough. * **Mace;** **Mace is a condition weapon which was supposed to be fast paced and...doesnt work. The base torment duration on aa is too low considering the fact we have to apply it in melee range. Another problem is that while aa on it own is fast paced, searing fissue is simply out of place due to high casttime. Echoing eruption feels alright howered it could apply some condition along with damage. I know it main purpose is to mightstack but as it stand now its nearly impossible to do that in combat. That straight forward fire field combined with this skill is simply unreliable in a mobile game like GW. What i propose;** **1** Misery swipe and anguish swipe - Increase torment duration to 5 seconds. Buff direct damage. **2** Manifest toxin - Should apply 2 stacks of poison. Reduce duration to 5seconds. Make the field longer (600 like jalis road) as backpedaling to use echoing eruption doesnt work in pvp at all on melee set. **3** Echoing Eruption - apply 2 stacks of bleeding on each hit. * **Axe;** **Axe Hybrid weapon created to work with mace. Overall this weapon isnt that bad but it need some tweaks.** **4** Frigit Blitz - Reduce cooldown to 8 seconds. Nothing less, nothing more. We need mobility and this skill is a good candidate for that one. We cannot escape fight with it so i believe its justiced at this point. **5** Temporal rift - increase range of the pull, right now its too easy to walk out of range. Make it ground targeted ability like Into the Void. Buff direct damage by 20% * **Staff;** **Staff Fun weapon but the damage is simply too weak, now i understand that staff is not designed to do dps but in this case it should provide a bit more defense outside of a block with 10cd if that is a support weapon.** **1** AA - The healing doesnt not make up for the low damage this weapon has. **2** Punishing sweep&gt;debilitating slam - Completely useless skill. First i have to time it right and take damage from an attack just so i can apply 3sec weakness withamount of damage with huge 1sec windup? Useless. Rework it to provide counterattack instead similiar to ranger gs 4. I propose block duration 1.5 seconds, can be triggered in melee range olny. When counter land apply weakness to your foe. Counter block animation 0.50sec **3** Warding rift - Awesome skill. I love it. **4** Renewing Wave - Remove selfroot and decrease casttime to 0.75sec. Increase radius to 600. **5** Surge of the mists - Interesing skill. Howered i believe it should apply evade frames for skill duration. After all we taking a mist form during this skill. Legend skills; * **Jalis** **Jalis was supposed to be a tank legend yet failed miserably at his job. Rite of the dward doesnt work in current state and never will. It also happen to be his olny way to reduce damage on us, inspiring reinforcement is too unreliable to work and vengeful hammers are useless. What i would do assuming revenant will get build in class mechanic tools i mentioned;** **-**Soothing Stone - Current value is too low. Sweet spot would be 5500 or lowered cd. 2 second block duration, reset the skill if interrupted like Shelter. Increase casttimeme to 1.25sec. **-**Inspiring reinforcement - Let it apply stability right once the skill goes off. Right now delay in which stability is applied kills this skill. I wasnt able to get stability in time to prevent cc simply due to the fact that i have to wait too long in a small field to get any stability. It wont work that way, stability must be applied instantly. Increase energy cost to 35. Make it a stunbreak ability. **-**Vengeful hammers - Buff it damage, really just do it. As it stands now it damage is too low for the casttime it needs. Consider to buff it damage by at least 25% and let the hammers apply 1sec of protection to allies they pass. Apply pulsing retaliaton to revenant while this skill is up. Theres also one problem about this skill as well - hammers keep disappearing if they run into a objectice, its gamebreaking considering the fact how many obstracled we have in this game, not to mention the overall well know bugged ground. It happened few times to me where the hammers dissapeared on a flat terrain due to the bugged ground. **-**Forced engagement - Reduce the cost to 35 energy. Remove 2 conditions on yourself upon skill activation (doesnt matter if it land or not) **-**Rite of the dwarf - Remove it stunbreak function. Make it an upkeep skill effecting olny revenant. Keep casttime as it is. 10 energy/sec, 25 energy cost. Reduce casttime to 2 seconds. * **Mallyx** **Mallyx overall this legend feels alright when it comes to animations and casttimes. Howered the condition threshold should be reduced to 2. Its quite hard to maintain 3 conditions on yourself when not with conditions cleanses around. I dont think condition duration should have affect self inflicted conditions either. Another problem with Mallyx is that he doesnt have access to anything else outside of confusion and torment, making him quite weak vs classes that doesnt spam conditions on you.** **-**Empowerering Misery - A worse version of consume conditions. It also doesnt heal for a lot if you dont fight condition builds. Make it heal for 6500 and apply 2seconds resistance for each condition on revenant. Reduce casttime to 1 second. **-**Unyielding Anguish - Needs a nerf. It shouldnt keep displace foes over and over after initial leap. Allow this skill to continue applying 2 stacks of torment/pulse to foes in the field instead. Reduce self cripple duration to 4 seconds. **-**Banish Enchantment - Increase range to 900. Otherwise fine as it is. **-**Pain Absortion - Reduce energy cost to 30 and casttime to 0.75sec. Make it a stunbreak ability so it can find use outside of teamfights **-**Embrance the darkness - No reason to stay for a longer periods of time.. Cast it, copy conditions, leave. 10% buff to all stats doesnt cut it. Make it pulse resistance once every 7 seconds. Removes resistance upon leaving and prevents boon application to yourself for 5 seconds. This skill should copy all stacks currently on revenant to foes instead of just 1 stack. Also change it to copy conditions every second. Reduce castitme to 3/4 sec. * **Ventari;** **Ventari ""I can outrun a centaur"" well im not sure about it. Ventari doesnt work, its sluggish, too hard to use as we have to focus and waste time giving orders the tablet while enemy beats us. Let the tablet summon on default once we channel Ventari and follow us. Increase the radius to 360 (except protective solace) and give it a proper healing skill. Energy expulsion should launch foes (450 distance) to justice it energy cost. While ordering commands i want to continue attacking or whatever , tablet control shouldnt interrupt my own actions. You tried to desing something new but it doesnt work and never will in current form. Protective Solace could become a stunbreak ability with increased cost to 30 energy. That would make it a bit more useful when there are no projectiles around and also help reduce the ridiculous block uptime** **Traits..most of them are weak and feels outdated, it also feels like many of them are a must have pick up over everything else leaving it never used..** * **Corruption line - overall this line inst bad but it needs some tweaks;** **-**Repleshing Despair - increase the amount of healing to 70. **-**Venom enhancement - also increase damage of poison by 20%. **-**Demonic Defiance - swap it with opportune extraction to a minor position. I believe everyone going for corruption will pick up this trait leaving others in to be overshadowed by that one. Howered at some point i think it should become baseline. **-**Opportune extraction - Make it a gm trait. Boons you remove during channeling Mallyx corrupt instead. **-**Frigid precision - increase chill duration to 3.5 seconds. **-**Spontaneous destruction - reduce cd to 20 seconds. **-**Diabolic inferno - apply 2 stacks of burning for 4 seconds **-**Maniacal Persistence - pointless trait. Rework it to provide a 33% chance to inflict condition on critical hit based on legend. Jalis 4 sec weakness, Mallyx 6sec poison, Shiro 3sec chill, Ventari 4sec burning. 15 cd. Make it a master trait **-**Pulsating Pestilence - Useless ability when we are being attacked from range. Give it a target icd and copy condition to foe that hitted us. Just like embrance the darkness it should copy all stacks instead of 1. * **Retribution - at some point i like the fact that it doesnt need Jalis legend to use, but at another point i dont understand why nothing in this line enhance Jalis abilities compared to salvation line.** **-**Enduring Recovery - buff to 25%.* **-**Improved aggresion - also gain energy when taunted foe strikes you. 10 energy, 1 icd. **-**Unwarevering avoidance - also breakstun on legend swap. **-**Eyes for the Eye - reduce cd to 30seconds. **-**Retaliatory evasion - increase duration to 3 seconds. **-**Reedeming Protection - swap with determined resolution. It will always be picked up over the other two traits. **-**Determined resolution - Boring and null trait. Let it apply 2 second protection for Jalis abilities after skill use instead. **-**Empowering vengeance - provide might for 15 seconds. 8 seconds is too short duration to make any use of it. **-**Steadfast Rejuvenation - Terrible and boring trait. Make it heal for 500 instead whenever we use Jalis ability. * **Salvation - too dedicated to healing, but let it stay that away, anyway..;** **-**Disarming riposte - reduce cd to 10 seconds per target. **-**Nourishing roots - increase radius to 320. **-** Hardened Foundation - swap with invoking harmony. **-**Invoking harmony - invoking a legend creates a wave of healing centered on you in a 240 radius. 800 heal (0.90* healing power) **-**Tranquil Benediction - increase regen and swiftness to 3 seconds. **-**Momentary pacification - should apply daze in the same moment where we use elite skill instead being delayed by 2 (?) seconds after the elite skill is done casting. 15 cd. * **Invocation - how come a professions line has literally no connection whatsoever to class mechanic, thats one of the reasons why this line is terrible. Lets fix it!** **-**Replenishing globes - combine with revitalizing breath. With the specialization changes it makes no sense to have them as separate traits. **-**Cruel repercussion - useless as this trait is too unreliable. Delete it and make a new one which will provide a boon upon swapping to legend. Jalis 3sec protection, Ventari 5sec swiftness, Mallyx 3 sec resistance, Shiro 5sec fury **-**Fierce unfusion - remove cd, reduce fury duration to 6 seconds. **-**Equilibrium - swap with empty vessel, increase healing to 800. **-**Invigorating flow - make it a minor in place of revitalizing breath **-**Empty vessel - healing skills no longer cost energy and instead provide a small amount of energy - 15. **-**New master trait - Recovering mists. Reduce energy cost on utility skills by 10%. **-**Charged mists - Keeps the amount of energy upon legend swap if the energy was above 50% **-**Shrouding mists - Remove healing increase per target above 50% energy and instead make it reduce incoming condition damage by 10% **Modified weapon skills based on channeled legend, just an examples for hammer;** * **Jalis** **Skill 1** - cause vulnerability for 5 sec. **Skill 2** -gain 2x stacks of might for 5sec. **Skill 3** -2 sec aegis. **Skill 4** - gain 2sec retaliation for blocked projectiles. 1sec interval. Combo field changed to light. **Skill 5** - cause 5sec weakness. * **Mallyx** **Skill 1** - cause 3 sec torment. **Skill 2** - cause 3 stacks of vulnerability for 6 seconds. **Skill 3** - also cause 2sec slow. **Skill 4** - reflect projectiles instead which cause 3 sec bleeding. Combo field remain unchanged. **Skill 5** - cause 2 stacks of burning for 4 sec. * **Ventari** **Skill 1** - heal yourself for small amount and allies it pass through(100hp?) **Skill 2** - gain regeneration for 2 seconds **Skill 3** - removes chill, apply aoe vigor to yourself and allies **Skill 4** - block projectiles and heals you and allies behind for 10% of incoming damage. Combo field changed to water. How it would working? Field of the mist changes projectiles to healing bolts. **Skill 5** - also blind for 5 seconds * **Shiro** **Skill 1** - gain might for 5 seconds **Skill 2** - gain fury for 2 seconds **Skill 3** - gain swiftness for 5 seconds **Skill 4** - reflect projectiles gaining 1sec vigor. 1 icd. Combo field remains unchanged. I believe changing it to smoke would be too strong due to blind on projectiles. **Skill 5** - gain 4sec quickness. "

Mesmers would gain OH daggers and Tricks. Any feedback would be interesting to see! The numbers are just place holders/rough ideas and would definitely need balancing. &amp;nbsp; **Elite Specialization - Rapscallion** &amp;nbsp; **Dagger OH Skills** - The Mesmer's offhand dagger would be used with deception and counter punishment in mind (For those that play D&amp;D/Pathfinder, there's somewhat of a feeling of Sneak Attacks and Teamwork Feats - particularly Broken Wing Gambit - mixed in as well). *Skill 4; Charlatan's Gambit/Imposter's Flourish* - Taunt all targets within range and gain Aegis/Create a flash of light that blinds foes within range. Taunt: 2s Aegis: 2s Blind: 3s Radius: 500 CD: 22 *Skill 5; Auspicious Strike* - Roll around your target and deliver a strike that immobilizes them, dealing increased damage to foes with no boons. Damage w/ Boons: 757 Damage w/out Boons: 1103 Evade: 1s Immobilize: 1s Range: 140 CD: 25 &amp;nbsp; **Utilities** - The Rapscallion would focus on playing an evasive mid-range style of combat. The utility skills are designed with blind, evasion and counterplay in mind, relying on a combination of movement controlling abilities and well-timed counters. *Skill 6 - Heal; Scoundrel's Reprieve* - Vanish in stealth, gaining regeneration.

Major Adept: Plan B - Blocking reduces the duration of Revealed by 1s. Major Adept: Embellished Return - Blind foes when you use a healing skill (3s). Major Adept: Unbalance - Enemies you interrupt are confused and bleeding. &amp;nbsp; Minor Master: Unrelenting Shadow - Increases the duration of Stealth applied by skills by 1s. Major Master: Remorseless - Dazing a foe below the threshold weakens them (50%). Major Master: Ambidextrous - Reduces the cooldown of dagger skills by 20%.

359,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Norn Racial Skills ideas,1,3d6ajy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3d6ajy/norn_racial_skills_ideas/,2015-07-14 07:24:17,"This has been mentioned since launch but Norn have really lost out on racial skills, I mainly really noticed recently when making a Ranger themed around birds and 'Call Owl' misses 70-90% of the time. I know they are meant to be not as good as profession skills, but they still should actually do something surely? I mean other races get somewhat useful but unmeta stuff such as Hounds of Balthazar, Take Root, Technobabble, Hidden Pistols, etc; plus other summons which at least add something extra (if not much) such as golems, sylvan hounds and warband. I guess it's not likely at all to change now but here are some ideas I had as a fun hypothetical: * Call Owl hits target. * The Elite skills act the same as a **combat tonic** transform (ie. keeps weapons and utilities) but provides a flat buff to stats: Bear: Soldiers (Power, Toughness/Vitality) Wolf: Givers (Toughness, Boon duration/Healing) Raven: Sinister/Givers (Condition Damage, Condition Duration/Precision) Snow Leopard: Berzerkers (Power, Precision/Ferocity) * On Elite activation: Bear: AoE Knockback (240), Vulnerability (3s) and 3 Might (10s) Wolf: AoE Fear (1s), Fury (10s) and Regen (10s) Raven: AoE Daze (3s), Cripple (2s) and 4 Bleed (8s) Snow Leopard: Stealth (5s) and AoE Swiftness (10s) At a 240s cooldown I don't think that it's overly OP, but if it was the stats could be really minor and/or the activation effects reduced. I love the principle of having racial skills, I wish there were more unique cosmetic related race stuff (eg. if the appearance of your summons, like turrets and minions, were tied to your race), but it just seems a bit redundant having elites that are a suicide button that you get gimped for using."
360,vulnerability,Guildwars2,The main problem with necro,0,3dk5q1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3dk5q1/the_main_problem_with_necro/,2015-07-17 08:42:43,"Okay, In all honestly since the giant changes on June 23rd, everyone is just hating on necros. People say 'Why ever have a necro in the group when you could have literally anything else' etc. The problem with necro, isn't the necro, or the necro player. When I play my necro in PUG's, the runs go 100 times more smoothly, nobody ever dies and though it may take 5-10 minutes longer because marks can't be triggered by immobile bosses (nightmare tree), the run always goes smoothly. Albeit a party of 5 guardians is better than a party of 5 necros, but this isn't the problem. The problem is with the non-necro players who are just completely intolerant. They refuse to even stand near a necro let alone run a dungeon. They have little understanding of the class since they don't play it and don't actually know how much a necromancer actually does. A necromancer can amplify your teams damage with Vulnerability and Weakness. Even though the 8 might you get from BiP is only a short duration, it's a low cooldown with MoC, and it's pretty handy to have 8 might on an ability you don't have to set up with a combo field. A necro spreads your teams damage around therefore getting your teams single target damage on a boss, and immediately spreading it to all the ads, or from a random vet in a dungeon that you're all killing to anything around it. Transfusion is underrated, and honestly even though a necromancer's damage isn't super high, its not about that. They do have team support, just not obvious team support. Killing something that a necro is trying to kill is significantly easier. It's very easy for a necro to stack up vulnerability without even trying, it's super simple for them to spam blinds on enemies and it's very easy to constantly make an enemy weaker by removing boons. Necromancer is a great class, it's not the highest damage and it doesn't just vomit out boons and regeneration like other classes. However, it will never die, and a well played necro will never let your team die. It'll make the run EASIER rather than faster. Honestly most of the time I see a full zerker team, they just get wiped constantly. Though it's faster till get something killed, once someone dies, they all die. **TL;DR:** Necro's are a decent class, not the highest dps, can't spit out boons, but they make things easier to kill. The problem with necro's are not the necro, it's the people who are completely intolerant to necromancers and necromancer players with little knowledge to back it up. I've often asked the people who kick me out of groups ""why don't you like necros?"". They say something like ""no team support, no damage"", and i'll reply with ""have you played necro properly? or at all?"". That answer is always no or something like ""I got level 10 and hated it"".

The auto attack can stack a lot of vulnerability (~15 stacks shown in the video in a short time). * Precision Slash- #2 skill  Medium ranged attack 450 range) that can hit up to three enemies. It will throw out a maximum of 3 daggers and can hit a max of 3 targets. If there are less than 3 targets, it will only throw out less daggers (i.e. 2 daggers for two enemies, 1 for one enemy). Allow you to catch up with your enemies since it chill your targets. * Unrelenting Assault - #3 skill  Will attack random targets in the area but will always teleport you back to your first target. * Duelists Preparation/Shackling Wave  #4 skill  Duelists Preparation is a blocking skill and if you get attack while using this skill you can use the Shackling Wave skill which is basically an immobilize. * Grasping Shadows  #5 skill can be combed with #3 skill to pull someone out of a group and then use #3 skill so all the hits land on them. **Shiro Legend skills** * Skills: URL * Enchanted Daggers: Your heal skill, Enchanted Daggers have a 1200 range so they will work with hammers. It is designed as an offensive heal and can proc things like sigils. * Riposting Shadows  Stun breaker that will evade you backwards to remove impairing conditions and grant you endurance. * Phase Traversal  You basically blink to your enemy and your next two attacks cannot be unblocked. Works well with Riposting Shadows to evade large attacks and then blink back in. * Impossible Odds  Upkeep skill (drains 10 energy every second), will be active until you run out of energy. Give you pulsating quickness and super speed. Drains energy pretty fast so save it for burst scenarios. * Jade Winds  The stun lasts for 3 seconds. Costs 50 energy but doesnt appear to have a cooldown. **Devastation Trait Line** * Traits: URL * This trait line is designed to compliment sword skills and the Shiro legend. * The minor traits really fit the sword skills well since it allow you to stack more vulnerability, deal more damage to vulnerable targets and steal health from them. * Rabid Lacerations from adept trait works with a sword in either main hand/offhand to give you 10% attack speed. * Jade Wind from the Jade Echo master trait has a 90s cooldown. * Nefarious Momentum can give you lots of might stacks, especially when used with sword #3 skill. * Dismantle Fortification  Most CC right now just remove one stack of stability currently but with this trait you can make your CC go through a single stack of stability or remove 2 stacks of stability.

No one have discussed yet Dragonhunter's traits and I am curious what comunity (mostly players, who main Guardian class) think about some of them: **Hunter's Fortification** *Apply protection in the area when activating a virtue.* Protection (4s): -33% incoming damage Radius: 240 Cooldown: 1s **Big Game Hunter** *Striking an enemy tethered by your spear of justice causes vulnerability and increases damage dealt.* Damage Increase: 15% Vulnerbility (10s): 1% incoming damage I don't think that **Hunter's Fortification** is good enough for a Grandmaster trait or even for a Dragonhunter's trait at all. I get the idea you throw your spear od justice, you get protection and you can jump into melee knowing, that you will get less damage for 4 seconds... well that will work in PvE, but certainly not in PvP, where you can't slice your foes fast enough to maintain this boon. What's more the radius is only 240 is not that good, when the radius of current virtues is equal to 600. Well that's my thought about it. I just don't want it to be and useless trait like: **Protector's Impact** or **Healer's Retribution**, where the other trait in this row are simply much better than those two. And I don't believe that people would pick **Hunter's Fortifictaion** over **Big Game Hunter** or **Heavy Light**, which benefits longbow. [Straw Poll](URL "

No intention is meant to actually confuse or dupe readers into believing that we are living in 2017 or that a new new expansion is coming. Roy Cronacher is a wonderful man and owns his original article detailing the revenant.) First, here's the *press release!* From IGN: **SAN ANTONIO, TX** - At PAX South 2017, NCSOFT and ArenaNet announced the new profession joining the game in Guild Wars 2: Pharaoh of Bones, the Guild Wars 2 expansion that will return players to Elona - the land of the original Guild Wars expansion Nightfall. This expansion will add the Runeweaver class to the game - a 'profession' which will utilize ancient scrolls, powerful runewords, and sacred geometric patterns to smite foes and bolster allies. Guild Wars 2: Pharaoh of Thorn's new profession will tie into the storyline that unfolded through the game's Living World updates. The storyline has players and the game world of Tyria facing off in a war against the Elder Dragon Kralkatorrik and the Undead Pharaoh of Elona, Palawa Joko and his hordes. As the story progressed, players were bolstered by the return of the Forgotten and Apostate Margonites from the Mists, teaching them the powerful Forgotten language and ancient texts that have been preserved in the Mists. The next Guild Wars 2 expansion is expected to release sometime in 2018. Now for the blog post: ""**Runeweaver: The Power of Words** by Roy Cronacher on February 18, 2017 Hello, Tyrians! Im Roy Cronacher, and alongside my team, Ive been working on bringing the runeweaverthe new profession introduced in Guild Wars 2: Pharaoh of Bonesto life. We know youre excited to learn about the runeweaver, and its my privilege to finally start sharing some of the juicy details. Runweaver **Sketching it Out** The runeweaver is the tenth profession, added into Guild Wars 2 as a unique archetype not seen in other games. Runeweavers are lightly armored masters of the ancient languages of the Old Races of Tyria with abilities that allow them to harness and manipulate the sacred texts and geometries of these races in order to perform powerful spells and an unparalleled level of skill management. They utilize special Forgotten syllables and runewords to manipulate their own abilities and change the face of the battlefield. Those familiar with lore from the original Guild Wars will note that the Forgotten were heavily tied into the original Nightfall campaign, and along with the reformed Apostate Margonites we're happy to bring their unique brand of pre-Six Human Gods magic into the game. Here are some quick overview specifics: Unique profession mechanic Unique ability management and new skill types Light Armor High health pool, balancing the number of high health professions to three. Color scheme: gold, amber, and sapphire blue. Between now and the launch of the expansion, youll learn a lot about the runeweavers skills and abilities. Well start that process today by talking about the following: Spear Sword Scroll of the Forgotten Scroll of the Jotun Geometry and Positioning As mentioned, this professions unique theme is its evocation of primeval Tyrian wordcraft, but how does that affect its gameplay? Runeweaver UI 2 IMG Lets start with the basics. A runeweaver's skills are fundamentally imbued with ancient syllables - each skill has an associated syllable, with auto-attacks having one for each component of the auto chain - that are always on and combine to form runewords. With this constant forming of words, youll always be mixing and matching your skills to get the desired effect from your runewords. Runewords are formed from two syllables, and their are three syllables that can fit in those two slots. Thus, there are nine different runewords that you can form based on which skills you use when - it's a system unlike any we currently have in the game. Not only will the runeword you're forming cause different buffs and status effect, but whether your skill is starting or ending a runeword will sometimes cause that skill to have different properties. This runeword system will allow runweavers to make split-second decisions in battle that change minute-to-minute gameplay - the difference between leaping backward from or towards your foe with one of your scroll skills is where the syllable fits in the word, and you have to make that choice. The runeweaver will have to know which skills they can cast quickly to set up word-finishers, and which skills they can reliably cast to finish needed words. Different parts of the runeweavers kit will tend more towards certain runewords than others, with some syllables being dominant in certain weapons or scrolls more than others, and sometimes with limited access to certain syllables with high cooldowns. The runeword box is placed just above the red health orb, clearly in sight below the middle of the screen, allowing players to see which word they are currently creating - and mousing over the runeword symbol will show the actual letters associated with that symbol. The Forgotten syllables and combinations are as follows: Zu, the light syllable which tends more towards support effects. Aht, the medium syllable which balances the two sides. Ro, the heavy syllable which tends towards conditions. These combine into ZuZu - Regeneration ZuAht - Protection AhtZu - Might ZuRo - Swiftness AhtAht - Vulnerability RoZu - Fury AhtRo - Bleeding RoAht - Chill RoRo - Burning Runeweavers also have ancient skill scrolls, which you may remember from the original Guardian profession on release as tomes. We were never happy with how tomes worked on Guardian, and when we took them out prior to Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns, we began thinking about creating a new profession that would revolve around them and revitalize the idea. Skill scrolls are the other major component of what makes the runeweaver unique, and have a little bit in common with kits, attunements, legends, and other similar systems. Skill scrolls are equippable utility skills - on release the runeweaver will receive four or five scrolls, not counting specialization additions - that when activated will change the back half of your skill bar to that scroll's skills and cause a magical scroll to hover near your character's right shoulder. What's so special about that? Here's the catch: runeweaver's F1-3 skills will allow manipulation of scrolls. F1 will allow the runeweaver to swap the scroll around on their bar, replacing their weapon skills and allowing the summoning of another scroll on the back half, or the use of utilities. Don't like that scroll on that side? Swap them around as you like. F2 will dismiss the scroll on the 1-5 side of the bar, if there is one, and F3 will do the same for the back half. These skills will last until you dismiss them, and all have Forgotten syllables attached to each skill as well, and give access to other new runeweaver skill types. In addition, scrolls behave more like advanced weapon sets than anything else, all having auto-attacks and some having healing skills (although at least one has no healing skill). As you can see in the screenshot, the scrolls have much more of a look of a weapon set than a traditional utility set, and we'll get into how they play a bit farther along. This allows us to introduce another profession in Guild Wars 2 with unique functionality and a high skill ceiling that will hopefully please those that love swapping around skills on elementalists, engineers, or revenants. **A Fresh and Familiar Face** A runeweaver is not primarily a weapon-based profession; instead, like elementalists, their focus is on casting spells. We really wanted to emphasize the runeweaver as a true scholarly class - one that is as comfortable in ancient libraries or ruins as a battlefield, and the skill design reflects that. Thus, weapon choices will be limited - and the profession does not have access to weapon swap. Although revenant was originally designed not to have weapon swap, we later felt after testing in the beta events that this was too limiting. For the runeweaver this will be less of a problem, as scrolls and runewords and enormously to the amount of variety and customization the profession has access to. However, that doesn't mean that we're ignoring the weapons! The runeweaver will bring back some of the feel of the old Paragon Nightfall profession that never quite made it to Guardian, which rolled in some of the other Paragon concepts. This is a key part of the class that enhances the look and feel of gameplay as a runeweaver; you wont feel like a necromancer with its undead minions or shadowy attacks or an elementalist with its flashy elemental attacks. We want to push the feel of a profession that has studied old, and less showy but effective fighting styles and imbued the power of words into their weapons themselves. I know by now you must be thinking, Come on, tell me what some of the skills are! Ill indulge you with a few. Of course, in the expansion, weve picked up some new skills and acquired awesome new tech from our programmers. Here goes *Spear* Weve given a lot of thought to what should be our first new weapon given to one of our professions, and the spear was an easy choice. Not only are their lots of models in the game already, but it has a flavorful feel that isn't really found in the other weapons - of a weapon that's hardier then a bow but lighter than, say, the revenant's hammer throws. Runweavers have studied old Elonian fighting techniques and use their powers to enhance the spear in order to use it effectively against foes such as Joko's armies or Kralkatorrik's minions. Thats rightyoull use these unique powers of wordsmithing to imbue a magical spear which will teleport to you and be used to do massive single-target damage, while allowing you to remain in the midline to cast your spells safely. Wild Throw - Zu Imbue your spear to seek out your target and throw it at a right angle, before it snaps back towards your foe. The angle depends on syllable placement. This skill uses new tech that youll start seeing in many areas of our new profession, and gives a great example of runeword use as well. It throws your spear around various types of directional shields and walls, even around physical objects in the game world. This specific skills damage increases if the attack would otherwise be obstructed. This allows us to create very impactful attacks that have a lot more play to them for both yourself and the foes you use it against - who may want to look into finding some new ways of shielding themselves! Merciless Spear - Aht Throw your spear into the sky with a keen aim, tracking your foe before coming down and causing cripple and deep wounds. Again, this is brand-new, shiny tech. It's very difficult (not to mention powerful) to create skills that 'track' enemies, but this is something that you'll see with the runeweaver in several of their skills. The idea is that they have a feel for the ebb and flow of the ley-line and unseeable nature of physical Tyria through their grasp of the words that control it, and in addition we're bringing back a condition from the first Guild Wars! Deep wounds is a debuff that will max the amount of your opponents health at lower than normal - we're still working out the exact percentage. This debuff will only stick to your foe if they're less than 50% health, already. *Sword* While the sword is a seemingly commonplace and ordinary weapon compared to the spear, runeweavers are all about tradition - they just don't mind bending it a little bit. The sword will be a magical ranged weapon on the runeweaver which will operate mostly through piercing foes with magic word-powered energy from the Tyrian earth beneath their feet. The sword is based on causing lots of conditions and damage to groups of enemies from afar, while helping the runeweaver keep strong positioning. Whirling Charge - Ro Aim and dash forward three times, each stop causing a blast of energy and damaging foes you pass through. You evade attacks until your last dash. This skill is another demonstration of new tech. This kind of 'aimed' dash will require players to make quick split-second conditions - you can dash forward on a grid based on where you're facing and pressing the directional keys of the direction you want to go. So for example, if you want to go forward fast you'll just press 'w' or the up arrow or whatever key you have bound to 'foward'. If you want to dash behind you you'll tap the opposite three times. You will not change facing direction when dashing. This attack also begins to demonstrate some of the emphasis we're placing on 'sacred geometry' with the runeweaver that is inspired by calligraphy and architectural practices from the Middle East historically. This is a very geometric attack, and you'll want to make sure your positioning is correct. Mystic Sweep - Aht Whisper to your sword, imbuing it, before releasing an energy crescent that damages and blinds up to three targets, and causes targets to release explosions of light that could hit two more targets to damage and bleed. Sounds intense, right? This skill is one of my personal favorites as there is a lot of play and counterplay around it. Again, its an attack that focuses on grouped up foes. The range of the secondary explosions are not very large, so you need to be aware of when your enemies bunch up, or if you are the enemy you need to be aware of how close you're standing when facing a sword runeweaver. It also has a slight delay with a unique visual tell that allows enemies a chance to escape. Mystic Sweep is a great complimentary skill for the other skills on your bar, including some of the scroll skills. **Learning from Ancient Texts** I suppose its time to dive a bit more into the scrolls themselves. Again, scrolls are a core part of the runeweaver, as they can determine the skills on any, or both, sides of your skill bar. More than that, each legend includes a package of skills themed to that ancient race and a specific play style. In that sense, each scroll will feel very distinct; you will choose each one with a set purpose in mind - but with more flexibility and less personality than the revenant, for example. Your scrolls won't whisper in your ear about eating your enemies souls, for example, unlike some demons we know! Each scrolls skills are designed to be very distinct from one another visually, but more akin to engineer kits on that front than elementalist attunements, as the distinction will be more readily apparent in the changed playstyle. Telling your enemy's scroll choice will be a bit more similar to telling their weapon choice, in that way, though each scroll does have different styles and themes to its animations. It's important to note that when on the utility side of your bar, scroll attacks (such as scroll autoattacks) will be represented as skill effects coming from the scroll itself, while when on the weapon side of your bar the scrolls will become visually stronger - such as turning your hands into icy hammers for the Jotun scroll! *Scroll of the Jotun Astronomer* Summon a text of icy magics and powerful astrology. The Jotun scroll focuses on getting up close and personal while controlling areas of the battlefield. Runeweaver scrolls in general have more hybrid designs than some other class package skills. Instead of being focused solely on damage, conditions, or support, the Jotun scroll will focus on making you a tanky condition-focused character. Your approach on the battlefield learning from the Jotun is to lay your symbols and patterns to prolong your own survival and debilitate your enemies. Meanwhile, you'll be wailing on those foes while they try to focus you down or cleanse your conditions. People won't like you when you're angry. Lets look at an example. Orbital Eclipse IMG Orbital Eclipse - Aht Pattern. Summon the sacred geometry of the Jotun astronomers to create a pattern which rotates twice as a fire field, causing burning, and then completes as a dark field, causing blindness. This is an example of a pattern skill. You can see immediately that all patterns have two phases - incomplete and complete. When incomplete, patterns will often have different properties as they move along the ground or draw themselves before finishing and remaining in their final form as a field for a certain amount of time. All patterns are fields of differing kinds, though all have additional effects. In this case, youll be applying burning to those caught by the rotating moon symbol of the pattern as it spins counter-clockwise in two full rotations, and then you will be pulsing out blind to nearby foes while this field active. *Scroll of the Forgotten Caretaker* Summon a text of healing geometries and the burning desert. The Forgotten were an incredibly important race in the original Guild Wars, but were often found tending to and protecting other beings or environments. That is the kind of style you can expect from the Scroll of the Forgotten, focusing on supporting your allies and punishing your foes with conditions of the Crystal Desert. Lets check out another example of a new type of skill the runeweaver has access to through the Scroll of the Forgotten. Crystal Path - Ro Chant. You become unstoppable. Leave behind a pattern of light field lines wherever you walk, that also causes torment to enemies that pass over it. What better skill to evoke the Forgotten than one that brings to mind pilgrimages and crystal dragons? This is the last new skill type that the runeweaver has access to, although it will likely be more available on other professions with new elite specializations when compared to patterns. Chants are the opposite of mesmer mantras, essentially - the require an instant activation and then are active for the entirety of a channel that cannot be interrupted or removed. Theyre great for when you need some help that will stick around for a little while that is more powerful than your average buff or signet - this one in particular demonstrates more new tech that has a ridiculously cool number of uses and play opportunities. **New and Shiny!** We've already explained the deep wound condition that will be coming to runeweavers and other professions this expansion, and that's just some of the cool ways well allow players to interact with new types of skills in our combat system this expansion. The Runeweaver also has a very cool set of traits that we're not quite ready to talk about just yet, though I'll say that I'm particularly fond of the line names. Astronomy, Secrets, Speech, Archaeology, and Calligraphy will all boost your new skill types and scrolls in really cool new ways. We should also mention at this point that for those that want an option for builds that will not be scroll-based, the runeweaver will have one full set of heal, utilities, and elite skill that are not scroll-based. Just in case. **Just the Beginning** This was just the tip of the iceberg. There are more weapons and scrolls coming with the runeweaver, but youll have to wait to find out more. Its no fun to spoil everything at once. Just the Beginning All of the features that I detailed today in this blog will be available in our first playable demo at PAX East in Boston, March 68, and at Rezzed in London, March 1214. Ill personally be at PAX East on the showroom floor, and I hope to see some of you there trying out the expansion for the first time. See you all on the battlefield!

367,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Solid Necro 'Tanking Build' for sPVP,0,3ezz67,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3ezz67/solid_necro_tanking_build_for_spvp/,2015-07-29 16:32:03,"(Warning: Build Guide, so it's really TL;DR!) I call it 'Nana-nana-boo-boo' but it might also work well named 'Point Holder'. I'll link the build and then explain it. Thank you for reading if you do decide to read it! This build works in both Unranked and Ranked PVP and seems to do very well in Solo and Duo Queue. **Link to Build** URL **So you want to PVP as a Necro?** First thing to note is that this is **not** the end all necro build or even an amazing one. It works for most situations and is a **fantastic** build for solo or duo queuing but it has very little team synergy and is primarily focused on solo play. There are many ways to play every class and this is one of many that I do with the necro, but you should get some mileage out of it! **Build Concept** When I was designing this build I had the idea that Minions could be extremely useful if they could do more damage consistently and not die as easily. As a result, this is what I've come up with. Now the most difficult part here is realizing that Lifeforce is literally your lifeforce. If you don't have it, you are dead. But if you have it, you will be very hard to kill and you will do solid damage. This comes from the fact that every minion you have that is attacking will heal you, every attack you do heals you, and you will have insane toughness because of Armored Shroud and Flesh of the Master. The minions will also hit **very hard** if you take these traits because you will be hitting close to or max stacks of vulnerability almost constantly- which is 18-25% increased damage on the target. With all of that in consideration I'll explain further why we take each trait, what you aim to do with each weapon, why we take each Sigil, rune-set, and the pendant. **The Weapons:** **Axe and Focus** First off let's start by addressing the primary weapons you will be using. Axe and Focus. They both have an attack that applies vulnerability with Rending Claws applying 2 per hit and Reaper's Touch applying 4 and giving nearby allies (usually your minions) regeneration. In addition we have a high damage attack in Ghastly Claws that gives us a **huge** chunk of lifeforce and the wonderful Spinal Shivers that allows a very noteworthy nuke and removal of boons! Unholy Feast is a decent spell, but since we won't want to be too close to the enemy, it's not super useful for this build. **Dagger and Warhorn** This is your swap set.. why? Because dagger has high damage output for the most part, an immobilize, and life siphon, but more than that- it generates Lifeforce **very quickly** and that's a huge thing in this build, so we want to be able to swap to a weapon that can literally save your life as quickly as possible. Warhorn allows you to cross the map and pin down running targets or buy you a few seconds with the daze to build up lifeforce. **The Minions** Alright, here's where things get.. micro-y. In order to understand Minion AI you have to understand why they are crap. They will hit what you hit.. sometimes. But more than often they will stand there. However, I've found, that if you call a target the Minions seem much more responsive (maybe wishful thinking?). In this section we're going to go over each minion, what it does, and when it's a good idea to use it. **Blood Fiend** Do not consume this minion unless you are nearly dead. It is much more valuable alive now that you can heal while being in Death Shroud. Other than that it's just something you should have up as often as possible. If you have every minion off cooldown this one is the first to summon. **Bone Minions** These little guys are mainly to absorb those conditions and re-apply them thanks to Necromantic Corruption. Other than that, they have good combo potential if you team up with an Ele or some other field heavy user and relatively good burst which should be used when they are low on health. **Bone Fiend** This guy hits like a **truck** and can help you pin down thieves and guardians that like to roll through your barrage of vulnerability. Use his ability **only** when you are in a defending state. **Flesh Wurm** If you are ready to lock into **tank mode** which we will discuss later in the strategy part of this little guide, you deploy this guy. He hits really hard and allows you one more stun breaker. **Flesh Golem** Used to be the bread and butter of an old Minion Master build I ran, but these days it's just a friendly neighborhood freight train that can CC an enemy or group if need be. Remember that this guy starts his charge in the direction and position he is facing when you command it. **Sigils** Force and Frailty because you need as much damage as you can get out of this build and you want to stack as much Vulnerability too! **Runes** We pick Ogre for the same reason we pick Force and also because Rock Dog is OP (jk). Otherwise the power is nice to help complement the insane toughness you'll have. **Amulet** We take Soldier to extend our allowance of time outside of our Death Shroud so that we can build up our Lifeforce and re-summon our minions while also having a nice power to modify with Ogre and Force. **Traits Explained** Death Magic is a specialization that we use to make our Minions better and make ourselves harder to kill. Through a combination of Armored Shroud and Necromantic Corruption we gain up to 280 toughness from having our minions out and being in the Shroud. It also allows us to remove the shroud to gather more lifeforce so that we can spend more time inside of it healing from Vampiric Presence and Unholy Sanctuary. Soul Reaping we use to generate more lifeforce and make our time in the Shroud beneficial. Naturally we grab Unyeilding Blast for the vulnerability, Vital Persistance so that we stay in Shroud longer, and the absolutely necessary Foot in the Grave which acts as a Stabilizer and Stun Break, making our shroud a CC breaker as well as a tanking tool. Blood Magic is our sustain. It's where we get all of our 'kitten you' powers. We take ritual of life because the others will not be super useful. You won't be in dagger enough to warrant taking Quickening Thirst and we're not inflicting enough bleed for Blood Bond. Naturally we take Vampiric Presence for sustain, team sustain and minion sustain, but the big element here is going to be the synergy between generating more lifeforce, Necromantic Corruption and Unholy Martyr. As I understand it, when the minions pull conditions off of you, you generate lifeforce- this is amazing. You will be able to camp in shroud for insane periods of time and if you remember to dodge so that Marks of Blood proc, it will be extremely hard to shut you down. **Finally, Strategy** First thing to understand is that this build is not built for killing people, though it certainly gets the job done. This build is built to take points and hold them indefinitely against any number of players and/or keep players from being able to kill you so you take up their valuable time and let your team gain the advantage. That said, the concept works like this. **Attacking A Point** Open with the tag, call your target- make sure it's not a mesmer if you can help it as they will drop the target before your minions can get any significant damage in. Set up your Wurm on the edge of the fight in case you need it, don't be afraid to get hit but get your lifeforce up quickly, then apply vuln with the Reaper's Touch. Once you figure out who your highest Vuln, lowest boon target is, burst. Burst hard and juggle Death Shroud to heal, try to stay topped off. Keep your minions up and use Shroud to Break Stuns and immobilize or fear targets that have lots of CC and re-summon your downed creeps. **Defending a Point** Have your Wurm set up in the point somewhere and fear them out as long as you can, CC them with the Flesh Golem, cripple them, chill them. Once they get in the point use the Death Shroud only when you have it maxed out if possible, kite in it, hold them out make it hard to catch you by dodging their CC when you can and then Juggle out to break their boons, give your minions regen with Reaper's Touch and if necessary heal up with the Life Siphon. If there are multiple enemies make sure that you line them up for the Flesh Golem knock down and juggle out to build your Lifeforce back up. **Roaming** If you're just moving around the map, use the Dagger/Warhorn as you'll get bonus movement speed and it has an immobilize and daze to help you escape! **Final Notes** This build was really fun to make an test, one surprising thing is that this build can solo the lords, their minions, Svanir and Chieftain with relative ease. If you liked it please let me know! I have a few more not as effective but equally fun builds! Enjoy and keep PVPing! "
368,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Nerf Lightning Hammer without reducing damage!,0,38jioa,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/38jioa/nerf_lightning_hammer_without_reducing_damage/,2015-06-05 03:14:19,"So we know Anet has said recently that some of the conjures (ice bow and lightning hammer) are getting incoming nerfs. I'd like to express a factor of the lightning hammer conjure that should be the focus of the nerf, while keeping the damage the same. Elementalists have a lot of access to straight out damage buffing traits, which is fine because either they attack slowly (staff &amp;amp;amp; scepter) or they have to spend time using defensive abilities and dodging (dagger/x) to help them survive considering that elementalists have low health pools and low armor, which makes Melee range fighting difficult. Therefore traits that give damage buffs are required to compensate for lost time or slow autoattacks. The traits used in the current s/f LH build are: 10% damage while attuned to fire 10% damage to burning foes 10% damage while in 600 range 20% to vulnerable targets This is in addition to the might and fury stacking capabilities of the s/f build as well as the ferocity granted by arcane lightning. So an elementalist, the weakest defensive class, is using a weapon in melee range, and it restricted from using its 4 attunements, it should be rewarded with a high damage output right? I think it does, however the **blinds** from the last attack in the lightning hammers auto attack make this easier. The balance should continue the current damage output, but reduce the blind duration to 1-1.5s or take it out completely to give the weapon risk of using. Right now it's easy to get buffs, then go berserk without being able to be hit due to blinds. Keeping the damage output the same means it is still possible to do the same amount of damage but will rely on party support to mitigate incoming damage, and the DPS loss would occur when the elementalist isn't supported and is either getting hit or having to dodge. Reducing this weapon's damage might take it to the point where the tradeoff of a utility slot and cast time isn't worth it, and the player might just be better off using lightning whip on a dagger build. Thoughts? Edit: and if blinding were to be taken out, it should be replaced with weakness or vulnerability, so that completing the attack chain still is rewarded with additional effect. (Heck, what about providing 3-4s or area fury on the 3rd hit?)"
369,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[SUGGESTION] Final Living Story to merge into HoT,0,38me2g,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/38me2g/suggestion_final_living_story_to_merge_into_hot/,2015-06-05 13:49:23,"Alright, here it goes: Heart of Thorns. Push it back another month. Have it finished and ready to go, but wait 30 more days. Use those 30 extra days to work on this surprise release  during this time, focus 100% on this. Forget the rest of your schedule. This DLC will cost like 800 gems, HEAR ME THE FUCK OUT. Dont dismiss this until you completely read this brilliant idea: Mordremoth. Mother Tree. Talking cabbno, no fuck the talking cabbages. Mordremoth. Straight up. Hardcore. Railing the Mother Tree. Tentacles everywhere, blocking the exits in and out of the Pale Tree. There is no escape. But this dragon is just slammin the Tree. Her avatar is screaming, you know like when the mini dragon attacked her in Living Story? Like that. She hits the deck, lights go out, super romantic, shes just getting rammed hard by this veggie dragon and shes getting slammed GOOD. Im talking full out max vulnerability, permanent fear, weakened, AT LEAST 19 stacks of confusion, one or two bleeds (for that M rating). Also, have her immobilized while getting launched by that dragon rod, that way even the game client gets freaked by whats going on. All hope is lost. WHEN SUDDENLY: she starts to like it. The Mother Tree is like Wait were both plants, I can dig it. And thats when you tie in the Sylvari getting mind fucked, they start passin out from the collective experience of getting dragon fucked  the feeling seeps into the Dream and they all go crazy. From that point, every single Sylvari player character, when they log in, there is a 92% opacity layer over their screen thats just a 7 minute repeating scene of the Mother Tree getting plowed by Mordremoth. BUT ONLY THE SYLVARI PCs SEE THAT!! (400 gems: item to re-live the experience for anyone.) Anyway, Mordremoth is goin to town. Sap all over the place. STOP Cut to Living World content: Two whole weeks No one gets into the Pale Tree. Its the new broken-ass Lions Arch. No one gets in for two weeks while Mordremoth and the Tree just bang. Two weeks. Every Sylvari character gets to watch that 7 minute scene. For two goddamn weeks. And dont tell me thats too long. Face it, thats the most intriguing Living World content that Ive seen in the past 4 fucking months. And Sylvari will be pissed off about it, too. Perfect for HoT when theyre all pissed off, anyway. BUT THATS NOT ALL! You dont get to go to the Pale Tree, but everyone gets to HEAR it! You cant travel there, place is blocked off by hentai vines, but all surrounding areas that lead to that map get to hear the two of them just straight up fuckin hard. Alright, two weeks later Two weeks later, things get quiet, vines retreat Oh what? Players can go back into the Tree place? You walk in the Tree looks a bit worse for wear: some claw marks, a few snapped twigs, its tilting a bit to the side and a big explorable pseudo-cave system where the Mother Trees ass would be. Players can go in, check it out. Have some NPCs walkin in there, like Mordremoth Oozes, an asura going My ears, what sticky sap or a Charr going Well, it wasnt no Searing, but that shit was HOT!  or a Sylvari just quietly sobbing in a corner. Anyway, MORDREMOTH just FUCKS OFF. Hes gone! He just leaves. I mean, he woke up, ate some magic, and just righteously fucked this plant, hes doing great. He takes some time off to go relax. AND THATS WHEN YOU SLAM IT THE FUCK DOWN: REVEAL THE DEEP SEA DRAGON. He bursts out of the water like I CANT FUCK THE SEA!! and he is PISSED OFF. FULL FUCKING CIRCLE. No one expects that shit!! Awesome opportunity for Living World events, like. Oh god! The Mother Tree might get pregnant! Its up to the players to figure that out!! And it gets split because some players are dumb and will tie it to abortion, and theyll get pissy with those that dont TA-DA!! NEW PVP SETTING! You guys are fucking welcome, no thanks necessary. Shit, make it 1600 gems. Id pay that. "
370,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[Idea] Tempest Specialization,6,38nhlp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/38nhlp/idea_tempest_specialization/,2015-06-05 20:33:23,"I'm pretty sure everyone is excited for their new elite specialization, and that I'm not the only who wants his class to be a full package of cool, useful and, above all, fun to play. Some made posts regarding weapon or skill ideas, but I decided to kick it up a notch and try with my best powers to come up with a fully detailed specialization for the class I've been maining since day #1, **Elementalist**. This will be a long read, spiced with wishful thinking, hopes and dreams, and as a way to (hopefully) inspire those working on Tempest - or just pure theorycraft. Feel free to add ideas of your own, or point out how poor my sense of balance is. &amp;nbsp; **What is Tempest ?** Yes, we all know it will be the elementalist spec, but aside that, we have no other clues. So we're going to work with what we have available. * **Tempest**, as per dictionary, is a *violent storm*. I emphasized that trait in a ""reckless but rewarding"" playstyle. * **Swords**. Elementalists are, by default, a scholar class that specializes on magic. Give it a sword, and you have an arcane warrior in the making - that uses the elemental powers to enhance their offense. &amp;nbsp; **a) Weapon Skills** * **Fire** **#1** : 3 slashes, 3rd one restores endurance (*amount increased if under a stance*) **#2** : Release a fiery nova around your character, dealing damage. *If under the effect of burning, gain vigor.* **#3** : Short distance teleport (*up to 600 range*) that blasts the area on arrival and deals damage. *If no enemy is hit, applies burning to player. * * **Air** **#1** : 3 slashes, 3rd one grants evasion for 1/2s (*duration increased if under a stance*) **#2** : Leap towards your target. If under the effect of swiftness, increase leap distance. If under superspeed, apply AoE blind on land. **#3** : Calls a thunder strike on the player location. Chains to nearby enemies in a 180 AoE and applies vulnerability to them *If no enemy is hit, applies blind to player.* * **Water** **#1** : 3 slashes, last one heals for a small amount on hit (*all hits proc heal if under a stance*) **#2** : Perform a spin that splashes water around you. Deals more damage if the enemy is chilled. Applies blind if the enemy is burning (*cleanse the burning in the process*) **#3** : Add chill to your next 3 hits. If any of the 3 attacks crit, you also apply slow. If you do not use the charges before the buff expires, you get chilled for every stack not consumed (*up to 6 seconds*) * **Earth** : **#1** : 3 slashes, 3rd one cripples (*changes to immobilize if under a stance*) **#2** : Leave a trail of spikes behind you, that cripple enemies walking/standing on them. If the enemy is also bleeding,they become poisoned. **#3** : Activate a shield that absorbs projectiles (up to 10). Activate again to release the projectiles to nearby enemies (adding bleed to them). If the shield absorbs a 11th projectile, or is not released in 5 seconds, it detonates,dealing damage to those around you, and applies bleed to player. &amp;nbsp; **Note** : #1's cleave and have 150 range &amp;nbsp; **b) Traits** * **Minor** : Stances block the first hit after being activated **I** : +Toughness while in a stance, for every enemy in a 360 radius. **II**: +1% damage after attunement swapping, additional 1% per recharging attunement **III** : Stances knockback all enemies in a 180 AoE when activated. &amp;nbsp; * **Adept** : Whenever you get blinded, you gain fury and swiftness (icd) **IV**: You gain stability every second when in a stance, as long you stand still. **V** : fury duration +20%, +150 ferocity when entering a stance **VI** : When an elemental condition is applied to you, mirror it to the enemy that applied it. Elemental conditions on you last longer. (+20%) &amp;nbsp; * **Grand Master** : Each time you crit, you gain quickness for 2-3s (icd) **VII** : For every elemental condition (burn, chill, vulnerability, bleed) you suffer, gain 5% increased damage **VIII** : While under the effects of fury, your sword attacks are unblockable **IX** : Your stances recharge faster each time you get damaged by a critical hit. (icd) &amp;nbsp; **Note** : This was the roughest one. Balance is fickle if you have no testing grounds, but I tried to make it diverse and give several options to combo stuff - or supplement favorite playstyles (stances, power or condi) &amp;nbsp; **c) Skills (stances)** Before we begin, you may ask, *Why stances ?*. I think the justification is pretty simple. By being a hybrid warrior-ish class, the choice was between physical skills or stances. Physical just doesn't feel appropriate for a (still) caster class, while Stances give the vibe of a ""battle meditation"" that felt pretty fitting. &amp;nbsp; * **Adaptive Stance (Heal)** Break Stun, continuously heal over a period of time. If you are hit (crit?) during that period, based on attunement, you apply a condition to your attacker. When it ends, it grants a boon based on the attunement. *Fire* : Burn/Might (3 stacks) *Water* : Vulnerability/Regen *Air* : Blind/Swiftness *Earth* : Weakness/Protection &amp;nbsp; * **Wisdom Stance** Incoming conditions are converted to boons. When it ends, you gain resistance. (*existing conditions before skill activation expire 90% faster*) &amp;nbsp; * **Unstable Stance** You gain quickness for 10 seconds. Every 2 seconds, a condition is randomly applied to you (*weakness, blind, chill*). When it ends, you lose all endurance and become crippled. &amp;nbsp; * **Ethereal Stance** Clear conditions and boons, become immune to damage and further conditions/boons for the duration. You cannot attack or enter any stance. &amp;nbsp; (*Elite was insanely hard to think. Elementalist suffer from the ""useless or extremely situational"" elite syndrome - so the line between completely broken and completely trash was really thin. I devised something that fits the theme of a violent storm, complete with utility, in or outside a battle.*) &amp;nbsp; * **Tempest Stance (Elite)** - 1.5 activation, 4 seconds condition phase, 3 seconds cc phase. Unleash the full potential of Tempest and gain mastery over elements. Conjure a powerful elemental storm at your location, based on attunement. (360 AoE) You are rooted for the entire duration of the channel, and cannot interrupt it or activate other stances. You take reduced damage for every elemental condition on you, but are still susceptible to interrupts. &amp;nbsp; **Fire** : Area around caster turns red-crimson. Creates a lava font underneath you that applies constant burning. After 4 seconds, meteors start falling in the area, that knockdown enemies and apply further burning. *End effect* : every ally in a 360 AoE gains 5 stacks of might and fiery aura &amp;nbsp; **Water** : Snow starts falling around the caster. The ground freezes, which applies constant chill. After 4 seconds, enemies remaining in the chill become temporarily frozen solid. (take less damage in the frozen state but cannot move or use skills) *End effect* : every ally in a 360 AoE gains 15s of regen and frost aura &amp;nbsp; **Air** : Heavy rain starts around the caster. Powerful winds start blinding the enemies standing inside. After 4 seconds, lightning bolts start hitting randomly, which apply vulnerability and weakness, plus mini-daze. *End effect* : every ally in a 360 AoE gains 20s of swiftness and shocking aura &amp;nbsp; **Earth** : The ground (screen) starts shaking in the area, applying constant cripple to those caught in the shockwave. After 4 seconds, enemies get launched outside the initial cast point. *End effect* : every ally in a 360 AoE gains 10s of protection and magnetic aura &amp;nbsp; *Note : All storms create a blast field (fire, ice, lightning) except earth, which creates a blast finisher itself every 2 seconds.* &amp;nbsp; This concludes the extremely lengthy elementalist fanboy post. I hope you had as much fun reading as I had writing it - and **thank you for reaching this far !** "
371,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Idea to make necros contribute more to the team,0,38usys,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/38usys/idea_to_make_necros_contribute_more_to_the_team/,2015-06-07 10:33:48,"So today I was exploring maps with my necromancer, and I don't know even how I came up with such an idea. Basically, there could be a master or grandmaster trait, which would make corruption skills draw a related condition from allies (Bleed for Blood is power, vulnerability for pandemic, etc.) and/or apply a boon on allies. Blood is power could simply apply might on allies, Corrosive poison cloud - regeneration. Fury could be thrown in too, I guess on Corrupt boon, because it has longer cooldown so wouldn't be so OP. Regarding trait system changes, this effect could be added to Toxic landing (with specialisation system it not only reduces fall damage, but shortens corruption CDs by 20%. Sure there can be balances issues, so it could be made that it only reduces CDs by 10%. If it was too powerful for an adept trait, it could be swapped with something from major traits. Such a trait wouldn't require a huge rework on trait lines, yet it would enhance necros in dungeon encounters alot, imho. Thematically it could be explained that necros corrupt themselves and draw corruption from other players (if it's made to draw a condition from allies) and enhances them in exchange."

For example: -**Big Game Hunter**: Striking an enemy tethered by your spear of justice causes vulnerability with every attack and increase 15% damage dealt. -**Light's Judgement**: Trap that damages (x10), reveals, and gives 25 stacks of vulnerability to the target for 10s.

Sorry for really really bad English, I hope you understand WEAPON. Main hand scepter, offhand dagger, offhand warhorn. BUILD. Reaper is the way to go, I can explain. URL UTILIZATION AND EXPLANATION. Rotation: well of suffering, dagger5, scepter2, blood is power, dagger 4, signet of spite, scepter 3, warhorn 5, enter in reaper shroud and use skill 5-4-2 and autoattack, after 9 seconds from the finish of locust swarm you should exit, use locust swarm, swap weapon and use well of suffering, scepter2, dagger5, blood is power, dagger 4, scepter 3, return in reaper shroud and repeat. Signet of spite will be activated each 2 rotation. You will never use the weak autoattack of scepter and you use it only for skill that apply a lot of condition or direct damage or both effect. The trait lingering curse should work while in reaper shroud so the autoattack in reaper shroud apply 6 seconds of burning, the autoattack will do 3 attack in 2 seconds so can keep 9 stack burning, a buffed barded precision work really fine with the really fast attack and about 100% critical chance, after use locust swarm entering in death shroud and use 5-4-2 and auoattack you will see about 25 stack bleeding, great amount of chill, poison, and burning. The combo 5+4+2 will do great direct damage and chilling boltsx11 and apply frost armor to you. Autoattack in reaper shroud do a great direct and condition damage, a lot of might and regen ds(5 seconds might each hit to chilled foes), and will apply easy 25 stack vulnerability(increased from lingering curse, like all the condition for all the fight). Out of death shroud you will do a lot of bleeding for very long time, give might to yourself and do good direct damage from scepter 3, locust swarm and well of suffering and you will stay out of reaper shroud only for 10 seconds, next you stay about 24 seconds in reaper shroud. That's almost all sorry for the long post :) chill do condition damage each second but not stack in intensity, and with the trait that we do chill at chilled foes(6 seconds) three time each 10 seconds we have perma chill. Maybe after the first combo 5-4-2 we could stop to repeat this combo and do instead more autoattack, we will see. If we need to kill trash of mob we should chance signet of spite with epidemic. After this analysis I can say that necro have great chance to be the greatest or the second greatest conditioner for pve, absolutely don't lack of direct damage and do really great condition damage, have maybe access to the better burning in the game together with great direct damage, vulnerability and might, chill, poison, bleeding. We will see like they balance epidemic but probably will be great. Survivability will be really fine, 15% permanent damage reduction, and great regen of death shroud, and we will stay into death shroud most of the time. Maybe maybe and maybe because I don't have a perfect knowledge of al the profession and because we have saw only 3 elite spec. Again sorry for the long and maybe bad structured edit. I'd like to have your opinion, comment and begin to discuss about this excite changes."

The change was donce, cause PvE mobs don't use skills often enough. * Poison is a DoT and lowers your healing. * Vulnerability affects conditions. * Swiftness and Chill won't affect movement skills like leap now. ArenaNet knows that it's controversial, but those skills allowed to skip content, break out of map etc. Also for example Earthshaker is a ground target skill and if you are chilled, you don't land where you aimed, which is confusing for the player. * Skills which convert boons and conditions now randomly select a boon/condition which will be converted. Until now, last casted skill was converted. They showed tables of all boon to condition and condition to boon conversions. **ELEMENTALIST** * Conjured weapons will be stronger now. They want to encourage using different skills, other than just #4 on Ice Bow. They know that until now people just used few skills. **WARRIOR** * Burst skills havelower cooldowns (8s instead of 10s). * Longbow distance increased to 1200. * They didn't have slides for Tactics. **ENGINEER** * Grenades have 900 range now (was 1200). * F5 skill is now available. * All grenade skills throw 3 grenades by default. * All kit backpacks were removed and replaced with a weapon that your character holds to distinguish the kit you are currently using. * Toss Elixir X - transforms enemies into Moas. * Med Kit was redone. It gives you a cool glove with syringes. Healing skill #1 doesn't heal you, but heals allies. * Mortar was redone. F5 gives your Orbital Strike now! * Supply Crate is a turret now! Turret traits work with it. If you have it equipped F5 allows you to summon just the health packs. The elite itself summons 3 turrets. Using elite skill again overcharges all 3 turrets. Using F5 again allows you to detonate 3 turrets at once. * Gadgeteer grandmaster trait will overcharge gadgets and for example allow you to fly further with Rocket Boots. **RANGER** * Longbow has 1500 range by default now. * All spirits now have a 30s cooldown. * All active spirit skills now sacrifice the spirits. * Spirits are no longer mobile and the trait was removed.

378,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Consume Conditions,22,3a0k7n,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3a0k7n/consume_conditions/,2015-06-16 17:41:33,"So, the new Consume Conditions now has a 30 second recharge and applies self vulnerability. On the side note: Master of Corruption: Reduces recharge of corruption skills by 33% but causes corruption skills to apply additional conditions to you when cast. (Condition applied varies per skill.) SoI could possibly fear myself after healing? Hahayeah, I am scared to what can happen in PvP nowsomeone hold onto my arms and calm me down with some encouraging words. Let me know on the comment section if anyone could think of a build right now with the patch notes given to us where Consume Condition can still be a reliable heal for small skirmishes (1v2, 2v3, etc) in PvP. I've always liked Consume Condition for its condition removal as well. Now...I don't know."
379,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Celestial Engineer with Core Specializations,0,3a0mut,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3a0mut/celestial_engineer_with_core_specializations/,2015-06-16 18:19:20,"[**Celestial Engineer**](URL is indisputably one of the strongest builds in sPvP, with high mobility, damage, sustain, and minor support through Healing Turret to boot. It's only counters are heavy conditions and CC chains, and even then, Slick Shoes + Gear Shield + Rune of Vampirism give many disengage options. But looking over today's announced changes, it seems like it's going to get even stronger. Yes, the meta will shift once the patch happens, and other builds may rise that counter Cele Engi. But as it stands, it's pretty terrifying how much better this new Cele Engi is than the old one. Consider the following trait selections (chosen to come as close to the existing ""feel"" of a Celestial Engineer): **Explosives** *Minor* * **Evasive Powder Keg**: Create a bomb when you dodge. * **Steel-Packed Powder**: Your explosions cause 5s of vulnerability. * **Explosive Powder**: Explosions deal 10% more damage. Your turrets explode, dealing damage and knocking back nearby foes when destroyed. *Major* * **Grenadier**: Increases your throw velocity of grenades by 100%. Increases the blast radius of grenades by 60. * **Shaped Charge**: You deal 5% increased damage to foes affected by vulnerability. * **Thermobaric Detonation**: Evasive Powder Keg is now a blast finisher. **Firearms** *Minor* * **Sharpershooter**: Your critical hits have a 33% chance to cause 4s of bleeding. * **Hematic Focus**: You have a 10% increased chance to critically strike foes affected by bleeding. * **Serrated Steel**: Bleeding you apply lasts 33% longer. *Major* * **Heavy Armor Exploit**: Your critical hits have a 50% chance to grant you 3s of swiftness and cause 3s of vulnerability. * **No Scope**: Your critical hits on nearby foes have a 100% chance to grant you 4s of fury. This trait has a 10 second internal cooldown. * **Incendiary Powder**: Your critical hits inflict 4s of burning. Burning you apply lasts 33% longer. This trait has a 10 second internal cooldown. **Alchemy** *Minor* * **Hidden Flask**: Drink an elixir B when struck while below 75% health. * **Transmute**: Incoming conditions have a 100% chance of being converted into a boon. This trait has a 15 second internal cooldown. * **Alchemical Tinctures**: Elixirs remove a condition from affected allies. Boons you apply last 20% longer. *Major* * **Invigorating Speed**: When you gain swiftness you also gain 6s of vigor. This trait has a 5 second internal cooldown. * **Backpack Regenerator**: While using a kit you passively recover health. * **Stimulant Supplier**: Drop a stim pack when you use a heal skill. This trait has a 10 second internal cooldown. This is a bit overwhelming to look at as is, but I'll just to highlight some key buffs with this kit: * **High/near-permanent Fury uptime** from Stimulant Supplier + No Scope + Hidden Flask, just by swapping into Med Kit every 10s, picking up the Stimulant, and getting critical hits on nearby foes (easy with grenades or Sigil of Intelligence). This is in addition to +10% chance to critical bleeding foes (which also procs Engi crits and is pretty common in general). * **Bigger &amp; faster grenades** from the Grenadier trait. Makes it much easier to land grenades. * **Free blast finishers** from ~~Evasive Arcana~~ Thermobaric Detonation * **Passive +5% damage** from Shaped Charge (vuln applied on every grenade) * **More than one usable elite in PvP** (not specific to this build, but I'm just happy this is a thing now for Engi). Supply Crate still gives plenty of random CC from turret explosions (it still stuns, right?) and heals, while Mortar Kit is the new kit for engaging and long-range damage. Of course, this is not without some drawbacks: * **No out-of-combat movement speed**. You could change Alchemy for Inventions to get Mecha Legs (and also Automated Medical Response + Vampiric Rune synergy, and Cleansing Synergy which is just obscene with Healing Turret), but I think Backpack Regenerator might give more sustain. * **No Inertial Converter** (Toolbelt skills recharge when &lt;25%). This is big, since it means you don't get the free escape after Rune of Vampirism procs. * **No +Endurance from Toolbelt skills** though this isn't important. Discuss?"
380,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Discussion: Thoughts on the viability of different Shatter Mesmer builds with Specializations,4,3ac5jf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3ac5jf/discussion_thoughts_on_the_viability_of_different/,2015-06-19 08:18:55,"Edit: This is definitely thought in the mind of PvP. Please include PvE suggestions in comments :) When it comes to Shatter Mesmers, I think we will still be using Dom/Duel/Illusions. That said, with Prismatic Understanding, some Mesmers may opt to play GS &amp; Sword/Torch for some Chaos fun. Chaos also gives more protection. I'm going to list the potential traits in adept, master, and grandmaster for Dom/Duel/Illusions that will probably be most viable. **Domination - Adept** II - Empowered Illusions - Illusions deal 15% more damage. III - Rendering Shatter - Shatter skills inflict 1 stack of vulnerability for 8 seconds on foes they hit. *Thoughts:* When taking domination, the minor traits give 3 boosts to vulnerability. You apply 3 stacks when you interrupt, 5 stacks when you daze, and you apply 0.5% more damage per stack. As it stands, with Diversion, Mesmers can already stack 20+ vulnerability on enemies quite easily. With that in mind, I don't think Rendering Shatter will yield more damage than Empowered Illusions will while you're setting up your shatters. My personal take is one should take Empowered Illusions over Rendering Shatter. **Domination - Master** IV - Shattered Concentration - Shatter skills remove 1 boon from foes they hit. *Thoughts:* There isn't any other viable trait here for a shatter mesmer. This trait is crucial for individual fights and group fights. **Domination - Grandmaster** VIII - Mental Anguish - Shatter skills deal 15% more damage. This bonus damage is doubled on foes that are not activating skills. *Thoughts:* While Imagined Burden sounds awesome with the 2s cripple every time a GS attack hits, it just doesn't beat out Mental Anguish. Mental Anguish is an amazing trait when matched with the vulnerability minors this specialization gives you. Further, with mass invis, you'll be able to insta-down much more often because of the double bonus damage when you hit unsuspecting opponents. **Domination: II - IV - VIII** ---- **Dueling - Adept** I - Phantasmal Fury - Your phantasms gain 10 seconds of fury every 10 seconds. *Thoughts:* Truth be told, you don't really taking Dueling for the Adept trait. This line is all about the Master and Grandmaster traits you bring. That said, Phantasmal Fury is the only trait that makes sense to bring out of the Adept traits. Sure, Desperate Decoy is here, but the Fury is worth it when setting up shatters. **Dueling - Master** IV - Blinding Dissipation - Whenever you use a shatter skill you blind foes around you for 3 seconds. V - Evasive Mirror - Whenever you successfully evade an attack, you gain a projectile reflecting barrier for 1.5 seconds (1.5s ICD). *Thoughts:* When I first looked at these traits, Evasive Mirror sounded awesome for dealing with Rapid Fire... Then, you look at Blinding Dissipation. Blinding Dissipation is a no-brainer here. It blinds multiple foes for 3 seconds when you shatter. This helps survivability against thieves and other classes in general. This can also help swing the tide in team fights. With Illusionary Persona being baseline now, you can simply use this to save yourself when you don't have any clones available. **Dueling - Grandmaster** IX - Deceptive Evasion - Whenever you use a dodge roll you create a clone. *Thoughts:* This one doesn't really need any introduction. It doesn't have any competition from the other 2 Grandmaster traits and it is also a huge source of clone production. **Dueling: I - IV - IX** ---- **Illusions - Adept** I - Compounding Power - Deal 3% increased damage and gain 50 condition damage for each illusion you control. II - Persistence of Memory - When a phantasm shatters all phantasm skills have their recharge reduced by 2 seconds. III - The Pledge - Torch skills remove 1 condition from you when activated. While stealthed, torch skills recharge 1.5% every second. *Thoughts:* For the first time, every single Adept trait is viable. Phantasm skills having their recharge reduced by 2 seconds is very cool, but is it worth it? I don't think so when you factor in the minor skill you get from this line called Illusionist's Celerity. That skill reduces illusion-summoning skills by 20%. Further, the more important reason why is because the most viable Shatter Builds use either a Staff or Sword/Torch. If you're using a Staff, Compounding Power is the obvious choice. Staff inflicts conditions on auto-attack and has good clone production. If you're using a Torch, then the big question is what kind of team you're going against. Feel the need for more offense? Compounding Power. The need for more defense against condis? The Pledge. The 50 condition damage per illusion boost from Compounding Power though plays very well with other traits. I'd personally use Compounding Power, but The Pledge is very viable as well for Torch users. **Illusions - Master** IV - Shattered Strength - Gain 1 stack of might for 10 seconds per illusion when you use a shatter skill. VI - Maim the Disillusioned - Shatter skills inflict 2 stacks of torment for 6 seconds on foes they hit. *Thoughts:* Condi vs Might is the crux here. That said, I don't think 3 stacks of might does all that much. Further, even for power shatter, I think the minor traits Mesmers are given should be exploited for gain. If you took Compounding Power as your Adept trait here, then Maim of the Disillusioned seems like the right choice. I would personally rely on my team to help stack might on me in team fights. To this point, we're able to deal vulnerability, bleeding, confusion, and blindness. I'm not completely sure the order that condis get removed with condi clears, but by using Maim the Disillusioned, we get an extra condi to protect the others from being lost by a condi clear. Further, condi pressure will help frustrate and give a source of damage when preparing another round of shatters. While I do think Shattered Strength is useful, I don't think it is as valuable as Maim the Disillusioned. The more your opponent is focusing on the condis they have on them, the less they're focusing on you. **Illusions - Grandmaster** VII - Ineptitude - Inflict 1 stack of confusion for 4 seconds whenever you blind a foe. Whenever you successfully block or evade an attack your foe is blinded for 3 seconds (10s ICD per foe). VIII - Master of Fragmentation - Enhances the effect of shatter skills. Mind Wrack has a 10% increased critical hit chance. Cry of Frustration inflicts cripple for 3 seconds on struck foes. Diversion hits up to 5 targets. Distortion reflects projectiles. IX - Malicious Sorcery - Reduces recharge of scepter skills by 20%. Increases attack speed by 15% while wielding a scepter. *Thoughts:* I think Malicious Sorcery is interesting, but of course, only if one is using a scepter. I don't think scepter is all that viable still. If you were to pair Ineptitude together with Malicious Sorcery while one has a scepter, that'd make great use of the block, but since they're both Grandmasters, that is impossible. For a shatter build, I don't think Malicious Sorcery is viable, and while Ineptitude is interesting, the Mesmer already causes blindness during Shatters from Blinding Dissipation in the Dueling line and gets confusion from minor traits. Further, the 10s ICD doesn't help. What we do have though is a trait tailor-made for a shatter build: Master of Fragmentation. It gives us a shatter-esque way of inducing cripple and we can stack invulnerability on an entire party now. Further, distortion reflecting projectiles turns it into an offensive shatter for certain use cases. **Illusions: I - VI - VIII** ---- **General Thoughts** From the above, especially for PvP, I think the most viable Shatter Mesmer build will be: Specialization | Adept | Master | Grandmaster ---|---|----|---- Domination | II | IV | VIII Dueling | I | IV | IX Illusions | I | VI | VIII Now, come the release of Chronomancers, we'll see a much more support-oriented Mesmer. While, it'll be a lot of fun in PvP, I think it'll find a true home in WvW. Taking the Chronomancer specialization requires the sacrifice of one of these 3 specializations. I also foresee people playing around with the Chaos specialization. For one, an Adept trait called Master of Manipulation reduces recharge on manipulations by 20% and also gives Mirror when you use a manipulation skill. So, if you want to reflect projectiles, you can use blink. This is also very useful when running away to safety. You'll also gain regeneration, protection, and increased condi/boon duration from the minor traits. Chaotic Dampening will also be fun with staffs because you gain protection from Chaos Armor. For Grandmaster traits, the Prismatic Understanding trait and Bountiful Disillusionment can prove fun, but I'm not sure how viable they'll be for shatter mesmers. Prismatic Understanding will let you stealth for twice as long, but you'd probably want to bring a torch along for it. This means you either sacrifice the staff or the greatsword. Sacrificing the staff makes Chaotic Dampening useless, and neither of the other Master traits seem exciting enough. Bountiful Disillusionment grants stability, but I don't think it is worth much in PvP. In WvW, especially when commanding, you'd probably run it. So, I foresee a lot of different mesmer builds running around in WvW. One of the more popular ones might substitute the Illusions specialization for Chaos. In fact, I can see a lot of Mesmers running with Dom/Duel/Chaos and Staff &amp; Scepter/Torch. In PvP, I don't think Chaos is worth that much thought unless you don't plan to run a shatter build. What Shatter Mesmer builds do you see being most viable? Do you see any other variation that might take off? I can see lockdown mesmers becoming much more prominent. In PvP, I think a thief is more useful though. "
381,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"GW2Power.com: Calculate, compare and share your build's damage - Update 1",45,3aecsr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3aecsr/gw2powercom_calculate_compare_and_share_your/,2015-06-19 23:00:27,"**Hi, Impie here again!** After a month of testing and feedback, I have updated [GW2Power.com](URL with some quality of life additions. The hyperlinks made before were often too long to share properly. Besides, the special characters in it (like '|') were sometimes changed/removed causing the link to break (thus not loading the build properly). That has now been resolved through an automatic link-shortener, which can be used by pressing the corresponding button underneath the link box. In addition to this, the overall performance of the website has been slightly improved and the input boxes have gotten more error-forgiving. **The changelog in short:** * Added automatic link-shortener * Improved performance **Plans for the future:** * Removal of Guard Stacks for HoT * Update of Ascended/Exotic differences for HoT * Longer caching of pages for faster loading (when I don't change the site as often anymore) * Enabling Gzip compression (up to 90% smaller files for faster download/loading - my webhost will enable this later this year) -------------- [Original Release Thread - 2015-05-27](URL -------------- **TL;DR** Go to [GW2Power.com](URL to calculate and compare damage between different builds. **Introduction** Hello! I am impie and I have been part of Team Aggression [TA] for over two years, a hardcore World vs. World guild that many of you will know. As many of you know, there is a lot of theorycrafting involved in making the perfect build, be it for PvE, PvP or WvW. Most highly competitive player and guilds already had mathematical models for this purpose, although those were less intricate, harder to use and generally a lot less automated than GW2Power.com. With this website I hope to bring up the overall level of Guild Wars 2 builds, especially those of the less experienced players. The formulas and layouts used on GW2Power.com were originally compiled by me for use in Team Aggression, though they make up only a small part of the theorycrafting tools made available to that guild. **What does GW2 Power do?** It calculates your so-called 'Effective Power', which combines all the boons and stats into one number. This amount of Effective Power is essentially an equivalent of the raw damage you can put out, though conditions are not included. As I said, buffs (like might and fury) and vulnerability are all taken into account and can be switched to a desired amount as you please. **Core Features:** * Calculate damage (Effective Power) * Calculate tankiness (Effective Health) * Calculate condition duration * Compare up to 5 builds per profession at a time (and switch between professions seamlessly) * Save and Load builds locally * Link (multiple) builds to your friends at once **Converting Effective Power into actual damage** This conversion is rather straight forward and should only take a couple of seconds, if you choose to do it at all. Effective Power does not necessarily need to be converted, as everything else in the calculation is a simple constant. The formula for conversion can be found below, while the skill coefficients should be on the Guild Wars 2 Wiki. Keep in mind that utilities dont use weapon strength: each one has their own number. However, utilities do still scale with Effective Power. &gt; Damage = Effective Power * skill coefficient (wiki) * weapon strength / target armor **Feedback** I have been working on this project devotedly over the past couple of weeks and would appreciate your feedback on anything related to this website. Did you find a bug, does something about the layout or interface bother you or have you managed to break something? Let me know! You can contact me in-game through my character name Impie Yay or use my account name instead: Luijtjuh.5964. Alternatively, you can just respond to this thread or pass an E-mail to luijtjuh[at]gmail.com, although it might take a while for me to respond."
382,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Necromancer Build Speculation,19,3aii7p,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3aii7p/necromancer_build_speculation/,2015-06-21 00:47:15,"So I cobbled together three pve builds which might be played after the traitchanges hit on tuesday but I am not quite sure which is the stronger one. **======================================================================** * [Spite/Curses/Blood Magic](URL This build is a dagger/x build which is used like the current one with additional party support. That would be party wide life draining, aoe weakness, protection through wells and chill+vulnerability from the well of darkness. * [Spite/Curses/Soul Reaping](URL This build is like the current death shroud build only with aoe weakness and chill+vulnerability from the well of darkness. * [Spite/Blood Magic/Soul Reaping](URL This build combines the current death shroud build with the new blood magic line. Here we swap the curses with blood magic which means that we get party wide life drain, protection through wells, focus recast and a 5% dmg modifier but loose the benefits of the second build. **======================================================================** Right now I favor the first build since the dagger build was even before the changes the one with the higher dps and this could still be the case since the traits haven't changed that much. I also like the high amount of additional party support this gets. I don't really like the second build because I think that blood magic might be too strong to skip. But I could also imagine that the third build might be used now that we get a higher lifeforce pool and heal with life transfer while being in the shroud. But what do you think? Which one might be the upcoming necromancer build? **======================================================================** Note: * In curses I have always taken path of corruption over master of corruption since I am not a fan of the changes to consume conditions If you have no problem with that then you should swap these two traits. But only if the well of blood isn't the superior healing skill with the addition of vampirics rituals. * I also traited vampiric presence instead of banshee's wail since I believe that the life drain aura might be the superior trait. But we'll have to see. * Edit: Unholy fervor should be taken over chill of death if the 10% modifier works with skills other than the axe. "

This is a huge adjustment! Engineer already has an enormous learning curve and takes a big investment to Do Right and this feels like I'm going to have to re-learn the entire class. In open world PvE I usually run a Flamethrower / HGH / Juggernaut build focused on might stacking; in Dungeons it was vulnerability from Grenades and Bombs; in PvP I was a Turret engineer with Fortified and Experimental Turrets using Pistol/Shield using Cleric gear focused purely on survivability (yes, I'm That Guy) And now I'm like What do What even is useful anymore Is there anything remotely resembling these builds anymore or will I have to come up with like an entirely new build TL;DR this patch is scary, change is scary! what do"
384,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Condition Balance Post-Patch,6,3as6hl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3as6hl/condition_balance_postpatch/,2015-06-23 12:08:22,"The patch itself isn't actually out yet, but there are those who've played with the balance of it in various livestreams, and we know what changes are coming. So with that in mind, is there any reasonable discussion that can be had about how conditions are going to look post-patch, specifically in regard to WvW/PvP, and specifically in comparison to raw damage builds? What mainly has me concerned is this: * After around 700~ condition damage, conditions will be scaling better with condition damage than they did prior to the patch. * Vulnerability now increases the damage of condition. I trust that Anet has done some balancing, but there are a few issues I see here. First is that not only is this a buff to condition builds, it's a nerf to raw damage builds who no longer get as much of an impact from their conditions due to scaling changes. More importantly, conditions still only need one stat to scale: **condition damage**. If you want to run a dedicated, raw damage build you need to run some combination of **power, precision, and ferocity** and that's all three of your stats. Condition users, meanwhile, only have to take condition damage and are then free to take any two stat specs they'd like; precision, vitality, toughness, etc. So conditions, which are already in a strong place, are becoming even stronger on builds that also encourage you to take passive tanky stats which are effective both against other condition users, and against raw damage builds who can't take tanky stats without losing a huge portion of their damage. I'm worried that the nature of this stat allocation is going to give us the often-decried 'tanky DPS' meta where everyone just pads defensive stats since they only rely on one offensive stat, pushing out builds which can't afford to take defensive stats. Have any of the livestreams shed any light on this, or at this point is a matter of waiting to see how the patch plays out? "
385,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[ENGI BUILD] HGH is back and better than ever!,6,3avyq8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3avyq8/engi_build_hgh_is_back_and_better_than_ever/,2015-06-24 09:02:11,"Hi guys! I am so excited to begin discussing HGH with you guys now that a lot of QoL has been added to this build even though some elixir stuff has been taken away. After over 30 games with this build and variants I can finally come and chat! For the people that don't like walls, here is the build using my personal preferences : [BUILD](URL Let me begin by noting changes that will directly impact the HGH builds in general for the good! Elixir gun has some skills that now are affected by elixir traiting! These are : **Healing mist**, breakstun now gives you might and is on a decent cooldown, YES PLEASE! **Elixir F**, pointless for self and impossible to land on others but I thought i would add it. **Acid bomb**, lovely bit of damage, kiting potential and have some might while you are at it! **Super elixir**, really strong heal, especially when running cele. **Elixir X** and **Throw elixir X** both grant might, as far as I can tell you need to be IN the area you cast it on to benefit as with any other elixir. Extra notes : All other elixir traits DO WORK with HGH and Alchemical Tinctures, Elixir S and Elixir B at their respective cooldowns. Now lets get into the build! I will be starting of with the likely to be meta variant which is a mix of damage and team support that would make a good solo or small party roamer and will also be making a more support orientated variant in a separate thread(unless you prefer it here in which case I will add it later). **Traits!** *Alchemy* : **Minor 1, Hidden flask**, drink an Elixir B when struck below health threshold granting you a bunch of boons and might. **Adept**, here there is a bit of preference involved, however the stronger definitely is **Invigorating speed**. Gain 6secs of vigor when you gain(refresh) swiftness on a 5 sec ICD. Even after the vigor nerfs this is still a good source of damage mitigation, your elixir will be granting you quite a bit of swiftness so you definitely can make use of this. **Minor 2, Transmute**, 100% chance to convert incoming condition into a boon every 15secs. Self explanatory and synergizes well with the last alchemy minor. **Master**, any of these will serve you well but I prefer control over random procs, so I chose **Inversion Enzyme**, when you use a gun skill that would have removed a condi, it is converted to a boon instead. I chose this because its clear that condis are very strong post patch. Alternative 1, Elixir S on 25% HP which again works with all elixir traits, if you are struggling to deal with power burst classes, this should be your choice. Alternative 2, Backpack regenerator, this is good vs lockup classes more than the above, even disabled you will continue to regen whenever you are in a kit, which you can swap to while stunned. **Minor 3, Alchemical Tinctures**, Elixirs remove a condition, increased boon duration by 20%, this synergizes super well with the boon build. Finally **Grandmaster and the defining trait of this build, HGH**, gain 2 stack of might when you use an elixir, reduces cooldown by 20% on elixirs and increases all effects from elixirs by 20%. This trait will provide you and your party(if in cast AoE) with insane amounts of might for extended periods which increases your condition dmg and power by a decent amount per stack. *Explosives* : This trait line will be your main source of power with a bit of condi and control damage beyond rifle. **Minor 1, Evasive powder keg**, set a timed charge when you dodge, 10sec ICD. This deals a decent amount of damage. **Adept, Grenadier**, increases the velocity(travel time) of your grenades by 100% and increases the radius by 60. This is helpful to land your grenades on single targets and even more on multiple targets. **Minor 2, Steel packed powder**, explosions cause vulnerability. Now that vulnerability improves condition damage and power damage it really is quite strong for a minor. **Master, Aim assisted rocket**, fires a seeking rocket on striking an enemy, 33% chance. I chose this for the extra procs on all explosion traits. **Minor 3, Accelerated packed turrets**, improved damage from explosives and exploding turrets knockback foes. **Grandmaster, Shrapnel**, explosions(all of them!) have a chance to cripple and bleed foes, 15% chance, this is super strong on any build running explosives, which we have TONS of. *Firearms* : This line provides condis and improved crit chance. **Minor 1, Sharpshooter**, crits have a chance to cause bleeding, 33%. Just some bonus condis that you can make good use of. **Adept**, here is another choice that you have, I chose **High caliber** for the 10% increased chance to crit if within 240 range of your opponent, due to the nature of conquest you are often in close range with your enemy and engi really excels at close to medium range for mahy reasons. Alternative is Heavy armor exploit, crits have a 50% chance to give you swiftness and appply vulnerability to your target. The vuln won't do much for your dmg in comparison to high calibers extra crit chance, however the extra swiftness application will give you near permanent vigor which can be useful. I did not choose this one as I found that i have enough swfitness and vigor via other means. **Minor 2, Hematic Focus**, Crit chance is increased by a further 10% on bleeding foes.You apply bleeding constantly, so you will near always have this active. **Master**, another choice. I chose **skilled marksmen** for the increased attack speed and reduced CD on rifle skills. The CD reduction is really strong mainly for Rifle 5 high damage and Rifle 4 instant knockback. Alternative 1, Pinpoint distribution, you gain condition damage based on your precision. This will give you 156 extra condition damage(using celestial amulet as this build does) for a bit more condition pressure, its quite impactful and also a very good option. Alternative 2, no scope. 100% chance to gain fury for 4secs on crits on targets inside 240range(10sec ICD). This synergizes well with the adept trait I chose and will increase your power based damage quite bit at the cost of utility. I did not choose this trait as the build already has decent fury uptime. **Minor 3, Serated steel**, bleeding you apply lasts longer, honestly not great but hey, its free right? :) **Grandmaster, Incendiary powder, there is no replaces this REALLY REALLY strong trait, crits inflict 2 burning on a short 10sec CD. Increases burning duration by 33%. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Right now that we have one wall over with, next one! Sorry about that! :D *Weapon, runes, sigils and utlities.* **Rifle** There is no better choice here than rifle with its really strong power damage, bit of bleeding and crazy hard and soft CC. *Sigils, why and when and how* : **Sigil of Intellegence**, for that extra burst with 100% crit chance on 3 attacks on high value skills like Jump Shot. **Sigil of Leeching**, for a bit more passive heals as you swap skills, not to great to be honest. **Sigil of Generosity**, this was my preference, when playing PvP the condis were terribly overwhelming, this adds some nice condi clear and counter condi pressure every 9 seconds. **Sigil of Energy**, if you feel you need more dodges and not wanting to use Heavy Exploit armor and invigorating speed. **Sigil of Battle**, definitely suboptimal after the nerfs, but for a bit more might, you can try this, would not suggest it though. *Runes* : **Runes of Hoelbrak**, best option here for more condition protection. And the might duration is part of the core build. **Runes of Strength**, for more offensive setup if you feel you have enough condi clear or up against power heavy comps. **Runes of the Traveler**, I would say only use this if you are roaming, not PvP, it gives you a bit more out of combat movement speed. You will have more boon duration but quite a bit less uptime on might, which is really not that bad, even 10 stacks of might is really powerful if you can keep it up. *Utilities* : There are quite a few options you can go for here, so bare with me while I detail the benefits and traidoffs of each. *Heals* : **Elixir H**, more might/boons, 2 stacks for each of the casts as well as 1 condi removed per cast, heal and toolbelt. You also have a chance to gain vigor, protection or regen on toolbelt cast and swiftness, regen or protection on standard heal. You want protection or vigor/swiftness but the RNG could screw you and give you regen. **Healing turret**, more burst heal/condi clear because of blast or shorter CD when you pickup the turret. It also gives you a very useful on demand knockback/interrupt thanks to Accelerated packed turrets minor trait. *Slots 7 through 9* : **Elixir gun**, with the changes that allow you to benefit from elixir traits on skill 4, 5 and toolbelt this kit is a must have for any HGH build. The kiting potential, damage, on demand poison, heal and weakness/bleeding on auto is just amazing as well and has made it my favourate kit for the longest time. **Grenade kit**, obvious choice being a great hybrid damage kit mixed with some utility. Last slot is optional and quite versatile. **Elixir S**, a really useful invuln for safe stomping and a useful invis. Does benefit from elixir traits. **Elixir B**, one of the few sources of stablity an engi has via the toolbelt, so thats quite nice. Obviously grants might and a bunch of other boons on use. Benefits from elixir traits too. **Toolkit**, really strong kit that brings damage, conditions, defenses and disables to the table. Using it will cost you in mights, but there is not doubting its power. You have quite a bit of might from many sources, so don't hesitate to try this kit instead of an elixir. I will not go into any other options like slick shows, rocket boots or even other elixirs as I found them very lackluster in comparison to the above. *Elite* : Another difficult choice here. **Elixir X**, the new Toss Elixir X is really strong in teamfights, 3.5sec AoE moa, WOW, however I found that the cooldown and non-toolbet does not suit me, feel free to try it, it definitely is quite strong just based on the toolbet skill and it of course benefits from elixir traits! **Supply crate**, still a strong choice with the Med pack drop (f5) on a 60 sec CD as well as the supply drops turret knockbacks and stuns. This still is my preference so far. **Mortar kit**, by Balthazar this thing is lovely from just a utility perspective why its great. 4 fields, poison, ice, light and water. Half second auto is a 100% projectile. So far the thing I have most used it for is mainly for the AOE heals and condi clear via water and light fields while on cap. The autoattack does good damage and WORKS WITH ALL explosion traits! EDIT : This seems to be buggy at the moment however. For now I am not using it much as its quite hard to juggle 3-4 kits when you are not familiar with the build and kit itself but I will likely be switching to it soon! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- EDIT : Just like to add that you really should try to keep at least 1 elixir on your heal or utility besides Elixir X and elixir gun, giving up too many negatively impacts your damage quite a bit. EDIT 2 : **Effective stats** assuming perfect conditions and 12 might and fury, which is a safe and easy to reach number. Power : 2095. Crit Chance : 70%. Range under 240 + bleed on target + Fury. SUPER good! Ferocity : 560. Condition damage : 920. Health : 21522. Toughness : 1560. Boon duration : +20%. Healing power : 560. **Right guys! Thanks for reading that if you got that far and feel free to discuss and recommend improvements.** "
386,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"After spending a whole bunch of time playing the new necromancer, here's my conclusion",14,3b07qx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3b07qx/after_spending_a_whole_bunch_of_time_playing_the/,2015-06-25 08:36:07,"Okay so I've been working on a build that to me kinda fits the necromancers role and properly plays with a corruption/transfer conditions build. There's a few other builds similar going around, that trait more into a supporty playstyle, However this build made the most sense to me. URL * Rabid Gear * Runes of the Undead * Sigil of Geomancy (Rune of Cleansing looks pretty decent here too), Earth, Corruption and Generosity. *Generosity is REALLY expensive right now, so i've been using sigil of torment* * The build set me at around 2000 condition damage, 2000 toughness (no food, exotic gear only), and after food and the 25 stacks of might/corrupters ferver that the build makes it super easy to achieve you're at around 2500 condition damage, 2300 toughness and around 1500 power (just as a backup) The Idea behind this build is to stack as much condition damage as possible, while also stacking toughness along with corrupters ferver to be able to tank the condition damage you take. It worked out quite well, I ran dungeons for hours last night with a few friends, and honestly I feel like every single party now should run Guardian and Necromancer. It makes it so nobody else in your party aside from the Guardian and Necro should ever take damage. For utilities I took: * Consume Conditions * Plague Signet * Blood is power * Epidemic / Corrupt boon (depending on the number of enemies I'm dealing with) * Plague Form The way the build was working, was that any condition that came to one of my allies, came straight to me, I then had Spiteful Renewal, Plague Sending, Shrouded Removal, Staff 4 skill, Dagger 4 Skill, Plague Signet and Sigil of Generosity and Consume conditions to be able to deal with all the conditions coming to me. It worked great, My team reported having pretty much no conditions on them the entire dungeon, and as a necro, I didn't even feel like I had conditions on me, they just went directly to the enemy effortlessly. If you use your transfers only when you have to transfer conditions and not spam shit on cooldown like most people do, it becomes a very effective build that creates a psuedo support necro with ridiculous amounts of condition damage, and tankiness. **HOWEVER** There are a few problems that go with the class and not the build that just made micromanaging my skills way too difficult and high risk, low reward. * Consume Conditions - made me feel like I never really wanted to heal, but I couldn't switch out heal skills because I lose the ability to consume some rogue conditions I don't feel like sending (For example some 1 or 2 second conditions that I used to just consume for a larger heal). It started to feel like I just never wanted to use this ability, and when I did I'd get some health back but just drop straight back down to the health I was at. The vulnerability and blind is just too much. If this skill simply removed conditions and healed, it would give me a very reliable build that allowed me to deal with any condition that came to me at any time. Considering that the cast time is so long and so obvious and can be interrupted so easily, it makes no sense for it to damage you when you use it. Just because it's a corruption skill doesn't mean it needs to corrupt, it makes no sense. If this skill was the same as it was, it would be a very reliable skill that would get you out of situations where you have no way to transfer conditions. * Plague form - The skill itself is great, I feel like I see why they nerfed it, before it was that skill you popped for stability and then just sat in the middle of the enemies and spammed your skills. Now you deal with about 3 stacks of self inflicted bleed and poison, and at 2400 condition damage, this fucking hurts. It became that I would use it for around 10 seconds, and drop from full health to around a quarter, and I have to exit the skill or else I'd just die. Yet there are no better alternatives, since lich form is garbage and flesh golem makes no sense in this build whatsoever. **TL;DR:** This build is really fun to use, and it feels like I actually matter in dungeons, however consume conditions and plague form are just too high risk low reward to ever want to use. If these two skills were restored back to the way they were, say hello to one of the most important PvE classes! I just wish I didn't kill myself before the enemy killed me. EDIT: Spelling and added a few more sigil options EDIT: Update on stats. With 25 Might, 25 Corruption stacks, Rare Veggie Pizza and Tuning Crystal I have 3,000 Condition damage, 2,200 toughness and 1,700 power (just something extra for skill 1 in deathshroud while you're stacking might - comes from the trait deadly strength)"
387,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Build: Opening Strike Ranger,6,3b1fxr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3b1fxr/build_opening_strike_ranger/,2015-06-25 14:58:16,"The new specialization system introduces some powerful buffs to the Ranger's Opening Strike mechanic. This build takes advantage of these and with a variety of synergies. I have been working on this late, so I if I have made any mathematical or other errors I apologize! **First, here is the build:** URL * Use Berzerker Stats * Superior Runes of Rage * Sigils are up to you, but the standard Fire/Air combo would seem to be best * ""Strength of the Pack"" as Elite. The other utility skills are optional and can be taken as needed for the situation or your preference. * Pets are also optional, although a Red Moa synergizes very well with the build **The build provides:** * 100% uptime of a MINIMUM 13.8% boost. Can be a much larger boost in groups. * Similar damage boost to autocritting attacks for your pet. Can be a much larger boost in groups. * 100% Fury uptime * Spotter for group support * 25 stacks of vulnerability nearly 100% uptime * Easy might stacking for your pet * High Swiftness uptime; swiftness ""on command"" **How does the build work?** A Ranger's first hit on a foe is classified as an opening strike. The Marksmanship specialization gives opening strikes to pets and causes opening strikes to do two things: 1) Apply 5 stacks of vulnerability 2) automatically critically hit The Grandmaster trait Remorseless adds two additional bonuses: 1) Opening strikes deal 25% bonus damage 2) Anytime you gain fury, the next attack will also be classified as an opening strike It is important to note that #2 applies anytime you gain fury, *even if you already have fury*. The build includes other traits synergize with this to keep renewing opening strike: 1) Marksman 's Adept ""Clarion Call,"" which grants fury - and therefore opening strike - on pet swap 2) Beastmastery's minor trait ""Loud Whistle,"" which lowers the cooldown on pet swap and therefore grants more opening strikes 3) Skirmishing's Master trait ""Furious Grip,"" which grants fury/opening strike on weapon swap 4) Beastmastery's Master trait ""Two-Handed Training,"" which causes Greatsword attacks to grant Fury about once every 10 seconds The Runes of Rage also grant fury when struck. All of this adds up to a Ranger who on his/her own can provide one opening strike approximately every 5 seconds by swapping pets, weapons, and getting Greatsword procs. This means once every 5 seconds the Ranger autocrits an attack for 25% bonus damage. When you factor in the autocritting, the 25% damage bonus, and the 5% damage bonus from the Runes of Rage, it should work out to a 13.8% damage boost overall. (In other words, you should be hitting opening strikes 16% of the time, so 16% of the time you are hitting for an overall damage multiplier of 290.) **Stronger in Groups** The real power of this build should be in groups, where the Ranger can gain fury much more frequently than once every 5 seconds. Every time an ele blasts a fire field, another ranger uses Call of the Wild, a Warrior uses ""For Great Justice,"" or any of player grants fury in any other way, the Ranger gets another 125% autocritting attack - and his pet does as well. **Alternatives** It is tempting to go into the Wilderness Survival specialization for ""Wilderness Knowledge,"" which would cause survival skills to grant Fury and this may be a viable option if you want to opt for a tankier build, but for pure damage the fury on hit trait and 5% damage boost for greatsword in Beastmastery are superior. Beastmastery also grants pets might on your critical hits - which you will be doing a lot of in this build, reduced cooldown on pet swaps, and a very hearty 300 ferocity boost for pets - which will be critting a lot in this build as well. It is also tempting to consider Runes of Evasion as an alternative to Rage runes, but the 5% flat damage bonus that the Rage runes provide vastly outpaces and benefit of the one additional opening strike every 10 seconds that the Evasion Runes provide.

388,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Necromancer feedback: what are your thoughts?,14,3b217b,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3b217b/necromancer_feedback_what_are_your_thoughts/,2015-06-25 19:39:27,"by now we have tested everything, it would be nice to know what the necro community think of the changes now. My opinion is below and by all means im not the 1% of pve, WvW and spvp. Id like to know others opinions on necro, in hope ANet will read this or other posts and act Blood magic is amazing and works well with everything, our support capability is great now. Condition overall is weak. Plague deals lots of damage but drains 70% of your health in the process, consume conditions is no good (thanks recharge nerf), and the corruptions are still not strong enough to justify their use (epidemic and, most importantly, poison cloud). Flesh golem or lich are better than plague on condi build. Signets are great, however the res-signet-that-nobody-uses is still a pile of crap. Either remove it or rework it completely. Our concept of manipulatin conditions by pulling from allies, cleansing and sending them to enemies has been improved dramatically (from non-existant to an OK state). However this is damaged by the consume conditions nerf, especially when we are self-inflicting vulnerability/blindness and chill (chill upon blindness trait) upon HEALING. Not to mention that we are inflicted with so many conditions (master of corruptions trait) that our manipulation becomes innefective, since they last very shortly and are applied too fast. Minion master is better but the AI still suck. Is it that hard to give Pet's AI to minions?"
389,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Condition changes bleeding 29% more damage,28,3b25c6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3b25c6/condition_changes_bleeding_29_more_damage/,2015-06-25 20:38:56,"edit: I think i didnt check for stat changes on gear. Might get more condition damage now and can't check the values since i am not at home atm. result would be a bigger difference then ""just"" 29% for bleeding ---------- I allways liked to play conditions, and i thought i'd so some very simple math to see how much they changed. Now that condition damage is more important if you want to deal damage with conditions, i was wondering, how much condition damage you'd need to get the same damage as before. Since vulnerability does work for conditions, i'll also look at how much that helps. Condition | Break-Even-Point (condi dmg) :--|:-- Bleeding | 2050 Bleeding + 25 vuln | 600 Torment | 2130 Torment +25 vuln | 640 Now with ascended celestial gear and condi runes you get 676 condition damage. So you will deal about the same bleeding and torment damage with celestial gear as before **as long as the enemy has 25 stacks vulnerability** Now with full Ascended Dire gear + unded runes, condi infusions, sigils, buff food, 25 might (no traits or skills) we get 2594 Condition Damage. That's enough to deal more damage then before the patch even without 25 vuln. But lets see how much more damage we deal. **2594 Condition Damage** Condition | Pre patch | Post patch | Dmg increase :--|:--|:--|:-- Bleeding | 172 | 177 | +3% Bleeding + 25 vuln | 172 | 222 | +29% Torment | 129 | 132 | +2% Torment +25 vuln | 129 | 165 |+27% Now for Burning and Poison the total damage got reduced. To make up for it, the intensity stacking prevents the ""qeued"" damage that is in a 1 minute burn to get completely negated. This is harder to compare but results in better burst damage for condition builds to be more viable against builds with alot of condition remove."
390,vulnerability,Guildwars2,"""New condition damage evens out at 700 base stat"" - Let's find out!",126,3b2n3z,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3b2n3z/new_condition_damage_evens_out_at_700_base_stat/,2015-06-25 23:54:44,"Hello, you probably heard it, it was said that the new conditions would be less effective under 700 condition damage stat and more effective above, to push players to actively build for condition damage if they want to do damage with conditions. Let's see if it's true, or (spoilers) if it actually makes sense to say that. We'll use level 80 for base damage. CD = Condition Damage (stat) *** ##Poison .|Old|New|% of old damage :--|--:|--:|--: Formula|84 + 0.1 x CD|33.5 + 0.06 x CD| 0 CD|84|33.5|39.9% 700 CD|154|75.5|49% 850 CD|169|84.5|50% 2000 CD|284|153.5|54% Basically for one stack, it doesn't even out within the reach of obtainable stats. Is it a nerf? Not at all, as now Poison can stack. If your build can add up 2 stacks of poison, the damage output evens out at 850 Condition Damage. At 3 stacks and above, you don't even need Condition Damage, you already deal more damage. *** ##Burning .|Old|New|% of old damage :--|--:|--:|--: Formula|328 + 0.25 x CD|131.5 + 0.155 x CD| 0 CD|328|131.5|40% 700 CD|503|240|47.7% 1083 CD|598.75|299.365|50% 2000 CD|828|441.5|53.32% Same as Poison, it doesn't even out within the reach of obtainable stats. Is it a nerf? Not at all, Burning can now stack too. The damage output evens out at 1083 Condition Damage for 2 stacks. At 3 stacks and above, you don't need Condition Damage to have your damage output boosted. *** ##Bleeding .|Old|New|% of old damage :--|--:|--:|--: Formula|42.5 + 0.05 x CD|22 + 0.06 x CD| 0 CD|42.5|22|51.76% 700 CD|77.5|64|82.58% 2050 CD|145|145|100% The new Bleeding damage evens out with the old one at 2050 Condition Damage. I don't know if you can reach it with the new stat repartition on equipment, I'll let you search for that. Is it a nerf? It depends on the situation : - 1v1, PvP or PvE : Very few build are able to go above the previous limit of 25 stacks. If you are under 2050 Condition Damage and can't go above 25 stacks, it's a nerf. 49% less damage if you don't have CD, 17.5% less damage at the famous 700 mark. It's a solid nerf if you don't build specifically for Condition Damage. - group vs 1 : It's a lot easier to go above the previous limit of 25 stacks. 2 players generating 13 stacks, 3 players generating 9 stacks... if you have a small group that's dedicated to conditions, you will enjoy a boost of the damage output. Even more with big groups like on World Bosses where even with 0 CD it will wreck the boss. - **(edit)** Vulnerability stacks : with the change of Vulnerability, the point it evens out is lower. With 25 stacks (you probably need a group to get them in addition to your conditions), Bleeding evens out at 600 Condition Damage. *** ##Torment .|Old|New|% of old damage :--|--:|--:|--: Formula|32 + 0.0375 x CD|15.9 + 0.045 x CD| 0 CD|32|15.9|49.7% 700 CD|58.25|47.4|81.4% 2146 CD|112.475|112.47|100% The new Torment damage evens out with the old one at 2146 Condition Damage. I don't think it's obtainable. Is it a nerf? Yes, because there is no build that can go above the previous limit of 25 stacks alone, and even in a group it's incredibly difficult. Building your group on the purpose of reaching more than 25 Torment stacks could be funny, but not efficient. On World Bosses in the previous meta, people wouldn't try to use Torment so it wouldn't reach 25 stacks. Now that people try out condi builds, it will go above and there'll be a boost of damage in this precise situation. **(edit)** You can note that with Vulnerability stacks, it's a lot better. However sources of Torment and Vulnerability aren't together, and you will certainly need a group. There you can make up for the nerf. *** ##Confusion This one is harder to compare, as it doesn't do exactly the same thing. But as I know some people will still look for comparisons, I'm gonna try one. The only parameter for old Confusion was the number of time the enemy uses a skill. With the new Confusion, a duration has also been added. So I'll give several examples for 1s of duration (1 tick). At 0 skill use, the new Confusion obviously deals more damage, so let's skip this one. #1 Skill use every second .|Old PvE|Old PvP|New|% of old PvE|% of old PvP :--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--: 0 CD|130|65|59.55|45.8%|91.6% 243 CD|178|83.225|83.24|46.6%|100% 700 CD|270|117.5|127.8|47.3%|108.8% 2000 CD|530|215|254.6|48%|118.4% #2 Skill uses every second (SirSpamAlot) .|Old PvE|Old PvP|New|% of old PvE|% of old PvP :--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--: 0 CD|260|130|109.1|42%|83.9% 700 CD|540|235|221.1|41%|94.1% 2090 CD|1096|443.5|443|40.5%|100% #1 Skill use every 2 seconds .|Old PvE|Old PvP|New|% of old PvE|% of old PvP :--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--: 0 CD|65|32.5|34.78|53.5%|107% 700 CD|135|58.75|81.15|60.1%|138.1% 2000 CD|265|107.5|167.275|63.1%|155.6% #1 Skill use every 5 seconds (note that some confusion applications only last 3s) .|Old PvE|Old PvP|New|% of old PvE|% of old PvP :--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--: 0 CD|26|13|19.91|76.6%|153.2% 700 CD|54|23.5|53.16|98.4%|226.2% 812 CD|58.48|25.18|58.48|100%|232.3% 2000 CD|106|43|114.91|108.4%|267.2% As you can see, it's a general boost in PvP, even if the difference is less important if the enemy mashes his keyboard. In PvE where the enemies are neurasthenic, you don't need a lot of Condition Damage to break even. However don't fool yourself, with the new Confusion in PvE you'll still do more damage if the enemy spams skills than if he doesn't. It just won't make as much damage as before, if such situation exists. *** ##Fear I haven't found a new formula for Fear damage when traited by Necromancer. As it doesn't stack, I assume it's left unchanged. *** ##Conclusion I don't know why the 700 Condition Damage mark came up, it doesn't really make sense, it's irrelevant. What's important to understand is solo Bleeding is nerfed, Poison and Burning are boosted at the 2nd stack with a condi build and at 3rd stack otherwise. As an example, a necro power mark/well can get her 3 poison stacks quite easily. Torment has been nerfed, it's not reasonable to expect doing as much damage as before. Confusion works differently, helping with a tick damage, which is nice for PvE but a bit ""dumbing down"" in PvP. **EDIT:** Added notes about Vulnerability, which can help to make up for the difference, but benefit groups more than individuals, which can be the summary of these changes.

Based on the calculation for fire damage and most attacks, I get ROUGHLY 1% more CD and 1% damage from each stack of Might on me. So about the same right? Is it fair to say that applying 1 stack of vulnerability is now about as good as a stack of might in 1v1? To me this really changes how I looked at Vulnerability traits. New Engineer skill Shaped Charge gives you 5% more damage if your foe has Vulnerability -&gt; About as much damage as 4-5 stacks of might? That's pretty good as few traits can stack that much might and its easy to keep Vulnerability on a target. If you compare Sigil of Strength (60% chance 10s might on critical) with Sigil of Vulnerability (50% chance 10s vulnerability on ALL HITS) I think the later is a clear winner now right? With a 50% chance to crit, you will land vulnerability 20% more often than might will proc? That's a really solid buff. "
392,vulnerability,Guildwars2,PvE Elementalist DPS Guide Post-Specializations,1,3b68mt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3b68mt/pve_elementalist_dps_guide_postspecializations/,2015-06-26 18:39:27,"With the Specializations patch, Elementalists received a buff to their overall DPS despite the build staying the same for the most part. The inability to take Fresh Air and Bolt to the Heart has put the Dagger/Focus build in the ground as it cannot compete with the DPS of the Staff build. The Scepter Hammer build is weaker as Warriors will be able to provide much of the might necessary through Phalanx Strength without losing DPS. Staff is the strongest build by a large margin as the DPS it outputs is unmatched. **Build:** [Here](URL is the build calculator for those who want a quick look. A written version with reasoning is below. **Gear:** - Berserker's Armor and Trinkets with Runes of the Scholar - Berserker's Staff with Force + Night/Appropriate Slaying Sigil Flame Legion Runes are a cheaper substitute for Scholar Runes. For encounters where no 10% sigil is applicable, such as those found in Fractals, an Impact Sigil is a good substitute. Despite the buff to conditions, Berserker's gear is still the best choice. The fact that Elementalists have no consistent way of applying and maintaining large stacks of conditions coupled with the amount of direct damage a staff Elementalist can deal between Meteor Shower and Ice Bow makes Berserker's the clear choice. **Traits:** * *Fire:* - Burning Precision: Higher burning uptime means higher uptime on the Grandmaster Minor trait, Burning Rage. - Pyromancer's Alacrity: A flat 10% damage modifier when you are in Fire and a 33% reduced cooldown on fire skills allowing permanent Lava Fonts with ~1 second overlap as well as more frequent Meteor Showers. - Persisting Flames: Gives the entire party fury for an extended period of time provided enough blasts are used. Allows Lava Font to tick for more damage as well. * *Air:* - Ferocious Winds: Flat boost to Ferocity, DPS boost. - Tempest Defense: 20% modifier that procs off of Ice Bow 5. Allows for heavy damage from Ice Bow 5/4 combo. - Bolt to the Heart: Standard damage modifier. * *Water:* - Piercing Shards: Extra vulnerability duration helps boost party DPS. The extra damage which in water which can make for some more attunement dancing than usual. Refer to the rotation section below for usage. - Aquamancer's Training: Another Scholar Bonus, which means staying above 90% is doubly important. Reduced cooldown on Water skills isn't really important. - Powerful Aura: Slim pickings here. Giving the party Magnetic Aura can be helpful in projectile heavy encounters like the Volcanic Fractal, but the trait doesn't have many uses in dungeons. Water may seem like an odd choice over Arcana (Bountiful Power is a nice modifier), but the extra vulnerability duration outweighs the personal DPS gain from Bountiful Power. Aquamancer's Training also helps make up for the lost modifiers. Party DPS is more important than personal DPS. **Utilities:** - Heal: *Arcane Brilliance* is the only choice here. Staff lacks blast finishers, and Arcane Brilliance fills that gap. It blasts at the location of your target, so be sure that the target is in a fire field before casting. Ether Renewal can be used in encounters with heavy condition pressure, i.e. Volcanic Fractal. - Slot 1: *Conjure Frost Bow* hits hard and brings a lot of control. The meta revolves around this skill, always bring it. - Slot 2: *Glyph of Storms* brings a lot of utility and damage. Sandstorm can be used to blind hard hitting trash mobs. Lightning Storm deals decent damage and almost instantly stacks 25 vulnerability. In Fire it deals okay damage and stacks burning which maintains Burning Rage. Cast this in Air attunement on bosses at the start of fights, Fire attunement on bosses when you are already in your Fire rotation, and in Earth when you need to fight hard hitting trash mobs. - Slot 3: *Signet of Fire* is a flat DPS increase. The new downscaling has made Critical Hit Chance abysmal in low level dungeons, making this utility much more valuable. *Lightning Hammer* should be slotted over this when fighting structures as the 4 skill on the conjure can hit quite hard on large hitboxes. Ice Bow should always be slotted, but the other two utilities can be swapped out if necessary. Arcane Shield, Arcane Wave, Mist Form, Armor of Earth and Earth Shield all have niche uses depending on the encounter. **Rotation:** There are two basic rotations, depending on the circumstances such as the fight and who/what you are partying with. - *Rotation if you provide fire field:* Eruption (Earth 2) &gt; Fire Attunement &gt; Lava Font (Fire 2) &gt; Flame Burst (Fire 3) *Optional* &gt; Conjure Frost Bow &gt; Deep Freeze (IB 5) if boss has no defiance &gt; Ice Storm (IB 4) &gt; Frost Fan (IB 3) &gt; Drop Ice Bow &gt; Lava Font (Fire 2) &gt; Meteor Shower (Fire 5) &gt; Lava Font &gt; Glyph of Storms &gt; Lava Font/Flame Burst/Meteor Shower off cooldown after this point.

395,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[Warrior] [PvP build] Clerics Shoutbunker! (not bow),3,3bbzgh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3bbzgh/warrior_pvp_build_clerics_shoutbunker_not_bow/,2015-06-28 05:41:49,"Hi guys! Just here to show you an interesting build I have had some success with. This is my second build post June23 I am sharing. To be clear this build will likely never be meta but if tanking is your thing, this build is pretty epic, even with the crazy damage output of the current state of PvP. This build is also better with a team(premade) that understands your role, hotjoin or soloQ just does not compliment the build well unless you strike it lucky or explain well to them pre-match and hope they understand. **Uses and role** : **AoE instant heals.** **Team condi cleanse.** **Decapping/bunker.** **Great mobility.** **Safestomping and rezzing.** **CC machine.** **Lacks range of any kind.** **Very defensive with near zero damage output unless you get a good lockup and understand the counter attack I will explain.** [BUILD](URL Right here we go for some more detail and reasoning behind choices. **Weapons** : **Sword/Warhorn.** Sword : Used for mobility, executes via skill 3 because of the &lt;50% damage and power scaling. Also a great immob tool. Mostly not going to use this much during fights. Warhorn : Compliments mobility. Grants more team cleanse and support. Weakness is really useful to help you bunker. **Mace/Shield**, you will mostly be using this weapon set. Mace : Has a block! Dazes and weakness application. Shield : Block and stuns. Didn't choose bow as we are not running Cele so condi damage is very limited, bow also does not provide worthwhile defense or utility. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Sigils and runes** : **Rune of the Soldiers**, really is a must for any shoutbuild nudging for some teamsupport and condi clear. Sigils are a bit optional but I went for **Sigil of Battle** in both weapons. **Sigil of Doom** in the Sword/warhorn, to help you negate heals, this helps tremendously to actually score a kill solo but some mindfulness is required to use it correctly to coincide with the enemies actual heal output or risk it being cleansed with no usefulness. **Sigil of Intelligence** for the Mace/Shield set, this helps with a bit of burst, you want to proc it on your scullcracker preferably. Another doom works here too. **Amulet** : *Clerics*, makes for AMAZING heals to make up for the lack of Vital, also has really good toughness. I didn't choose Cele as hybrid was not the goal of this build, I did however try it and found that with the changes to damage output, the meager tanky stats Cele provides is not worth it. **Utilities** : **Elite, Rampager**, this REALLY is good with very high base power damage(since we have limited crits). It insures safestomping and great control for rezzing allies after multiple knockback that is quite effective at stripping small amounts of stability. Slot 7-9 : Only 3 shouts are worth using and I will explain why. They also heal for an amazing 2200(traited), remove a condi per use thanks to runes. **Shake it Off**, one extra condi clear on top of the 1 provided by runes, breaks stun(only one we have) and has a super short 20sec CD(traited). **Fear Me!**, does everything that traited for but what makes this worth it is the decap potential as well as the time it can buy you for your heals and other CD to come back up. **For Great Justice!**, I mainly chose this one because it has a shorter CD(20secs vs 24) and is generally more useful than On My Mark, the team might and fury is quite strong. **Healing Signet**, I chose this above the new To The Limit for 3 reasons. Less vulnerability to being interrupted(damn power lock mesmers :D). You benefit from it while in Rampagers. This build has very little use for Adrenaline, in most cases you want to hold on to your adrenaline, I will get into this with traits! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Traits**. we are going into Defense, Tactics and Discipline for a near full defensive build! **Defense** : **Minor1, Thich skin.** Gain toughness above 90% HP. Meh sucks but its free. **Adept, shield master**, this trait got a major buff with 23rd patch. Reduces shield skill recharge by 20%, blocking an attack grants might, blocking reflects projectiles. Pretty self explanatory, more blocks, useful reflects and might for the counter burst that I will explain at the end. **Minor2, Adrenal Health**, heal every 3 seconds based on adrenaline level. While not very strong after the nerf over a year ago, its still useful in this build due to our great healing power. **Master**, Here you have options. I picked **Sundering mace**, for the Cooldown reduction and vuln on mace skills. The daze and block really are up quite a bit more. Alternatively Defy Pain can be nice for 4 seconds of extra invuln. Armored Attack, add 10% of your toughness to power, less tanky but still worth a try for a bit more damage. **Minor3, Spiked armor**, Gain 150 toughness when you have retaliation, crit applied to you grant retal. Useful for the build we are going. **Grandmaster, Rousing Resilience**, gain 1000 toughness when you break out of stun, nice extra power dmg mitigation, especially with Shake it Off on such a low CD. --------------------------- **Tactic** : **Minor1, Determined revival**, gain 300 toughness when reviving, helps a bit. **Adept**,another optional. I chose **Quick breathing** for reduced recharge on warhorn skill, adds some condi cleanse and better uptime on vigor on your team and weakness on enemies. Alternatively Leg specialist can help for some more soft CC, although I found this interfered with decapping when trying to fear people of cap. **Minor2, Revivers Might**, gain 3might to all allies when you rez an ally, useful for more counter damage which is the best way to deal damage in this build, I will get into this in the notes at the end. **Master, Shrug it off**, cast Shake it off when you have 1 condition on you. This trait benefits from all shout traits, so it heals for 2200, has reduced cooldown and removes an extra condition for allies. **Minor3, inspiring Presence**, might you apply grants 10 healing power per stack, this is the main reason(and obviously extra damage) we are using Battle Sigil. It just synergizes really well with the build in general. **Grandmaster, Vigorous shouts**, the defining trait of this build, this allows us to shout more because of reduces CD, it also allows shouts to heal. Also grants 5 adrenaline per shout, which is not that useful. ----------------- **Discipine** : **Minor1, Versatile Rage**, grants 5 adrenaline on weapon swap. Meh... **Adept, warriors sprint**, 25% increased movement speed when wielding a melee weapon, movement skill removes immobilize. REALLY useful when you need to get out and recover. Must have trait on this build as we have no range weapons. **Minor2, Fast hands**, one of my favourate traits, Reduces recharge on weapon swap by 5 seconds. This helps you react much faster to enemy plays, it allows us to proc sigil of doom and use skill3 on sword for a quick damage proc before swapping back to our main set. **Master, Brawler's Recovery**, Remove a condition on weapon swap, only useful trait here and its not bad, just not exceptional because we already have so much cleanse. :) **Minor3, Versatile power**, Gain 2might when you swap weapons and burst skills recharge 15% faster. The might once again is very useful to down enemies. **Grandmaster, Heightened Focus**, Striking a foe below 50% HP grants quickness for 4 seconds. This is on a really short 15 sec CD. A very helpful trait that makes stomping and finishing off enemies a lot easier. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Right! Now for some play style guidelines!** The idea is to be **heavily defensive and support** your team as much as possible. **To kill** is quite difficult and requires some timing, you rely on might and countering after the enemy has used their big skills. Without might duration you have only small windows in which to deal damage. To pull this off you stack up the might by blocking and defending cap as well as supporting your team. Once the enemy has used most of their high offensive CD, for example a ranger LB2, you have quite a bit of short duration might, that is when you need to counterattack with a FOR GREAT JUSTICE! (so appropriate), close the distance with shield bash, use a skullcracker, mace skill 3 into Sword 3 if they are below 50% HP, if this does not drop them, the Doom sigil should keep their healing in check for the swap back to mace and rotation repeat, don't worry too much about stacking adrenaline for skullcracker, the damage stays the same at all levels and the extra stun isn't helping while you are on the offensive. By the time your might and fury wears off, your defensive shields and shouts are back up and repeat the process. Choose your targets well for this burst, Celestial Eles are too tough for this for example. Rampager is a really strong skill but its important to use this at the right time. Its GODLIKE in teamfights, but burning it too soon means you lose out on rezzing teammates and secure stomping, those 2 are the main priority of Rampager in this build. **Well there we are ladies and gents! Hope you enjoy the build and let me know what you think, feel free to rip it apart, all feedback welcome!** EDIT : Some formatting and spelling."

Burns your tethered enemies every second for 10 seconds. This spear will pierce all enemies it touches and tether all of them. Other players can counter the Spear of Justice by moving past the max range. * Wings of Resolve, similar to old resolve but you can leap to an area and activate your resolve (heal allies). * Shields of Courage  create a shield in front of you that blocks attack for you and allies (sides and back are not protected). You still get Aegis when you activate it. Blocks projectiles and attacks currently but we are still working on it. **Longbow skills** * URL * Puncture Shot: Your basic autoattack. You are going to strike an enemy and if there is an enemy behind them it will bounce. if this attack hits two targets it will cripple them (no cripple if you only hit a single target). * True Shot  Your large damage attack on a short cooldown. Need to charge up for 0.75 seconds (you are stationary while doing this) and then unleash a large bolt that pierce through enemies. * Deflecting Shot  Fire a missile that block projectile and blind enemies this missile strikes. You can aim this shot between your allies and block projectiles coming to them. * Symbol of Energy: Launch a symbol into an area. Guardians normally dont get ground targeting symbols other than with staff. It grant vigor to allies and explode on impact to burn enemies. * Hunters Ward: Barrage an area and at end of it forms a fence around the area trapping up to 5 enemies. **Traps (heal &amp; utility)** * Tooltips: URL * Animation: URL * Enemies will see you setting the trap down but not the actual traps. These traps have an arming time and an activation time. If you use them like bombs they will take longer to hit your enemies. But if you set them up preemptively they will pop up at a much faster rate. * It takes about 0.5 seconds to put a trap down on the ground and about 0.5 seconds for them to pop up on the ground. * Dragonhunter is all about territory control: traps, hammer #5, ring of warding, dragons maw, longbow #5. * Purification  Imbue a light on the ground and when the enemy triggers it you will pull it back to yourself, blind enemies in the area and use the light to heal yourself. You get a small heal when you lay down and when the enemies walk over it, the big heal triggers. * Test of Faith: Triggers multiple times if enemies walk over it multiple times. * Procession of Blades: Basically your whirling spinning trap that is spin to win. Activates your justice quite a lot. * Lights Judgment: Applies massive amount of vulnerability to them (25 stacks but lasts only 1s) and reveal them on trigger. Theives will squirm at this trap. * Fragments of Faith: A shield that pops up and shatters crippling enemies. Allies can run over them and gain aegis. * Dragons Maw: Elite Trap that pull enemies in and hold them there. Also applies slow. **Traits** * URL * /u/that_shaman has already updated the specialization calculator to [include the Dragonhunter traits](URL Hunter"",2,5,8-""Zeal"",2,5,8-""Radiance"",2,5,8) Minor Traits * Virtuous Action, the first Dragonhunter minor trait will automatically change all your virtue skills into Spear of Justice, Wings of Resolve etc. * Defenders Dogma: Blocking an attack causes your justice to reach its maximum charge. Your Virtue/Spear of Justice passive triggers about every 3-4 attacks to burn an enemy but if you block an attack it should recharge instantly and your next attack burns. There is no CD on this. * Pure of Sight: Deal more damage the further away you are. Between that and the Zealots Aggression that will give you extra damage to crippled enemies it is a lot of bonus damage. Adept Traits * Piercing Light: Traps will bleed enemies. Varying effect depending on the trap. Every hit with the trap will stack up bleed. Procession of Blades for example will deal tons of bleeds. * Zealots Aggression: Deal 10% extra damage to crippled enemies. Combo well with Longbow skills such as Puncture Shot which will cripple enemies if it bounces. * Soaring Devastation: Wings of Resolve will deal an attack on landing and immobilize enemies, giving you an offensive option. Master Traits * Hunters Determination: Get stability for each enemy you hit with True Shot. You can get quite a few stacks of stability if you fire True Shot into a group of enemies. * Bulwark: Shields of Courage lasts 2s longer and has a bit of radius increase (180 deg to 240 deg). * Dulled Senses: Enemies you knocked back are crippled. Good if you have a shield equipped or use the knockback from Hunters Ward (Longbow#5). Really good if paired with Zealots Aggression. Grandmaster Traits * Hunters Fortification: Gain protection in an area when you activate a virtue. This will likely get changed. This trait is a bit redundant with a couple others but we might keep the boons/protection aspect of it. * Heavy Light: Longbow arrows will knockback enemies within 300 range on a short cooldown. Only apply to arrow attacks (Puncture Shot, True Shot, and Deflecting Shot). Your Symbol of Energy/Hunters Ward wont work on this. This will make you a more skirmishy longbow user. If you have Dulled Senses and Zealots Aggression equipped you can move in range to get the knockback, cripple, and the 10% bonus damage. You can knock enemies through your Test of Faith trap and get a combo on it as well. * Big Game Hunter: Striking an enemy tethered by your spear of justice causes vulnerability with every attack and increase 15% damage dealt. This will boost your alliess damage as well with all the vulnerability stacks. **Other changes to Guardian** * They were posted on this thread: URL * Tome of Courage -&gt; Signet of Courage * Passive: PBAoE Heal every 10 seconds. * Active: Light of Deliverance * Tome of Wrath -&gt; Feel My Wrath * Shout that grants Quickness and Fury * We like the idea of tomes and if we did this we would hope to bring them back in a future Elite Specialization.

Signets are often a good addition that are used in one slot to help focus a build towards a purpose. Engineer's are getting a hammer to cover the melee damage that has been sorely lacking so I went ahead and came up with ideas for what the 5 signets might be like. Engineering signets have a quirk in that they have essentially a free active ability with toolbelt skills. Some of these are pretty bland (the heal one especially) but others like the elite signet could have some really cool play with certain builds. Health signet * Passive: Gain regeneration * Active: Heal * Toolbelt: AoE regen and remove 1/2 conditions Forgemaster's Signet * Passive: Increase power * Active: Apply burning and weakness to target * Toolbelt: pbAoE might Signet of Mobility * Passive: 25% movement speed * Active: Cure cripple and immobilize, break stun * Toolbelt: cripple/slow target Alchemist's Signet * Passive: Increase condition damage * Active: convert conditions into boons * Toolbelt: convert 1/2 enemy boons into conditions Signet of Targeting * Passive: Increase precision * Active: stun and apply vulnerability to target * Toolbelt: pbAoE fury Signet of the Dark Knight -- Elite * Passive: Increase range of toolbelt skills * Active: Refresh toolbelt skills * Toolbelt: Unleash static discharge at 5 targets"
400,vulnerability,Guildwars2,The new Necro Specialization won't 'fix' PvE Necros because they aren't broken. Necromancers just don't fit with how we currently play PvE.,0,35q6zf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/35q6zf/the_new_necro_specialization_wont_fix_pve_necros/,2015-05-13 02:38:09,"**TL;DR** Necromancers are looked down on in PvE for the same reasons that anything other than berserker gear is looked down on  Attrition and trading damage isn't utilized when the battle plan is to never take damage in the first place. ---------- [](/lunabats)So there's been a lot of talk about how people hope that the new Necro specialization will 'fix' PvE Necromancers. I have to disagree, because the fundamental design philosophies of the necromancers simply don't mesh with how people currently play PvE  Square peg, round hole. Whenever anyone asks what type of gear they should get on their characters, the answer is almost always Berserkers! - pure offense. This is because in PvE right now the majority of damage can be safely avoided and we're told to focus primarily on damage output. This clashes with the design of a Necromancer, who is built to win the long game through constant damage and durability. If you trade with a Necromancer the necro is sure to win  but you don't trade much in PvE, you just go pure DPS and avoid getting hit in the first place. That's not to say that attrition play can't work in PvE even in the tougher dungeons like Aetherpath or Fractals. I've had great success with tanky parties, geared up in Soldiers equipment and taking defensive traits that trade blows with the bosses. It's just that being tanky isn't necessary for a lot of PvE content, and Berserker parties are preferred in PUGs and dungeons groups over tanky setups. If we start facing content where being able to take a hit is crucial, or if people start running tanky parties, then Necromancers will function perfectly well. If it's just more of what we currently have, then Necromancers are will be at a disadvantage on a pretty fundamental level and I don't think the new specialization will fix that. ---------- That's the meat and potatoes of what I had to say. However I'd also like to put in my two cents on specific areas of the game and how I think the Necromancer fits, doesn't work, or that I think most people are using them wrong. **Damage Output** Death Shroud necros are capable of putting out some pretty big numbers  maybe not as big as some other builds, but still respectable. Lifeblast can easily hit for 5k damage per hit and Death Shroud necros are able to stay in Death Shroud the majority of the time when properly traited. They aren't particularly fragile compared to other DPS builds either, being in my opinion even more durable than a DPS warrior. Condition necros can also deals crazy amounts of damage over the course of a fight. However they are a bit more situational  it doesn't work so well when you have multiple people using conditions as you'll hit the bleed cap and step on each others toes, and they take time to set up so if you're pretty ineffective against hordes of smaller enemies. They can grant themselves a modest amount of Might with Blood is Power and other traits, but they don't stack it nearly as well as some other classes. Since might stacking is emphasized in many dungeon groups you'll have to rely on a team mate to reach your full damage potential. **Support** Necros don't share boons with allies very often, which is what most people equate with 'support'. However, they're great at inflicting foes with Weakness, Vulnerability, Poison or whatever else is needed to give your party an edge. Plague Signet and Well of Power are amazing condition removals for your party, and Well of Blood and Life Transfer (With transfusion) are great AoE heals. And I don't think I need to argue with anyone about how much CC a Necro can dish out. **PvP** Necros are less common in the current meta, but I'm going to argue that this isn't a sign that they're unusable. Elementalists are also in the same situation right now, and heck Warriors were 'worthless' for a good 9 months after the game launched until the right builds were discovered. Styles come and go, and Necros were very powerful in PvE for a long time even if they aren't used much now. And even though the pros don't use them much anymore I can tell you from personal experience they work just fine in PUGs **WvW** Necros are crazy strong in WvW. Condition Necros make some of the scariest solo roamers and small group members, and even in larger fights the amount of damage you deal can rack up quickly on the enemy zerg. Well Necros are even more powerful in zerg fights  often the Well Necro is a high priority target in GvG fights. The amount of area you control is crazy, and the instant the enemy zerg makes a mistep you can make them pay for it like no other class can  ripping off their boons, blinding / chilling them, and all the Fear you can inflict allows you bust open the melee train like no other class can."

Using a combination of venomous shots and strikes, once an Assaulter has you, hes not letting go. Brand new class mechanic: **Assault!** The F1 steal has been replaced with the Assault skill. Once you assault an enemy, you will shadowstep to him and then back to your original position. But before you leave, they better check their pockets for a little gift. Body Mines are the newest form of havoc spreading the Assaulter is bringing. Once an enemy is assaulted, a mine will be left at his back, visiby ticking off for 3 seconds before exploding. Once it does, the mine will inflict the enemy with a variable set of conditions depeding on what the Assaulter has previously determined with his F2 and F3 skills: **Mine Charge and Mine Set-up.** **F2 skill Mine Charge!** Mine Charge will work as follows: Everytime you use it, it will deplentish all of you Initiative Points and charge your Assault, making it stronger the most IP you had. So if you used it with a 10 IP, you will inflict a bigger number of condition stacks. **F3 skill Mine Set-up!** This ability is now your brand new F3 skill. It will cost 2 IP and will allow you to stack the conditions your Assault skill will inflict. It has a 3 seconds cooldown and takes up to 4 stacks, going as follows: 1st stack: Confusion 2nd stack:. Bleed and vulnerability 3rd stack:. Poison and criple 4th stack: Torment and Burn This makes the Assaulter a force to be reckoned with if given the time to prepare. So you better watch your steps, because you might get Assaulted! See you in game."" &gt;Enjoy it... was just bored at work... EDIT: Upvote is love."

It is something we are still playing around. **Reaper General** * One of our earlier specialization designs, we worked on it before chronomancer. It is the first specialization we experimented with that changed the F1 skills and changed the tone for the other specializations afterwards. * It was one of the first ones that had a theme with the minor traits where themes fit the character. * Main counter to Reaper is avoiding the conditions by outranging the Reaper since Reaper lacks mobility and ranged options. Reapers are also fairly vulnerable to interrupts due to slower attack skills. **Traits** * Tooltips: URL Minors * Shroud Knight is the first minor and it allow you to use reaper shouts, greatsword and enter Reapers Shroud. * Shivers of Dread, your second minor, chill enemies who are feared by you. Since Reaper is melee based, we dont want players to run away when they are feared so they are also chilled. * Cold Shroud  Cause your chill to 20% longer and reduce damage from chilled foes by 15%. Adept * Augury of Death  shouts recharge 7% faster for each foe they hit. If your shout hit the max amount of 5 enemies, you gain 35% faster recharge. * Chilling Nova  Critical hits against chilled foes cause an explosion that chill nearby foes. Cannot happen more than 3 times within 10 seconds. * Relentless Pursuit  Reduce duration of movement impairing conditions. 66% reduction while in Reapers Shroud. Master * Soul Eater  Cause your GS attacks to steal health, help you sustain while in battle. It also cause Gravedigger, one of your GS skills, to recharge by 3% per foe hit. * Chilling Force  Gain might and life force when you hit a chilled foe. It is a bit too strong right now so we might not ship with these numbers. * Decimate Defenses  Striking a foe with vulnerability give you 2% critical hit chance per stack. If you hit someone with 25 stacks of Vulnerability you gain 50% critical hit chance. This couple wells with another trait that give you 50% critical hit chance while in Death Shroud. Grandmaster * Blights Boon  Gain lifeforce when you gain boon. If you are in reapers shroud, gain health instead. * Deathly Chill  Cause chill to damage and deal more damage to foes below the health threshold (50%). * Reapers Onslaught  Attack 15% while in Reapers Shroud. Killing a foe recharge Deaths Charge (gap closer skill while in Reapers Shroud). Themes * If you pick all bottom traits (Relentless Pursit, Decimate Defenses, and Reapers Onslaught), it is our movie monster themed line. It is hard to stop you, you move and attack faster. * Middle line is our chill based line. It helps you spread chill, deal more damage to chilled foes and make chill do damage. * Top line is our brawler line, it rewards you for hitting lots of enemies. Your shouts recharge faster, you get lots of siphons, and sustain. **Greatsword** * Tooltips: URL * GS skill #1 will inflict chill on the third hit. GS Autoattack is about 0.25s slower than other autoattacks. Chill on autoattack is pretty powerful and we usually try to avoid putting snare conditions on autoattacks. If Reaper gets on a guy he will usually not getting away if you can keep the chill up. * Gravedigger is your bread and better damage skill. It hits up to 5 enemies around you after a long wind up. Recharge bonus works even if just 1 enemy in a group of enemies is below 50%. Also act as Whirl finisher. * Death Spiral, this is a setup skill that breaks the armor of your enemies. Applies 12 stacks of Vulnerability. Generate lots of Life Force. * Nightfall  Blind and cripple enemies over 6 seconds. You cannot move while casting it but you can move after casting it. It has the same cast time as Mesmer #3 Greatsword skill. * Reapers Grasp  Send out a pull that will pull a max of 5 enemies into a nice little bowl right in front of you. This set up pretty well with rest of skills as you can setup Nightfall, pull enemies to you and then just go Gravedigger on them. * Executioners Scythe is basically your second execute (Gravedigger is your first execute). Deals tons of damage, freeze and chill enemies while also leaving behind an Ice combo field so you can combo with finishers. **Reaper's Shroud (F1) skills** * URL * All skills in Reapers Shroud corresponds to the Death Shroud skills and the same traits will affect them. If you trait something that affect Death Shroud #1 skill, the same trait will also affect the Reapers Shroud #1 skill. * Life Reap, the final hit from your #1 skill, is also your Life Force generator that damage up to 5 nearby enemies. * Deaths Charge is unaffected by movement impairing abilities and will charge same distance even if you are chilled/crippled. It doesnt go as far as Dark Path unfortunately but has a lower recharge. The spinning scythe will damage any foes along the path and when you reach your location you will do a poison explosion to poison foes. * Infusing Terror give you stability every pulse for a short duration. Once activated, Infusing Terror can be activated again to trigger Terrify. Stability does not end when you exit Reapers Shroud. * Soul Spiral is basically your spin to win skill. When you want things to die, you activate this skill. Also act as a whirl finisher. **Shouts/Utilities** * Tooltips: URL * Shouts hit everything within 600 range, they dont do a lot of damage as their main thing is utility. They are bad vs single targets but good vs lots of enemies. Shouts have cast time since they are too powerful if they are instant cast. * These shout skills will work with Runes of the Trooper (Used to be called Runes of the Soldier). Runes of the Trooper remove conditions from allies affected by shouts. * Your Soul is Mine is the first heal for necros that give you Life Force but it is only 4% Life Force per enemy so it is good vs more enemies. * Your are all weaklings is your stun breaker and gain might on struck foes. You get 4 stacks of might but they are fairly short lasting. If you hit 5 foes with this you gain 20 stacks of might. Good when coupled with Gravedigger as you can get 20 stacks of might with this and then go to town on foes with Gravedigger. Weakness will help reduce incoming damage from enemies. * Suffer no longer breaks stun. The tooltip is wrong. It used to be your stun breaker skill but the text was not removed. It will transfer a condition from you to each foe you strike and also chill them. * Nothing can save you is your defense breaker. It will convert enemies boons it hits into vulnerability. It will remove up to 2 boons per enemy and give 5 stacks of Vulnerability per boon removed. Also make your attack unblockable with duration depending on the number of enemies it hits (4s if you dont hit anyone, 9s if you hit all 5). * Rise skill currently summon Jagged Horrors on each enemy it hits which are fairly weak. We are currently still revising on what type of minions this skill will summon. * Chilled to the bone is your elite 600 range 5 target AoE stun that last for 10 seconds. It has quite of a long wind up so you will want stability on you to prevent interrupts. For each enemy you hit you gain resistance which make you resist conditions. "

I mostly run pug dungeons and fractals (about to reach fractal 50 soon), and I'm a party damage kind of guy. My previous main is a Phalanx Warrior...so it is a pretty big leap from being a party damage kind of guy to a solo damage Necromancer, ha ha. I'm currently building a full Ascended set with Scholars Runes and eventually, when I can afford them, Mighty Infusions. I was just wondering that, huh, I have no idea what to run. **Sigil of Force** is probably mandatory. I would prefer not to run **Sigil of the Night.** I do not like carrying multiple of the same weapon, so the same goes for the **Sigils of X Slaying.** Remember, I'm a pug dungeon guy, not a uber speedrun dude (I mean...I'm playing a Necromancer). **Sigil of Accuracy** would be nice aside from the fact Reapers can reach 100% accuracy in Deathshroud without any precision. **Sigil of Frailty** is also cool, since it provides an indirect party support, but the Reaper can stack a ridiculous amount of vulnerability anyways, so there's a good chance that would push the Reaper over 25 stacks, not to mention there's other classes who can stack Vulnerability. I'd prefer not to run a **stacking Sigil**, but I might if there really isn't any better Sigils to use. **Sigil of Chilling** seems alright for a Reaper, but I was thinking Reapers already have a permanent chill on their Greatsword autoatack anyways. **Sigil of Strength** is really promising, but a bit of a waste since, yes, even in pug dungeons you can usually get 25 stacks of might even with a Necromancer. It is extremely tempting when I solo content, though... **Sigil of Energy** is cool, but I think I'll leave that to PvP. I have no idea about **Sigil of Air** and **Sigil of Fire,** in terms of DPS, but they seem promising again. Does anyone have any opinions? "

Here is an example: [Comparison of Necromancer builds](URL **Introduction** Hello! I am impie and I have been part of Team Aggression [TA] for over two years, a hardcore World vs. World guild that many of you will know. As many of you know, there is a lot of theorycrafting involved in making the perfect build, be it for PvE, PvP or WvW. Most highly competitive player and guilds already had mathematical models for this purpose, although those were less intricate, harder to use and generally a lot less automated than GW2Power.com. With this website I hope to bring up the overall level of Guild Wars 2 builds, especially those of the less experienced players. The formulas and layouts used on GW2Power.com were originally compiled by me for use in Team Aggression, though they make up only a small part of the theorycrafting tools made available to that guild. **What does GW2 Power do?** It calculates your so-called 'Effective Power', which combines all the boons and stats into one number. This amount of Effective Power is essentially an equivalent of the raw damage you can put out, though conditions are not included. As I said, buffs (like might and fury) and vulnerability are all taken into account and can be switched to a desired amount as you please. **Core Features:** * Calculate damage (Effective Power) * Calculate tankiness (Effective Health) * Calculate condition duration * Compare up to 5 builds per profession at a time (and switch between professions seamlessly) * Save and Load builds locally * Link (multiple) builds to your friends at once **Converting Effective Power into actual damage** This conversion is rather straight forward and should only take a couple of seconds, if you choose to do it at all. Effective Power does not necessarily need to be converted, as everything else in the calculation is a simple constant. The formula for conversion can be found below, while the skill coefficients should be on the Guild Wars 2 Wiki. Keep in mind that utilities dont use weapon strength: each one has their own number. However, utilities do still scale with Effective Power. &gt; Damage = Effective Power * skill coefficient (wiki) * weapon strength / target armor **Feedback** I have been working on this project devotedly over the past couple of weeks and would appreciate your feedback on anything related to this website. Did you find a bug, does something about the layout or interface bother you or have you managed to break something? Let me know!

If u dont plane on running dungeons with that Char go for other sigils. "
411,vulnerability,Guildwars2,pure axe is back!,0,32ohgs,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/32ohgs/pure_axe_is_back/,2015-04-15 22:59:26,"Dear community and autochthonic warriors! With this thread I want to introduce a very old but still new variation for the EA-Warrior and the DPS-Warrior respectively. I would also like to invite you for testing, improving und especially criticising my ideas. The most important pioneer for the warrior meta was and still is Nike from the guild DNT. His researches, Perrys Effective Power Spreadsheet and also Abes information build the basis for my improvements. First of all it is very important to understand that any DPS or EA-Build is only than applicable if the might stacking is already established e.g. from elementalists. If this is not the case the warrior has to play PS in order to take care of might stacking! A very detailed explanation for this principle can be found in Nikes thread. (URL Nikes already mentioned EA-Build (2/5/0/4/0) tries to maximise the balance between damage, vulnerability and CC. This is achieved with the GS for the main damage and movement and also through the possibility of vulnerability stacking with Axe/Mace and providing a decent amount of CC at the same time. Of course these hybrid-builds always come with the disadvantage of not focusing on one principle enough and trying to do everything but nothing really well. In order to avoid this I searched for an improvement and found the very old but mostly forgotten Pure Axe Build (4/6/0/4/0). URL It provides a very high amount of vulnerability and according to my calculations even an increased damage! Of course the movement out of the fight is decreased in comparison to the GS but with a weapon change to Sword/War horn this disadvantage can be compensated easily. The pure facts about the damage can be seen in the Spreadsheet*. The calculated skill-coefficient is based on a 30s rotation** which will be topic of the following paragraphs. The demonstrated skill rotation shows the potential of creating the maximal vulnerability. In well organised groups this can differ if a high vulnerability uptime is already established. Cyclone Axe (Axe 2) and Crushing Blow(Mace 4) should only be used if the vulnerability is massively decreasing in order to rapidly push it again. In all other situations the warrior has to stay casting his auto attack and should never ever interrupt his attack chain! The rotation can also be extended with Tremor (mace 5) which provides a damage increase while standing in max-melee range and giving a CC/Defiant Control at the same time. The F1 skill Eviscerate is not covered in the rotation because it is always a damage increase if adrenalin is full and should always be used in that case! Another very important advantage of the Pure-Axe Build offers the usage of experimental remnant and bowl of seaweed salad on the warrior. This would bring an additional 8 or 10% damage modifier because he can always keep moving while using performing the rotation. If the only aim would be to maximise the damage  so to make sure that might, fury and vulnerability is up all the time  the Pure Axe Build (4/6/0/4/0) can even fight the Pure GS Build. The according calculations are provided in the Spreadsheet. The rotation would then be changed to auto attack until the maximal adrenalin is reached. After that the F1 skill has to be used before continuing with the auto attack. The damage potential is also shown in the Spreadsheet. With bowl of seaweed salad or experimental remnant this provides the maximum damage possible with the warrior. Unfortunately this variation is only possible while playing in well organised groups. But still the idea of this guide is not to do this but just to proof that the Pure Axe Build can replace the EA Build suggested by Nike (2/5/0/4/3) and hopefully I was successful. Sadly the guide is now longer as intended hopefully I it is able to cover all relevant information and explain it in an easy understandable way. If you have any questions do not hesitate asking me ingame your ideas, concerns and questions. In the end I want to repeat that this build is not a new invention and is only possible due to the excellent work of DNT, Perrys Spreadsheet and a lot of other very great people. I hope that the axe can find its way back to the main weapon for EA and back into the daily life of a warrior player. I wish to express special thanks to my guild [ TDN ], skywalker and togo *DMG Calculation: URL **Rotation: URL 100b vs Chop: URL Build: URL "
412,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Discuss: Superior Rune of Rage on Meditation DPS Guardian,0,33corx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/33corx/discuss_superior_rune_of_rage_on_meditation_dps/,2015-04-21 23:33:03,"I'm not sure if when did the Superior Rune of Rage got changed or fixed but it now shows 5% extra damage when having Fury. It seems like a pretty viable build aside from the meta medi guard that uses Traveler runes or of the pack. I was wondering if someone out there has a build variation of the Superior Rune of Rage for the Meditation DPS guardian whom I can compare with? I am currently playing a medi guard that focuses on Fury uptime and blind (traited to inflict vulnerability). I have Litany of Wrath for my heal, Contemplation of Purity, Smite Condition, Judge's Intervention and the elite Renewed Focus. I have 0-2-6-0-6 for traits and sword/focus and GS. Sigil of Intelligence and Sigil of Leeching are used on the GS for life steal and Energy and Force for my sword and focus, respectively. No need for upvote, I just need/want to discuss. "
413,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Guardian Discussion Thread,38,33sm83,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/33sm83/guardian_discussion_thread/,2015-04-25 15:43:20,"Hey all! I know there's a thread out there about our burning stacks change in particular, but I'm curious what the community thinks about the proposed changes to our traits overall. **[Here](URL is an album showing all the new traits as they appeared in the twitch stream this afternoon (*huge* thanks to /u/dulfy for all her work today!). I want to walk through the traits and discuss my thoughts, but even more than that I want to hear what the broader community thinks! I've not been playing Guardian all that long, and I'm certain you will see plenty that I don't. Fair warning: All my gameplay is in PvE (dungeons/fractals/SW), and so I'm not even going to try to interpret the new changes from a PvP or WvW standpoint, but I'm be very interested to hear from those of you who have more experience in those areas! Some changes: ###Zeal: * Third minor rune gives a large DPS increase to symbols by giving them a 33% chance to proc burning -- will it be enough to start including more symbols in our rotations? * Difficult to tell whether anything will beat out Fiery Wrath for pure damage for the Adept slot. Zealous Scepter gives us 8s of Might every fifth scepter attack... but I'm not sure 5-6 stacks of might (at best) will be enough to beat out a solid 10% increase to damage all the time. * Forcing us to choose between Zealous Blade (5% damage with GS plus healing and recharge reduction) and Binding Jeopardy (3 stacks of Vulnerability on Blind or Immobilize) for our Master slot is cruel -- I definitely feel Kindled Zeal will be the odd man out in this row, unless condition damage is drastically improved. * Shattered Aegis gets a ~2x boost (from what I can tell), but Symbolic Avenger (combined with the third minor trait) might encourage more symbol use and win out in pure DPS for the Grandmaster trait. * Overall, this definitely feels like an odd path -- the focus on scepter is at odds with the emphasis on symbols, and I'm not immediately impressed by any of the Grandmaster traits. ###Radiance: * I like the change to Radiant Power: 25% Crit Chance vs. burning targets feels tighter thematically than the 10% damage for conditions. Curious to see how the numbers work out, since I'm not sure immediately how much that affects our damage output. * Inner Fire!! Gaining almost constant fury uptime as long as the enemy is merrily ablaze is very strong, and likely works out to almost the same as the static +15% crit chance from Right Hand Strength. Obviously the recharge on Sword skills might push RHS over the edge, particularly on trash (though why are you using sword on trash?). Again this is cruel, making us choose between RHS and IF! I definitely see Healer's Retribution as a distant third for Adept traits. * For Master traits, I'm torn. Retribution has some excellent synergy with the Virtue and Zeal trees -- I can see a build there involving Aegis application and removal, cycling Virtues, and trying to pour on the damage. On the other hand, Radiant Fire has some excellent synergy with the rest of the crit-focused traits in this line, and Wrath of Justice looks appealing as well. One of the more difficult tiers to choose from, I think! * Amplified Wrath feels like the winner for the Grandmaster traits, at least to me. Perfect Inscriptions gives a bit of power (from improving Bane Signet) and increases Retaliation uptime (through Light Aura), but I'm not sure it's worth it given how rarely we see signets (aside from Bane) in use. Radiant Retaliation is again entirely dependent on how strong condition damage can be in the new meta. * Overall, this still feels like the Radiance line we have now, just cranked up to 11. I see it being favored heavily for DPS builds of all stripes. ###Valor: * Valorous Defense has its ICD cut in *half*, and Courageous Return now triggers off Rez *or* Rally. Some nice simple changes, but definitely ones which make these minor traits more appealing. * Strength of the Fallen is just a pure combination of the trait of the same name plus Purity, but I still think it falls behind Smite Condition and Focus Mastery here for Adept traits. Focus Mastery's ability to grant ~33% uptime on Protection is impressive, as is the extra condition cleansing with Smiter's Boon. * I agree with the twitch audience: Stalwart Defender is boring. It's not *bad*, but it's very boring compared to the other weapon-specific traits, and feels underwhelming as a Master-level trait. I'm amused that Strength of Numbers got moved up a tier, while Communal Defense got moved *down* a tier, but they provide good competition against one another. I can see arguments for any of these three, though none really stand out in a PvE setting (at least Pre-HoT). * Monk's Focus combines three traits from the Valor tree into one truly powerful Meditation-centered Grandmaster trait here, and definitely catches my eye over Altruistic Healing and Retributive Armor (the later of which feels somewhat out-of-place in a specialization with so little mention of crit chance or crit damage). * Overall a powerful support specialization -- not a role I'm too familiar with in PvE, but I can see how this spec could be used to great effect in aiding party survivability in other areas of the game. ###Honor: * Nice to see a bit of endurance regen in Purity of Body, though we lose the ability in this specialization to pass that (or the healing) on to our allies with Battle Presence (which was relocated as a Grandmaster trait in Virtues). Otherwise, very little change in the minors. * I like that Mace got moved from Valor to an Adept trait here in Honor -- as pointed out in the stream, the healing power has a potential to grow huge very quickly, gaining synergy from the rest of the traits here. It's actually a difficult choice to pick between that or Protective Reviver, as both offer different but powerful support benefits. This is also where our falling damage trait combination ended up. * I can start to see some connections between the Master traits in Honor and the traits throughout the other specs, Radiance in particular. Empowering Might ties directly in with the crit-boosting traits in Radiance, while the Staff trait and Pure of Heart can both benefit a variety of builds. * I love both Writ of Persistence and Pure of Voice as Grandmaster traits, particularly given how often we utilize various shouts in dungeons. Force of Will is clearly designed for those who are specializing in healing, and for them it provides a sizeable boost in output. * Overall, I love the theme of this specialization, and even though I don't see myself dipping into it, I can see the power it provides for a healing-focused Guardian. ###Virtues: * I love the combination of Vengeful and Virtue of Retribution into one minor trait in this line, and similarly the blend of the virtue refresh rate into the final minor trait. Those are examples of the exact type of change I was hoping to see when the details starting coming out about their reduction in traits. * The only change to Adept traits from live is the addition of aegis to Retalitory Subconsciousness, but combined with some of the other trees (particularly Zeal) that might be a rather large change. It's also important to note here that all **consecrations** will become ground-targeted automatically, which may increase their utility and the appeal of Master of Consecrations. Still, it's hard to pass up on 20% extra damage, even if it's not a constant benefit, so it will be interesting to see if anything besides Unscathed Contender gets taken here. * Supreme Justice combos very well with Zealous Scepter (from Zeal), significantly increasing the number of Might stacks you could sustain on your own. Even outside scepter, it's likely the top pick for Master trait in this specialization: Absolute Resolution remains the same, and Virtuous Mallet is very specific). * Virtues has an excellent set of Grandmaster traits: Indomitable Courage combines two previous traits together, turning Virtue of Courage into a party-wide stun break and stability granter, with more frequent aegis for you to boot; Battle Presence grants party-wide regen and (I assume) endurance regen if you've taken Honor as well; and Permeating Wrath offers a chance to see a trait that exists currently in-game but is almost never utilized (at least in PvE). I'm actually very intrigued by all three options, which is refreshing. * Overall Virtues is a powerful damaging and party-wide supporting tree, one which I suspect will be utilized quite a bit. Whew! Quite a novel. That's my take on things, anyway -- now it's time for me to shut up and hear what you guys have to say! What do these changes do to the Guardian's role in groups in all three aspects of the game? What are you most excited for? Does ground-targeting for all consecrations matter all that much in the grand scheme of the class? And, on a scale of 1-25, how excited are you for stacking burning?! Can't wait to hear what the community thinks!"
414,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Let's talk about the Ranger trait changes (Warning: Wall of Text),20,33vklj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/33vklj/lets_talk_about_the_ranger_trait_changes_warning/,2015-04-26 11:16:50,"With yesterdays stream ANet showed us what they planned for the Ranger in the upcoming trait revamp. I always felt that Ranger in general has really boring and lacking traits and this revamp would be the perfect opportunity to do so. Are the presented changes this long awaited revamp? Well I would say they are partly, but there is a lot of stuff in there that doesn't seems like it was well thought out. I'd like to go through the changes in detail and comment what I think is the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Because once all traits are at least interesting in their nature, the important part is balancing their numbers, but boring traits will stay boring no matter what their numbers are. I will sometimes propose new trait ideas, but please don't over think those, as they are merely small suggestions for stuff I would find interesting in place of the existing traits. To put all this in context, I played Ranger extensively since release in all game modes, PvE, WvW and PvP. If a trait is good in one of those modes and not so good in other modes it can still be a good trait. All screenshots are taken from /u/Dulfy's amazing [specialization livestream thread.](URL **Marksmanship** [Screenshot](URL *1. Minor Traits* The Minor Traits set the baseline for the opening strike mechanic. I was never a fan of this mechanic, and always thought those 3 minor traits were pretty much a waste, but with some of the new traits I think opening strikes could get very interesting or powerful. So in that regard these minor traits are fine. *2. Adept Traits* Enlargement is a decent trait that is getting moved from the Nature Magic line. It fits well into Marksmanship though, because of the signet effect. Beastmaster's Bond is a completely new trait, that sounds very powerful and will surely find use in a lot of builds. It's an interesting effect that promotes active pet management, overall a really well made new trait. Predator's Instinct sounds much too weak and has a very dull effect. Especially on ranger, the class that already has insane access to cripple (Unless you play with axe main hand in both weapon sets, you definitely have cripple in your weapon set) the trait just seems like something that probably won't be noticed at all. In my opinion the effect should be merged with Predator's Onslaught and in it's place you'd put a new trait or an interesting old one. My idea would be a trait that gives a small effect on using an opening strike, like 2 stacks of might for you and players around you. *3. Master Traits* The new Beastmaster's Might sounds great and finally like something that I'd consider worth taking. Again, it promotes active usage of your Signets and the addition of Opening strikes is a clever usage. Steady Focus is a trait I never particularly liked, but that is very important for PvE and Dungeons so I definitely won't complain that it stays. I think a small additional effect would be cool, maybe just something like having dodge rolls only use 80% of the normal Endurance if your endurance is full. It'll find usage either way though so it's generally fine. Moment of clarity is a good fit in Marksmanship and worth taking in the Master tier. My only problem with the trait is that they should change the tool tip from +150% to either ""You deal 150% damage"" or ""You deal +50% damage"" because that would actually be accurate. *4. Grandmaster Traits* Well all of them are great. As I said, I think Predator's Onslaught should get the effect of Predator's Instinct, but only because PI is so weak that I don't think it deserves to be a separate trait. It's a DPS boost, so it's great for PvE. Remorseless sounds amazing, if it keeps the lack of ICD. In group situations ranger could potentially easily keep up 25 stacks of vulnerability on an enemy alone, if he get's enough fury from his allies which would be a great team synergy^^TM. Could actually be a much better DPS increase that Predator's Onslaught in some situations, which is a really good thing for Build Choices. Lead the Wind is great and with it your longbow will have a moveset that currently is impossible to trait for, because you can't take all 4 traits for it (piercing, 1500 range, increased attack speed, increased projectile speed, cd reduction). No complaints here. **Skirmishing** [Screenshot](URL *1. Minor Traits* All stay the same, but they are fine the way they are, as they are useful and promote an active playstyle. *2. Adept Traits* Sharpened Edges is strong right now, so I don't think it needs changes. Most Dangerous Game is a new trait. The mechanic sounds interesting and it's something new giving the ranger more access to might (which the class lacks). I don't think it's a particularly powerful trait from the looks of it, but aside from changing some numbers it looks like a good trait. It doesn't synergize well with all the buffs that happen at &amp;gt;90% health, but as a standalone trait it's interesting enough. Trappers Defense (the screenshot doesn't completely have it, it basically places a spike trap around allies that you res) sucks now and sucks the way it is in the rework. Placing a spike trap around resed allies isn't particularly powerful to begin with, because it will only affect enemies that already stand next to the ally you res, which means they are in ressurection range. Also for some reason ranger has another trait in another line that gives resed allies swiftness and speeds up resurrection. I don't understand why those traits weren't merged together. I'd argue that even merged together they aren't worth taking, but split up? No way anyone should choose them ever. It should be completely reworked. Maybe add a whirlwind effect like Axe 5 around people you res, which reflects projectiles and gives both of you retaliation, again just an idea. In every case, ranger shouldn't have 2 bad res traits, they should be merged. *3. Master Traits* Basically said all 3 sound good. I don't have to explain PvE players why spotter is great, Primal Reflexes is an interesting take, much better than the old version that triggered when you were hit by a critical strike. Now you actually have to land a dodge. Trapper's Expertise is good for trap builds obviously and it's good for them. *4. Grandmaster Traits* I love everything about Quick Draw. This is what a Grandmaster Trait should look like. It promotes clever and intelligent play, gives tons of new options for your combat. It gives you more options in all kinds of play, offensively, defensively, support oriented. Light on your feet will also find it's use as a great trait and Strider's Defense will be the Trait of choice for the Dungeon crowd. Again those are some good Grandmaster Traits. **Wilderness Survival** [Screenshot](URL *1. Minor Traits* The first two are good, and were always my favorite Ranger minor traits (well at least since the nerf of the quickness on pet swap trait). Getting a new Bark Skin as a minor trait that triggers on &amp;gt;90% health is also a great change. Even outside of PvP, everyone that does difficult dungeons or fractals were you are in danger of being one hit by a boss will now only take half the usual damage on a hit when their life is full. In PvP this trait also has great synergy with Troll Unguent and generally many of the ranger survival options. *2. Adept Traits* Soften the fall is the mandatory fall damage reduction trait. It does it's job well in that regard, the created muddy terrain isn't great but doesn't really matter for this trait. Condition Builds with Torch or Dagger (or both) can be happy about Ambidexterity, which should give them a decent boost in usefulness. I think the range increase of the old off hand training trait is now baseline so you generally have a decent trait for condition builds, promoting more than Shortbow Bleed stacking. Expertise training gives pets extra condition damage. Now I have never really relied on pets as a condition damage dealer so I think the condition damage increase is mostly negligible, but the increased condition duration should be useful on most pets especially wolf or spiders. Overall I have to say the adept trait tier is pretty disappointing. None of the traits are terrible in their own right, but they all seem situational. I can think of many builds, where I want to take none of them. If you don't care about falling damage (like most players) and don't play with dagger or torch offhand there is really only one trait to pick, which isn't even that good in it's own right and pretty situational. One of the traits should probably swap positions with a more universal trait from another tier or trait line. I'd also like to see some form of Vigorous Renewal as a trait, because I always found vigor on using a heal skill very useful. *3. Master Traits* Oakheart Salve already is a decent trait that gets picked often enough and with a 5% damage reduction on regeneration it only gets better. Peak Strength gives a big damage boost comparable to scholar runes (although it also boosts your pet, which I'm not sure about with scholar runes), so it's useful in PvE by default. Shared Anguish is another popular trait. All in all a decent trait tier. There should be something for everyone here. *4. Grandmaster Traits* All 3 traits are good and the new wilderness knowledge is amazing. I was never a fan of Poison Master, but a lot of people used it in their PvP builds, and with the Poison changes it could become even more powerfull. I have a really big problem with this trait line though. Empathic Bond used to be the only decent way for a ranger to get rid of conditions, which kind of forced the class to go into the Wilderness Survival trait line for PvP. As a reaction for that, Survival of the Fittest (or here called wilderness knowledge) was introduced to give another good condition cleanse option in another trait line. Now both are put in the same trait line and both as grandmaster traits. Not only do I know plenty of builds that actually used both, it again forces the ranger to take this one trait line to have the option to clear conditions. I'd suggest moving Empathic Bond to Beastmastery, maybe swap it with Honed Axes. **Nature Magic** [Screenshot]( URL This trait line is something that shouldn't be that relevant anymore for dungeon runners, but there is still a lot to talk about on the PvP/WvW side. *1. Minor Traits* They are fine. Rejuvenation and Fortifying Bond were useful, although Rejuvenation always was a bit boring. The old 5% dmg boost when you have a boon (so basically always) trait wasn't particularly interesting. The new increased boon duration minor trait sounds much better (although I think the numbers in it might change, since they sound rather high). *2. Adepts Traits* Right of the bat, we have two traits that basically do the exact same thing. Bountiful Hunter and Nature's Wrath both increase your power based damage output. *The question which one is better isn't really a choice, but a math problem.* They should really introduce some new effects here. Healers Celerity has a weak effect, but I already talked about it. It should be merged with Trapper's Defense, and even then I think it's too weak. This trait tier definitely needs more work. *3. Master Traits* Evasive Purity is already good, and with added cripple remove it definitely won't be worse. Vigorous Training used to be a never used trait, because it was in a bad trait line. Here it actually looks decent. Giving allies Vigor is always a good thing, and having it as an active effect on your pet swap is useful too. Windborne Notes should give a really high regeneration uptime. An issue I have here is that Windborne Notes is something that will largely be triggered by the Beastmaster's Bond trait, which is on Pet Swap. So instead of being able to get a lot of really good support effects on Pet Swap, you have to decide if you want Vigor or Regeneration. Definitely a missed opportunity here. *4. Grandmaster Traits* Nature's Vengeance is right now only a Grandmaster Trait, because ANet wanted to make it easier to get moving spirits. With moving spirits being removed from the game, Nature's Vengeance is definitely not Grandmaster worthy and just needs a much better effect to be actually considered. It's definitely not a game changer and a Grandmaster Trait that changes the way a certain kind of skill works should be a game changer. Since we don't have details how the ""new"" spirits will work exactly I won't suggest a change for this trait, but it definitely needs more for it going on. Protective Ward sounds pretty powerful and annoying to fight against. It looks like it would generally work well as a grandmaster trait but I think the numbers might need some tweaking. Still a nice new trait. Invigorating Bond just doesn't sound that useful to me. I don't think the effect is particularly interesting or strong. Definitely not grandmaster worthy for me. It might work as an adept trait somewhere. *(continued in the comments)*"

It allows you to build up to stage 3 adrenaline faster during the initial phases of fights, and mitigates the DPS loss after using arcing slice for 100% fury uptime without consumables and an extra burst skill in the rotation. Only use arcing slice in place of a brutal strike (third attack in the aa chain), and only if you actually need the fury (~once per minute as a rule of thumb, but check your fury). Try to time it so that you have time to follow it up with an additional greatsword swing, and preferably slice. You will have a greater DPS increase if you try to use arcing slice when the target is below half health, but this is a DPS increase even at the lower damage stage. The rotation used for the calculations above can be found [here](URL From what I can tell, using 6/6/0/0/2 was never max solo DPS (compared to either empowered variant). Intuitively, it might seem that using this would result in more expected might, but since most of your might comes from forceful greatsword the reduction in boon duration actually results in less expected might. On top of that, having to cast the signet more often means fewer attacks in your rotations. &amp;nbsp; **Random thoughts** * This is definitely only intended for situations where you dont need fast hands, as fast hands will be a huge dps increase in many practical situations * Im pretty sure that I could get another auto attack into the signet mastery rotation without affecting the time, but even 2 additional auto attacks wont change anything stated above, and 3 wouldnt change how it compares to furious * If you can get fury from other sources (med kit, banner), 6/6/0/2/0 deep/rending strikes may be optimal * In fights where you have downtime to use signet, the signet mastery build will be less bad (but Im skeptical that it would be better than either 6/6/0/2/0 variant) * Favoring deep strike over rending strikes results in lower theoretical DPS, but could be better in some practical situations where you can't attack as often (but I'm highly skeptical) * Im using no bloodlust and mighty infusions for the calculations that you see in the spreadsheet because thats how I run, but Ive tested this with bloodlust and precise infusions as well and the conclusions are the same * Mighty infusions might be better than precise for this build because arcing slice with be a guaranteed crit at 90% chance with critical burst, but I didnt do the math here (I just already have 7 mighty infusions and dont want to blow them up for precise) &amp;nbsp; **Notes about the calculations** * These calculations are done using ~2 minute (banner cast to banner cooled) rotations with expected values for each hit instead of 30 second rotations using averages * Assuming perfect FGJ activations and signet activation immediately after it is cooled (this helps SM more than the other builds) * %damage bonuses for empowered are calculated based on whether or not you will have might, fury, and swift for each individual attack in the rotation, no assumptions * The %damage bonus for attack of opportunity is calculated based on probability that the enemy will be bleeding for each attack in the rotation (based on how many times it had been hit in the last 4 seconds) * Bonuses for berserkers power are calculated based on the adrenaline stage for each attack in the recorded rotations, not probabilities of furious triggering based on crit chance * Expected might/vulnerability are calculated for each hit in a similar way to the attack of opportunity bonus * Assuming that the %damage bonuses from stick and move (this is questionable), superior rune of strength, sigil of force, sigil of X slaying, potion of X slaying, and slashing power are always present (where X = undead, obviously)"

I would think Mesmer is better since there's also the boons (and conditions) that stack really fast the nearer you are. I mean winds of chaos, though random, seems to apply vulnerability and bleed mostly and boons, and burning as a bonus whereas scepter apples just poison and bleed."

I am playing this game again since a month ago (me and my friend quit just after release due we finding the combat a bit repetative, however we returned with a fresh look on things and enjoy it alot). However, I started playing mesmer and enjoy the playstyle, however I can't seem to get a pvp build going for me which I like and which feels good. I tried some phantasm builds going 2/3/0/5/4 getting all the phantasm increase dmg, this build is quite tanky, however, the damage is not big and feels rahter slow. I also tried an 4/4/0/0/6 build in which I went for maximum condition damage, testing it on a golem ends up with 25 bleeding stacks ticking for 3k dmg per second, however this build leaves you with 15k hp which is almost nothing. One last thing, I just find all the shatter skills rahter weak except for diversion which can add a lot of vulnerability. (like one stack of confusion is not gonna make a difference, frustration). So can anyone please help me getting some insight? (I also made a guardian and somehow those traits seem a lot easier to go by) With best regards, Sky tl;dr : Please give me some insight in the mesmer pvp builds, its rahter confusing [139 dmg on trying to get my head around it ;)]"
418,vulnerability,Guildwars2,My dream Warrior specialization - an in-depth speculation,0,2yhq5y,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2yhq5y/my_dream_warrior_specialization_an_indepth/,2015-03-10 09:24:52,"I see specializations as a method of supporting areas that a class was previously weak in, or rather enabling classes to fill niche roles that they were previously ineffective at doing. So, looking at the Warrior as a class we can see what it already has access too: * many melee weapons supporting both power and condition builds * limited range weapons, both longbow and rifle have decent range * plenty of direct burst damage from the axe, greatsword, hammer and rifle * good condition pressure from the sword mainhand, offhand and longbow * great control from the hammer, mace, shield and physical utility skills * strong sustain from mace, shield, stances and signets * plenty of support options from shouts and banners * amazing mobility from sword, greatsword, physical utility skills and high swiftness uptime * decent hybrid options from the sword, longbow and shouts The Warrior has access to lots of damage, both direct and condition. They are one of the strongest control classes in the game. I think what the Warrior needs is an option to play that chaos style, similar to how Engineers, Mesmers and Thieves(to an extent) can be played. It is the type of playstyle that is literally defined by its name: chaos! The style where it doesn't really excel in any area in particular but creates lots of problems for the enemy. So this is my Warrior specialization: **Name: Outlaw** *I think this name fits perfectly with both the theme of Heart of Thorns and the target playstyle. Outlaw seems very western to me, very gritty. Personally not a big fan of 'Gunslinger' because really the specialization should be useful even without the new weapon IMO, so that name is too limited.* **New weapon: Pistol** *I've seen the Warrior getting the Pistol idea popping up all over the place and I really agree it could suit the class perfectly and fill the role it needs to. In true Warrior fashion, they will be able to dual-wield of course, if they wish to. As a side note, the Pistol will deal more damage than the Longbow, but less damage than the Rifle. The Pistol will fit a mid range niche, sitting at 900 range. Here are the skills:* * 1(autoattack): Straight Shot: Fire a shot that pierces foes. Bleed foes if they are Vulnerable. * 2: Knee Pop: Shoot your foe in the legs causing Cripple. * 3: Gunpowder Blast: Shoot your foe with a high power shot, causing Vulnerability and Blind. Also Blinds foes near your target. * 4: Pistol-rang: Throw your pistol like a boomerang that bounces off foes and Dazes them.(3 targets) Gain bonus adrenaline per target hit. * 5: Skull Shot: Shoot your foe in the head causing Slow. Stun your foe if they are Blinded. * F1 Burst: Triple-barrel Shot: Shoot your foe with 3 powerful shots. The first shot causes Weakness, the second shot causes knockback, the third shot launches your foe. Launch distance increases the closer you are to your foe. **New profession mechanic: Reload** *This will be the mechanic that will be added as part of the specialization. Instead of removing the current adrenaline/burst, I think the mechanic should work alongside it, and actually work as part of it.* *Basically, the Warrior's new F2 ability would be called Reload. Using Reload will recharge your weapon skills by a certain percentage based on your adrenaline level. Reload will also have a fairly long cast time. 1 bar = 33%, 2 bars = 66%, 3 bars = refresh. So as an example, the Hammer skill Staggering Blow is on cooldown with 12 seconds remaining until it can be used again - if the Warrior uses Reload on 1 bar of adrenaline, the skill will now have 8 seconds of cooldown remaining, 2 bars would be 4 seconds and 3 bars would refresh the skill. Using Reload will effect all weapon skills at the same time.* *As said above, Reload will have a longish cast time. 1 bar = 0.75s, 2 bars = 1.5s, 3 bars = 2.25s. When used the Warrior will display a generic animation no matter what weapon is equipped. Reload can be interrupted like any other skill and successful or not it will deplete all of the current adrenaline. Reload will have a 20 second cooldown upon successful use.* **New trait line: Loadout** *This trait line will replace Discipline so the Warrior will not have access to traits that upgrade both Bursts and Reloads at the same time. Trait line will increase Ferocity and Reload Speed. Reload Speed will be the new profession specific stat that simply decreases the cast time on your Reload - 7% per point spent up to a max of 42%. So for example, a Warrior with a full 6 points in Loadout would have a 42% quicker Reload, so the cast time for a full 3 adrenaline bar Reload would be roughly 1.3 seconds instead of 2.25.* *This trait line will have various traits that affect Reload, Pistols and of course the new utility skills and new elite(s). A few trait examples:* * Restock: Reduces recharge on Reload by 20%. * Sly Shooter: You deal more damage with Pistols and Rifles to foes that are disabled. Increase: 15%. Unfortunately I couldn't really think of a decent utility skill and/or elite skill concept to support this particular idea. I did think of a skill type that would work like a Thief's Venom skills to aid your attack skills further, but it is difficult to justify why or what this would really offer.

One that i've thought myself is when the defiant bar break it removes/increase the condition cap and stacks of vulnerability while the boss is immune to normal attacks at timed intervals, so if you want to have constant dmg you'll have to apply conditions or be smart and time you normal attacks at the right time.

420,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Predictions for the specializations,0,2yuc4d,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2yuc4d/predictions_for_the_specializations/,2015-03-13 08:50:45,"My predictions, with the general idea and then the unique profession mechanics, sans thief who I really can't predict: * **Guardian**: Paragon. No longer having the big focus on protecting themselves, I believe Paragons will be the game's first full-blown support class. Perhaps we might see some ally-targeted skills here, with a bigger focus on consecrations and areas that benefit allies. As for their profession mechanic, I think it will follow the same sort of ideas as virtues but instead be changed to medium-sized (similar to a ranger's Barrage skill) ground-targeted fields instead of a personal skill with a small area of effect if you spec into it. As well as having beneficial effects like might gain and regeneration, enemies caught withing these fields will receive the new effect slow and things like vulnerability. Trait line would replace Virtues and effect the cooldown and duration of these skills. To compliment this, I think they'll gain access to a longbow to make a more viable ranged guardian than the scepter available, where they can buff from afar and not stick to the front lines. * **Revenant** Ritualist. Rather than becoming conduits for their chosen legends, I think Revenants will gain the ability to summon corporeal manifestations of the legends. I think they'll still have the second half of their skill bar governed by the legend they currently have selected, but rather than have the energy bar it returns to the normal cooldown system, albeit with things that require sustained energy use simply having a limited time. When it comes to the unique class mechanic, there will be the opportunity to ""summon"" the legend that will appear as a minion designed to do certain roles depending on the legend. For example, Jalis Ironhammer could have a high health pool and access to skills that taunt the enemies, while Mallyx has an attrition-esque area of effect around him that stacks conditions on enemies. They would work on a cooldown rather than being permanent. I can't speculate on the trait changes, but I can assume the trait line that buffs energy upkeep will be replaced with a trait line that reduces the cooldown on summoning times. We don't know the weapon types of the Revenant yet, but I can only guess at staff. Maybe a melee staff?^please^anet^please * **Warrior** Battlemage. Warriors that specialise in magic, using magic to push themselves to 110%. While this may seem like more of a guardian mechanic, I envision it to be more of a ""magic imbuing physical attacks"" rather than an outright magical attack. So for example using magic to make your punch hit with more physical force, rather than using magic to turn your punch into a hadouken. If we were to remove the adrenaline from a warrior, I think it would be replaced with a ""frenzy"" mode. On a cooldown based system, the frenzy mode would give a flat increase to damage output and give the warrior a higher defense for a short period of time, to allow for even greater burst/tank potential. To compliment this I think the warrior would earn a more ""magical"" weapon. While most people would jump to a damage-dealing weapon like a staff or a scepter, I think a focus would be more appropriate that stacks boons on the warrior. Traits wise, discipline would be replaced by a specialisation specific trait line that would provide a longer frenzy mode to the Battlemage. * **Ranger**: Druid (no surprise there, eh?). While the trailer proved to us that they'll be keeping the pets, I believe pet special attacks will be removed, and there will be much less control available to the user. They would act more like a summoned elemental or minion, and revive themselves out of combat. Pet swap will be removed, the skin would be purely cosmetic and there will be a base armor, dps and health value for ALL pets. Instead of the heavy pet focus, Druids will gain more Nature Magic skills, the Beastmastery trait line will be removed to be replaced by ""Druidry"" or something similar. I think this specialisation will have a much heavier focus on the nature spirits (Sun, Stone etc) and we'll see a lot of buffs given to them, as well as some new spirits. We might potentially see something akin to the Necromancer's Death Shroud but instead turn into a Druid Spirit from GW1 (Oakhearts but ethereal to those that haven't played the first game). The druid would gain new skills, customisable through the trait line. I think the staff will be very CC based, with immobilizes being a big role in the playstyle of the weapon. (Vines = immobilize, right?) * **Engineer**: Technician. While the Engineer is already hell-bent on turning the tide of evil with a toolbelt of gadgets and weapon kits, I think some would want to mobilise their more ""powerful"" gadgets. Namely, the turrets. While turrets are grand for defense and holding an area (e.g. winning Conquest), they are immobile. I think the Technician will be able to choose 3 (judging by the trailer) mobile turrets to follow them, much like ranger pets. Trait payoff would be losing the Tools line to be replaced with the technician line, which passively increases turrets health pool and damage/healing/cooldowns. As we have all guessed, he'll earn the hammer which would be the first proper melee weapon for the engi, allowing his turrets to get up close and personal. Who needs a flamethrower kit when you have a flame tower watching your back at all times? * **Elementalist**: Arcanist, instead of attuning to one of four elements they will instead use ""arcane"" spells, which are more akin to the arcane spells like Arcane Shield or Blast. The skills will still have elemental themes, but much less prevalent than the base elementalist. Traits that react to your current attunement will either be tweaked or removed. (I seem to remember Anet saying that some traits will be locked, as well as whole trait lines?). Instead of the ""arcana"" trait line they will have a new trait line that focuses on the management of the profession mechanic that follows. Whenever they cast a weapon spell they will gain something similar to the warrior's adrenaline, and can then use that power to buff one of their heal/utility skills (e.g. more damage or an extra condition). Possibly available to elite skills at a much higher ""energy"" cost, but I doubt it as they're already buffed. To compliment this, I think the Arcanist will gain access to a sword that has AoE skills that effect the area around the user. * **Necromancer**: (unofficial name) Minion Master! Instead of absorbing the power of death for your own use, harvest the souls of the dead and convert them to your own, greatly boosting the amount of minions on the battlefield and imbuing their power. This specialisation will focus on the Death Magic trait line, doing away with Soul Reaping and converting it into a second line dedicated to reanimating the dead. The Minion Master was SUCH a huge part of GW1, I don't think they can skip out on giving it the justice is sorely needs as, let's face it, minions are useless in GW2. Working on a mechanic slightly similar to the Mesmer's clones, I think that the Necromancer will still gain power from the enemies that he kills, but instead channel that power into creating more and more minions. Skills F1-4 will each correspond to a different minion type (e.g. Vampiric, Fiend, Shambling and Bone Horror?), and the necromancer will expend the energy from felled foes to create minions that last for a limited time. The trait line will focus on buffing these minions, which will be seperate from the ones created with the utility skills. I think the GS will be a purely DPS focused weapon, giving the necromancer the tools that it has been sorely lacking to burst down enemies to fuel its army of corpses. * **Mesmer**: Chronomancer. Remember that clockface-esque skill we saw in the trailer? Remember that scrapped profession from GW:Utopia? Remember the Mesmer primary attribute from GW1, Fast Casting? I reckon Mesmers are about to get a whole lot quicker. Deriving directly from GW1, the Mesmer was able to spec itself to shave enormous amounts of time from long casting times, and I think we'll be seeing a return of that. A bar of energy that gets charged every time a mesmer casts a spell, and begins to drain when they stop. This bar would cut down cast times the higher it went, allowing the mesmer to crank out those skills faster and faster the longer the battle rages. And what comes as a result of speed? Chaos. I think we'll see a lot more from the chaos trait line at the expense of the Illusion traits, and the mesmer will be focused on throwing out boons and conditions every which way. The shield? Creating fields of slow and quickness. Please feel free to reply with your thoughts. Reposted this form a comment I made a few days ago, thought it could make for a half-decent thread."
421,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Thief Specialisation Concept/Idea: The Saboteur,4,2zdfwy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2zdfwy/thief_specialisation_conceptidea_the_saboteur/,2015-03-18 04:47:47,"I've been playing with the idea of Thief getting Rifle as its extra weapon, considering that Thief is the only profession that has a maximum weapon range under 1200 (1050 with traited Pistols). That alone leads me to believe Rifle is the most likely, as I can't see Longbow being introduced instead. However, I found the idea of just being a sniper incredibly boring. I wanted the specialisation that comes along with it to really shake up the way that the profession would play, bringing Rifle with it (with the potential for some sniping in there). Going the firearms + explosive route, I've tried to be as careful as possible to diversify it away from anything too Engineer-esque. Let me know what you think and try to ignore numbers or specific combos of bonus conditions etc. it's mostly just random stuff I've thrown in there to give an idea. **Synopsis** The Saboteur is a specialisation that focuses on firearms and explosive sabotage. Steal is no longer a thing for the Saboteur  instead, they have access to four types of explosive charges that can be planted either on the ground or directly on an unsuspecting target who would be carrying it around without realising the danger to themselves or their allies. These charges do not have timers  they are detonated remotely when the Saboteur chooses (though getting too far away or waiting too long will expend the signal and the charges will become duds). Saboteurs lose the Trickery trait line and gain access to the Sabotage traitline, which increases the effectiveness of charges and how they are used. **Rifle** I'm going to give credit where it's due  Zacchary on the GW2 forums came up with the base skillset a while ago, I've just made a couple of changes here. Damage calculated = 2000 power x 1265 weapon strength)/2597 armor x skill coefficient *1) Versatile Shot (0 initiative)* Prepare and fire your next round  your choice of round is dictated by the range of your target.  Bird Shot (1/2s) Fire a cloud of Bird Shot to damage enemies near you, making them Vulnerable. Damage: 146 x2 Range: 400 2 Vulnerability: 6s  Pot Shot (3/4s) Given a little more time to prepare, fire a stronger round that has a chance to bounce. Damage: 390 Range: 401-800 Chance to Bounce: 50% Maximum Bounces: 3  Cover Fire (3/4s) Support your allies from a distance with concentrated, precise gunfire. Damage: 487 Range: 801-1200 *Incapacitate (0 initiative)* Stealth Attack. Shatter your target's kneecap, crippling and slowing them from the agony. Damage: 536 Range: 1200 Cripple: 8s Slow: 3s *2) Drill Shot (4 initiative) (1s)* Shoot a piercing round designed to penetrate armor. Damage: 649 Ignored Toughness: 400 Range: 1200 Pierces *3) Shadow Retreat (3 initiative) (1/2s)* Pack up your things and shadowstep directly away from your target. Range: 600  Double Take (3 initiative) (1/4s) Shadowstep back to your original location, leaving some surprise Caltrops at your previous location in the process. Cripple: 4s Range: 1200 *4) Ghillie Suit (5 initiative)* Go prone and blend in to your environment. Initiative regeneration stops. Movement and skills break camouflage. Initiative Drain: 1 per second Camouflage: 2s Camouflage: 1s per initiative spent *5) Aim (7 initiative)* Kneel down and line up your shot to your target's vitals. Initiative regeneration stops. Moving or casting other skills breaks your concentration. Initiative: 1 per second  Snipe (0 initiative) Fire your well-aimed shot. Gains range and power for time spent using Aim. Automatically fires when Initiative is drained completely. Damage: 974 Range: 1200 Bonus damage: 2% per initiative (up to 10) Bonus range: 150 per initiative (up to 750) Bonus critical chance: 2% per initiative (up to 10) **Charges** Charges have icons similar to breach charges you see used to blow out doors/walls. They are used in 2 different ways, depending on the state of your target. If you do not have a target, or the target is not in range, you will plant them on the floor at your location. If you have a target and they are in range, you will attempt to plant it directly on to that target, meaning that the detonation will centre around their location at the time of use. They are undetectable until the time of detonation, where a short delay will display an icon for that charge on the target or on the ground with a loud audible double beep before it explodes. If a charge has been planted directly on to a living target, the effect will be unblockable for that target only. *F1) Composition E (25s cooldown)* Plant an explosive charge that will interrupt and deal damage to your enemies. Range: 130  Detonate (1/4s) Detonate your planted charge. Damage: 702 Daze: 1/4s Radius: 240 *F2) Composition M (35s cooldown)* Plant an explosive charge that will expel corrosive gas on detonation. Range: 130  Detonate Detonate your planted charge, leaving the gas to affect foes each second. Damage: 401 Corrosive Gas Duration: 5 seconds Poison: 5s Weakness: 3s Blind: 5s Combo Field: Smoke Radius: 240 *F3) Composition X (50s cooldown)* Plant an explosive charge made up of a slew of dangerous alchemical materials. Range: 130  Detonate (1/2s) Detonate your charge, causing a number of possible alchemical anomalies that ripple throughout the area, affecting foes and sometimes allies. Each anomaly can occur a maximum of twice and never twice in a row. Damage per pulse: 87 Anomaly duration: 5 seconds Slow: 3s 2 Confusion: 6s Daze: 1s Chilled: 2s Quickness: 3s Aegis: 3s Swiftness: 5s Resistance: 3s Combo Field: Ethereal Radius: 240 *F4) Composition P (1s) (70s cooldown)* Plant an enormous payload that requires a larger charge time to prepare and detonate. Range: 130  Detonate (1s) Detonate your payload, flattening the target and sending everything else away with immense force. Damage: 804 Knockdown: 3s Launch: 600 **New Utility Type: Contacts** Contacts are NPC allies that appear to assist you similar to Ambush and Thieves' Guild. In fact, while you are a Saboteur, both Ambush and Thieves' Guild are classified as Contact-type skills and thus benefit from traits and other bonuses that affect Contacts. They all take and deal appropriate amounts of damage eg. Ambush hits fairly hard but dies quite quickly, Swindler barely hurts at all but is quite tanky etc. *Ambush (1s) (60s cooldown)* Contact. Designate an area for your contact to ambush passing foes with Dagger/Pistol. Daze: 1s Weakness: 5s Blind: 5s Radius: 600 Duration: 20 seconds  Rush Command your contact to finish the job, smashing the opponent across the face and knocking them out before leaving. Knockdown: 2s Range: 130 *Swindler (1s) (60s cooldown)* Contact. Summon a contact that will attempt to steal boons with Sword/Dagger and share them with allies. Immobilise: 1/2s Cripple: 5s Boons removed: 2 Duration: 20 seconds  Plant Command your contact to plant conditions from nearby allies to its target before leaving. Conditions removed: 3 Range: 130 *Duelist (1s) (75s cooldown)* Contact. Summon a slippery duelist who will damage targets from range with various types of ammunition. Bleeding: 3s Chill: 3s Poison: 5s 3 Torment: 5s Range: 900 Duration: 20 seconds  Tag Team (15s cooldown) Swap places with your Duelist via Shadowstep. Range: 1200 Breaks stun *Undercover (1s) (90s cooldown)* Contact. Summon a medically trained Thief who will Stealth and assist downed allies. Stealth: 3s Regeneration: 5s Range: 1200 Smoke Bomb Radius: 240  Shadow Puppet Your contact uses shadow magic to take control of a downed ally's body, bringing them to their feet to fight back for a period of time. Fully revives the target ally if they kill a foe. Increases cooldown of Undercover to 120s. Shadow Puppet: Temporarily alive (15s) *Thieves' Guild (1s) (240s cooldown)* Contact. Call more Thieves to support you in combat. Calls an Ambush, Swindler and Duelist without secondary effects. **Traits** These are only examples, not direct placement/structures. I have suggested what tier some would be, however. Rifle traits credited to Zacchary again. Dark Rounds: Rifle attacks have a 33% chance to inflict Blind. 10s cooldown. (Master) Ankle Shots (revamp): Pistol and Rifle crits have a 60% chance to Cripple for 3s. 10s cooldown. Sprint: +25% movement speed in combat while using a Rifle. (Master) Steady Breathing: 10% damage with rifles. Activation time for rifles skills are increased by 1/4s. Ghillie Suit and Snipe have a 20% chance to not drain initiative each tick. (Master) Target Acquired: Targets that take damage from your traps become marked for 5 seconds. The next rifle attack deals 10% more damage. (Adept) High-powered Scope: Increase Rifle range to 1500. Decrease range bonus to 100 per initiative spent while Snipe is active. (Master) Fine Print: Contacts will hang around for 10 more seconds, and cooldowns are reduced by 20%. (Master) Mob Mentality: Endurance regeneration increased by 50% for all nearby allies while a Contact is active (Adept) Security: Contacts have increased health and armor. (Adept) Extra Shrapnel: Charges also apply Vulnerability with each pulse or hit (5s) (Adept) Expert Demolitionist: Charges have 20% reduced cooldowns and will not show a visual indicator before detonating (Master) Daring: Using a charge while a target is out of point-blank range will cause you to shadowstep to them and the attempt to plant will be made (Grandmaster). Range: 1200"

Enchanter keeps the usual attunements from the normal Elementalist, but receives a mechanical upgrade to how they function. First, what Enchanters would lose: - The Arcana traitline (presumably what happens to all Specialisations eg Thief loses Trickery, Ranger loses Beastmastery) - One set of utility skills (I'm thinking Conjures or Glyphs) - The use of Scepter (Enchanter is more martial-focused and I guessed that Specialisations would maybe lock out a weapon. This doesn't have to happen, though) In exchange, the Enchanter gains: - The use of Sword in the main hand. Without any particular skills in mind, this weapon would hold its own without as much requirement for attunement swapping. Focus on mobility, short blocks and an evade or two. Intended for very aggressive, frontline gameplay. - A new utility set, Wards. These were part of GW1 Elementalists that you can look up on the wiki. They are kind of like Wells that serve very different purposes. There would be a healing Ward and an Elite Ward to go with this. **Enchantments** Unlike the regular Elementalist that gets chucked in to an attunement as soon as you press the skill button, Enchanters are able to hold the attunement button to charge that attunement. Doing so grants group-wide buffs depending on how long you have charged for before you release it. There are 3 stages to an Enchantment (the first being instantly upon swapping), and speccing in to the unique traitline (Enchantments) will reduce the time it takes to complete the charge. When you release your attunement, you and your allies will have their weapons coated in the chosen element along with respective bonuses. These bonuses range from not only buffs to allies but offensive applications as well. Stage 2 is tough to reach in chaotic situations, and getting interrupted will put that attunement on full cooldown. You will likely be prioritised in a team fight. You are able to move while charging, but standing still to charge your weapon would look a little like [this](URL Some examples of bonuses (concept level, not set in stone or theory-crafted): **Fire** Instant: You and your allies will inflict 1 second of burn with each hit for the duration. Stage 1: In addition, each hit will grant a stack of Might and you are granted a Fire Aura. Stage 2: Even further, each hit will grant 3 stacks of Might and you all receive the effects of the Superior Sigil of Fire (chance for an AoE fire blast on crits). Upon release, send a wave of fire in front of you that deals more damage the closer a target is. **Water** Instant: You and your allies receive a small duration of Regeneration and each hit will heal you for a small amount while applying Vulnerability. Stage 1: In addition to a second stack of Vulnerability and extended Regeneration, each hit will also cause 1 second of Chill. Stage 2: Upon release, a large burst of healing will occur to your allies (rough equivalent of a Geyser) and you will all gain Frost Aura. **Air** Instant: You and your allies gain Swiftness and each hit has a chance to apply some Weakness. Stage 1: In addition, attacks are under the effect of Superior Sigil of Air (the same way as Fire), while the chance to apply Weakness is increased. Stage 2: Further, you all gain Super Speed instead of Swiftness and a burst of Haste. Upon release, foes near anyone affected are blinded. **Earth** Instant: You and your allies gain a short amount of Protection and your hits have a chance to apply bleeding. Stage 1: In addition, your hits will now also apply cripple as well as a higher chance to cause bleeding and a small chance of applying Torment. Duration of Protection is also increased. Stage 2: Duration of Protection increased massively. All allies will now also receive Magnetic Aura. Upon release, launch adjacent foes (Churning Earth's ending animation would work for this). **The Enchantments traitline** Yeah, some of this stuff is most likely on broken levels in practise (remember, concept!), so we can chuck the stronger things like Haste or the big Might stacking in to the traitline, perhaps as a Grandmaster or Master. The unique effect of this line would be to reduce the time it takes to charge an attunement rather than reduce the cooldown of attuning itself. The actual traits can not only attach the more powerful effects to each attunement but can also apply different bonuses to the act of charging eg. take less damage while charging or whatever. Putting aside balance, I'm sure the general idea has been put across!"
425,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[Guide] How to play Elementalist underwater,43,2vz91p,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2vz91p/guide_how_to_play_elementalist_underwater/,2015-02-16 03:08:17,"So recently I have seen a lot of HoTW records and it is disappointing to see elementalists not utilizing fresh air or high damage burst skills, if used effectively the elementalist has very good under water damage So we start with the traits 66200, this will allow for fresh air and persisting flames, two very important traits in this build for fury stacking and consistent damage. You will also want internal fire, burning precision, bolt to the heart, air training and stone splinters. In Fire attunement your skill 2 is a fire field and does good damage over time. In Water attunement your skill 2 is a projectile which does decent damage and heavy damage on detonation, much like Napalm on engineer. Skill 3 in water is also heavy damage, detonate in the same way, it is also a blast finisher. Skill 5 in water is your heaviest damage skill in water providing the boss is near a wall or an object, you can sink bosses to the ground and face towards the floor if the boss is not near an object, use it in the same way which you would use FGS 4 in the past. In air attunement your auto attack is very good damage, you also want to be using auto attack on this attunement, also skill 2 is moderate damage as well as providing vulnerability. Skill 4 can be used as a rupt, skill 3 as a gap closer and skill 5 is a static field, but hard to position effectively. In earth attunement skill 2 is good damage, skill 4 is a decent sink (2 seconds) and skill 5 is a blind, useful on the end boss in HoTW p3 to blind the jellyfish detonate. Your elite is useful at times when you can't get very close to a foe for example the hotw p2 boss without getting rekt by his auto attacks, it also has good aoe and a pull, you should use the utils in the video. The other skills are less useful and not worth using the vast majority of the time. Essentially you want to utilize the auto attack damage in air attunement, with the burst skills in other attunements, thanks for reading and here is a visual guide: URL "
426,vulnerability,Guildwars2,My 4 year-old's Engie build. (better than expected),176,2w2uft,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2w2uft/my_4_yearolds_engie_build_better_than_expected/,2015-02-17 01:40:17,"I often play GW2 with my 4 year old son sitting on my lap. He loves it and often asks to play ""Gill-bor-bors"" he is allowed to press the jump button whenever he wants to and also press F the many many times this game wants you to press it. He also knows to press 1 A LOT. I generally handle the other buttons though recently he discovered where W is and relishes running me off cliffs or into lava. His favorite class is Engineer because of the flamethrower. He essentially wants to just sit on flamethrower and press 1 whether enemies are in front of us or not. I've recently gotten him interested in the rifle too because it shoots nets and your character makes a crazy screaming sound when you use jump shot. Anet should know that he is very disappointed in the cooldown on both of those skills. His second favorite thing is setting thing on fire and any skill that causes an explosion. So I had to design a build that maximizes burning and explosions and still lets you sit on Flamethrower most of the time. The key is to spam F3 and F4 and walk backwards enough to take advantage of bunker down. This build has shockingly high burst potential which is helpful when your energy is usually drained from dodging to produce bombs (explosions are more important than well timed dodges). If you have an engineer alt give it a try it is shockingly fun to play. He calls her ""Purple Fire Lady"" URL The build: Max explosions and flamethrower: URL EDIT: I forgot to point out a couple of alternate builds: Perma swiftness/vigor: URL Modified Amunition version with near meta levels of Vulnerability: URL"
427,vulnerability,Guildwars2,What are some LFG/party tips you guys would like to share?,4,2wro7s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2wro7s/what_are_some_lfgparty_tips_you_guys_would_like/,2015-02-23 03:07:09,"* Be careful when you use ""exp"" in your LFG because some people read it as **exp**erience while others read it as **exp**loration * Also be careful when you use ""experience"" in your LFG because it can also mean many things to other people. One example is that the person may have completed the specific dungeon path BUT the person may not know the ins and outs of the path. A second example would be a rusty player that hasn't played in a long time but would like to catch up to the meta or relearn the specific dungeon path. * Some players interprets speed runs as only skipping mobs/content (not killing mobs ASAP), which explains why you may see the lack of might, fury, or vulnerability or they might not even stack might, fury, vulnerability at all or even use food or utility. Hence why you may see people use soldier equipment in so called ""speed runs"". * Always be nice to other players in your party because that may open up communication between you and your party members and, from my experience, communication leads to a much better run. Never point fingers or increase the tension of other players because that may cause them to make more mistakes or you may get anarchist type of players where they will do the opposite of what you or the party wants to do. Another thing to add is that being an asshole may even increase the chances of you being kicked from the party, so don't be one of those players. * If you're looking for people that are willing to communicate you can use something like ""P1 - Name your favorite animal"" in your LFG. * If you notice that a player is struggling then you should try to whisper tips to them instead of going out loud in party chat because that makes it look like you're pointing fingers. * If you're asking for berserker you may get people with berserker armor with tanky runes, so be specific on what you want.

So I'd like to hear what people play with outside of Zerker, and talk about the merits of that trade off. I'll start with a few of my favorite stats. ASSASSINS MESMER: Probably the least departure from Berserkers possible, the Assassin's Mesmer is arguably more optimal, and in my opinion, a lot more fun. Your minor drop in Power can easily be made up for with increased triggering of Strength Sigil, giving you a passable self source of Might. Your reflects are noticeably more nukelike, which really plays to Mesmers balance of control and DPS, and on-crit food rounds out your build synergy, providing life steal or more Might. Your phantasms with their perma-fury also greatly benefit from this setup. SINISTER ENGINEER: Condition damage has become of increasing importance in the post-release content, which can be greatly assisted with dedicated condi teams, being near necessary in Triple Trouble for clearing Husks, and in the Silverwastes. Engineer has a great deal of condition potential, with Shrapnel and Incendiary Powder both applying condis. Extra Precision can be helpful with this setup, with Assassins Trinkets being a good option.with proper traiting, you will still be applying crazy vulnerability to your targets, and can be useful in almost any setting. CELESTIAL ELEMENTALIST: This is a great setup for world completion and party support in more relaxed dungeon groups. It mitigates Elementalists innate squishiness very nicely, and encourages self sufficiency."

But with the latest changes the party often achieves 25 stack of vulnerability even without a engi present. Meaning that a engi doesn't have to stack that much vulnerability anymore. So my questions is if the max vuln. build is also the build with a maximal dps output or might there be something stronger? If it is the former, might there be slight changes to traits and bufffood?"

EVERY TIME YOU DO TREAHERNE KILLS A KITTEN, OR A PUPPY IF YOU LIKE PUPPIES BETTER!!!** Do you want to play a game? Of course you do! So I've come up with a little game. Wouldn't it be fun to dream up new weapon choices (out of the current weapons!!!!!!!) for different professions? TRICK QUESTION OF COURSE ITS FUN!!!!!! So here's the deal. Your job is to make a post detailing which weapon, and which profession should get it. You gotta tell us what the weapon skills are!!! THOSE ARE THE RULES! But just like in middle school you're gonna have to explain why. So you cant just show up and be all ""warrior pistol"" without telling us what the skills are, and why it should have those skills Whoever can make the best post will be awarded with... uh... KARMA (on reddit) and like, a cookie and hug or something. so lets see your ideas!!!! I'll start. Thief: off-hand sword 4) Quivering Blade. 3 initiative. grants 2 seconds of fury. deals 15% additional damage to disabled targets(knocked dow,.launched,stunned,dazed, etc) 5) Counter Attack. 5 initiative Block the next attack, stunning enemies in front of you (.5s) -&gt; Sequence. stop blocking, blinding enemies near you.(4s) 3) S/S Blades of steel. 3 initiative Spin around, damaging enemies around you (5 max) and applying vulnerability (2 stacks, 5s) 3) P/S Put Down. 4 initiative. attack with your sword, crippling the target(5s) following up with an aimed shot at the enemy (1s cast time) that does more damage the closer you are to the target (instead maybe higher crit chance?) 3) D/S Flashing Blades. 4 initiative. attack twice with your weapons, gaining 1 second of retaliation for each eneymy hit with your dagger (max 2) and 1s of protection for each enemy hit by your sword (max 3) So, why these? well first off I felt that thieves would best be served gaining a new offhand rather than a mainhand because of dual skills, you get more bang for your buck with an offhand (3 DS skills plus something different than stealth weapon and control weapon) than with a main hand (2 new DS skills). with sword winning out over torch (a possible condition weapon) since it would make a bit more sense. The idea behind the 4 and 5 skills are to bring the sword in as a cleaving weapon, much like the mainhand, but be a middle ground between the offense of */d and the control of */p, being more of a personal defensive weapon with some bite. the 4 skill is able to combo off the 5's stun, or promote weapon combos by using a dagger offhand to stealth, swap to s/s (for example) to stealth attack, then 4, or usign scorp wire or tripwire to get a few hits in to build fury, then proceed to attack with the other moves. the 5 offers an on demand block which is pretty fitting for a thief, being evasive and tricky with the kick stun a flavorful way to bring some dirty fighting into the game. the dual skills are a bit different s/s is to fulfill the ""dervish"" and ""swashbuckler"" fantasies while adding more AOE options to melee for thieves, the kit consisting of an entrance, a hard hitting AOE move, a potentially hard hitting move if used right, and a defensive block move. basically a way to make a more aggressive control thief, giving up some control of s/p P/S idea is to make pistol 2 more exciting to use, being able to lock them down for a devastating execution shot (2-&gt;3) and to enable a sort of ""melee ranged"" build, where p/d is more of a switch hitter and elusive, this is more in your face version of pistol, kind of like a pirate D/S is a bit more subtle, very similar in concept to d/p, it loses some chase potential in 1 on 1 but hopes to makes up for in small scale engagements. the idea was to create a weapon set that would reward thieves who like to get into the middle of a fight to focus down a target, the 5 skill stunning the intended target whenever anyone hit them, and stacking prot and retal when cleaving, still giving the devastating attacks backstab and heartseeker to the thief Please please PULEASE post some weapon set ideas, I would love to see what others brainstorm"
433,vulnerability,Guildwars2,[Guide] Dungeon running for beginners,87,2smj8m,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2smj8m/guide_dungeon_running_for_beginners/,2015-01-17 00:22:44,"**Note:**This is a starter guide for players looking to get into running dungeons with a group. See the bottom of this post for useful links. It is focused on the current berserker meta. If you are not comfortable with this playstyle and/or dont find it fun, speed clearing dungeons is not the way to go for you. This is for people who want to get through the dungeons as fast as possible for gold, loot and tokens. But where do you start? How do you gear? **Overall tips** * *Get a guild!* Its generally more fun to play with like-minded people. They can also help you learn the mechanics of the dungeon. Find a guild that is suitable to your playstyle. Avoid pugging (via the LFG tool) at first, especially when you dont know the dungeons very well. * *Communicate well, stay friendly and be open-minded!* Always tell people up front if you are not (very) familiar with the dungeon. Ask guild-mates to teach you. Dont be afraid to ask questions. Do not get mad if you fail or if they tell you to do things differently. Now that you have a guild you can prepare your character. Keep in mind that dungeon running is all about DPS (Damage Per Second). There is not a single hybrid build that generates better results than a DPS build in terms of speed clearing. **Class and build** * *Pick a class you are comfortable with.* Any class will do, but keep in mind that some are easier or more useful than others. I will give a small overview of the classes and their roles in dungeons below. Optional: play an Asura, because youre cool like that. * *Get a decent build.* The easiest way to do that is to go to URL and check out their dungeon builds. They have some gear info as well. * Get to lvl 80 and get full exotic Berserkers gear, preferably with ascended accessories. There is no other option (except Assassins in some cases). It is not worth it to get Ascended armor for the DPS increase. Scholar runes are generally the best runes, but new players might want to start out with cheaper runes with easier bonuses to maintain (scholar runes are only superior if you can keep your health above 90%). Runes of the Ranger are decent and, at time of writing, the 6th rune bones can be maintained with a mini-pet (check comments or wiki if this is fixed). * *Weapons and sigils*: Night + Force for night dungeons, Force + something else (like 10% vs X) for day dungeons. If you cannot afford more than one weapon set, make sure it works in all dungeons (e.g. take force and frailty). Make sure to have all the sets you need (see below for a brief overview). * *CONSUMABLES!* Many people forget this. Get the 10% potions for ALL dungeons (e.g. the Powerful Potion of Undead Slaying). There are no alternatives, just get them. Food is just as important, but high DPS food is expensive, so you can also get the cheaper variant, like plates of steak and asparagus. Try not to rely too much on health on crit food, like the Omnomberry Pie. It makes you lazy and is quite a DPS loss. Might be good starter food when youre still learning, however. Being alive is more DPS than being dead. :) There are other consumables, which are just as useful: Harpy Feathers (URL are useful for skipping mobs, while the [Pot of Hylek Poison](URL can give you access to more swiftness. A [rock](URL is a situational consumable, which can strip defiance off of foes, or keep foes without defiance knocked down. * *Get familiar with the build.* This means that you know the DPS rotation, which skills to bring where, when to swap weapons or traits, etc. Other people have already made very extensive guides on these topics. Check out the guys from DnT on Youtube: Brazil, Nike, DEkeyz and Obal, check out the written guides on [Dulfy](URL or find posts here on Reddit. There are many in-depth vids and written guides of popular meta builds. * *Get familiar with the dungeons.* You can find videos on Youtube or written guides on the wiki and sites like URL *but the best way is to jump in with friends who can teach you.* **List of glossary used in dungeons** * Pinging skills: People often ping skills (CTRL + click on the skill) in the party-chat. It often means that they are going to execute the skill and that you should pay attention. If a thief pings Shadow Refuge, you should stay close to him and make sure to stand in it. Sometimes people ping skills at the start of the dungeon, to let others know what they plan on bringing. If you have two warriors, e.g., one might ping Banner of Discipline, implying that you should bring Banner of Strength. * Stack: Refers to all players stacking on each other, often in a corner or against a wall, to pull all the foes. * Stack might: Refers to stacking might by using blast finisher skills in fire fields. While elementalists often deploy the fire fields, it is advised to help them by blasting yourself as well (warrior and ranger #5, popping banners, etc.) * Guardian skills: Almost all guardian skills are abbreviated. SYG means ""Stand Your Ground"", SY means ""Save Yourselves"", etc. * AA: Auto-attack, skill #1. * Burning the boss: refers to unleashing all your wrath to take out foes as quickly as possible. * SR: Shadow Refuge * Bow: The Ice Bow utility skill from the elementalist. Used for the skills #4 (Ice Storm) and 5 (Deep Freeze). One normally freezes a boss before attacking it. * CC: Crowd Control. Skills that push, daze, stun, etc. Often used to strip bosses of defiance. For those of you who are interested, here is an overview of the professions and their roles in dungeons. It is advised to try to get familiar with *several* professions. This has three advantages: you know how other professions work and therefore know what to expect from your teammates, you can switch on the fly if your team needs another profession and farming dungeons might become less tedious. * **Warrior.** This used to be the most popular choice for dungeons, but has fallen from its pedestal somewhat. Its not the most popular class anymore, but is still very useful in dungeons. Every team has at least one warrior for Banners of Strength and Discipline. You can either go Phalanx Strength + Empower Allies (PS build) or full DPS greatsword, depending on what your party needs. You need at least a greatsword, an axe, a mace, a warhorn, a sword and a longbow. Equip sword/horn + gs for skipping mobs. Know when to pop your banners, so that they are off cooldown at the right time. Quickly swap to horn for swiftness when out of combat. * **Elementalist.** The King of DPS at the moment. The Elementalist is quite a complex profession because of the many skills it has. The highest DPS build (and easiest to learn) is a staff build, which focuses on keeping up lava font (fire #2) permanently. This build is only the best DPS if your team has some other way of keeping might up (like a PS warrior or other elementalist). Scepter builds are better at might stacking. Focus has amazing utility in Swirling Winds. Keep in mind that you are extremely squishy (lowest health pool + armor in the game). You need at least one of every weapon, and almost any weapon combination is useful somewhere. * **Guardian.** Very useful class to have in a party, but hard to play right. Access to blocks, blinds, stability and reflects are the guardians specialty, but most skills have long cooldowns, so it is important to know what to use and when to use it. Its mostly played with GS + sword/focus. Make sure to have a scepter, a hammer and a staff as well. Dont use Empower with the staff: the might will override other (longer) might stacks. Keep in mind that you are the key supporter of the team, but that doesnt mean that you should go full tank. A DPS guard can deal insane damage. This profession requires a lot of knowledge of the profession and the dungeon to play effectively. * **Thief.** Useful utility class with good DPS. Can either go sword/pistol + shortbow or dagger/dagger + shortbow. The SB is mainly for blasting in smoke fields for AoE stealth. You can skip entire fights if you know how and where to blast stealth or pop Shadow Refuge. For single-target bosses, the D/D has superior DPS over S/P. Switching between two sets is most optimal, but only if youre fast enough to switch traits accordingly. Staying S/P is easier, because you have access to Blinding Powder to stealth and blind. As with the elementalist: you are very squishy. * **Mesmer.** Reflects and Timewarp are the main assets of the mesmer. Interestingly, the DPS of this class largely depends on your knowledge of phantasms and the boss' mechanics. If your phantasms are constantly killed, your DPS is terrible. Good mesmers have to constantly switch traits to get the optimal DPS, which makes it a hard class to learn. E.g., when you don't need reflection, it's useless to trait for it. Get at least two swords, a focus, a GS and a pistol. * **Engineer.** This class got some anti-meta hate in the beginning of the game, but look whos laughing now! The grenadier engi is one of the best DPS builds available. It has superior vulnerability stacking and decent might stacking capabilities. You will mostly play a rifle. Dont spam your grenades mindlessly; some grenades have lower DPS than the auto-attack and the poison grenades can override other more useful combo fields. You have access to an insane amount of skills. Learn as much as you can. Youll even find that the engi can stack stealth quite decently. * **Ranger.** The ranger is a victim of bad reputation. The Bearbow is infamous and just as terrible as it sounds. Luckily, after the longbow buff, rangers got more use in dungeons! Theres not a lot of build variation: play LB + sword/axe. Open with Barrage and Rapid fire to stack vulnerability, and switch to sword to auto-attack until everything is dead. Note that the auto-attack of the sword prevents you from moving when executing the last two attacks of the chain. Make sure to keep your Frost Spirit alive and bring feline pets for max DPS. A horn can be used to swift your party and as a blast finisher, while the greatsword is nice for skipping mobs. IMPORTANT: micromanage your pet! Many rangers forget this. Your pet might aggro, fuck up stealth runs, etc. And keep your bear at home, of course. :) * Last, and sadly also least, the **Necromancer.** There is no niche for the Necromancer to fill in dungeon teams. Decent DPS, but no reliable blasts and the useful skills, like wells, are on a long cooldown and provide useless combo fields. Theyre not entirely useless: you can still bring a Necro as a DPS class in your team, but there are sadly just always better options out there. Pray to Grenth for a good update for PvE necros.

434,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Adding set bonuses for build diversity,0,2t5187,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2t5187/adding_set_bonuses_for_build_diversity/,2015-01-21 16:01:41,"With rumors of an expansion, I thought it might be fun to share some ideas of how to enhance the game's build diversity without nerfing the meta - there will always be an optimal set-up, right? Adding a set bonus for armor with a majority of one primary attribute: **PvE only** because balancing PvP is scary. **Power:** *Strong Arms* - Cleaving and AoE attacks affect 1 additional target. I didn't want to directly make beserker builds stronger, but I wanted the set bonus to somehow thematically work; big muscles mean you can hit more people? **Precision:** *Accurate Applications* - Able to critically apply boons that last twice the duration. Having an assassin's Elementalist could result in longer might stacking and less of a need to reapply. Triple the duration of boons with a Signet of Inspiration? **Toughness:** *Exposed Weakness* - Enemies targeting you take 15% more damage from your allies. I didn't want to make a tanky build even tankier (and I don't know much about aggro mechanics), but to thematically make sense I figured enemies focusing on you will not see blows coming from other party members. Utility professions might benefit from this - they still can provide their utility/reflects/blocks/aegis while losing personal DPS and increasing party DPS. **Vitality:** *Second Wind* - Increase your damage by 2% (max of 10%) for every 30 seconds you remain in combat. I was having trouble thinking of something to work here. My thoughts are that having a large health pool means you have lots of stamina so you don't tire out over the course of a battle - instead of everyone else losing damage over time, just increase your own over time. **Condition Damage:** *Traumatic Wounds* - Intensity stacking conditions have additional effects: My attempt at fixing the condition cap problem. Take this with a grain of salt since I won't even claim to know much about the mechanics involved here. Bleed - Deal 75% of total damage as a burst when you apply past the condition cap. Confusion - Each stack of confusion you apply gives a 2% chance to cause a glancing blow. Torment - Every stack of torment you apply gives a .5% chance to interrupt an action, ignoring defiance. Vulnerability - Vulnerability you apply when capped grants might (20s) instead. **Ferocity:** *Honed Anger* - Your 1 skill deals 5% more damage when not critically hitting. Ferocity! You're always angry! Your basic attacks are like mini-criticals. Might be useless if you manage to get 100% critical chance. **Healing Power:** *Merciful Tactics* - Applying a heal adds 1 second to every boon currently applied. I definitely ran out of ideas for this one. I didn't want to make healing power turn into damage, because it didn't fit thematically for me. Maybe a healing power Engineer with healing bombs to extend might stacks indefinitely? I mostly just shared these ideas for fun, so the numbers aren't thought out much. I had the idea that set bonuses would be determined from the majority stat in your armor - 4 pieces of assassin's and 2 of beserker would apply only the assassin set bonus. It might be fun to also set tiers like there are in rune bonuses, but I feared it would detriment those who min/max stats by mixing armor up (tier 6 bonuses are usually too good to pass up). Oh, and please don't make fun of my skill naming, haha."

436,vulnerability,Guildwars2,Elementalist Specialization Idea: Arcanist,1,2u21a0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2u21a0/elementalist_specialization_idea_arcanist/,2015-01-29 17:21:13,"I was thinking about where Anet could take the Elementalist without removing that unique feel for playing Elementalist  having a wide array of abilities at your disposal to really react to the situation and your needs right there in combat. After a little bit of thinking, I present the Arcanist. Taking influence from Magicka and Dota 2s Invoker, I envision an Elementalist that replaces attunements with formulaically created spells by mixing their elements. The Elementalist will no longer have elemental attunements. Their weapon spells are replaced by one new ability in the first slot and an ability for fire, water, air, and earth in the last four slot. The elemental abilities will be the first slot ability for that weapon for that element. For example: Scepter/Dagger will gain a new scepter 1 ability then Flame Strike, Ice Shards, Lightning Whip, and Impale. Any elemental ability with a cast time of more than 1 second will be pushed down to one second. The Arcanist will lose the ability to wield a focus and instead can wield a sword in either hand. Replacing the Attunements will be two pieces of UI: F1-F4 abilities and three empty circles above it. As you cast any elemental abilities, one of the circles will display that element  starting from left to right, the circles will fill one at a time. Casting more elemental abilities when the circles are filled will not change the circles. When all three circles are filled the Arcanist can use F1-F4 to expend them. F1-F4 will be named Arcane Prism, Arcane Renewal, Arcane Prodigy, and Arcane Boon (named after GW1 Energy Storage Elites). When activated, each Arcane Spell will act similarly no matter the elements stored in the circle, however the effect that the Arcane Spells ultimately has depends on the elements stored. There is a cooldown for Arcane Spells, similar to attunement swapping cooldowns. Arcane Prism will always damage the target and the four enemies nearest the target within a range. Without a target, Arcane Prism will simply damage five enemies nearest the Arcanist within a range. * Arcane Renewal will always heal the Arcanist for a small amount and create a blast finish at the Arcanists location. * Arcane Prodigy will always deal high damage to the target. * Arcane Boon will always create a beneficial AoE at the target area. Each type of Arcane Spell will be modified by the elements in the circles  each circle modifying the spell differently based on element: * The first circle dictates the element of the Arcane Spell  fire will cause burning or might, water will cause vulnerability or regeneration, air will do cause blindness or swiftness, earth will cause bleeding or protection. * The second circle dictates the AoE of the Arcane Spell  fire will be a circular AoE, water will not have an AoE but instead repeat the spell right after, air will be bouncing between five targets, and earth will create line(s). * The last circle will add a bonus to the Arcane Spell  fire will move the Arcanist, water will provide 50 endurance, air will reduce the cooldown of the Arcane Spell type, earth will briefly reflect projectiles. The new first slot abilities will is not meant to be spammed, instead will always clean the elemental circles as well as interact with Arcane abilities. Scepter will channel a damaging beam that reduces the cooldown of Arcane Spells as it is channeled. Dagger will be a fast melee attack that deals little damage but generates a stack of Arcane Speed, which causes elemental abilities to activate significantly faster, expending a stack of Arcane Speed per ability. Sword will deal AoE damage around the target based on how many Arcane Spells are on cooldown. Staff will cause the next cast Arcane Spell to not actually use up the elemental circles. Trident will cause the Arcanist to spin in the water dealing damage to closeby enemies, each enemy hit will reduce all Arcane Spells cooldowns. I wanted to take a complicated twist to the Elementalist gameplay, making this spell creation system gives players immense control over how their abilities act in any situations. Arcane Spells are low enough cooldown to continue to use them one at a time cycling through the four, however, repeatedly using one or two Arcane Spells will not be easy without specifically using first slot abilities. I havent thought of how to modify Glyphs to fit this  it would probably be best to simply replace them with new abilities that work off of the elemental circles, perhaps each one will be based on only one of the last circles element. Here are some example Arcane Spells to give an idea on how I imagine the different circles interacting with each other. * Arcane Prism with air, earth, and earth will deal damage to five targets total, blinding each one(nearest to your main target), create lines between your main target and any subtargets that deal minor damage and blind, and briefly reflect projectiles by the lines and from the targets hit. This spell would be useful in encounters where a lot of blinding is needed and reflecting many projectiles but it is most useful if the enemies are a bit spread out. * Arcane Renewal with air, water, and air will heal the Arcanist slightly twice, grant swiftness twice, blast finisher twice, and reduce the cooldown of Arcane Renewal twice. This is great stacking and blasting fields. * Arcane Prodigy with earth, earth, and fire will apply multiple stacks of bleed, create a line between you and the target dealing minor damage and applying bleeds, and teleport you to the target after the line has been created. This is a decent amount of bleeding as well as an extra bit of mobility. * Arcane Boon with earth, fire, and fire will create a circular area that grants protection and teleports the Arcanist to the centre of the area. A powerful defensive combo not only allowing the Arcanist to move but also grant protection. I realized that not all of this is perfectly balanced, however, I just wanted to get this idea out on paper. This might even be too complicated to be in the game. Whichever the case, Im sure that Anets specialization for Elementalist will be great, I look forward to the interesting mechanics they give to each specialization. "
