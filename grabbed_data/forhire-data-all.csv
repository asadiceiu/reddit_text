5,vulnerability,forhire,[For Hire][$25/session] I'll teach you computer hacking and cybersecurity over the winter!,1,eaq4hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/eaq4hm/for_hire25session_ill_teach_you_computer_hacking/,2019-12-15 09:07:59,"Hey /r/forhire! I've gathered a lot of students here before back when I taught [computer programming](URL so I just thought I'd offer something new: computer hacking and cybersecurity! I'll teach you computer hacking and cybersecurity for $25 per session. These sessions consist of three main parts: one-on-one online lectures and live demonstrations with Q+A, readings, and labs that offer you hands-on experience. I already have the entire course outlined, and am more than confident that I am capable of teaching you the content. No additional course materials are needed -- I create all lectures, readings, and labs myself and give them to my students at no additional charge. This course requires very little background knowledge. However, it is preferable that you are acquainted with computer programming in Python and acquainted with reading the x86 Assembly instruction set. If you are unfamiliar with these, that's perfectly fine! I can teach them to you concurrently along the way so as to make sure that your learning is successful. We will be covering a wide array of topics including information gathering and vulnerability scanning, buffer overflows, post-exploitation, social engineering, web application security, passwords and cryptography, and using enterprise-standard tools such as netcat, Wireshark, and Metasploit. If you would like to have a look at the full syllabus, let me know and I'll send you a copy. All sessions are conducted over Discord so that we can screenshare and voice call. We can work based off of an appointment-based schedule and work around each others' personal schedules. I accept payment in the form of PayPal and Bitcoin, which can be made either before a session or within a 7-day period after a session is completed. I've cumulatively taught over a hundred students computer programming in the past, and I've had many successful students go from little to no knowledge to being well on their way to being amazing programmers. Shifting gears from teaching computer programming to teaching computer hacking and cybersecurity is exciting for me, especially because cybersecurity engineering is actually what I aim to do after graduating from university. I'm currently a first-year university student at the University of California, Merced studying computer science and engineering, and am the youngest member of the IT Networking Department at the University. I did not teach at all during the fall semester because my main focus became my studies, but with the end of the semester less than a week away, I am able to teach again during the intermission between the fall and spring semesters. This may seem a little bit accelerated, but trust me, if you can stick to it, I can guarantee you'll be able to learn well. Let me know if you have are interested or have any questions! I am reachable via this reddit account. I hope to be hearing from you soon."

Once the scan is complete, the webmasters dashboard needs to be populated with the results in a fancy, nice, format rather than viewing raw JSON. The webmaster will also need to receive a notification e-mail informing him that the scan has been complete, because each scan can take upwards of 12 hours. The webmaster also needs to be able to export the dashboard results (we can use a free API for this), so he can produce the results in writing to management. Additionally, the webmaster will also need to be able to schedule scans at certain dates / times. Contact via PM"

I want to pursue the freelancer route to not just prove to myself that it is possible, but to prove to the industry that it is time to make some changes in the hiring process. I have a total of 4 years of collective experience, a mixture of both professional and freelancing, as a web/software developer. My forte is in C#.NET backend development with SQL for database, and HTML, CSS, jQuery for a responsive front-end. I also have experience in Wordpress Vulnerability Assessment, virus/malware removal.

40,vulnerability,forhire,[For Hire] Offering Done For You Marketing Services With Transparent Pricing and Deliverables,7,8gtnvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/8gtnvy/for_hire_offering_done_for_you_marketing_services/,2018-05-04 06:49:56,"Hey there, Thanks for checking out our listing! Were a team of freelancers who are fed up with tip-toeing around the money conversation when it comes to buying professional services. This discussion has to happen at some point, but most people make it more painful than it has to be. We think we have an approach that benefits everyone involved... Were not here to run you through a complicated sales process to try and extract every bit of information (and every dollar) youre willing to fork over. Instead, we have prepared a few service packages that list out exactly what youll pay and exactly what you will get for your investment. No pushy sales pitch...no ambiguity...no negotiation. If your goals and budget align with what were offering, lets do business. If not, no hard feelings. So, if any of this sounds like you - Youre sick of spending hours getting to know a freelancer only to realize they are too expensive for you. - You want to know exactly what youre getting for your money. - You hate the ambiguity of paying hourly rates (Read: Not having a clue what the project will actually cost) - You want to minimize your involvement... get the work done without having to manage time or resources. - You hate needless meetings. We operate independently and contact you only when required. ...we should probably work together. Here is whats on the table. If you like what you see, **send us a direct message to get the conversation started.** ___ # Conversion-Focused Website Audit If youre selling a B2B product, running an eCommerce shop, or offering professional services, we can help you convert more website visitors into paying customers. This project focuses on conducting a manual audit of your existing website and producing actionable strategies that you can implement to improve your conversion rate. In most cases, our advice centers around things like: - Site structure and navigation - Website copy - Value proposition framing - Shareability/virality - Other customer experience elements #### Deliverables - Analysis of up to five key pages of your site - Website teardown recording (Screenshare + Voiceover) - Executive summary slide deck (PPT/Google Slides) - Detailed report with recommendations and resources (PDF) #### Pricing &amp; Delivery We can currently take on **four** audit clients per month. Delivery typically takes about 7-10 days from the completion of our Client Questionnaire. **Our current price for this service is $500.** ___ # Email Newsletter Autopilot If youre a solopreneur, independent consultant, founder of a bootstrapped startup, or senior leader for a small company, odds are you have more important things to do than manage your email newsletter. But, you know its important to regularly touch base with your audience and nurture existing relationships. So, whats a well-meaning business person to do? You can work with us to put your email newsletter on autopilot. Well collaborate with you to make sure the subject matter is dialed in, but content production and publication will be our responsibility. You can focus on doing more of the work you actually love knowing that someone else is taking care of your newsletter marketing for you. #### Deliverables - Up to four email newsletter editions per month - Collaborative or outsourced topic strategy and research - Draft and one round of revisions if needed - Upload, formatting, and scheduling/publication of content each week #### Pricing &amp; Delivery We can currently take on **three** email newsletter clients per month. Delivery typically takes about 7-10 days from the completion of our Client Questionnaire to get started and then weekly delivery after the ramp-up period. **Our current price for this service is $350 per month.** ___ # Email Campaign Development Some people say email is dead, but we believe it is alive and well. And now that automation has become popular among nearly all email service providers, the prospect of setting up an automated sales or marketing funnel is well within your grasp. This package focuses on preparing an automation sequence and a set of emails that are tailored to help you hit your sales and marketing goals. Here are some popular use cases for such a service: - Nurture leads with a series of educational email lessons - Reach out to and follow-up with potential sales prospect automatically - Automatically introduce and promote a one-off event (Ex: Course launch or webinar) - Segment your audience and pitch them relevant content or products based on their needs and interests #### Deliverables - Prospect Research Report (PDF) - Strategy Recommendation (PDF + Voiceover) - Campaign Workflow Diagram (PDF + Voiceover) - Production of Email Content (Up to five emails, one round of revisions) - Set up workflow and emails in your email service provider #### Pricing &amp; Delivery We can currently take on **four** email campaign development projects per month. Delivery typically takes about 10-14 days from the completion of our Client Questionnaire. **Our current price for this service is $750.** ___ # Monthly Content Strategy People have been shouting it from the rooftops for a while now - **Content is King.** But, as more and more people buy in to the value of content marketing, its getting harder and harder to stand out. You cant just publish a 400-word blog post each week and cross your fingers. Well, you can, but your competitors are probably going to eat your lunch. Instead, you need a strategy that is driven by data and research. One that helps you be intentional about the content you produce and how you get it in front of your target audience. Heres how we can help: - Conduct keyword research to identify attractive target for increasing your organic traffic - Conduct competitor analysis to see what strategies seem to be working for them and identify points of vulnerability - Identify attractive opportunities for pursuing guest posts, promotions/shares, or backlinks - Consolidate all of that into a content marketing strategy that you can implement in the next 30 days - Provide a detailed editorial calendar that you can follow like a recipe #### Deliverables - Keyword Research Report (Spreadsheet + Voiceover) - Competitor Research Report (Spreadsheet/PDF + Voiceover) - 30-day Marketing Strategy Guide (PDF + Voiceover) - Article Outlines (Key points, sources, target keywords, etc.) - Editorial Calendar (Publication timing and sequencing) #### Pricing &amp; Delivery We can currently take on **three** content strategy clients per month. Delivery typically takes about two weeks from the completion of our Client Questionnaire. **Our current price for this service is $1,250 per month. Reduced rates are available for long-term engagements.** "

Hackers gained access to back-end trough hijacked administrator session after witch everything was textbook example. I'm security researcher acknowledged by U.S Department of Defense. My core competency lies in performing black and white box testing, on the live web applications or in lab environments.I am familiar with all common attack vectors and mitigation techniques, aswell as finding unknown to public exploits known as 0days in web applications.

(Web servers, databases, IP Camera streams, Mobile phones) -Network packet debugging (public network, virtual private network, intranet). -Keylogger detection (Windows, macOS, Linux) -Malware disassembly (for your computer at work and your computer at home, an antivirus is NOT a guarantee of anything). -You name what you're worried about!

120,cybersecurity,forhire,[For Hire][$25/session] I'll teach you computer hacking and cybersecurity over the winter!,1,eaq4hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/eaq4hm/for_hire25session_ill_teach_you_computer_hacking/,2019-12-15 09:07:59,"Hey /r/forhire! I've gathered a lot of students here before back when I taught [computer programming](URL so I just thought I'd offer something new: computer hacking and cybersecurity! I'll teach you computer hacking and cybersecurity for $25 per session. These sessions consist of three main parts: one-on-one online lectures and live demonstrations with Q+A, readings, and labs that offer you hands-on experience. I already have the entire course outlined, and am more than confident that I am capable of teaching you the content. No additional course materials are needed -- I create all lectures, readings, and labs myself and give them to my students at no additional charge. This course requires very little background knowledge. However, it is preferable that you are acquainted with computer programming in Python and acquainted with reading the x86 Assembly instruction set. If you are unfamiliar with these, that's perfectly fine! I can teach them to you concurrently along the way so as to make sure that your learning is successful. We will be covering a wide array of topics including information gathering and vulnerability scanning, buffer overflows, post-exploitation, social engineering, web application security, passwords and cryptography, and using enterprise-standard tools such as netcat, Wireshark, and Metasploit. If you would like to have a look at the full syllabus, let me know and I'll send you a copy. All sessions are conducted over Discord so that we can screenshare and voice call. We can work based off of an appointment-based schedule and work around each others' personal schedules. I accept payment in the form of PayPal and Bitcoin, which can be made either before a session or within a 7-day period after a session is completed. I've cumulatively taught over a hundred students computer programming in the past, and I've had many successful students go from little to no knowledge to being well on their way to being amazing programmers. Shifting gears from teaching computer programming to teaching computer hacking and cybersecurity is exciting for me, especially because cybersecurity engineering is actually what I aim to do after graduating from university. I'm currently a first-year university student at the University of California, Merced studying computer science and engineering, and am the youngest member of the IT Networking Department at the University. I did not teach at all during the fall semester because my main focus became my studies, but with the end of the semester less than a week away, I am able to teach again during the intermission between the fall and spring semesters. This may seem a little bit accelerated, but trust me, if you can stick to it, I can guarantee you'll be able to learn well. Let me know if you have are interested or have any questions! I am reachable via this reddit account. I hope to be hearing from you soon."

These React front-end applications will interface with existing server-side applications via RESTful APIs. This will be a high-energy, fast-paced work environment. Expect weekly builds, constant collaboration, rapid feedback, and lots of learning. Please complete our application to apply: URL ## About Rhino Security Labs Rhino Security Labs is a boutique cybersecurity assessment and penetration testing company focused on providing highly technical security engagements to our clients. For the security layman, we research and use the offensive capabilities of hackers to identify security weaknesses in client corporate networks - before the bad guys can find and use them. Culturally, we are a very technical group of hackers and builders who love what we do - whether researching new security vulnerabilities, developing new tools, or just automating internal tasks. We prioritize (and invest in) constant education, research, and pushing the envelop with technology. Even our sales people use Python for streamlining their work processes! **We believe the best work comes from fostering passion, not obstructive corporate policy.** As part of The Crash (a family of Rhinos - see? You're already learning new things!), we offer quite a bit of flexibility and self-management. Struck by midnight inspiration and want to come in late? No problem - drop a message in Slack and sleep in. Want to work from home today? Whatever you need. The flipside of this is your work should speak for itself. Every employee here is critical and their impact felt - so we cant afford those who just fill seats. Not excited about what youre working on? Talk to your manager - maybe theres a better project for you. Rhino believes in both working hard and playing hard. We constantly look to improve our products and services - and sometimes work long hours to reach the quality we strive for - but we also know how to unwind. With quarterly offsites, monthly game nights, and regular happy hours, youll get to know the lighter side of your coworkers in no time. Not to mention what goes on in Slack! ## What Its Like to Work with Rhino Development at Rhino Security Labs is team-oriented, Agile, and fast-paced. Youll collaborate with a project manager and other developers working in parallel on, as well as with members of other teams like sales or cybersecurity. Slack is a mainstay of the communication process, supplemented by voice/video calls and screen shares, as well as regular in-person team standups. All development projects use Git for source control and Ansible / Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment. Access to issue trackers, test servers, and other common resources are accessible over the companys LAN via VPN. # Requirements ## Professional Requirements * Able to commit to a full time role (~40hrs per week). * Converse fluently and clearly on technical and non-technical issues. * Participate in and contribute to regular voice/video/screenshare calls with the team to discuss requirements and goals, report on progress, and collaborate on new feature proposals. * Comfortable working in a fast-paced work environment with weekly builds, constant collaboration, and rapid feedback. * Write clean code with commenting where necessary. * Manage your own time and priorities within the scope provided by project leads and client focals. ## Technical ""Must Have"" Skills This is a list of hard requirements for this position, and applicants who dont have the necessary expertise in these areas will not be considered.

The business is about 18 months old, with a team of 4 freelance contractors. I work full-time as the project manager/ salesperson. We are experiencing rapid growth and I am looking to add at least one more content writer to my team. Niches covered in the last 6 months include: sales, education, dentistry, cybersecurity, small business, politics and food. We mostly write blog articles, but we also work in SEO and social media for clients that need that. Most of our clients are in the sales and small business niches, so if you have any past career and/or writing experience in those areas, I will look favourably on your application. I've been working remotely since 2013 and run all my business ventures that way. I believe in hiring the best people out there, no matter where they're from. Typically, I will give you a batch of articles and a deadline, and then leave you to get on with it. I had several bad experiences early in my career with being micromanaged and prefer a more hands-off approach. With these freedoms comes a high degree of responsibility on your part. In particular, I need my writers to be exceptionally responsive to email. If you have a problem or need support, I need you to tell me about it assertively. These are simple soft skills that go a long way in this type of work. Here's a summary of the sort of person I'm looking for: * Liberal arts degree * English native speaker * 1+ years of writing experience * Knowledge of SEO, Wordpress and/or social media * Superlative soft skills (see above) If that sounds like you, please send a resume + 2-3 writing samples to the email address at the bottom of my website: URL Please tailor your email to this application and write ""I read your requirements"" as the subject line of your email.
