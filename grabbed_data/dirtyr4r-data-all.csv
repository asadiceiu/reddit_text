0,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,34 [M4F] US east coast/online - I want to chat with you about the girl I once corrupted into an eager slut.,1,i22gjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/i22gjh/34_m4f_us_east_coastonline_i_want_to_chat_with/,2020-08-02 09:52:20,"This happened about ten years ago. She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning.

I want to be very forthcoming on my hopes and desires. I crave both an emotional bond and sexual one. The sexual neglect in my life has pushed me to the point of hoping to find a woman who finds herself in a similar situation as me when it comes to intimacy and hyper-sexual needs. I am the man you see at the grocery store, at community events, or at the mall who seems to be very happy in life. My exterior shows such a kind and warm disposition. This is not an act or facade. I truly am a very compassionate and comforting man; however, there is a sexual beast present within which has my mind constantly racing with all the needs and desires I have in life. Perhaps you find yourself in a similar stage in life. You adore your family, and you feel comfort like a friend to your spouse, but your needs and dreams have been forgotten by all as you support and provide all those around you. There is a constant longing inside of you to be desired carnally by someone, to feel the heights of lust with another, and to be able to share your deepest secrets and desires with someone. If you reach out, please realize the vulnerability that comes with what I am hoping for. It's not for everyone to be so vulnerable with sharing pictures, videos, voice clips, video clips, and live voice/video chats. I don't want to make someone uncomfortable by hoping for these things. My desire is to allow both of us to feel care and satisfaction like never before, not be feeling like you are just being used or pushed to do things you don't want to. Even though I have an insatiable sexual appetite inside, my tenderness and care never leave. Physically, I am a tall, handsome, thick man. I am working daily now to conquer things that have held me back as a person, and me using food as a way to cope with sexual neglect is one of them. Even though I am a thicker man, the athletic build underneath is still there. I have very kind yet intense eyes, a warm smile, and a voice which will send pleasurable shivers up and down your spine. It's amazing how hearing someone's desire for you can be such an erotic experience. I am excited to make you my fantasy, so there are no body types which I crave over others. Your open personality, evident care, and excited attitude towards experiencing each other is what is most important to me. If you feel a connection to me already by how I portrayed myself and my hopes, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am very available to chat while at work, and it just so happens I am at my desk now."

I am the man you see at the grocery store, at community events, or at the mall who seems to be very happy in life. My exterior shows such a kind and warm disposition. This is not an act or facade. I truly am a very compassionate and comforting man; however, there is a sexual beast present within which has my mind constantly racing with all the needs and desires I have in life. Perhaps you find yourself in a similar stage in life. You adore your family, and you feel comfort like a friend to your spouse, but your needs and dreams have been forgotten by all as you support and provide all those around you. There is a constant longing inside of you to be desired carnally by someone, to feel the heights of lust with another, and to be able to share your deepest secrets and desires with someone. If you reach out, please realize the vulnerability that comes with what I am hoping for. It's not for everyone to be so vulnerable with sharing pictures, videos, voice clips, video clips, and live voice/video chats. I don't want to make someone uncomfortable by hoping for these things. My desire is to allow both of us to feel care and satisfaction like never before, not be feeling like you are just being used or pushed to do things you don't want to. Even though I have an insatiable sexual appetite inside, my tenderness and care never leave. Physically, I am a tall, thick man. I am working daily now to conquer things that have held me back as a person, and me using food as a way to cope with sexual neglect is one of them. Even though I am a thicker man, the athletic build underneath is still there. I have very kind yet intense eyes, a warm smile, and a voice which will send pleasurable shivers up and down your spine. It's amazing how hearing someone's desire for you can be such an erotic experience. I am excited to make you my fantasy, so there are no body types which I crave over others. Your open personality, evident care, and excited attitude towards experiencing each other is what is most important to me. If you feel a connection to me already by how I portrayed myself and my hopes, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am very available to chat while at work, and it just so happens I am at my desk now."

Recently ended a long term thing, seeking my next project. In my experience the best D/s dynamic is built exclusively on trust, communication and mutual vulnerability. Sometime the hottest aphrodisiac is progressive disclosure over Reddit chat ;) Enjoy Twisted Monk and mid range Etsy products but often the best BDSM items can found at Target or Home Depot with the right play mate ;) Impact play, edging, rope play, sensory deprivation and wax play are all things I like to explore with new partners for openers. Can custom calibrate according to vibe and chemistry. If interested please respond with the last kinky or steamy book you read that had you folding down the top corners of certain pages Near Highland Village. Safe, sane, consensual."

I strongly believe that the highest function of D/s is as a tool to build someone up. To give them the support, companionship, motivation, structure and accountability necessary to manifest positive change in their life. There is great meaning and joy in introducing someone new to this lifestyle. In showing that it is right to give yourself and that within that surrender, you have worth beyond measure. **What brings me here:** I'm a 23 year old professional blessed with a stable career that allows me to do meaningful work that makes a difference. I have been further blessed in the creation of healthy relationships with friends and family, and a steady motivation to further improve myself and work on new goals. I've found a place of peace and contentment that I want to share with someone who needs it. Those who have been under me describe me as a caretaker, some have even asked if I'm a therapist (I'm not). My role could also be compared to a life coach. But, I'm not here because I'm better than you or more accomplished than you or even have this life better figured out. I'm here because I've failed, because I've taken hard falls and have made many wrong turns. In the most perilous moments, with the help from others, I've discovered tools within myself that have led to real change. The most important of which is an acceptance of myself and a belief in my strength and capability to overcome any obstacle and grow from my failures. **This is the truth that will lie at the core of our dynamic:** You are intelligent. You are creative. You are capable. You are strong. You have the power to create what you want in life. You are of great worth and you deserve meaning and happiness. I don't need you to feel those things right now - a large part of your training will be about accepting those truths and introducing them to your life - but I need you to be open to them. This dynamic is about taking action in your life that serves you. To re-orient your life where the decisions you make allow you to feel healthier, to have well-being, to grow, improve and accomplish your goals. **What we will create:** Well work on changing your thoughts, the stories you tell yourself, the narratives that are keeping you trapped. Well identify your goals, short-term and long-term, identify what is important to you, and develop a plan to get you there. Well change your routine. Create a disciplined regimented environment for you to thrive in.Well transform your lifestyle to one that is healthy, a nutritious diet, and regular exercise schedule, daily meditations. In all of this, you will find that you are no longer alone. Youll have an owner. An owner to make proud. An owner to represent. An owner who will encourage you and always push you forward. An owner who will hold you accountable with whatever severity is necessary. Most importantly, above anything else, you are going to feel pride within yourself. **What you will invest:** This is not free. You will pay me daily with your body, your mind and your service. With your obedience and your submission. You will be entirely stripped and exposed, physically and mentally, and within that environment of true vulnerability and commitment, we will create the catalyst you need to start creating the life that you deserve. A final word Let me take this moment to stress that the most important element in this is not me, it is you. This depends on the kind of commitment, energy and openness you create in yourself. If you come to me out of simple curiousity or because this sounds interesting and it'll help pass the days, you're probably not going to get a lot out of this. But if you come to me with a determination and a fire - no matter how small - that you are ready to build a new life for yourself, a new way of being - then the day you message me will be the beginning of a journey we will eventually look back on with gratitude.

This intrigues and arouses me and leaves me wondering if there is anyone who would wish to be blackmailed in this way and others, being controlled by afar by someone who has 'dirt' on her to be constantly simultaneously stressed out and aroused at the beck and call of some stranger who could out her at any time. Its a difficult situation to find a way for someone to get themselves into. Obviously for the power play to work I would have to have something that would actually leave someone truly vulnerable - say private nudes and facebook or some real secret and the contact details of someone with whom they would not want it shared and of course no one is likely to trust some stranger on the internet but perhaps there is someone willing to take this leap of faith, to put themselves in this state of vulnerability and to enjoy the consequences. If you are this woman I would be interested to discuss further, to talk about limits, a safe word / end word etc. and would ask that you message me. In case it plays into any fantasies I am a 24 year old professional (lawyer) male. Perhaps you are an older woman who fantasises about being at the beck and call of a young man or perhaps you are a young lady who wishes to be dominated by a professional male."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

Ive never posted something like this anywhere before, let alone on Reddit, so forgive me if Ive done anything wrong or out of place.... Who am I? Im a 21 year old bisexual sub in Burbank. Ive been involved in the lifestyle for about 3 years with the majority of my experiences being online. Due to the fact that Im in college pursuing a STEM degree, Im incredibly busy and therefore unable to pursue an in-person relationship, and would like to begin with something online at least for the time being. That being said I need a release from reality to occupy my free time - hopefully I can find that in You. I am 55, thin, with brown hair and blue eyes. I am quite pale thanks to quarantine locking me up. About my non-kinky side: Im your average college student. Im extremely career-oriented and a bit of a nerd, so I study a LOT. Its very important to me that my studying is not interfered with - if anything, what Im hoping to find will help me focus and stay on track. However, when Im not studying, I can be found spending time with my closest friends, listening to music, watching football, or watching my favorite movies/tv shows on repeat. As for my kinky side: I would still consider myself inexperienced, however I am a submissive through and through. To be more specific: I consider myself a primal brat. I have little tendencies (dont we all need a little Little in our lives?) and would love to dabble in pet play. My kinks include: teasing, light bondage, rope, light degradation, discipline, humiliation, JOI, orgasm control/denial, exhibitionism, breeding, marking (scratching/biting), sensory deprivation, CNC (to a degree). I tend to have a very open mind and would love to explore more. My limits include: Scat/urine, blood play, bestiality, heavy pain/abuse. What am I looking for in my Dominant? Physically - a man or woman between 20 and 45. I am not incredibly picky about looks - I would just prefer someone generally in good shape and good health, as I am trying to keep healthy and active myself. I would prefer someone in the United States due to time zone differences; that being said, I will keep an open mind. I need a confident Dominant who is strict but caring. I thrive under structure and am most satisfied when I am pleasing a superior. However...I need someone headstrong who can easily put me in my place when Im feeling bratty. What am I looking for in our relationship? I want a connection. Someone who I can come to at the end of the day and open up to, who I can open myself up to and entrust with my vulnerability. I want a friend, a mentor, a lover - someone who knows me, gets me, sees me, and yet can put me back in my place at the snap of a finger; someone to make me feel small. s\\nxap **zoxostacy**"

As Jackson Browne said, ""a lover who won't blow my cover."" My central values are honesty, vulnerability, compassion, and evolution. I got into fetishism because I was drawn to the incredible openness with which people spoke about their desires and then was sold on it because through a paddle and a vibrator I was able to elicit some of the greatest pleasures of my partner and my lives. I am at a place where I want to make durable connection. I'm almost always inclined towards sexual dominance with the part that most evokes my interest and sense of self being the psychological components. Sensory deprivation, play protocols, and commitment/being serviced by a partner are those aspects of a dynamic that really get me going. I'm a deeply silly, curious, and reflective guy. I have made mistakes in my life and attempt whenever I can to take responsibility and admit my imperfections as an impetus for growing. If you're looking for something similar and would like to start a conversation, I would love to hear about something that gets you going, intellectually or otherwise."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out.

The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

I'm 27, English isn't my native language, so I am sorry for the awful grammar. I love movies, everything geek, from Harry Potter to Star Wars to Pokemon. I'm about 1.75 m, dark brown eyes, beard and short black hair. I work 5 to 6 days a week as a restaurant manager. Cooking is something I adore to do, as is gaming and pets. I don't smoke, I rarely drink, I don't do drugs. I am from a small country in Europe but I am planing to move somewhere by 2021/2. Which means I am willing to move closer to you in a couple of years. I am open minded about pretty much everything, I love talking about politics and religion. I am strong believer of equality for everyone and a supporter of LGBTQ. About my kinky side,I like to take control, I love to set up as many rules as possible and to give guidance. I've my limits as you have yours and they are to be respected, but that's something to be discussed later on. Sex is important but isn't not the most important thing in a relationship. I don't want to base the relationship on sexual aspects, I want a perfect balance between mental connection, love, respect and sex! I am waiting for someone to help guide and a possible relationship if we work out well. I am patient and passionate but I can be pushy and direct when the occasion dictates. I like being transparent with people and I expect the same in return. I am here for the vulnerability and connection I've had little/sub before but everyone one is different so I rather if we take it slow. I suspect you are not from my little town, so please be open to pics / voice recordings / videos. Friends are welcomed too! Just please be +18a"

To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr.

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her.

I've been every kind of Top you can think of, and I am quite flexible with what kind of sub is right for me. What I really need is that devotion that only comes from submission. That kind of gratification and control and vulnerability that can only be shared by the kinky among us. I'm based near London, in Kent. I drive. I am a business owner. I'm a firm but fair Master with a lot of experience under my belt. I love to make things. I love to better myself and my property too. Trainer. Sadist. Cuddler. Owner. I don't have a type, but I dislike too much bratting, I prefer a good girl. Kinks are many and varied, limits few. I yearn for the other half of my dynamic, and I hope to meet someone for a lasting relationship. I love to teach, experience not necessary. I love eagerness to please. I dislike intolerance and closed-mindedness. As long as this post is up, please feel free to message me. I hope to hear from you!"

She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

53,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,"34 [M4F] Indianapolis, Indiana (EST) - Do you also feel taken for granted as the indifference at home becomes almost unbearable? Seeking mutual ""throw caution to the wind"" and hopefully finally experience sexual fun, excitement, and satisfaction.",1,i0niw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/i0niw6/34_m4f_indianapolis_indiana_est_do_you_also_feel/,2020-07-31 01:00:01,"If you are like me, you put the needs of others above your own. The desire to be a kind and uplifting force in someone's life has you constantly hiding your most desperate wants and needs in order to better serve the people you love. I wish to truly dote upon someone, and not just in an emotionally supporting way. I crave a lover. Almost always being subject to a dead bedroom has left me aching and desiring for so much more. I am searching for someone who wishes to escape this world of neglect and indifference together. Like most here, I am not looking to leave my situation or family. I am hoping to experience very high levels of passion, sexual ecstasy, and actually being pursued as I hope to pursue someone. I am naturally kind, caring, and selfless to a fault. I have had to hide my wants and desires for my entire adult life, and I am excited to find someone who revels in the dichotomy that is me. A respectable businessman and caring man on the outside, and a deeply passionate and sexual demon on the inside. Physically, I am tall, athletically built but thicker with the stresses of taking care of others, with a very warm smile, tender and kind eyes, and a voice which is both soothing and arousing. Please enjoy a man with a little more to love. I wish to find someone who enjoys exchanging voice messages, pictures, videos, and live video or voice chats when timing allows. I am a very visual and audible person, and I hope you are too. I am very comfortable with an online only situation, but also am excited if we are close enough to meet. I understand the heights of passion I wish to experience are not for everyone. I want to unleash myself on someone, and that entails a level of vulnerability through being seen and heard that is not easy for all. If you reach out, please be wanting of a very adult, explicit connection."
54,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,"34 [M4F] Indianapolis, Indiana (EST) - Have you gone through your life hiding major parts of yourself due to an SO not understanding or even wanting that part of you? Let's escape our neglectful worlds together and pursue each other with great want. Let's make fantasy a reality.",1,i0t2n5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/i0t2n5/34_m4f_indianapolis_indiana_est_have_you_gone/,2020-07-31 06:03:19,"First and foremost, yes, I am seeking a very active, passionate, and interactive sexual connection with someone to include an over abundance of care, trust, and compassion. I want to be very forthcoming on my hopes and desires. I crave both an emotional bond and sexual one. The sexual neglect in my life has pushed me to the point of hoping to find a woman who finds herself in a similar situation as me when it comes to intimacy and hyper-sexual needs. I am the man you see at the grocery store, at community events, or at the mall who seems to be very happy in life. My exterior shows such a kind and warm disposition. This is not an act or facade. I truly am a very compassionate and comforting man; however, there is a sexual beast present within which has my mind constantly racing with all the needs and desires I have in life. Perhaps you find yourself in a similar stage in life. You adore your family, and you feel comfort like a friend to your spouse, but your needs and dreams have been forgotten by all as you support and provide all those around you. There is a constant longing inside of you to be desired carnally by someone, to feel the heights of lust with another, and to be able to share your deepest secrets and desires with someone. If you reach out, please realize the vulnerability that comes with what I am hoping for. It's not for everyone to be so vulnerable with sharing pictures, videos, voice clips, video clips, and live voice/video chats. I don't want to make someone uncomfortable by hoping for these things. My desire is to allow both of us to feel care and satisfaction like never before, not be feeling like you are just being used or pushed to do things you don't want to. Even though I have an insatiable sexual appetite inside, my tenderness and care never leave. Physically, I am a tall, thick man. I am working daily now to conquer things that have held me back as a person, and me using food as a way to cope with sexual neglect is one of them. Even though I am a thicker man, the athletic build underneath is still there. I have very kind yet intense eyes, a warm smile, and a voice which will send pleasurable shivers up and down your spine. It's amazing how hearing someone's desire for you can be such an erotic experience. I am excited to make you my fantasy, so there are no body types which I crave over others. Your open personality, evident care, and excited attitude towards experiencing each other is what is most important to me. If you feel a connection to me already by how I portrayed myself and my hopes, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am very available to chat while at work, and it just so happens I am at my desk now."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me.

59,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,29 [M4F] #Kent UK Master seeking committed slave girl to own,1,gw11zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/gw11zf/29_m4f_kent_uk_master_seeking_committed_slave/,2020-06-04 05:43:51,"I'm missing that connection that only a Top and his sub can share - deeper and more visceral than any other. I've been every kind of Top you can think of, and I am quite flexible with what kind of sub is right for me. What I really need is that devotion that only comes from submission. That kind of gratification and control and vulnerability that can only be shared by the kinky among us. I'm based near London, in Kent. I drive. I am a business owner. I'm a firm but fair Master with a lot of experience under my belt. I love to make things. I love to better myself and my property too. Trainer. Sadist. Cuddler. Owner. I don't have a type, but I dislike too much bratting, I prefer a good girl. Kinks are many and varied, limits few. I yearn for the other half of my dynamic, and I hope to meet someone for a lasting relationship. I love to teach, experience not necessary. I love eagerness to please. I dislike intolerance and closed-mindedness. As long as this post is up, please feel free to message me. I hope to hear from you!"
60,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,34 [M4F] US east coast/online - I want to chat with you about the girl I once corrupted into an eager slut.,1,gwguzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/gwguzy/34_m4f_us_east_coastonline_i_want_to_chat_with/,2020-06-04 22:51:57,"This happened about ten years ago. She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place.

64,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,26 M4F MA/RI -- Any love for a useless softie?,0,gzywoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/gzywoo/26_m4f_mari_any_love_for_a_useless_softie/,2020-06-10 09:22:29,"Just testing the waters to see if anyone is interested in a broken toy like me. &amp;#x200B; As a vanilla sexual partner, you'd probably consider me fairly useless. Without a condom I cum very quickly, and with a condom I either still cum within a few minutes or the lack of sensation softens my erection. Despite being extremely horny I often only get half hard, and it can take a lot of stimulation to get that far. I'm able to cum without being completely hard (and even when I'm nearly completely soft), which as you might imagine can be fairly humiliating. Maybe it's due to association or because of my experiences in the kink scene, but over time the humiliation aspects of all of this has turned into a fetish; SPH, being forced to orgasm while soft (e.g. with a hitachi), being ridiculed while attempting to have normal sex, etc, have all become major fantasies for me. &amp;#x200B; For much longer than I've had those kinks I've been involved in BDSM and kink, and I've had a lot of experience as a submissive both online and in real-life scenes. My kinks as a sub include light humiliation, pain play, impact play, chastity and orgasm control, ruined orgasms, cum eating, body worship, choking, mental play and mind fuckery, etc. I enjoy anal play and when it's done right it's incredibly pleasurable and will thoroughly melt my brain and make me useless for a few hours, though that's easy to do in general because it's very, very easy for me to hit sub-space. I suppose all this doesn't come as too much of a surprise. &amp;#x200B; My relationship with kink is complicated, and it's not something I just turn off my brain to do. Like I said I hit sub-space very, very easily, and when I do I go deep. The complicated side of that characteristic is that there's a significant loss of control that can happen with very little work, and needless to say there's a ton of vulnerability that goes along with that. A lot of this stuff is genuinely humiliating for me and there's plenty of different feelings wrapped up in them, so a casual and open friendship and a good amount of physical affection outside of the kinky stuff is absolutely required. &amp;#x200B; Here's a little bit more about myself outside of the kink related stuff (feel free to pm me for a photo): I'm white, 5'8"", big muscles from weight training but basically a dad-bod. I work in a STEM field and recently moved back to the central MA/Worcester area. I'm a softie in pretty much every meaning of the word. I'm very affectionate once things develop but I'm usually pretty shy when meeting new people, or at least when I'm meeting them due to a kink thing.

Im looking for another girl to share our experiences, fantasies, kinks, links to sex toys, favorite angles for nudes with, in the hopes of becoming genuine friends (or maybe friends with some added benefits of exploring new things together). Im not looking to meet right now, but would love to chat in the meantime and get to know each other. Im 30, Asian, cis woman, who grew up pretty sexually repressed. People routinely tell me that Im the only person theyve shared xyz with, but I havent really found anyone with whom Ive shared an equal amount of vulnerability and trust. Basically looking for more kinky women in my life. If youre into early 2000s pop punk, Carly Rae Jepsen, close analysis of art, or prison abolition, send a message!"

A 59, 180 pound, handsome white guy who can dress well, cook, and may be relatively smart. [Picture for reference](URL I'm looking for a partner, either a casual one or something more serious if we both feel inclined. So long as there's great conversation (with laughter, flirting, vulnerability and openness) and great sex (with much the same, plus kinky fun) I'm game to see where our relationship leads. **A Bit More About Me** Originally from Chicago, Ive lived on both coasts of the US, travel a fair amount of it, and also have lived (and sometimes still live) in Europe. I love other cultures, different perspectives, and their origins. Im also incredibly passionate about food (maybe even too passionate). Always searching for that best dessert, or sauce; because dipping things is a favorite past-time. When Im not eating or traveling I love video games, spirituality, self-reflection, personal growth, music and television binging. I read the internet a fair amount but am not a huge book reader- though I do have my modest collection. Sense of humor: playful, ridiculous, bad sexual innuendo, absurdity, sarcasm... I love to laugh. **What Ive learned is most important to me in relationships (whether casual or serious)...** or what I seek out the most are two things: communication, and sexuality (hence the great conversation, great sex line from earlier). Communication's vital to me because how you communicate, what you communicate, is the basis of everything between two people. Sexuality because... well thats a slightly longer story. Suffice to say Ive done *a lot* of exploring there and know myself pretty well. Ideally, you would too. Lets just say: be comfortable sexually, be kinky and imaginative, and have your own drive to experience your sexuality. (If you're curious, as kink compatibility is huge, my kinks are: anal, extreme dirty talk, orgasm control, free use, public, pics &amp; videos, group play, sleep play, exhibitionism, voyuerism, attention play, cum play, oral fetishists. Hard limits include: marking, resistance, brats, force-submission, scat, blood, urine, knives) The other vital element is someone who loves themselves, that is to say someone who is kind and gentle with themselves, versus harsher. If I sound like your kind of deep dish, drop me a line with some info about you, a photo and lets chat. Low-effort responses will be ignored. Wishes of safety and health to you."

Its super cute and hes my travel buddy, we got lots of plans to go to Hawaii and Japan when this shit blows over, he always gives me food when Im hungry, he holds my hand wherever we go but like... some times I wish he would push me against a wall or randomly eat me out while we were playing video games or get me drunk so he can take advantage of me . One time we were eating dim sum and he touched my inner thighs once, I think thats the more scandalous thing weve done. I get kinda horny when I see other girls stare at him, especially since hes so tall and girls always look at him. I have these fantasies of him checking them out too. In reality hes too busy looking or talking to me or asking me where we gonna get boba. I also get kinda horny at the thought of him fucking his ex, a former flight attendant. I always ask him how did they fuck but he gets so nervous to talk about it. I know he actually truly cares about me but like some times I wish he could get me jealous or something lol. Then I have these fantasies of wearing a remote vibrator at one of those daytime pool clubs in Vegas, and I would let him control it while I was tanning. I know he aint gonna do that but its a nice thought. I also have these ideas of him getting me buzzed and then having his way with me. I know consent is important but I crave this kinda of vulnerability with my boyfriend because I trust him. But tbh even if his finance bro coworkers came in to fuck me too I wouldnt mind. Anywho Ive got more but would love to chat further. Ive got the sweetest and cutest bf but I wish he was a little bit more perverted like me lol."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr.

As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr.

76,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,24[F4M] Literally just looking for someone to talk to or any words of comfort,1,hiyrzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/hiyrzl/24f4m_literally_just_looking_for_someone_to_talk/,2020-07-01 09:24:39,"Mentally, I am sitting on the floor in a dark room hugging my knees and hoping no one comes in to hurt me again. The loneliness is sharp and palpable, but the hope that things will work out is waning with every day that passes. Searching for BDSM partners on Reddit is honestly one of the most painful things Ive been through in my adult life. I've been using reddit to engage in D/s dynamics for the past 11 months and it has left me feeling gutted and even more alone than before I started. I've been used, left, ghosted, rejected, and as a result, my self worth is shattered. I can't explain how many times I've said, ""Okay. I understand."" only to mean ""Okay, I understand that I'm not enough to make you stay. I understand that I'm not your priority and I never was."" How many ""Doms"" on here are actually just abusers? How many people promise that they're looking for connection, only to request explicit pictures and dole out tasks within 48 hours? They all want to possess me completely, to own every aspect of my mind, to exploit my vulnerability for their limited attention span, while giving nothing in return. And there's no pattern; it's been men, women, younger, older, nearby, and across the ocean. Someone told me once that this is just the game - that sifting through people on Reddit is common and most interactions are disappointments. But it's worse than that, I think. I wonder if weve created a space where anonymity serves to shield countless transgressions. I've known I was submissive since I was 15. I acknowledge and celebrate that part of myself, but I crave companionship. I crave a Dominant to guide my mind, command my body, cherish my heart, and treasure my submission. But I'm only interested in doing this safely and genuinely. I am constantly told that I'm ""not submissive"" when I stand up for safety, fairness, and honesty. To vouch for myself, to say ""no,"" is seen as disobedient. It hurts. I feel lost in this wide world and maintaining softness and sensitivity feels impossible.

Just the power dynamics of it and taboo are such major turn-ons. The control and utter domination involved contrasting with the absolute submission and vulnerability.

85,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,34 [M4F] US east coast/online - I want to chat with you about the girl I once corrupted into an eager slut.,1,fusfdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/fusfdv/34_m4f_us_east_coastonline_i_want_to_chat_with/,2020-04-04 22:52:51,"This happened about ten years ago. She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories.

89,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,24 [M4F] Seattle - A womans body is an easy thing to appreciate. Ive taken the moment to reflect.,1,fwzsgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/fwzsgs/24_m4f_seattle_a_womans_body_is_an_easy_thing_to/,2020-04-08 14:33:25," Tonight, I cant get girls off my mind. All I want is to touch, to love, and to worship. Girls bodies make that an easy thing. Theres something to be adored in every place. \- I love womens hair. Her smell is best captured in her hair, and to put my nose in it and breath is to fill my thoughts of her. There is no more a complete mental summary. It all floods my thoughts. The good. The bad. The beautiful. Every thought I have of a girl comes to me at her scent. A girls hair can be either a crown, a halo, a veil even. Its always an important accent and one of the first things I observe on a girl. It speaks a lot about her. Where has she been? What is she thinking? \- Foreheads are very kissable and broadcast alot of emotion. \- I absolutely love eyes. The epicenter of thoughts and feels. A favorite activity of mine is just to maintain solid eye contact with a girl. Power play is some of my favorite and so much of it happens in that game. Ive never dated a girl who didnt have beautiful eyes. Most women do in general. When shes crying, eyes are still beautiful. My appreciate for the honesty of eyes is boundless. \- Cheeks. I own an apology to every cheek Ive paid mind to. Often, theyre the nexus of any punishment I might look to deliver. A quick and dirty spot that can take abuse like a chief and I receive an instant response from the rest of the face. \- Lips. I could touch a girls lips until the end of days, and it would pass in an instant. Ive never seen a pair of ugly lips. \- The neck of a woman encapsulates her grace and her vulnerability. Ive never known an ugly neck. The neck is always telling a story. Her heartbeat can be felt under the skin with every kiss. Any elevated emotion is instantly shown by a swallow or sigh. When a girl shows her neck, its a show of incredible trust. To betray that trust a little can be very rewarding. Its a massively sensory organ that feels as uniquely as her face creates identity. \- I like shoulders. Theyre fair and show her strength. A girls salt of the earth best shows in her shoulders. Bite marks look best on the forward face of a shoulder. \- Imma tits guy. Tits are just great. Although easy on the eyes, I dont see tits as beautiful in the classical sense as other places. Boobs are very functional, and usually teased from behind a bra or under a sweater. I associate them with fun. They play a lot of games. Their function is usually blunter than other spots. Its either a yes this feels good, or not really. No great deal of variation in pressure against them. Theyre easy to think about. Theyre two of them. Im always happy to see them, to touch them, and I appreciate their simplicity. Plus, theyre not far from the face if I want to communicate. \- Shoulder blades. The blades are interesting. I like them because they have a lot of character. They speak very bluntly about how the rest of the body is feeling. They skin on them is tight but has no qualms about stretching outward to give beautiful and defined shapes. I have to put my mouth on them. \- The tummy. A girls tummy is a special spot. Its very vulnerable.. which depending on the mood, can be an interesting focal point for some gentle powerplay. \- Pussies are without a doubt the single most underappreciated human body part. Girls cant see them, so they dont know how they feel about them. Guys have no idea how they work cuz theyre never talked about. Would you poke a dick to make it feel good? No? Well it doesnt work with a vagina either. Its not a button. \- Butts. Butts are my favorite place to put my teeth. Their use as a percussive instrument is well versed. Butts look good in any garment (or lack thereof). \- Leeeegggssssss Yes.. Yes please. Legs are awesome. Everything about them is awesome. Theyre powerful, intensely pragmatic, and more often than not, a place that enjoys being touched. A girl who shows off her legs plays on a different league. They speak boldness, confidence, and ability. If Im to worship, I go to the leg. \- Feet. They have their mood. Damn girls. Yall have incredible bodies."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture.

I have over seven years of experience with submission myself, but only recently have I come to terms with my growing interest in domination. I am not looking for a serious relationship, but rather a lovely play partner and friend. Over the years I have had several encounters of dipping my toes into domination, but I never went any further with it. Until now, that is. As a submissive I'm into ddlg, pet play, humiliation, bondage, S&amp;M, high protocol, dress up, water sports, daily tasks, and much much more. As a dominant? Well, I'm not completely sure yet, to be honest. I have tried some humiliation and bondage type of play before and I simply adore giving tasks and guiding you through orgasm denial/permission. I'd love to tell you what to wear as well. I like being strict, but I also like giving affection and making you see how beautiful you really are. I know how much trust D/s takes so I will never rush you. Bdsm is best when we have chemistry, it's easy to make each other laugh, and we have a good foundation of trust and communication. I want to see who you are when you strip down the masks you wear around everyone else. I want you to be honest with me and tell me what you truly crave - how you want to be loved, how you want to be hurt, and how you want to be seen. I want you to tell me about your day and comfort you if anything was difficult. I want to see you for who you really are. And I want you to see me. Your mind is way more important to me than your body, but I do think physical health should not be neglected. Most of all, I love to be able to have a witty and flirty rapport going between us. Intelligence is incredibly sexy and vulnerability is a gift I do not take lightly. To sum it up I'd love to explore what kind of domination fits me while also getting to know what type of submission makes you feel fulfilled and cared for. If this sounds interesting to you let me know your age, gender, where you are from (you do not have to be specific), three things that turns you on, and three things that made you smile in the last week."

If you're not willing to invest the time in fulfilling my desires, please reconsider sending me a message. Now, I'm not sure what exactly warrants a lot of upvotes for a dirtyr4r post, apart from creativity.... but what I can make up for is unvarnished honesty and a rather active desire in something unorthodox to pursue something that is my choice.... something that I want. Looking for Caucasian US LEOs (border patrol, corrections etc.)/military men (Army, Navy, Marines, AF, Coast Guard... darn right I included the coast guard) to sext with and get to know. Wasn't sure how to spin a good post title but maybe unvarnished honesty with a bit of voluntary objectification of my newfound gender identity and ethnicity can go a long way. After all, my mom did say to never forget my roots... maybe she was right about one thing hehe. Vulnerability can be a heavy risk, especially in the military... for those who'd been a platoon leader, or in charge of a garrison, the safety of your men in your unit matters. Even then, any flinching to vulnerability can greatly matter in your men's confidence in you, their faith, respect. Losing that in your command can be everything. It is tempting to be in the mindset of being a razor... to casting aside fear, or hesitation when danger is near. The choice does not have to be so. Or it can just be feeling tired and restless at everything if you're a LEO, taking off your vest that smells like Nachos when you get home from a long shift. Your bar buddies aren't hard-pressed for conversations, sometimes you find yourself yearning for someone to make your day less stressed, and incrementally brighter can make a difference. For both professions that require professionalism and taught discipline... you rarely get to speak your thoughts off the record, and you're just as likely to be perpetually stressed, trying to keep your guard up. Regardless, I'd like to give you that chance of being vulnerable, not just emotionally but sexually as well. What is it that attracts men in these fields for me? I'd always believed and stayed true in my belief that these are fields capable for boys to grow up to become men. They can either make you or break you. Maybe you are young, accomplished and ambitious in being married to one of these careers, or you have doubts at what it means to be in it for some time. I'd like to tend to you, play the role of being a caretaker, get on your level. Anything on your mind, from the very tame to the sexually perverse (I can be a surprisingly open-minded person after all, tell me your very naughty thoughts and fantasies). **My kinks:** mother/soldier son, taboo/incest, feminization, impregnation/breeding, sloppy BJ's, sissy son-turned-daughter (just turned 18 today)/daddy, shared around by your buddies, you in uniform and including (but not limited to) the off duty cop starter pack, arm tattoos (no full body), and foreigner/US LEOs &amp; military... did I mention I'm Filipino? Nothing like a stereotypical Filipino nurse that is looking for something specifically, stereotypical ;) **You:** * 18-49 * Respectful, open-minded, very understanding * Not married or partnered (seriously lol) * Tell me a bit about yourself."

I'm mostly established, know what I want, and you should too. **What I look for in a partner:** Quality time. Connection. Emotional Vulnerability Intensity. I value people and the their presence in my life. I share openly and look for an incredible dynamic and connection. Persistence. Stability. Showing up. Life isn't all roses and gravy. Recognizing it takes two to tango goes a long way. I'm family oriented and do want children in the future. It's a shame if the latter is a deal breaker. Intellectual curiosity. Growth. Honesty. I look for genuine connections that challenge, foster growth, and share my enthusiasm and curiosity. Desire. Submission. Fire. Not for submission's sake, but as a persistent layer intertwined within an incredible relationship. **About you:** You're passionate. You take calculated risks. You're driven by a desire to experience life and appreciate the limited time that we have to see and do it all. You fight for what you believe in. You command and share respect, love, affection, and equality. You're open minded. You want to share new experiences. You have a life, hobbies, and interests that span beyond bdsm, yet you yearn to have someone to submit and belong to. You're sub. For the right person, you're willing to give and do anything. This doesn't preclude you from being loved, respected, or treated equally as a human being. You submit willingly, hungrily, and get excited at the thought of a strong, playful force in your life. **About Me:** I'm into most things kink, but especially into the heady, power play parts of it. I'm creative, sensual, and can be both mean and gentle. I enjoy creating challenging scenes, exploring the darker parts of the psyche, and driven by the psychological, mental, and emotional exchange in Ds. Somewhat primal. I'm generally attracted to stronger personalities that can match my intensity. Every time you push back, I'll push you harder. About the same goes for the romantic side of my relationships. I'm at my best in relationships that are intellectually and emotionally stimulating, built on a strong foundation of trust, communicate openly, and have the strength to endure through time. I'm thoughtful, affectionate, like snuggling up on late evenings, and just comfortably being ourselves. **In a nutshell:** I'm looking for someone to share it all with. I want to paint a picture, have you be my muse, canvas and inspiration. You should contact me if you're an adventurous, playful and open minded woman looking for a real connection.

Not that there is hatred or lack of care throughout the relationship, but that there is a major part of you being ignored and not pursued which causes you to lay awake at night, feel numb throughout the day, and not feel complete in the way you so desperately wish to be. Imagine being able to be yourself with someone. Think how exciting it would be to finally not have to keep your guard up or bury all your wants and desires deep down inside. I am a man who has found himself left to only fantasize and dream for almost my entire adult life, and I want to be able to break out of my box with someone. More importantly, I want to break down all your barriers as well. If you enjoy a man who is affectionate, tender, genuinely kind, caring, with an insatiably need and lust to please and be pleased, then I just might be the man you have been hoping for. I am not an Adonis nor do I seek a model type gal with a fake personality. I am handsome with a bigger frame that still resembles my athletic days. I crave a real person, not someone who is superficial. The vulnerability I seek also requires someone that wants more than an attractive face. The vulnerability of exposing both our bodies and minds. I hope to see each other through as many avenues as possible, hear each other, and pique each others desires in any way we can possibly imagine. Come take a chance on this man from the Midwest!"

I'm 5'10, 165, fairly good shape, great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy being a Daddy Dom for good girls who show affection and like to improve and want help to achieve their best. No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction and not be lost and excessively clingy. And Im also not into age regression. Seeking a little girl who is at least 21 years old and older is fine. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. On a vanilla level, I am a film and music lover, take photographs, study art, love learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. Please be HWP and no serious mental health problems If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start on vanilla topics. Thank you"

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was revelling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the last paragraph of this post. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * ===== So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was revelling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * ===== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out.

Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

I'm 5'11, 160, fairly good shape, single (divorced) great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy being a dominant. No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction, want an arrangement where we meet a few times a month, understand the focus is on exploring dominance/submission, and not be lost and excessively clingy. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads.

No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction and not be lost. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. Some connection is fun and important. Need trust I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. Lately I want to fine tune my skills with spankings so sex isnt the priority for me. Skill building is On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told.

(Hopeful for long-term)",1,emwiyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/emwiyd/33_m4f_indianapolis_indiana_online_searching_for/,2020-01-11 07:18:10,"Why not run fast into a mutual situation where we both feel the rush of excitement, exhibitionism, comfort, and closeness? I am that kind and caring young man who has been with the same person since the age of sixteen. I waited until marriage for sex, and I realized quickly that the way sexual intimacy and passion flows through my mind and body in no way matches my spouse. I am not looking to change either of our home situations, but I am hoping we can fill the voids in each of our lives. I am very uplifting, caring, compassionate, and giving to a fault. Are you the woman who wants to be on the receiving end of all my hidden passions along with my genuine care for you? Chatting and comforting each other throughout the day and when possible during the evening and weekends sounds like a dream come true. I want to dote upon you, always. Lets move past just text messages and be more vulnerable through pictures, videos, voice chats, and videos chats when our connection starts to take off. That excitement of having someone want you as much as possible just for being who you are is very intoxicating. Concerning age range and physical appearance, I am not seeking a specific body type. Your positive outlook and energy, your creativity, and your caring personality are much higher on my list than being a super model. Honestly, a bright smile and amazing laugh are much more of a turn on than anything. With being a loving father and provider, I have found myself in the athletic frame with more to love in certain areas. I have been on a weight-loss journey this past year, and I am excited to see the progress I can keep making. If you enjoy a thicker (not 300lbs of flab) type of man who is tall, handsome, has a full head of hair, with a warm smile and soothing voice, then I might just be your man. I am a natural leader and pursuer of things. Would you enjoy my attention being placed on you? I hope you feel the inclination to reach out and see if we can make the start of this year so much more wonderful than either of us could have imagined. Maybe you already feel a connection to a tender soul like me? I would love to hear what is going through your mind right from the start . If the type of vulnerability and indepthness of what I have portrayed is not what you are looking for, I sincerely wish you all the best. I hope to make someone feel cared for, wanted, desired, and help them realize just how wonderfully amazing they are. You are wonderfully you, and I am excited to start getting to know and experience just how wonderful!"

But that does sound fun. In search of an ethical non-monogamous, feminist women, sex positive, gross, pain slut who has a twisted mind on par with mine! The deeper and darker your fantasies, the more I want to meet you. Brat at me and I'll brat right back. It's a battle of resolve and I love to win. Located in the south bay to Watsonville About me: Older Pervert looking for a pervette 6'3"" Top/Sadist geeky retro nerd goblin who works in the trucking industry. Hobbies: I can show you I'm tall, dark, and handsome, but interesting? I have to leave some mystery. That's the fun part about meeting a new humans. Vulnerability, emotional intelligence, trust, and safety are very important to me. I'm not looking for a quick scene on a friday night or to jump into a relationship head first. I need to know how deep the well is or we'll both end up splitting our heads open. Let's chat and get to know each other so I can pour myself into you and drink you from within. I require Negotiations and demand aftercare if we do end up playing. I have my shit together in my non- monogamy [egalitarian non-hierarchical polyamory] and kink life [Risk aware consensual kink], [not interested in TPE, M/s] , [D/s is okayish], [Ageplay is where I flourish most]. We all have our baggage and I will not unpack it for you, but that doesn't mean I won't help. I won't leave you dangling on the wash line like grandma's wet panties if times get rough. But I need to know if you can see how the panties got up there, and how to get them down before the wind blows them away. Ultimately this is mutually beneficial exploration and experience that will take our kinks and fetishes to new heights. Build each other up so high we may never come down. I try live by example and I take responsibility and accountability for my actions. I am human, certainly not perfect. I try to be the person I would want to meet at kink events. Generally I'm sweet, patient, loving, kind, goofy, silly, empathic, and I will love on you in public but I'll want to put my cigarette out on your arm and have you thank me for it. A fun night would probably involve plastic sheeting, I'll let your imagination run with that. Don't worry I'm not an ax murderer, but I can play one in the bedroom. I don't drink and I don't care if you do. Give me kisses and I'll buy you drinks. My sense of humor comes out in person better than written. Have you ever stayed awake at night thinking about the futility of life and how little and meaningless our existence is in the grand scheme of things? Hahahaha me either....... Do you need to be put in your place? I have the skills necessary to make that happen. Message me and I'll make your existance and body finally have some meaning and use. Fortune favors the bold. Must hate bees, sorry apiarists. TLDR: If you're scared of a wall of text in a personal ad, you're not the right person, and bees suck, fuck bees. Let's talk on snap and I'll provide a horribly lit bathroom selfie from 5 years ago, sans penis. -Mark"

Im a hopeless romantic, not even close to 7 foot tall but most likely taller (60) than you so dont worry, otherwise pretty normal guy who cant believe hes 21 already and who rarely lets his facial hair go past a few days stubble. I like wandering through the park, befriending strangers dogs, I reply quickly and I will take a quiet night in vs. a loud night out any day of the week, I take excellent care of myself, can talk your ear off about diet and fitness and will probably ask you to come to the gym with me at some point, and think I look ok in a suit as well as out of one. Im also a dom, even though I dont like labels and am still not entirely sure what it means and have yet to explore much of what that even is as Ive been saving it for the right person who I have most likely yet to meet. I mention all of this because its important, much more important than a tedious list of kinks and limits, because Im a person with a life Im passionate about, complete with flaws and imperfections and surprises and depths you should want to learn and love before we discuss our favorite spanking implements (my hands). I never last long on the more blatantly BDSM related sites with their blatantly sexual agenda and blatantly displayed genitalia where people seem to gather to find casual play partners and hairy old dudes to tie them up and take compromising pictures and jump right into things that would take me a really long time to open up to. D/s is not just a sexual dynamic to me; the intense and awesome depth of sexuality it can offer is, instead, an expression and reflection of the intense and awesome vulnerability and love that exist between a master and his Slave. The possession, hunger, electricity, utter filth, blissful peace, and terrifying beauty inherent in an ideal dynamic stem from the mind and the heart, over time and trust, not from hormones in a moment of physical weakness. I need cuddles, patience, warmth, unconditional praise of my cooking, unabashed nerdiness, unwavering loyalty, unlimited kindness, and an embarrassing amount of kissing. But I also need to be able to stop you mid-sentence with a look, pull you to your knees by your hair, earn and exercise complete control over your orgasms, and call you a good girl knowing full well what that does to you. Im a dom, and Im looking for a Slave. Not a Slave, but rather my Slave. Like a one and only forever sort of deal that starts in friendship and blossoms into a love that would make the rest of the world jealous if they could ever understand. I want to date like normal people, only knowing that the endgame includes and involves much more than 5 minutes of missionary once a week. Im not looking for my equal; Im looking for my complement. We will likely be very different in many ways, and I hope we can both learn so much from each other as we build a loving relationship alongside a beautiful d/s dynamic. Maybe weve shared the same dream our whole lives and, in some sense, already know each other better than anyone else. Kinks: Currently my kinks include anal, bondage, punishments, humiliation, degradation, DDLG, orgasm control, orgasm denial, watersports, collaring, CNC. Hard Limits: Will discuss further if we decide to play, but main ones are anything illegal, blood, scat, and more. I hope this was enough to ignite the spark we need to connect. we will never know if you dont reach out. Im not going anywhere, I wont bite (yet), and am clearly a fan of epically long letters, creativity, and originality. But, Just be you. Thats all I can ever ask of you, even without knowing you yet. Im ready. Are you?"

210,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,"31 [M4F/MF/FF] #San Diego/OC - Hoping to find a chill, sexy Asian lady to be FWB, and possibly open to non-sexual fun as well",1,eobggo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/eobggo/31_m4fmfff_san_diegooc_hoping_to_find_a_chill/,2020-01-14 09:20:54,"**This turned out much longer than I wanted it to be. Feel free to read the essay below, or skip to the tl;dr at the end** I happen to have an attraction to Asian ladies. Not in a creepy, fetishizing way. I'm not looking for a stereotype. Just a real person who happens to fall within a certain physical spectrum I personally find visually and sexually appealing. There. Hopefully that came across as minimally creepy haha. I'm looking for something casual, but with mutual respect/likability. We each doing our own thing in our own time. But meeting up now and then for fun to help relieve some of the stresses of being big boys and girls, and maybe explore and fulfill some fantasies in the process. Also down to hang out some outside the bedroom if we share some common interests, and enjoy each other's company in a non-sexual way. I find I get along best with those that are: open minded, non judgmental, more liberally inclined in their political outlook and that try to stay aware of what's going on in the world. Intelligence and the ability to articulate your thoughts is really fucking sexy. In the bedroom, I love a lady that isn't afraid to embrace her kinkier side or desires. Not being afraid to let go of your inhibitions and get lost in your pleasure is one of the sexiest traits a woman can have in my opinion, and I never abuse that trust or vulnerability. I'm familiar with some aspects of kink and have light experience in some aspects of BDSM. If you're experienced, or just curious about any of the above, let's go down the rabbit hole together. I'm also open to ladies in a relationship, if SO is fully aware. And, if you two play as a couple, I do enjoy joining in as a third every now and then, which is why this posting is also M4MF/FF. That last is a long shot, but never hurts to try. If you've never been in a threesome, 10/10, would very much recommend. If you've read all this way and you're thinking, ""Well, I'm super intrigued, but I'm not Asian"", please feel free to reply anyway. It's a strong preference on my part but not an exclusive one, and I'm not the type to burn down potential bridges before even crossing them. I'm also open to most body types, from petite to curvy, to chubby. This is much less of a dealbreaker for me than personality and compatibility. Hit me up and let's see where things lead. tl;dr Me lookee for Asian lady for the snu-snu and to make the ""schlick-schlick"" sounds with"

Emotionally balanced and looking for a D/s relationship or a steady play partner. I am single and unattached (divorced). Im not lifestyle and I look clean cut and one would never guess. Seeking someone to share time with and get to know and have more deep exploration with each other over time. Being able to connect on a vanilla level is a must. Daddy dom play is something Ive done before and find enjoyable but definitely not a requirement Im basically looking for someone experienced or inexperienced, get to know each other and feel comfortable, and explore things and go in and out of role. Duration of role can grow if we both want that. I have good experience as a Dom. I can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy control and teaching someone about the darker pleasures. Newbies are ok. I tilt a little more towards the BD than SM as I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. In particular Im skilled with rope play, and love bondage, exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I consider myself high EQ and I look academic, like a modern professor Ive been told. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, love to learn and happy and balanced by nature. I dont fit the mold of a Dom (aggressive, asshole, jerk etc). Behind bedroom doors its another story as we meet and take on our roles. Hate to say this, but after posting a few times I need to be clear that I am seeking someone without serious mental health problems and who has never been in a psychiatric hospital before. We all find life stressful but my preference is to find someone who can handle explorations of trust and control in a fun way When replying please state age, general location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation.

I'd prefer to leave most of the ""getting to know you"" to our actual talk, but I'd like to think I'm a rather interesting, erudite lad with an interesting take on life, people, love, and phone sex - with a soothing voice and a penchant for the profound. I really don't care what you're wearing or how nice your boobs are - I care deeply about how you feel about what we share, where you find meaning in life, and what it's like to be present in the moment. Intrigued enough? Try me. Shoot an orange-red with a quick blurb about you, why you'll be up for the next 4+ hours, and where I might reach you on a voice-capable platform of your choosing. Who knows, perhaps we'll find something beautiful and lasting tonight."

I'm 5'11, 160, fairly good shape, single (divorced) great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy being a dominant. Im an experienced Daddy Dom for those who enjoy that as well. No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction, want an arrangement where we meet a few times a month, understand the focus is on exploring dominance/submission, and not be lost and excessively clingy. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on vanilla topics. Thank you"

No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction and not be lost. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. Lately I want to fine tune my skills with spankings so sex isnt the priority for me. Skill building is On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. You: no serious mental health problems and no BBWs If you write please state age, location, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on vanilla topics. Please remember to include the details I wrote in your first reply Thanks"

Emotionally balanced and looking for a D/s relationship or a steady play partner. I am single and unattached (divorced). Im not lifestyle and I look clean cut and one would never guess. Seeking someone to share time with and get to know and have more deep exploration with each other over time. Being able to connect on a vanilla level is a must. Daddy dom play is something Ive done before and find enjoyable but definitely not a requirement Im basically looking for someone experienced or inexperienced, get to know each other and feel comfortable, and explore things and go in and out of role. Duration of role can grow if we both want that. I have good experience as a Dom. I can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy control and teaching someone about the darker pleasures. Newbies are ok. I tilt a little more towards the BD than SM as I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. In particular Im skilled with rope play, and love bondage, exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I consider myself high EQ and I look academic, like a modern professor Ive been told. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, love to learn and happy and balanced by nature. I dont fit the mold of a Dom (aggressive, asshole, jerk etc). Behind bedroom doors its another story as we meet and take on our roles. Hate to say this, but after posting a few times I need to be clear that I am seeking someone without serious mental health problems and who has never been in a psychiatric hospital before. We all find life stressful but my preference is to find someone who can handle explorations of trust and control in a fun way When replying please state age, general location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation. I prefer to start on vanilla topics. Please include these 4 pieces of info in your reply"

I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Im only interested in those that have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste.

While I'd love to drive somewhere, meet for coffee and decide we vibe well enough for you to fuck me, I had a big STD scare that's made me cool it on the mindless stranger fucking. (Thanks asshole who ruined it for me). So I settled on the next best thing: trying to actually build a romantic relationship. With feelings, vulnerability, and someone to enable my cravings. Like chili cheese dogs. So good but so bad. I'm kinda serious about this so would really appreciate it if you're also kinda done with stranger fucks and want something more. Anyway, a lil bout me. Think 24 year old Korean, worried about her savings account and the fact that she may never be able to adopt a dog or a cat because **finance**. Legally blind so you bet your ass I'm bespectacled, minus the beauty. If you take away my glasses, I won't be able to see your face unless our noses are near-touching. ~~But I can still find your dick~~. So yeah, legally blind. Hopefully you're between 24-27, Korean or east Asian, fumbling with relationships but sexually at ease. I like sucking dick to khiphop but I also like knitting scarves to khiphop. Yeah, I said it: I knit shit. So maybe I'll knit you a scarf for Christmas if I like you. And maybe I'll try to knit you a matching hat and make you wear it so you can look stupid cute. But I'd never make you wear it in public, I'm not that big of a jerk. And if you haven't noticed, I'm kind of a cockslut and I make jokes but I realized this isn't really the best mindset to have. Especially since I do want a healthy relationship that isn't just me bouncing on cock while big hands grip my ass. Aside from the STD scare, the guy wasn't into talking post-fuck. Which, yeah I'm horny and would love to be boned by you, but I have feelings too dude. I wanna know about your day and if something pissed you off, I wanna take away the bad vibes while I spoon you, and if something made you happy, let me tell you how awesome it is that it happened and we'll eat your favorite things while we watch wholesome shows like TGBBO. And if you had a whatever day with nothing to note, maybe we can cuddle and take a nap because I fucking love those. Then I had an epiphany and realized this is probably more boyfriend-territory. But holy shit, dating is so hard. I thought apps were supposed to make it easier but it just hurts more. LOL. So I'm on here. I'm grossly sarcastic but I've got a soft core and I can hold a conversation lol. It's sunny and warm in my area right now which means I'll either hit up some dessert places or just stay in my room and play my old gameboy sp. My day is looking incredibly eventful but I'm positive you could top whatever I've got comin at me. Badum tss."

Here are some for you, answer which ever interest you. And ask a question in return for each you answer. Did you appreciate how attractive you were, at your best? You have to lose one sense - which would you miss most if you were denied it when with a partner, hearing or taste? What was the last thing you found surprisingly erotic? Either being denied an orgasm or having them forced upon you, which would you rather experience, and which would you rather inflict? Which famous person's attractiveness is most underrated? You're challenged to make your partner orgasm. You have one hour, but may only touch them for thirty seconds. What would you do or say to lead them to that point of desperate, needy vulnerability, or do you think you would lose the bet? Think of the sexual accomplishment that brings you most pride, and the one that brings you most shame. Which do you dwell on more? You can make one element of your appearance perfect, but it will cost you one finger. Do you accept, and what do you change? When you're browsing through here, have you ever found what you hungered for, and what was it? Any answers, thoughts, comments, questions, anecdotes, criticisms, insights and insults welcome."

Having done this a few times, I can help put you at ease during our time together. I truly love catering to your pleasure and making the experience all about you. While it can seem selfish to ask someone please you without doing anything in return, I believe it's something everyone should experience at least once. Receiving pleasure from a fully-willing and enthusiastic partner is amazing. I'm a confident guy who's also gentle, loving, and considerate. I'm well groomed, clean, and thoughtful. I'm told I'm good looking and I smell nice. I enjoy pleasuring women who have rarely or never orgasmed (from oral or otherwise). I've given several women their first oral orgasm, or their first in a long time. I'm very flexible, patient, and giving. I love long oral sessions and can attend to you for as long as you want. Hit me up if you're interested! **\*\* This next section puts me over that TL;DR limit, so only read this if you're curious \*\*** ***An extra note for those who have questions about what such an encounter is like:*** I like to approach giving un-reciprocated oral one of two ways: The Boyfriend Experience vs. Pure Oral Only. With the Boyfriend Experience our time together would play out much like your boyfriend is giving you oral on your birthday. I like to start with kissing and include some other foreplay before I start to go down on you. If you haven't done this before, you may be pleasantly surprised at just how natural it feels once we start to kiss, and the nervousness fades quickly. For your comfort, I leave my clothes on the entire time unless you desire otherwise. Some women prefer Pure Oral Only; no kissing or other foreplay. In that case I'll suggest we move to the bedroom when it seems you're ready. Some women just remove their bottoms while others take off more. You're welcome to do whatever you're comfortable with in the moment. Again, any nervousness tends fades very quickly once things get started. With Pure Oral Only I almost always stay dressed. Speaking of ""in the moment"": I always respect your right to change your mind about anything at any time, even if that means you want to stop at the last second. No pressure, ever. Before we meet I'll ask you if you have a style preference. If you don't indicate a preference, I'll favor the Boyfriend Experience since I think it tends to feel the most natural and familiar. Remember, you can change your mind at any point. I encourage you to let me know anything that will help you get what you want out of this experience. Let's talk, share a picture or two, and then we can meet."

Emotionally balanced and looking for a D/s relationship or a steady play partner. I am single and unattached (divorced). Im not lifestyle and I look clean cut and one would never guess. Seeking someone to share time with and get to know and have more deep exploration with each other over time. Being able to connect on a vanilla level is a must. Daddy dom play is something Ive done before and find enjoyable but definitely not a requirement Im basically looking for someone experienced or inexperienced, get to know each other and feel comfortable, and explore things and go in and out of role. Duration of role can grow if we both want that. I have good experience as a Dom. I can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy control and teaching someone about the darker pleasures. Newbies are ok. I tilt a little more towards the BD than SM as I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. In particular Im skilled with rope play, and love bondage, exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I consider myself high EQ and I look academic, like a modern professor Ive been told. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, love to learn and happy and balanced by nature. I dont fit the mold of a Dom (aggressive, asshole, jerk etc). Behind bedroom doors its another story as we meet and take on our roles. Hate to say this, but after posting a few times I need to be clear that I am seeking someone without serious mental health problems and who has never been in a psychiatric hospital before. We all find life stressful but my preference is to find someone who can handle explorations of trust and control in a fun way When replying please state age, general location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation. I prefer to start on vanilla topics. Please include these 4 pieces of info in your reply"

In this post, I am going to be vulnerable and allow you to see many parts of me. Even if my wants and desires dont line up with yours, I hope that knowing you are not alone in having a marriage/relationship that leaves you left wanting, comforts you. I am not an arrogant man in the slightest, but I know for a fact you have never met or conversed with a man quite like me. If you have seen that Dad at the grocery store or in the mall with his wife and young kids being loving, caring, and genuinely affectionate to everyone around him, you have seen someone similar to me. What you havent seen is the part of me that is buried deep inside  the part of me which has been hidden from everyone, including my wife, since the early days of my marriage. I know the dichotomy of me is not normal, but I am what I am. My wife and I waited until marriage to have sex. We sometimes went a little too far while making out of course, but never venturing past certain points until our wedding night. The anticipation and excitement that 19-year-old me had quickly vanished into a young man who was hesitant, confused, and emotionally hurt by the indifference and neglect which quickly became the norm. I am not posting here or sharing these things to bring pity at all. My intention is just to give background to why I became how I am. These past 13 years or so have been filled with sleepless nights, numbing days, and times where the need to escape and actually be wanted, needed, and desired in intimate and sexual ways becomes overwhelmingly powerful. I am the most kind, most compassionate, most emotionally available man you will ever meet, but I am also the most passionate, most desiring, and most insatiable man you will ever meet. Insatiable in a way where the tenderness that is ingrained within me never leaves. I am searching for someone who has had similar experiences as me. You have this entire side of you which your SO has never really known or has stopped pursuing. For this Holiday Season, Im hoping to find someone who enjoys the pursuit, the vulnerability, and the excitement/passion that comes with this type of seduction. I am naturally a more dominant person concerning sex, but not in a violent or misogynistic way. I fantasize about talking with you while Im at work (both sfw and nsfw), sneaking away during my lunch for phone calls, being available to hear about everything that is happening in your life every day, and possibly meeting and memorizing the taste of your lips. Physically, I am tall with a solid, athletic build with that Dad-bod physique at the moment. Im down about thirty pounds from my heaviest, and Im excited to keep improving myself.

342,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,[SUCCESS] 27 [F4M] #LosAngeles My first BWC (warning: raceplay themes) (x-post from /r/Cuckold),139,d24b9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/d24b9t/success_27_f4m_losangeles_my_first_bwc_warning/,2019-09-10 17:39:42,"First time writing about my first BWC experience.. Im not sure where to start or even how to go about this, but Ive been getting a lot of requests for a success story update, so here I go! A little background story about me: raised in a conservative Korean family (brainwashed that sex/lust is bad), never masturbated before my current bf, and Ive had 4 Korean bfs and of those I slept with only 3 guys total in my life, until Labor Day weekend.. I was a basic, (to my standards at the time) having sex with my bf maybe once or twice a month type of low sex-drive, boring, nervous, closed-minded, prude girl. (Yeah, Ive come a long way since 3 years ago..) Ive been with my current boyfriend for about 3 years and he planted the seed of this cuckold fantasy pretty early on in our relationship. And as you can rightfully assume, I was extremely reluctant. I honestly thought my bf was a super pervert with this out of this world fantasy which I never in a million years thought Id actually bring to life! Over the course of 3 years, hes continuously and soundly weathered down my prudence and skepticism one cum at a time. I always loved the idea of giving my bf sexual satisfaction (almost thought of it as my job) and one thing he ALWAYS gets off on is this cuckold fantasy. Talking about it for so many nights really helped desensitize the initial disgusting feeling and I slowly grew into the fantasy myself. About 1 year into the introduction of this fantasy, I casually started posting on reddit, starting with underwear pics and then eventually nude pics too. I was surprised there was even a community for me to anonymously post and receive feedbacks lol. As Im sure most girls on [/r/AsiansGoneWild](URL know, the flood of encouraging messages really boosts ones confidence! So I had an encouragement boost to pursue this experience further with my bfs guidance and decided to post my first ad in search for my bull about a year ago. I wasnt as picky as I am now in the beginning, I promise  I honestly didnt know what I was looking for, until I met some of the guys.. One was too old, one had bad breath, some were too submissive, even too creepy? And another lured me into a private room, so I felt super nervous and awkward when I didnt feel safe/in control. Ive been through so many disappointments that I couldnt find anyone I vibe with these past 2 years and I was ready to give up. I even thought that maybe Im just not meant to sleep with BWC lol. The most recent disappointment I had to deal with was a flaky masseuse who I could write another entire story about. After booking/paying for the room myself, I confirmed with him that he was going to show up and he reassured me repeatedly that he would and he's really excited to see me. I really put myself out there, and what do you know, he flakes on me. I didnt think I could do this anymore. I expressed to my bf how depressed and unwanted I felt, and told him out of frustration Ill never do this again! And decided to just go get a massage by a professional to decompress my stress. While I was in the massage, my bf mocked up the idea of a last minute ad on reddit (I was hopeless, didnt think Ill find ANYONE Ill be interested to meet) so I said Sure! Why the heck not, I have nothing more to lose! I received more messages than I expected, at least hundreds, so unfortunately, I did not respond to most, one reason being because they didnt include face pics. (I understand its a lot to ask, and it isnt fair, but I needed someone who can take that leap of faith) But ONE guy stood out from all the messages, I actually missed his message because he didnt attach any pictures, but my bf caught that he had included his public IG account! Lol I immediately appreciated his vulnerability for sharing his instagram with me (pretty active too, not a dead/fake acct) So we planned to meet at a bar! Of course, I had my guard up after being flaked on the same day. First impression: cute, nice smile, looks a bit shy.. hmm I wonder if he could be dominant in bed? (Lol still skeptical) We continued our pleasant intro convo, and I think I may have pretended to act more tough than how I actually felt inside because I didnt want to repeat the awkwardness of my prior meetups when I was too much in my head lol and so I might have had one too many drinks to help with that. I would like to believe we vibed well (mutually), so we made our way up to my room... and I set up my phone to record my historic moment for my bf with my bulls consent... The details of the actions that happened from this point forward are very blurred tbh but the feelings that he made me feel are so vivid it still gets me soooo wet. He was everything I was looking for, waiting for, and more in ways I didnt even know was possible. Tbh, I never really understood the difference between Asian guys and white guys. By this I mean to say, I never appreciated the difference in size or the masculine features, because my bf was the tallest, biggest Korean guy Ive ever been with, and although I recognized the difference between him and my smaller exes, the difference in feeling and sexual desire wasn't that big. (Maybe because the Asian guys Ive been with were more submissive and considerate towards me during sex) But, this experience really blew me away, the way he effortlessly took me and fucked me like Ive never been fucked before, the way he went so deep into me that it hurt (in a good way). It felt like I was being conquered by a superior more masculine breed of man. I didnt want him to stop. I didnt want him to pull out, I wanted him to keep going, just keep going, Ive never felt this way before in my life. I promised my bf Ill use a condom since Im not on birth control, but I was SO turned on and felt so submissive in the moment, I let him go bare! I couldnt believe it, but it felt AMAZING I just couldnt say no to him.. I caressed his wide shoulders, his fit body and made out with him so passionately. Omg, I still cannot get over his BWC. I dont usually have this yearning for sex, but this was something else. After the BEST SEX of my life, I came home to my bf who had stayed up all night waiting for me.. I immediately ran into his arms, and we cuddled.. I enthusiastically showed him my video, he was SO turned on, yet SO hurt and worried that Id leave him I would never leave my bf! I assured him, comforted him and thanked him for opening my world to this fantasy and for trusting me with his heart that Id never leave him for a bull. After my first BWC experience, Ive lost the little sexual attraction I had left for my bf and decided to stop having sex with him entirely.. he begs me everyday for sex, but I just lovingly calm him down and tell him he can't satisfy me anymore and that I deserve a BWC. (This turns on my bf so much btw lol so it's not as cruel as it sounds) So if there are any other Asian guys out there wanting to convince their gfs to cuckold them, let this be a warning to you, I just cannot look at Asian guys the same way I used to lol so you should make sure she loves you before trying this kind of experience. This was my first big step into this fantasy, and so far everything has been amazing, I want to do right by my bf and my bull, and be as honest and forthright as I can about everything. As long as I stick to that, I look forward to more sexy times and exploring this adventure with my bf Hey you, (to my bull) if youre reading this, I hope to see you this weekend and you better be ready to fuck me again like last time! Ill be dripping wet waiting for your BWC Screenshots from the video: [URL"

I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it.

I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Im only interested in those that have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste.

Maybe you have experimented with a past boyfriend but want more. You've imagined being told what to wear, how to stand, being spanked and having your body used completely. Maybe a little hair pulling, being tied up while someone fingers you until you have cum multiple times. You want to feel that you no longer have control, and you will be exhilarated and feel almost trance like when we meet. I like the nervousness that comes from the first meeting. The stammering when you are given a direct order, the surprise you feel when you actually do as your told and how good it feels to follow direction. I love creating the feelings of vulnerability and trust when I am dressed and you are completely naked with your clothes confiscated. I love stripping and inspecting you for the first time, checking for wetness and finding your pussy dripping. We take it slow and easy. I am looking for someone to explore intense power exchange scenarios with. I am an experienced, over-educated, 42, fit bike rider, art lover, white, employed, successful confident guy."
357,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,46 [M4F] San Francisco - Let me introduce you to the joys of accepting un-reciprocated oral pleasure from others,1,db2adu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/db2adu/46_m4f_san_francisco_let_me_introduce_you_to_the/,2019-09-30 08:27:43,"I know making plans to receive un-reciprocated oral from a stranger can be nerve-wracking, and it requires no small amount of vulnerability on your part. I've been on Reddit for a while, met a few women, and I can definitely help put you at ease. While I love being catered to, and I've had plenty of opportunities to enjoy an attentive partner whose sole desire is to give me pleasure, I fully adore catering to someone else's pleasure and making the experience all about you. For most, it seems like a very selfish act to let someone please you without doing anything in return. But I firmly believe it's something everyone should experience -- and hopefully often. Receiving from a fully-willing partner feeds your soul, restores your faith in the giving and loving nature of others, and heals. I'm a confident guy who's also gentle, loving, and considerate. I'm well groomed, clean, and thoughtful. I'm told I'm good looking and I smell nice. However, if you want it rough I may not be the best choice. I also enjoy pleasuring women who have rarely or never orgasmed (from oral or otherwise). I've given several women their first oral orgasm, or their first in a long time. I'm very flexible, patient, and giving. I can attend to you for anywhere from 20 to 90+ minutes, depending on what *you* want, and I love long oral sessions. Feel free to tell me any concerns you may have, or what you'd like out of such an encounter. &amp;#x200B; **\*\* This next section puts me over the TL;DR limit, so only read this if you're curious \*\*** ***An extra note for those who have questions about what such an encounter is like:*** In my experience you can approach un-reciprocated oral two ways: The Boyfriend Experience vs. Pure Oral Only. With the Boyfriend Experience the evening plays out much like your boyfriend is giving you oral for your birthday. I like to start with a kiss and include some other foreplay before going down on you. You'll be surprised at just how natural it feels once we start to kiss, and the nervousness fades quickly. For your comfort, I leave my clothes on the entire time unless you desire otherwise. Some women prefer Pure Oral Only; no kissing or other foreplay. In that case I'll suggest we move to the bed when it seems you're ready. Some women just remove their bottoms while others take off more. Do what you're comfortable with in the moment. Again, the nervousness fades very quickly once things get started. With Pure Oral Only I usually stay dressed. Speaking of ""in the moment"": You retain all rights to change your mind about anything at any time. I don't care what we're doing, I will respect your wishes, even if that means you want to back out at the last second. No pressure, ever. Before we meet I'll ask you if you have a style preference. If not, I'll favor the Boyfriend Experience since it tends to feel the most natural and familiar. Remember, you can change your mind at any point. Of course, I also welcome women with lots of experience who know exactly what they want and like."

Im a goofball from NY looking for someone who craves emotional openness and the rawness of vulnerability with a dominant partner who will respect their needs and limits, help them towards self-improvement, and be an overall pretty awesome friend. Im 24, male, white, 59, average build, queer, feminist, liberal, and work in environmental tech. I lean introvert and have lots of varied hobbies (PC and Switch gaming, reading history and nonfiction, D&amp;D, hiking/kayaking/adventuring, sports, cooking and foodie activities, podcasts, digital art etc). Im very career driven and am always trying to learn something new! Open communication is absolutely essential to me- this means talking about desires, limits, interests, relationship boundaries, etc. Similarly, consent and respect are concepts I take very seriously. From my experience this mutual effort at communication is particularly necessary when kink is involved. I have a broad list of kink interests and experience, and I love learning and talking about BDSM and sexuality. I really like rules and training, praise, positions, verbal responses and protocol. I crave getting into a partners mind, learning every nook and cranny of their sexuality to use against them in the best way possible. I find it much more empowering to make someone want to submit to me, and prove it, than to take power from them. Orgasm control, sensation play, relentless teasing, dirty talk and humiliation are my top kinks, but Im very open minded and love helping partners explore their interests. I can give more details about my kinks, limits etc if we talk more! Im looking for a submissive female or female presenting fellow goofball online or in the US Northeast who is open to non-monogamy (non-hierarchical poly), as I have a long-distance partner. I need to get to know my partners and establish mutual trust to have a power dynamic, so open communicators to the front! Intelligence, drive, an absurdist sense of humor, and emotional maturity are extremely attractive to me. Im also potentially interested in talking with couples who are looking to share dominance or explore subbing together. If this sounds like anything youre interested in, send me a message! If not and you read this far anyway, I hope you find what youre looking for. :)"

The 36 questions in the study are broken up into three sets, with each set intended to be more probing than the previous one. The idea is that mutual vulnerability fosters closeness. To quote the studys authors, One key pattern associated with the development of a close relationship among peers is sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personal self-disclosure. Allowing oneself to be vulnerable with another person can be exceedingly difficult, so this exercise forces the issue. I JUST read a psychology article on this and thought it was absolutely awesome.

It is what I carry with me all time, it's mine entirely. It is who I am. And it should only be me, who gets to decide what to do with it. And I love it, in its rawest form. I love being naked, without a stitch covering me at all. The sensation of the line between the world around me and my body shedding away, as I shed every piece of clothing away. That's what I live for. Have you ever been naked in outdoor? Feeling the breeze wrapping you, caressing every single nook and cranny and curve and crevice, it's an exhilarating feeling. As the sun shines on you, you feel alive, knowing that you are how you are meant to be. Or have you been naked with others? It can be ""odd"". Maybe for a minute or two. But as the shame and prudishness melts away, and vulnerability makes way to familiarity, nakedness becomes a tool of warmth. Seeing other people's bodies, as they see yours, in its purest form is amazing. It can be sexy, and sensual, just like any other form of dress. But it can also be warm, cozy, and just natural. Let's talk. Women only."

I'm sure you can understand. I'm not one for the typical blas variations of phone sex (apparel interrogation et. al) and thrive on the more raw, real, vulnerable intimacy sort. Actually, orgasms/PG rated material is entirely optional, though it certainly exists (and in spades) should we mutually choose to open that door. What I'm looking for is someone who can just *be*, without much need for pretense, small talk, awkward pleasantries, or a therapist's license.

Looking for a best friend to share my life with. Someone to have sexy adventures with. Someone to feel safe with in every way. We can start online or long distance. Open to people in the continental US - to make travel easier on both of us. If things go well we can meet in person. I want to live with a kinky partner. I have a house here and am likely to stay. 1.

Looking for love and romance - with a side of handcuffs. One day - a collar. 4. I am open to exploring group sex and possibly opening the relationship more over time. My life took me to dark places. I walked through the fires. I was forged in them and came out stronger. Do you want to delve into the darkness with me? We can find things to enjoy and explore. We can laugh at the darkness. We can find pleasure there. Together. Who am I? - I try to make the world a better place. I know how hard life can be. No one has to go through life alone. I love sharing the lessons my life taught me. I can connect with most people pretty easily. I overcame many obstacles to become the person I am today. I have stories to share. Stories about my travels and the people I met. Stories about injuring myself the first night of a 2 week trans-atlantic cruise - really, not fair life. Stories about all my favorite songs. 6 foot. Big Handsome Man. Beard. Glasses. Charming. Contagious laughter. I do not smoke, drink, or do drugs. Financially secure. Multiple degrees. I am well educated, intelligent, and understanding. I am very good at breaking down complicated concepts and pulling out something simple and clear. I enjoy the search for answers to questions I never knew I had. I have been kinky by myself. I had difficulty finding people who understood. Until now. It is a wonderful feeling - being accepted and understood. Being seen. When I discovered bdsm - I found a place to belong. Where things make sense. I am pansexual. Hearts not parts. I am open to all body types. The more I like you mentally - the more I will like you physically. Looking for feminine energy - women, transwomen, crossdressing men. I want to dress someone in cute outfits. And do un-cute things to them. I tend to fall for people through nerdy conversations about passions. Lets get deep on something one of us cares about. We can learn from each other. I recently learned about the real pirates of the Caribbean - yo ho! Huge Disney fan! I enjoy spending time with friends. I travel about once a year - many of my travels these days are deep into the corners of the human mind. I have a weakness for accents. My natural southern accent is one of my strengths. I love talking on the phone / through voice chat. I love getting to know people through long rambling conversations. I love to dream and improvise. I am very silly. I love making people laugh. I have a darker sense of humor. I am pretty relaxed overall - but I love getting excited and enthusiastic about things. My love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I am incredibly optimistic. I accept things as they are - then find a path forward. I am kind and compassionate. I am empathetic and emotionally intelligent. I am nurturing. I like being the person that my friends can rely on. I love music. I have a thing for rap, rock, 80s pop hits (I CAN go for that), and music with really deep lyrics. I love how my feelings will magically line up with songs I am listening to. I love musicals like Hamilton (Wait for it!). I love falling into any storytelling experience. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I like watching Netflix. I love playing video games - especially JRPGs. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). I like documentaries. I love mythology. I love superhero, horror, crime, sci-fi, fantasy, action, comedy, thrillers. I love magic and stand up comedy. I love when they defy expectations. Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. It keeps me laughing during good and bad times. I occasionally host board game nights with my friends. I enjoy going to the movies and the occasional escape room. I love museums. Seeking - Passionate. Caring. Understanding. Curious. Nurturing. Affectionate. You love to listen. You like to tease, laugh, and play. You have an open mind. You love sharing your thoughts and feelings. You are comfortable with vulnerability. You are enthusiastic and willing to explore our kinks together. What am I looking for in a relationship? - Companionship. Romance. Intimacy and kink with someone I can trust, rely on, and depend on. Someone I can lean on during hard times. Someone to cum with and someone to talk to. We can tease each other with inside jokes and bad jokes. Laughing until we hurt and we have to stop to catch our breath. We can help each other get what we want. Help bring our fantasies to life. Inside and outside of kink. Inside BDSM - I like flipping between Daddy and Dom mode. I love the contrast between sweet and sadistic. I love showering my submissive with praise and affection. And degradation. Using them to satisfy myself. Training them to satisfy me. You will make my needs and getting me off - especially orally - a priority. We can discuss this - and more as we get comfortable with each other. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. We can find your limits and keep them sacred or push them until we find new ones. Limits are - scat, blood, weapons, needles, heavy impact play, dangerous breathplay and choking. Hold my hand. Let's build a safe place. A relationship with trust, respect, and vulnerability. Together. I can be your bright, shining light in the darkness. You can be mine. Send me a PM - What did you connect with? What are you looking for? Ask me anything. Good Luck everyone!

I suggest you read my previous post on my profile to get a better feel for me, even if BDSM isnt your thing. Ive met some amazing people through Reddit that have changed the course of my life forever. I also have the matching scars from the inevitable crashes that accompanied each one. I specifically choose to try again, even having been heartbroken in the not so distant past. Ive gotten some incredible responses from my recent post and love chatting to see if we are compatible people, have similar wants, etc. I truly love getting to know the people of some of these communities, even if things dont work out. This post is about the flip side of vulnerability: honesty. It can be difficult, but its what I crave. Im looking for someone thatll be my partner in crime. Someone I can say anything to without judgement. Someone to watch Netflix with just as much as to use sex toys on (or both? A little Netflix and chill with this inside you? Sign me up). Im looking for someone ravishingly beautiful that takes my breath away and makes me smile everytime I see her. But every beautiful woman Ive had the pleasure of knowing would never have thought of herself as being beautiful. So let me be the one to decide that. I tend to prefer thinner women, but my tastes are wide ranging. Please dont hold back from sending me a message because I wrote this. Its just a bit of realistic honesty. Your physical attributes are only one aspect of that beauty. Your mind will really be what gets me addicted and wanting more. I want to be a fixture in your life, and to give you a starring role in mine. I want to listen and talk and spoil you and learn and laugh and share and get off and repeat all of it. Im tall, smart, have a promising career, handsome when I try, adorable when I dont, goofy always, and want you to feel really fucking good. Dont take that as me not delving into the darker aspects of our kinks. But Ill make sure the aftercare you get is just as powerful. If you made it all the way here, I honestly thank you. I hope you understood where most of the above was coming from. Send me a message. Lets talk."

I am nurturing. I like being a safe place that my friends can rely on. Hold on to that feeling. I love music. I have a thing for rap, rock, 80s pop hits (I CAN go for that), and music with really deep lyrics. I love how my feelings will magically line up with songs I am listening to. I love musicals like Hamilton (Wait for it!). I love falling into any storytelling experience. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I like watching Netflix. I love playing video games - especially JRPGs. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). I like documentaries. I love mythology. I love superhero, horror, crime, sci-fi, fantasy, action, comedy, thrillers. I love magic and stand up comedy. I love when they defy expectations. They give me great ideas... Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. It keeps me laughing during good and bad times. I occasionally host board game nights with my friends. I enjoy going to the movies and the occasional escape room. I love museums. Seeking - Someone to share my life with. A best friend to have sexy adventures with. Curious. Caring. Sensual. Someone who wants to be understood. Looking for someone who can be my rock in the storm. Someone kind and affectionate. Someone who likes to listen. Someone who likes to tease, laugh, and play. My partner can be my cheerleader - inside and outside the bedroom. Someone to hold my hand on the bad pain nights. My safe place. Who will become devoted and passionate about pleasing inside bdsm. Someone with an open mind. Someone enthusiastic and willing to explore our kinks together. We can encourage and help each other get what we want. Help bring our fantasies to life. Inside and outside of kink. No experience necessary - this will go slowly. What am I looking for in a relationship? - Companionship. Intimacy, sex, and kink with someone I can trust, rely on, and depend on. Someone I can lean on during hard times. Someone to cum with and someone to talk to. We can tease each other with inside jokes and bad jokes. Laughing until we hurt and we have to stop to catch our breath. I am a romantic at heart. The destination is not quite as important as the journey. Dont stop believin BDSM - I can train someone to be Daddy's little princess, whore, cheerleader, slave, and cumdumpster. Into ageplay. CNC and freeuse. Dirty talk. Degradation. Lots of oral and deepthroat. Curious about bondage and sensory deprivation. Also into - orgasm control, multiple orgasm, worshipping, objectification, mindfuck. I am curious about petplay, Cg/l, master / slave. Collaring. I want to build a safe place for us to explore emotional highs and lows together. To go to the edge as a team. Then come back to reality. Hand in hand. I want to dress you in cute little outfits. Then roleplay. I like flipping between Daddy and Dom mode. I love the contrast between sweet and sadistic. Also I have a little side, but it is dominant. So I am sort of switchy. We can discuss this - and more once we get comfortable with each other. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. We can find your limits and keep them sacred or push them until we find new ones. Limits are - scat, blood, weapons, needles, heavy impact play, dangerous breathplay and choking. The movie never ends - it goes on, and on, and on, and on Get outta my sweet dreams. Get into my fast car. Hold my hand. Let's build a safe place together. We can build a relationship with trust, respect, and vulnerability. Together. I can be your bright, shining light in the darkness. You can be mine. Send me a PM - What resonated with you? Ask me anything. Good Luck everyone! Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day. Dont stop!"

I'm looking for a kinky play partner in Chicago to further explore kinks, fantasies, and general sexuality. **I'm 30, live in River North, and am originally from Chicago...** I've been seriously kinky- as in making kink exploration a priority, experimenting, and even partaking in the Chicago community- for about 5 years now. On top of kink, my passions include: cooking, spiritual study, design, video games, music &amp; movies, travel, and architecture, to name a few. Kink wise, I've evolved and shifted here and there to where I currently stand. I am definitely *Dominant,* and enjoy being in control; I've discovered I'm not a very jealous person, and a true hedonist, this has played into some of my kinks shaping (like group play &amp; swinging), and my desire to explore them. **My biggest kinks**, or biggest kink- as you'll see from my history, is extreme dirty talk. I love communication in and out of the bedroom; I think it's incredibly important to maintain any kind of relationship, but especially one where we're playing with kinks, fantasies, and each other. I also love anal, cum play, fashion play, free use, pet play, role play, toy use, edging, orgasm control, rough oral, public, exhibitionism, voyuerism, being rough, cock worship, sleep play, group, attention play... and a few others. I'm most curious to explore more deeply what I haven't been able to, that is swinging, group play, and cuckqueaning. When it comes to a partner I prefer aggressive, confident, service-oriented submissives. A sub who needs dominance constantly asserted, I find... well, boring (nothing against people who enjoy it, of course). I long for someone who wants to be the biggest slut in the room, someone who imagines all the ways they can fuck, just as I do. Someone who loves pleasing and giving, but also enjoys receiving and being pampered. I'm looking for the kind of girl who reads- or even better- posts on r/stupidslutsclub. There have been a lot of relationships I've had with mismatched sexuality, still plenty of kinky relationships where the sub thought that being a sub meant just laying there. If you're new, make no mistake, this shit takes work on both sides. Communication, vulnerability, *and* trust are required to go where I want go and do what I want to do. **Kinks I'm not into** include scat, blood, vomit, knifes, needles, extreme violence, resistance... **What I'm trying to create relationship wise** is something intimate and vulnerable where we can share, fuck, and grow. I'm looking for a fellow sex scientist, someone submissive in the bedroom, not outside it. Together, I want to create a relationship to explore our kinks and fantasies, and try things that maybe we didn't even think we'd like. I'm open to it being casual, or developing into something serious, monogamous or open (I love the idea of cuckqueaning, and of hot-wifing/hot-husbanding). So long as there's trust, unconditional communication, and us respecting our own- and each others- boundaries I don't think anything bad can happen that can't be dealt with. **As for you**, I need you to be intelligent, driven, strong, capable, and a total, stupid fucking slut. Someone who is brave enough to communicate unconditionally, and is seeking to build something just like me. [Someone who laughs at this comic](URL or at least gets it. Physically speaking, I'm 5'10'', 175, white, handsome face, great cock. If you're the type to ghost, flake, or fail to communicate (whether it's communicating affection or rejection) I'd rather you not reach out, thank you. If you are interested send a picture of yourself (your face, a faceless photo, a nude, something with clothes on, whatever), and **tell why you felt compelled to reach out.** I promise I will respond, whether it's with a photo and an invitation to chat, or to let you know I don't feel a physical attraction, I will pay you that courtesy. Happy spring."

It really hurts and the feeling consumes you and focuses your mind. You suddenly feel helpless and weak, but glowing inside. Radiating with desire. I see both the fear and trust as your moistening eyes look at me. I hear a begging whimper. Your lip quivers. The next blow is harder, swifter. In exactly the same spot. You reflexively beg for mercyreally beg this time. Your breath deepens, more desperate. Your hips writhe and buck after you feel my bare palm strike your ass. I turn your head and force you to look at the marks on your body. Red and purple welts. The spots grow, become splotchy, uneven, with a dark red center that rises from your skin. I love those marks. They are my gifts for you and now you will wear them. You will bear them. You feel me throughout the day, the dull aches and the searing sting. You smile and wince and glow. You feel them whenever you want to be reminded that you are mine. You feel them every time you sit down or move a certain way. Finally, you gasp and moan and your pelvis squirms when I tell you to feel pleasure. My touch is different now. My fingers glide across your beckoning wetness and I whisper, ""You are such a good girl. Such a pretty, obedient girl. I am so happy you are mine. You are all I ever wanted."" I kiss the tear away from your warm cheek as my finger pushes you open. I love the taste of your tears. I love how you feel inside. I want you to be my online submissive. l want to take you to that emotional edge and linger there with you, holding you precariously over the abyss of fear and pain and buried memories. I want to feel the surge of power in my body that I will get from holding your vulnerability in my hands and deciding what to do with it. I will use it to penetrate you forcefully and fill you: your mind, your body, your emotions, your spirit. Then I will break them all and make whats left of you mine. Write me now."

I want to go slowly with a partner. It is going to be awkward and fun. We are going to laugh, fuck, talk about our feelings, and have a great time. When I snap my fingers - you will read this post. Ok - That may not have worked - but - I can not snap my fingers. Let me try - This IS the post you are looking for - waves hands.. No? We may have to imprint the ""mind control magical spells"" - as we go. First - I want to thank everyone for reading this piece of my soul. I am well educated, intelligent, and understanding. I am charming and funny. I live with chronic pain - I can explain it all in detail as we get to know each other. It has taken a long time to get comfortable sharing this part of my life with someone - and here I am. For that AND kink. I am a homebody. I go out with friends every now and then. I travel when possible. I love learning about different thought systems and pulling out nuggets of wisdom and absorbing that into my own personal belief system. If it makes sense to you and you can support it - it is a validly held belief. I am growing and changing. I want to do it with someone. That IS what she said. I want someone here beside me - to be my cheerleader (inside and outside of the bedroom - super bonus points if you already have an outfit). A best friend to enjoy my life with. Someone to have sexy adventures with. Someone to feel safe with in every way. I am silly and love making people laugh - even if it is just myself. Looking for friends and the possibility of something more. Looking for the right connection that can build into a romantic partner. Someone to trust, rely on, and depend on. If we are close, we can see each other often. If we are far away, we can get together later. I work well with people who know what they want and are - assertive, genuine, direct, specific, emotional, inquisitive, and vulnerable. Seeking someone 25-45. A submissive or a switch. Someone to slowly and carefully explore all of my kinks and fantasies with. In conversation and BDSM. Someone who wants to understand and be understood. Someone I can connect and grow with - emotionally and sexually. We can see and accept all of each other. I love learning about people and their passions. Do you love, respect, and treasure vulnerability? Me too! I love sitting in, talking about, processing, and working to understand thoughts, feelings, and emotions. We can explore our minds together. Go spelunking and enjoy discovering whatever we come across. I have been kinky for a very long time - but had difficulty finding people who understood. Until now. It is such a wonderful feeling - being accepted and understood. When I discovered bdsm - I knew I found a place where I belonged. I connect with people on a deep and emotional level. I am very introspective. I love breaking things down and really understanding them. Lets talk it out! I am interested and curious - I want to know every story and really understand what made you who you are. I want to know what you think and I want you to know what I think. The deeper this goes - the more openly and transparently we can discuss our feelings, perspectives, thoughts, emotions and physical / emotional pain with each other. Everything is valid. I have a darker sense of humor (think - Cards Against Humanity). 6 foot. Big Handsome Man. Beard. Glasses. Huge Disney fan! I love nerding out about politics (Communism - great in theory, horrible in execution), sex, philosophy, and video games. I have a deep love of music. I love how my feelings will magically line up with the songs I listen to. I love quoting song lyrics and singing songs when talking to people. I love playing JRPGs - currently working my way through Yo-kai Watch 3. The Witcher 3 is one of my all time favorite RPGs. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). My favorite tv show is The Wire. My favorite movies are Avatar and Singin' in the Rain. I love falling into any storytelling experience - comic books, anime, and books. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I love mythology, magic, and stand up comedy. I love being surprised by punchlines and the way they use words to entertain. Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. I enjoy watching the Marvel movies. I occasionally host board game nights with my friends. My top 3 love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I love to cuddle, snuggle, and spoon - be close together. I am gentle, caring, and nurturing. I love being there for people. I am very good at it. I love being taken care of and nurtured. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. Let's explore each other and build something meaningful. Let's build a safe place together. We can build a relationship with trust, respect, vulnerability, and honesty. Together. I can be your bright, shining light in the darkness. You can be mine. I am pansexual. I love people. I am interested in exploring with other people alongside my partner - eventually. I lean towards the dominant end of the spectrum. I love the mental and emotional part of BDSM. I love exploring the dark corners of the mind - bring flashlights. Kinks - dirty talk, oral, deepthroat, ageplay, dark ageplay, petplay, degradation, trap / femboy / sissy, threesomes, begging, orgasm control, outfit control, incest, breeding, dd/lg, md/lb, nursing, ownership, collaring, freeuse, objectification, 1950s housewife, domestic service, and the rest (Here on Gilligan's Island!). Limits - weapons, needles, blood, scat, choking and breathplay Softer limit - heavy impact play I want to mix nurturing, gentle, and sweet with sadistic - I want to do horrible / beautiful things to you after I / we dress you in beautiful outfits. I want to wrap my arms around you - and whisper all your deepest fantasies in your ear as I hold you close to me. I want to dive deep into everything that brings us pleasure, to understand how and why. Then, we can use this knowledge to please each other - like we have all the answers to a test. I want you to turn me on by leaning over during dinner and teasing me - torturing me with words - because you know me so well. I want to shower you with praise and affection. Raining good girls. Storming the degrading terms we choose that break you down and give you joy at the same time. I enjoy time as a daddy and a little - nurturing and being nurtured. My little side is dominant sometimes - I want mommy to hold me close, massage me, nurse me, and rock me - but I also want to make her my sex toy. My dominant fantasies include - A harem, CNC (music factory!), training someone to love the things I love over time - with orgasms, conditioning, and more! I am not locked into any specific dynamic. I want to try to find what we like as we go - I have never dominated you before. And I will not - until we have built something in person. I'd do anything for love (but I won't do that). We can not jump right to a 24/7 collared TPE before I meet your parents. I may not work well with brats - the resistance confuses me. I want to explore so much in person with the right person. Discover our favorite things together over time. The more we explore - the more we will find. Make mistakes and turn them into inside jokes. Have a lot of awkward fun together. The destination is an illusion. Getting there and staying there is the fun part. Lets focus on the present. Together. Do not hesitate to send me a PM if you want to get to know me better. Tell me what resonated with you and tell me your favorite song(s). Good Luck everyone! Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day!"

It's so...embarrassing, being exposed, judged, watched, vulnerable in that way...but it's a thrilling kind of embarrassment. So I want to show off for you, in person. Strip naked and get myself off, for your viewing pleasure. That's the central desire, but I'm very flexible on details. Should I drive to see you, or invite you into my home? Will it be just you, or a handful of your girlfriends as well? Do you want to talk dirty, ask me questions, or just expect me to remain silent? Would you tease me by showing off your body, or would you stay completely clothed? Sit back and watch, or end up lending a hand? Etc., etc. I'm extremely open to suggestions (and commands, within reason). I'm hoping to be able to indulge your fetish(es) while you allow me to indulge mine.

I hope to hear from some voyeurs soon! **update from original post** I've already had the good fortune to meet one lovely lady, and seeing her expectant stare as I disrobed was just as embarrassing - and enjoyable - as I had hoped. The feeling of vulnerability, of being so self-conscious of myself as she sat and watched, was electrifying. Her reactions were just as wonderful, and I was soon adjusting how I stood, how I talked, and how I stroked myself based on what brought her the most enjoyment. Needless to say, I had an incredible time showing off for her (and more, at her request and with full consent all around) and I hope to repeat the experience with her - and with any other interested voyeuristic women - very soon. :D"

I have a special place in my heart for women with sexual proclivities on the more... masochistic side. Knowing that about someone drives me nuts. It doesnt have to be explicit, but once I figure it out, thru conversation or otherwise, my heart just flutters... the ability to be vulnerable like that, to trust me with that vulnerability, and to top it all off, to derive sexual pleasure (from me!) indulging in whatever thing it is that makes your legs shake. Always makes me feel like a lucky man. For example, you might like (and this is NOT an exhaustive list NOR is it a checklist NOR does this list mean that these things are musts or even a wish list. These are just things that IVE experienced; what gets YOU wet might be totally different, which is totally cool, and exciting might I add): - having your hair pulled - having things around your neck (like my hand, or a collar, etc) - being spanked (in any way, hands or tools, from behind, maybe being hit other ways, etc) - having your nipples get a lot of attention (with varying intensity) - anything involving my or your mouth, maybe some teeth, maybe some tongue, maybe some fingers at the same time - butt stuff (this tends to be a sensitive topic so Ill leave it at that but will note the goal is always orgasm. Further inquiries are certainly welcome lol) - Ive been known to get quite playful so, like, tickling? Thats a form of torture, right? Lol Or sort of wrestling/being pinned down? I think you get the idea. All that said, I understand that getting to a point where someone is comfortable enough with someone else to reveal sexual desires that might make them feel vulnerable takes some work. This is a tough conversation to broach in most settings, which is why Im posting here! If youre interested, lets talk! Lets talk until theres nothing left to talk about. I hope Ive exhibited that Im pretty much an open book. So to get things going, I guess what Im really looking for is a fwb sort of situation. I live just south of philadelphia, work in the legal world, and am told Im attractive  Im clean, hygienic, and take care of myself and would expect that of you. For a pic, I can send you my kik username, theres one there. Happy to send others to verify. Im using my main acct bc Im on mobile and currently out of the country so trying to keep it anonymous here. Of course, were talking about sex here and part of that is sexual attraction, so shoot me a dm and Ill send you the kik username, you can take a look and decide from there. Id of course want to see who Im talking to too! But thats secondary to all of the above. Anywho, Ill be on pins and needles!"

I want to find a best friend to enjoy life with. Someone to have sexy adventures with. Someone to feel safe with in every way. I live with chronic pain. There are many layers to my chronic pain - I can explain it all in detail as we get to know each other. Do you love, respect, and treasure vulnerability? Me too! Lets be friends! I love sitting in, talking about, processing, and working to understand feelings. I love getting to know people. Looking for friends. I do not want to rush into anything serious right away. I am pansexual. I am open to everyone. I have a passion for blowjobs, nursing, traps / femboys, threesomes, and ageplay. I am a dominant leaning switch. I have discovered many roles I enjoy - Daddy, Dom, little boy. My daddy side is gentle caring and nurturing. My dominant side is rough, demanding, and taking. My little side wants to be held, comforted, and nurtured - while being smothered in love, affection, and cuddles. Some days I want to just collar someone and pin them down and.. well - we can talk more about that later. I have been kinky for a very long time - but had difficulty finding people who understood. Until now. It is such a wonderful feeling - being accepted and understood. When I discovered bdsm - I knew I found a place where I belonged. I connect with people on a deep and emotional level. I am very introspective. I enjoy stepping back to explore feelings and tangents. I love breaking things down and really understanding them. Lets talk it out. I am interested and curious - I want to know every story and really understand what made you who you are. I want to know what you think and I want you to know what I think. The deeper this goes - the more openly and transparently we can discuss our feelings, perspectives, thoughts, and emotions with each other. I have a darker sense of humor (think - Cards Against Humanity). 6 foot. Big Handsome Man. Beard. Glasses. BA in philosophy. JD. Huge Disney fan! I love nerding out about politics, sex, philosophy, and video games. I have a deep love of music. I love how my feelings will magically line up with the songs I am listening to. I love quoting song lyrics and singing songs while talking to people. I love playing JRPGs - currently working my way through Yo-kai Watch 3. The Witcher 3 is one of my all time favorites. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). My favorite tv show is The Wire. My favorite movies are Avatar and Singin' in the Rain. I love falling into any storytelling experience - comic books, anime, and books. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I love mythology, magic, and stand up comedy. I love being surprised by punchlines and the way they use words to entertain. Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. I enjoy watching the Marvel movies. I occasionally host board game nights with my friends. My top 3 love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I love to cuddle, snuggle, and spoon - be close together. I am gentle, caring, and nurturing. I love being there for people. I am very good at it. I love being taken care of and nurtured. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. &amp;#x200B; Seeking someone 25-45. A submissive or a switch. Eventually, I hope to build an in person romantic relationship. If we are close and can see each other often - great. It is ok if we start online and we have to get together later. I want both of us to be able to explore all of our kinky and vanilla desires. Someone who wants to understand and be understood. Someone I can connect and grow with. Let's help each other become the best version of ourselves as we explore each other. Let's build a safe place together. We can build a relationship with trust, respect, vulnerability, and honesty. Together. I can be your bright, shining light in the darkness. You can be mine. Send me a PM - Tell me what resonated with you and tell me your favorite song(s). Good Luck everyone! Thank you for checking me out. Have a wonderful day!"

But tonight it resonates again, and Id really love to voice chat with someone. *** I shouldn't complain. I've had no small amount of striking conversations originating from reddit. Yet, I feel compelled to share my disappointment with the recent lack of substance in my inbox. Maybe it's my posts. Perhaps my words don't invite introspection and vulnerability, rather broadcasting myself a la Selena Gomez, ""When you're ready come and get it. *Wink* *Peach Emoji*"" Maybe it's the nature of need, that arousal inspires consistent spelling errors, poor grammar, and abhorrent reading comprehension. Maybe it's a byproduct of the fatigue men feel seeking women online. There is so much I want to learn, so many facets of you I want to explore. But sifting through the arbitrarily chosen (and vanilla) facts of your ""About Me"" depletes my energy. I don't want to talk about travel or sport, TV or movies. I don't want to know your height, weight, or hair color. I definitely don't want to know your dick measurements. Let our connection, should there be one, unfold naturally. I seek another to know and to be known by, someone with whom I can be honest about myself in a fashion previously unknown. I crave a level of openness and welcome that approaches the slightly terrifying. If I'm not uncomfortable, I'm not growing. If I'm not growing, I'm lost. **Here's a mixed bag of important notes!** - Please reside in PST, MST, CST, or EST. Due to my schedule, time zones outside these four make conversation difficult. - I hate reddit chat. Go for the classic PM. - Be kind. I certainly will be to you. - Please don't message me something along the lines of, ""Hey, your post sounded interesting. HMU if you wanna chat."" I will not HYU. I just wote a whole long thing and that's all you have to say?! - Be older than 26. - Don't feel pressured to rush your reply. This is not an early-bird deal. - If your message says something like ""I'm an open book"" or ""I'm not really sure what you're looking for,"" best of luck elsewhere. - Flattery will get you everywhere. No, really. I'm vain af. - I don't respond to pre-written messages; sorry. Your first message should be the next step in our conversation. And if it wasn't already clear, skip the ""About Me"" section. (Or if you're dangerous, spice it up a bit.) - I'm going to be myself. I hope you will be, too. - The last part I wrote of this post was *this* line. Before that, it was the title. "

While I am looking for something casual I am still open to more serious dynamics if connection is there/right. **Who am I**?

Physically speaking I hear that I'm *quite* handsome (if you're over 60) and cute (if you're not). I like shopping, and as such cultivating a sense of style. Oh, and I'm 5'10, 175 pounds, average build. My favorite things about me are my face and my cock (if I'm not *dicking* about). Kink wise **I am a total hedonist**. Choice is sexy to me, so I'm all about service-submission, zero disobedience, and a sub choosing out of a love to please, rather than a love to be 'forced'. I like being spoiled by my sub because I like to spoil her in return. **Kinks I must have** with my partner: * Cock worship * Free use * Anal * Cum play * Fashion play * Extreme dirty talk (this one is my favorite and most important) The list is a lot longer, those are my favorites. My **hard limits** are: * Permanent Marking * Scat * Blood * Needles * Intense pain * Extreme bondage * Brats/disobedience * Vomit * Illegal acts (children, animals, et cetera) **What I'm looking for** besides compatibility in kink, is similar qualities I embody. I'm more of a birds of a feather than opposites attract, though I don't close any doors. Be as emotionally intelligent and open, considerate and kind as you are sexual and kinky. Be able to **communicate** shamelessly, directly, probably with some amount of vulnerability too. Communication is one of the top reasons I got into D/s; communication is required for a strong, healthy D/s relationship, and I want someone who appreciates that neither of us will be a mind reader at the start. Communication is also my biggest kink, I'm all about it. Also, be uninhibited in your pursuit, comfortable in exploration; which to me is a big part of all this. When I picture my partner and I, (*not that I was a huge fan of this movie*) I picture the dynamic between Deadpool and Vanessa (with my partner being only slightly more submissive/obedient); I like a sexually aggressive, dirty minded, pleasing partner. Someone who is passionate about exploration and their own sexuality. I want a girl who, while she is my submissive sub/slave can easily handle herself, and though I can (would, and may at times), can/likes to fight her own battles. Distance wise I'm looking for someone local to Chicago. I live in River North and am happy to host. When you do message me, convey the same type of information I've done here.

I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and carefully controlled. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. You'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, the one who accepts you unconditionally as you are, and in that you have a place of strength and comfort. Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul."

In particular, Im referring to the misogynistic themes, which are simply part of the fantasy.* *However, for some out there, my mere perspective on politics might also be worthy of a Trigger Warning. If that happens to be the case with you, then please, dont be offended. If you must leave a venomous comment, then I can only hope you get some catharsis out of it.* *** *** **INTRODUCTION:** This is going to be a *very* long post, so I will keep this introduction part relatively short. Unlike a great deal of the females here on Reddit, I do not get flooded with responses; which is to say, you have all the time you need to respond to this prompt. And considering how lengthy this post actually *is*, perhaps it would be best experienced if you bookmarked it and read it at your leisure. Even if you dont reply, I hope you enjoy the story below regardless. I had a lot of fun writing it. And, please, dont take it too seriously, folks. *...Its just a story.* *** *** **ABOUT MYSELF:** Im twenty-four years old. I stand six-foot-three, with broad shoulders and an athletic build. I have blond hair and bright, blue eyes. Handsome features, with a pale complexion. Ive always had an extremely dominate disposition toward sex. Over the years, Ive cultivate a talent for creative degradation/humiliation. Ive also developed a keen eye for imaginative objectification/dehumanization. This is largely because I pride myself on having a unique brand of domination, one which is both distinct and nuanced. To me, the psychological aspects of domination are just as important as the physical ones, if not more so. I have too many kinks to be able to list them all coherently. Even this [kink-list](URL doesnt do a very good job of expressing the depths or subtleties of my depraviltiy *(itll have to do for now, though)*. My only hard-limits are children, animals, scat and submitting to women. Everything else can be negotiated, so long as the right context is involved. My experience with this misogyny as a kink is rather extensive, both online and off. Im happy to share some sordid tales, if thats the sort of thing that youre interested in. Your current level of experience, however, *isnt* a qualifying factor. If youre new to this particular scene and you are hesitant to jump into the deep end, I dont mind being your soft introduction; and conversely, if youre confident and experienced with this sort of thing, then I wont waste your time with the shallow end of the pool. My intensity will match yours  or, exceed it by a reasonable degree. Ive been told that my approachable and accommodating tone when writing these posts is counterintuitive for any serious Dominant advertising their services, especially one who specializes in degradation/humiliation. While I understand the obvious wisdom of this, I still prefer to reserve my *worst self* until after some initial understanding has been established between us. I know this is not a popular way of doing things on r/DirtyR4R and I acknowledge that it risks being a pretty major turn-off for some. Establishing that understanding might take as little as a single exchange of messages back and forth, or it could take several; that honestly depends more on you and your sensitivities than it does me and mine. For now, simply know that Im being on my best behaviour. After we connect privately, youll get a taste for my *deplorable* side... I should probably take a moment now to mention my politics, since thats something thatll become relevant shortly. Im a good distance right of centre, with strong individualist leanings. As far as politically incorrect beliefs go, I harbour more than a few of those. But, we can discuss those beliefs in more detail later on. For now, I think thats enough about me. *** *** **WHO IM SEEKING:** Im seeking a devout Leftist, to put it as simply as I can. Someone whos ideological bubble I can *pop*... You should be older than I am *(at least thirty, please, although exceptions can certainly be made)*. Anyone over the age of forty will go straight to the front of the line, especially if theyve been a lifelong feminist. Pictures are not required, although they are always appreciated. Im not concerned with your appearance *(meaning nothing is a deal-breaker for me)*, but I do **strongly** prefer that you converse *(or roleplay)* using your own looks. It just makes things a little more grounded and immediate. My taste in women is as diverse and contextual as my kinks, so I wont bother attempting to articulate *my type*. I will say one thing, however. My tastes often favour those who can not be described as ordinary, for better or for worst. This means you likely have no need to be shy about your appearance. The things you consider flaws, I very well might consider assets. *** *** **WHAT IM SEEKING, AS A DOM:** A little bit of everything, to be honest. That includes  but certainly isnt limited to  the following: * Simple conversation; * Providing education/re-education; * Sharing our experiences/fantasies; * Roleplaying. I guess Im here for all the things that youd naturally expect on this sub-Reddit; except, I prefer to dabble in a little of everything. If theres something specific that youd like to approach me about, go ahead; Im always open to hear whats on your mind. Even if I dont accept your offer, Im not going to judge you for making it. If youre primarily looking for an RP session, please give me a general idea of the scenario and kinks you desire, then Ill respond with a decent-sized *(and well written)* introduction to the RP. I enjoy crafting detailed prompts, especially when theyve been commissioned from me and they include your personal kinks. So long as it lines up with my own kinks *(somewhat, at least)*, Ill be willing to indulge your fantasy and help to flesh it out properly, no matter how taboo it is. You can be very specific with your request, or you can simply give me a rough idea of what turns you on and Ill *run wild* with it. I prefer long-term roleplaying, which develops slowly and gains momentum over time. Some of the best scenarios Ive ever roleplayed built-up and crescendoed over the course of days, or even weeks. With the right investment, those exchanges gained an agency all their own. Thats what Im looking for, even if it means that sometimes we have to sacrifice the most immediately satisfying outcome for necessary story set-up. That said... Im also content with the occasional short-term session *(if Im not already committed to a long-term one)*. *** *** **WHAT IM SEEKING, AS A BULL:** In addition to seeking a female Sub, Im also potentially interested in meeting couples who are curious about cuckolding. If youre relatively new to cuckolding, we can begin with an introduction of sorts. I think youll find that Im more accommodating than most Bulls on Reddit; at least, in this regard. I also like to think that Im a pretty good teacher. Then, we can progress organically from there  even if we have to take baby-steps. Im open to a wide variety of interactions when it comes to cuckolding, including: * Simply corresponding back and forth *(either as a group or one-on-one)*; * Providing education/guidance to uncertain couples *(I can effectively wear two hats, the second being that of a quasi-couples therapist/confidante)*; * Engaging in virtual cuckolding *(this can include audio/pictures/videos, but doesnt necessarily have to)*; * Roleplaying all sorts of scenarios *(again: together, or just between two of us)*; * You can also commission a piece of erotica from me. I love writing personalized smut for couples to enjoy together. Sometimes, I even like to include instructions through-out the story, to make it a more interactive reading experience. I dont mind if youre married or simply dating, but I do prefer that youre both over thirty and somewhat committed. If your relationship isnt built on a sturdy enough foundation to survive the possible after-shock resulting from this experiment, then Id rather not do it in the first place. My intentions are never to harm the well-being of others, only to provide a form of *escapism*  even if it happens to be a fairly taboo and unconventional form. *** *** **WRITING SAMPLE:** We met in early 2017, on a frigid January morning, in the heated midst of the *Womans March*. You were standing in a tight circle of protesters, each of you wearing identical knitted pussy-hats over yours frozen ears, and each of you holding a placard more naive and absurd than the last. *(Yours read: **The Patriarchy Can Eat a Dick**. At least you had a sense of irony, I suppose; the others were far worse.)* I approached you with a camera-man and a microphone, feigning sympathy with your cause. I seemed genuine and respectful when making my request  not to mention *a little* charming  so you gladly agreed to do an interview with me. In the theatre of your mind, you couldnt help but imagine seeing yourself bloviating on YouTube later that day, then immediately sharing the link with everyone you knew. It wouldnt be as good as getting yourself on the news, but there was still plenty of time left in the day for that... Whenever the *Womans March* would be brought up in the course of conversation  not just during this Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, but for *years* to come  your family and friends would associate *your name* with it. But, thats not what happened; at least, not how youd imagined it would happen... It took a few minutes for you to realize that I was treating you as some sort of inside joke, mocking your responses subtlety enough so that my audience would know to laugh along, without spoiling the joke by letting you in on the fact that it was at your expense. You thought the interview would likely be posted on some Alt-Right YouTube channel to incite mockery. Enraged and indignant, you and the circle of pussy-hat wearing protesters stormed away violently, trying to take away my microphone in the process. It didnt work. You found the YouTube video Id posted a week later and contacted me shortly afterward, threatening legal action. *(In the comments section, theyd taken to either calling you that attention whore or the older one with the nice tits. Your pussy-hat was clearly knitted by hand, which itself inspired a whole separate chain of comments, pondering on what it must be like to grow-up with a psycho mother who thinks making genitalia out of yarn constitutes meaningful political action. One commenter wondered if you chose that ugly off-pink coloured wool to match the dusty shade your actual cunt.)* After a few days of exchanging heated emails back and forth, you decided not to pursue any legal action. Not because youd realized that you had no case, which was indeed correct, but because youd started to... *enjoy* my replies. It was nearly impossible to admit to yourself, but it was true, all the same. My messages were unapologetic and raw, but still understanding and sympathetic in their own way. You found yourself slowly being seduced by my worldview; not convinced, but compelled; *enchanted*, even. It was like taking some exotic drug, both intoxicating and freighting. You never mentioned our private conversations to anyone, because you feared what your friends and family would think of you exchanging emails with a Nazi *(your words, not mine)*. Even when my popularity surged to ridiculous heights, you kept our correspondence secret. In time, my emails became one of the few aspects of your day-to-day life which you anticipated. That, and sneakily watching my YouTube videos with your headphones, so no one would know the ideological and personal conflict you felt. After our correspondence had already taken on a familial  albeit not quite friendly  tone, the video Id made of you suddenly gained viral traction, causing GIFs of your comedically exasperated expression to spread like wild-fire. Thankfully, your family remained oblivious of your over-night internet infamy. You never saw the meme posted anywhere you regularly interacted online  within *your bubble*, that is  but once you peeked over the ideological fence, you saw it *everywhere*... Reddit, Twitter, Imgur, *EVERYWHERE*. Itd become ubiquitous amongst right-wing trolls, whod use the GIFs to solicit a cheap laugh. Others had taken to gleefully tormenting your own Twitter account, like sadistic gremlins praying on your sudden vulnerability in the spot light. You deleted your account, telling your family that youd simply grown tired of social-media. You even encouraged them to do the same, in hopes that youd limit their chances of being exposed to your humiliation. Basically, *you were the new Trigglypuff...* I brought up your new found status as a meme a few times during our conversations, mostly with an apologetic air, but sometimes with what approached humoured indifference. I reassured you that the joke didnt have any legs to it, and that people would move on eventually  likely sooner rather than later. Infuriated and hurt, you asked me how Id feel if my family saw *me* being made fun of in public. I told you that I wouldnt like it at all, no more than I enjoyed being labeled a sexist or a Nazi, simply for understanding economics enough to know that the *Pink Tax* and the *Wage Gap* were both self-propagating, self-serving myths. That street goes two directions, I said. Even though Id seemed cruel about the whole ordeal, you did hear me call the meme lame and over played during a livestream. The meme came from my show and I dont even think its that funny. Get a grip, folks... And sure enough, your infamy seemed to vanish, as if in the blink of an eye. Everyone moved on; there were other Trigglypuffs, and no ones attention span is that long. Eventually, the frequency of our emails tapered off. You still watched my YouTube channel regularly, always alone and always with private browsing turned on, but we had no further contact. That is, not until January of the following year, when I sent you a message out-of-the-blue. I asked if you were going to the *Womans March: Redux*. When you confirmed that you were leaving your family at home to protest for the weekend, I suggested that you change your plans... Id also been planning to attend the march, hoping to trick another gullible participant into becoming a lucrative meme. You were pretty lucrative, you know that? But then, I told you that Id recently reconsidered, now suspecting that the *Womans March* had become a case of diminishing returns. I decided that Id take the weekend off from producing content. Instead of interviewing uneducated protesters for a laugh, I was going to take a well-earned rest. *(Making a video five days a week can take a toll on you after a while.)* I booked a good hotel room for two nights. You were invited to join me, I mentioned, too casually to be trusted. I told you that I made sure it would have an excellent view of the protests taking place on the street down below. Why stand out there in the cold, when the two of us could simply watch the surreal, estrogen-induced spectacle from a distance? I pitched it as your vacation from Feminism. Wouldnt it be more productive if the two of us had a long, civil conversation in my hotel room? Why stand out there, screaming at the top of your lungs and achieving nothing but welcoming more ridicule? ...Join me, instead. Maybe the two of us could get somewhere. Hell, maybe even a proper interview? Something more dignified that last time. After you rejected my offer, feeling shocked and repulsed by what you thought were *obvious* sexual implications, I replied with my hotel and room number regardless. Then, I mentioned that if you found yourself standing out there in the cold, feeling dumb and miserable, you could always come join me. The invitation was an open one. Still beside yourself and throughly disgusted by my approach, you asked *how stupid I thought you were?* You dont want to prove your point, you said. You just want to *fuck* me. Then, you sent a follow-up email sent thirty seconds later: Youre disgusting... *Yuck dude.* I thought better of you... So yeah, I must be pretty stupid I guess.* My reply came a second later. No, sweetheart. Youve got it backwards. I want to *fuck you* to *prove my point*. Youre right about what I intend to do, but not about my intentions. I very much want to prove something to you.. You didnt reply to that; you *couldnt* reply to *that*. You attended the *Womans March*, just like youd always planed to. After some deliberation, you packed your hand-knitted pussy-hat into your carry-on bag. You werent going to let a bunch of twenty-something virgins bully you into silence. *That wasnt who you were,* you decided. But, Id been right about one thing, youd come to realize. While standing out there in the street, holding your placard high above your head and chanting loudly, you felt *dumb* and throughly *miserable*. Every few minutes, you caught yourself looking up at the large hotel which loomed above the street, wondering which window was mine. *...Could I see you?* You found it increasingly hard to hold the placard above your head with enthusiasm. You began checking your email, wondering if Id sent you a message. When you saw that I hadnt, you scrolled up and looked at my room number again... *Do I go to him?*, you asked yourself. The mere idea of going to my hotel room caused a your skin to feel like it was on fire. Whenever you caught yourself considering the idea *seriously*, a wave of dread would then suddenly wash over you, extinguishing the giddy excitement youd felt only moments before. Until eventually, the cold rationality failed to put out the burning sensation within you. After hesitating for a long moment, you left your placard in a near-by bush and began walking toward the hotels lobby at the end of the street. *I wonder if hes watching me right now... I wonder if he already knows hes won...* *** *** **FORMALITIES** If youve read this far, Im going to assume that youre *considering* replying to this. If thats the case, lets get some of the formalities out of the way. Please include your age and a brief description of yourself. We can go from there and discuss what youre seeking after the introductions are made. *(And please, dont be shy. I respond to all the replies I receive.)* For now, take care, be safe and dont let the occasional judgemental pricks on here get you down. And if I dont ever hear from you, I hope you at least had some fun reading the short story I provided."

You expose your fear, making your suffering your gift to me, showing me your vulnerability, letting me explore inside your pain. So I give you more. I give you so much more. First you feel them and then you see them. The marks on your body. You see the red and purple marks. They grow, become splotchy, uneven, with a dark red center. They are my marks. They show my ownership. You wear them with pride and part of you wants everyone to know, but you know that it's our secret. You feel them throughout the day, the dull aches and the searing sting. You feel them whenever you want to be reminded that you are mine. You feel them every time you sit down or move a certain way. Sometimes it feels good to touch the places that hurt, to soothe them. Finally, you gasp and moan and your hips writhe when I allow you to feel pleasure. My touch is different now. I massage the hot flesh and whisper, ""You are such a good girl. Such a pretty, obedient girl. I am so happy you are mine."" I kiss the tear away from your cheek. I want this to be our life together, with you as my submissive. l want to take you to that psychic edge and linger there with you. I want to feel the power that comes from your vulnerability and loss of control. I will penetrate you in every way: your mind, your body, your emotions. Your spirit. And yes, we will start slowly and climb the slope of mutual trust together. You read this and you feel it. You know you are different but you know deep in your heart that somewhere there is a man whose touch is a perfect fit for the desires you feel.

Ive become a lot more interested in playing with degradation lately. Ive been into objectification for a while now, but the thought of seeing my object begging, telling them things like their only purpose is to be a cock sleeve, and fucking them out of pity makes me really hot. The thing is that I actually have to like you otherwise it doesnt work. I guess this is my version of romance. Im a lifestyle Master. I go to conferences, classes, discussion groups, and read books about this sort of thing. I feel called to M/s because the Master role resonates with me spiritually. I also like D/s because I'm a kinky mofo. Im much more into the psychological side of Dominance than the physical side, but I do have training in impact play, needles, candles, and ropes. Sexually, Im physically and emotionally sadistic. So Im looking for a woman that also thinks this sort of thing is hot and wants a connection. D/s relationships require vulnerability and trust. And I cant trust and be vulnerable with someone I cant connect with. Vanilla me: When I say I like animals its like Mike Tyson saying I like hitting people.

I am talkative, empathetic, funny, and pretty direct. I work in the digital marketing sphere at a startup and I'm pretty damn happy with my life. &amp;#x200B; There is something that I've recently noticed is missing. Or rather, *temporarily absent*. After my 3+ year relationship ended this last Summer, I haven't connected with men in a physical, affectionate way and I am totally missing it. &amp;#x200B; I love sex and I love dudes. I like a nice beard and a lil belly. I'm down for the back hair and height difference (5'1 here). I like men's deep voice and their presence and how y'all are somehow always warm. Men are the best and I stand by that statement. You dudes are wonderful and I miss ya. &lt;3 &amp;#x200B; With all that said, I'm in no place interested in or ready for a relationship. I have a lot of emotional, physical, and spiritual work before I am truly ready to be someone's partner. And that's ok with me. I'm happy with my life and my friends and my world. But man, do I miss getting off and the weird bliss of feeling my skin against another living, breathing human being. &amp;#x200B; So here is my conundrum. I want to have sex and affection and flirting and human connection but I am not interested in a relationship. What is a girl to do? &amp;#x200B; Well, I hear dudes like sex too. Awesome. Twinning. So here is my goal: I would love to find someone (or a few someones, ideally!) who is interested in trying out a physical, affectionate, fun, sweet, chill sexual relationship with me. &amp;#x200B; I have never had casual sex before. I have literally slept with like 8 people up until this point--peanuts! I don't exactly know how this thing goes. But I think with some honesty, a good dose of naked vulnerability (puns!) and a little vetting, I might just find a dude who is interested in the same thing as me. You in? &amp;#x200B; If so, read below! If not, thanks for reading and please have an awesome day! * I'm 28 right now. I don't really have an age prefence--I've been attracted to older, young, and my age dudes--but I do have a ""mutual respect"" preference. * Having sex with someone is not a minor deal, in my book. You wouldn't get into a car with a seatbelt or airbags, right, so I think that the same concept applies to casual sex. * I'm really into physical affection. Kisses feel awesome. Forehead kisses. Slow kisses on the lips. A nice neck tickle. Oh god, it all sounds and feels wonderful to me. Not into affection? We likely aren't a match. \\\_()\_/ * Important physical/looks-related note: I'm a cool, funny person. I love my friends and I take good care of myself. I shower, I floss, I take pride in how I carry and treat people. I'm also a sexy girl who would love to go down on your while you stroke my hair. K? * But here's the thing: I'm 5""1 and just a tad over 150 lbs. I am not slim or skinny or Instagram-modelesque by any stretch of the imagination. And that's ok. So if being attracted to super hot girls is your thing, that's just truly not me. * Attraction is a really, really important part of a casual sex relationship. So if you're not vibing on my physical characteristics, that's 100% ok. You are allowed to be attracted to anyone you please. On to the next! * I'm blonde. I have green eyes. People tell me my smile is nice. I have huge boobs. Like, real boobs. They don't look like pornstar boobs and that's ok. I love 'em and I hope you will too. * I have stretch marks and cellulite and a little tummy that is convex. I'm beautiful and sexy but definitely not at my so-call ""goal weight"" (eh, gross). I don't spend money on fake eyelashes or even typically wear a lot of makeup. I'm working on myself and my life and my health but I'm very much at the beginning of that journey. * My body is, dare I say it, basic. Am I a so-called ""basic bitch""? Yes, probably. But I will fuck you silly, regardless, and I won't judge a dude with some chub. We're all human and your weight/body does not define you. Ok, enough talking. I could go on forever but that's boring. I'm looking for someone who is responsible, excited, willing to have some ""no string attached"" fun and yet is still open to connecting. And giving kisses. And flirting. And telling me I'm beautiful. And making stellar eye contact. And being friends. Cool? Cool. &amp;#x200B; Lastly, being responsible when it comes to STI/STD prevention, pregnancy prevention, and consent are all extremely important to me and non-negotiable. Condoms, every time. Mutually getting checked for STIs prior to being intimate. Being honest with each other about the status of our partners. Birth control on my end. Ongoing consent, honesty, and negotiation are vital. &amp;#x200B; Before we move forward, I'd like to have a nice long convo about your sexual likes and dislikes. What you're into. What you're not a fan of. And vice versa. I know what I like in sex. * **Loves**: Going down on you. Having you stroke my hair while I taste you. Having you climb on top of me and holding my head down so I can't move while you pound me. Being called your good girl. Telling you where to come when you're about to blow your load. Having you cum on my little face, then rushing to the bathroom to clean me up, laughing and smiling and kissing me. Cumming while you pound me. It doesn't happen every time but if I'm comfortable a vibing, it's a real possibility. * **No Buenos**: Anything anal. Sorry, not my thing bro. Spitting. Slapping. Choking. Being called a slut or a whore. Being on top (Totally ok occasionally but really not my thing. I can't cum that way, sorry!). Biting. Hickeys. Oral sex on me. I know that's something a lot of ladies are into. Maybe I'm weird but I've just never been able to get into it. So... less work for you?! **Timeline**: So, here's the thing. This is a new revelation for me--i.e. that I want to explore casual sex. I am exploring now but probably not ready to really ""do something about it"" until April, May, June-ish. First off, I need to start on birth control. Haven't been on it for a long ass time. That journey will take some time. Beyond that, I'm probably gun shy and will need some time to find a dude that is on my wavelength/vibe/similarly ready to put in the work for us both to stay safe and happy. &amp;#x200B; OH MY GOD THIS WAS LONG, RIGHT? This is actually a good litmus test. If you've read until this point, you may actually like my personality. I'm talkative. I care a lot. And I get turned on by talking and connecting and being vulnerable about all our weird shit. If you're interested, location isn't really an issue if you're open to coming to me. With that said, the South Bay Area and or SJ/Palo Alto/Mountain View/Campbell/Sunnyvale is the most convenient for an ongoing thing. Which would be cool but certainly isn't required. &amp;#x200B; **Still interested? Shoot me a message with the following:** * 1. What is your first name, my friend? * 2. (*2.1*) How would you describe your personality in a few adjectives? (*2.2*) Your body/looks? (*2.3*) What you're into sexually? * 3. What are you looking for here? * A. Just talking and flirting seems cool! * B. I live close by and I'm horny for you. Let's see if there's chemistry! * C. I live far away but this whole thing is working for me. I would be down to come to visit you sometime over the next 6 months for a one-nighter. * 4. (*4.1*) What is your love language? (*4.2*) And what makes you feel really turned on and loved? * 5. What about me resonates with you? * 6. Are you single or in a relationship right now? * 7. Would you be down to: * A. Text? Yes/no * B. Do a call? Yes/no * C. Video chat? Yes/no * D. Meetup prior to our hookup? Yes/no * E. I'm just horny, none of this K, bye! &amp;#x200B; O."

Its starting to get to me, and I could definitely use a break/some stress relief. I am up for just about anything, as long as it involves escaping my extended family. If we are talking kinks, I like girls who are assertive and like to be in control. I like the feeling of vulnerability and being at the mercy of another person. Sometimes, I like the idea of just being used for my body. And although I've never done it, I I also like the idea of wrestling/struggling (which I guess borders consensual non-consent). And of course, pegging. There are few things hotter than watching a girl get into being the dominant one; turned on from being in control. That being said, I am really open minded and flexible; up for just about anything. If this sounds remotely like something you are interested in, shoot me a PM and ask any questions you may have.

470,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,24 [M4F] Seeking Devout Feminist For Misogynistic Red Pill RP &amp; Combative Debate (Long Prompt; 30+),1,9o02cl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/9o02cl/24_m4f_seeking_devout_feminist_for_misogynistic/,2018-10-14 15:13:17,"**TRIGGER WARNING** The prompt below contains content that could be offensive to anyone whos dealt with online harassment before. *** *** **INTRODUCTION** This is going to be a *very* long post, so I will keep the introduction relatively short. Before I share my prompt, heres a little about myself and a general idea of what Im seeking. Unlike a great deal of the females here on Reddit, I do not get flooded with responses; which is to say, you have all the time in the world to respond to this prompt. And considering how lengthy this post actually *is*, perhaps it would be best experienced if you bookmarked it and read it at your leisure. Even if you dont reply, I hope you enjoy the story below regardless. I had a lot of fun writing it. And, please, dont take it too seriously, folks. ...Its *just* a story. *** *** **ABOUT MYSELF** Im American, twenty-four years old. Six foot three, with broad shoulders and a muscular build. I have blond hair and bright, blue eyes. Pale complexion. Hung *(by any realistic standard)*. Frankly... I have too many kinks to be able to list them all coherently. Even [this](URL doesnt do a very good job of expressing the depths or subtleties of my depraviltiy *(itll have to do, though)*. My only hard-limits are children, animals, scat and submitting to women. Everything else can be negotiated, so long as the right context is involved. *** *** **WHO IM SEEKING** Im seeking a self-identified Feminist, with credentials. Second-wave and up, preferably the third-wave SJW type *(I dont want to debate suffrage or property rights or obvious issues like that)*. You should be older than I am *(at least thirty, please; although exceptions can be made)*. *** *** **WHAT IM SEEKING** I want our roleplaying to be punctuated by real and *very* combative debate, which would then organically filter back into our scenario. Any frustration or aggregation that builds-up between us, we can *use it* to make our roleplaying more electric. Think of it as half exaggerated fantasy and half taboo confession, with the catharsis of hate-fucking. I prefer long-term roleplaying, which develops slowly and gains momentum over time. Some of the best scenarios Ive ever roleplayed built-up and crescendoed over the course of days, or even weeks. With the right investment, those exchanges seemed to gain an agency all their own. Thats what Im looking for, even if it means that sometimes we have to sacrifice the most immediately satisfying outcome for necessary story set-up. That said... Im also content with the occasional short-term session *(if Im not already committed to a long-term one)*. Im not concerned with your appearance *(meaning nothing is a deal-breaker for me)*, but I do strongly prefer that you roleplay using your own looks, regardless of the particular scenario *(it just makes things a little more grounded and immediate).* Aside from that, I have no other requirements. I dont mind if youre the type of roleplayer whos enthusiastic, but who sometimes feels like they arent able to contribute more than the bare minimum; and conversely, I dont mind if youre the type of roleplayer who prefers to take a much more active role in the story as it develops. We can share an equal position leading the scenario or I can guide you through it like a literary rollercoaster-ride; both are fine with me, *its entirely up to you.* *** *** **SCENARIO** We met in early 2017, on a rather frigid January morning, in the midst of the *Womans March*. You were standing in a tight-knit circle of protesters, each wearing the same pink pussy-hat over their frozen ears, and each holding a placard more naive and absurd than the last. *(Yours read: **The Patriarchy Can Eat a Dick**.)* I approached you with a camera-man and a microphone, feigning sympathy with your cause. I seemed genuine and respectful when making my request  not to mention *a little* charming  so you gladly agreed to do an interview with me. In the theatre of your mind, you couldnt help but imagine seeing yourself on YouTube later that day, then immediately sharing the link with everyone you knew. It wouldnt be as good as getting yourself on the news, but there was still plenty of time left in the day for that. Whenever the *Womans March* would be brought up in conversation  not just during Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, but for *years* to come  your family and friends would associate *your name* with it. But, thats not what happened; at least, not how youd imagined it would happen... It took a few minutes for you to realize that I was treating you as some sort of inside joke, mocking your responses subtlety enough so that my audience would know to laugh along, without spoiling the joke by letting you know that it was at your expense. You thought the interview would likely be posted on some Alt-Right YouTube channel to incite mockery. Enraged and indignant, you and the circle of pussy-hat wearing protesters stormed away violently, trying to take my microphone from me in the process. You found the YouTube video Id posted a week later and contacted me shortly afterward, threatening legal action. *(In the comments section, theyd taken to either calling you that attention whore or the older one with the nice tits. Your pussy-hat was clearly knitted by hand, which itself inspired a whole separate chain of comments, pondering on what it must be like to grow-up with a psycho mother who thinks making genitalia out of yarn constitutes meaningful political action. One commenter wondered if you chose that ugly off-pink coloured wool to match the dusty shade your actual cunt.)* After a few days of exchanging heated emails back and forth, you decided not to pursue legal action. Not because youd realized that you had no case, which was indeed correct, but because youd started to... *enjoy* my replies. My messages were unapologetic and raw, but still understanding and sympathetic in their own way. You found yourself slowly being seduced by my worldview; not convinced, but compelled; *enchanted*, even. It was like an exotic drug, both intoxicating and freighting. You never mentioned our conversations to anyone, because you feared what your friends and family would think of you exchanging emails with a Nazi *(your words, not mine)*. Within time, my emails became one of the few aspects of your day-to-day like that you anticipated. After our correspondence had already taken its new form, the video Id made of you suddenly gained viral traction, causing GIFs of your comedically exasperated expression to spread like wild-fire. Thankfully, your family remained oblivious of your over-night internet infamy. You never saw the meme posted anywhere you regularly interacted online  within *your bubble*, that is  but once you peeked over the ideological fence, you saw it *everywhere*... Itd become ubiquitous amongst right-wing trolls, whod use the GIFs to solicit a cheap laugh. Others had taken to gleefully tormenting your Twitter, like sadistic gremlins praying on your vulnerability. You deleted your account, telling your family that youd simply grown tired of social-media. You even encouraged them to do the same, in hopes that youd limit their chances of being exposed to your humiliation. Basically, *you were the new Trigglypuff...* I brought up your new found status as a meme a few times during our conversations, mostly with an apologetic air to my tone, but sometimes with what approached humoured indifference. I reassured you that the joke didnt have any legs to it, and that people would move on eventually  likely sooner rather than later. Infuriated and hurt, you asked me how Id feel if my family saw *me* being made fun of in public. I told you that I wouldnt like it at all, no more than I enjoyed being labeled a sexist, simply for understanding economics enough to know that the *Pink Tax* and the *Wage Gap* were both self-propagating, self-serving myths. That street goes two directions, I said. Eventually, the frequency of our emails tapered off. You still watched my YouTube channel regularly, always alone and always with private browsing turned on, but we had no further contact. That is, not until January of the following year, when I sent you a message out-of-the-blue. I asked if you were going to the *Womans March: Redux*. When you confirmed that you were leaving your family at home to protest for the weekend, I suggested that you change your plans... Id also been planning to attend the march, hoping to trick another gullible participant into becoming a lucrative meme. But then, Id reconsidered, suspecting that the *Womans March* has become a case of diminishing returns. I decided that Id take the weekend off from producing content. Instead of interviewing uneducated protesters for a laugh, I was going to take a well-earned rest. Making a video five days a week can take a toll on you after a while. I booked a nice hotel room for two nights. You were invited to join me. I made sure it would have an excellent view of the protests taking place on the street down below. *Why stand out there in the cold, when the two of us could simply watch the estrogen-induced spectacle from a distance?* I pitched it to you as your vacation from Feminism. *Wouldnt it be more productive if the two of us had a long, civil conversation in my hotel room? Why stand out there, screaming at the top of your lungs and achieving nothing but welcoming more ridicule? ...Join me, instead.* After you rejected my offer, feeling shocked and repulsed by what you thought were obvious sexual implications, I boldly replied with my hotel and room number regardless. Then, I mentioned that if you found yourself standing out there in the cold, feeling dumb and miserable, you could always come join me. The invitation was an open one. Still beside yourself and throughly disgusted by my approach, you asked *how stupid I thought you were*. You dont want to prove your point, you said. You just want to *fuck* me. Then, a follow-up email sent thirty seconds later: Youre disgusting... *Yuck dude.* I thought better of you... So yeah, I must be pretty stupid I guess.* My reply came a second later. No, sweetheart. Youve got it backwards. I want to fuck you to prove my point, not the other way around. You didnt reply to that; you *couldnt* reply to *that*. You attended the *Womans March*, just like youd always planed to. After some deliberation, you packed your hand-knitted pussy-hat into your carry-on. You werent going to let a bunch of twenty-something virgins bully you into silence. But, Id been right about one thing, you realized. While standing out there in the street, holding your placard and chanting loudly, you felt *dumb* and throughly *miserable*. Every few minutes, you caught yourself looking up at the large hotel which loomed above the street, wondering which window was mine. *...Could I see you?* You found it increasingly hard to hold the placard above your head with enthusiasm. You began checking your email, wondering if Id sent you a message. When you saw that I hadnt, you scrolled up and looked at my room number again... *Do I go to him?*, you asked yourself. The idea caused a worm of excitement to writhe inside your stomach. Whenever you caught yourself considering the idea seriously, a wave of dread would then suddenly wash over you, extinguishing the giddy excitement youd felt. *What do I do!?* *** **FORMALITIES** If youre interested in playing out the scenario above, then send me a message and well go from there. Also, I should mention that any of the previous prompts that are still found in my history are fair game. If its not deleted, that means Im still eager to find a partner. Oh, yeah  and regarding the *misogyny* aspect of this scenario, we can take that as far as you desire to. Im content with whatever degree you wish to include, be it very minimal or pushed to the absolute extreme. *(Im very adept at using humiliation/degradation in my roleplaying.)* Just please be forthcoming with your kinks and your limits, so I dont run the risk of accidentally offending you when I merely intended to excite you. If youd like to involve another taboo kink into this scenario, pitch it to me and Ill likely be game to give it a shot. Please include your age, your Feminist credentials and a brief description of yourself in your reply. Its also helpful if you include some reference to the prompt you wish to play out, as I might not be sure which you are replying to. Im excited to hear from you, so dont be shy. I reply to all the replies I receive. If you are the type who finds it hard to open up on the first message, thats alright, too. Im more than happy to take this at your pace. For now, take care, be safe and dont let the assholes on here get you down."
471,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,24 [M4F] Seeking Devout Feminist for Misogynistic Red Pill RP &amp; Combative Side-Conversation (Long Prompt; 30+),1,9o7m7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/9o7m7n/24_m4f_seeking_devout_feminist_for_misogynistic/,2018-10-15 10:49:50,"**TRIGGER WARNING** The prompt below contains content that could be offensive to anyone whos dealt with online harassment before. *** *** **INTRODUCTION** This is going to be a *very* long post, so I will keep the introduction relatively short. Before I share my prompt, heres a little about myself and a general idea of what Im seeking. Unlike a great deal of the females here on Reddit, I do not get flooded with responses; which is to say, you have all the time in the world to respond to this prompt. And considering how lengthy this post actually *is*, perhaps it would be best experienced if you bookmarked it and read it at your leisure. Even if you dont reply, I hope you enjoy the story below regardless. I had a lot of fun writing it. And, please, dont take it too seriously, folks. ...Its *just* a story. *** *** **ABOUT MYSELF** Im American, twenty-four years old. Six foot three, with broad shoulders and a muscular build. I have blond hair and bright, blue eyes. Pale complexion. Hung *(by any realistic standard)*. Frankly... I have too many kinks to be able to list them all coherently. Even [this](URL doesnt do a very good job of expressing the depths or subtleties of my depraviltiy *(itll have to do, though)*. My only hard-limits are children, animals, scat and submitting to women. Everything else can be negotiated, so long as the right context is involved. *** *** **WHO IM SEEKING** Im seeking a self-identified Feminist, with credentials. Second-wave and up, preferably the third-wave SJW type *(I dont want to debate suffrage or property rights or obvious issues like that)*. You should be older than I am *(at least thirty, please; although exceptions can be made)*. *** *** **WHAT IM SEEKING** I want our roleplaying to be punctuated by real and *very* combative debate, which would then organically filter back into our scenario. Any frustration or aggregation that builds-up between us, we can *use it* to make our roleplaying more electric. Think of it as half exaggerated fantasy and half taboo confession, with the catharsis of hate-fucking. I prefer long-term roleplaying, which develops slowly and gains momentum over time. Some of the best scenarios Ive ever roleplayed built-up and crescendoed over the course of days, or even weeks. With the right investment, those exchanges seemed to gain an agency all their own. Thats what Im looking for, even if it means that sometimes we have to sacrifice the most immediately satisfying outcome for necessary story set-up. That said... Im also content with the occasional short-term session *(if Im not already committed to a long-term one)*. Im not concerned with your appearance *(meaning nothing is a deal-breaker for me)*, but I do strongly prefer that you roleplay using your own looks, regardless of the particular scenario *(it just makes things a little more grounded and immediate).* Aside from that, I have no other requirements. I dont mind if youre the type of roleplayer whos enthusiastic, but who sometimes feels like they arent able to contribute more than the bare minimum; and conversely, I dont mind if youre the type of roleplayer who prefers to take a much more active role in the story as it develops. We can share an equal position leading the scenario or I can guide you through it like a literary rollercoaster-ride; both are fine with me, *its entirely up to you.* *** *** **SCENARIO** We met in early 2017, on a rather frigid January morning, in the midst of the *Womans March*. You were standing in a tight-knit circle of protesters, each wearing the same pink pussy-hat over their frozen ears, and each holding a placard more naive and absurd than the last. *(Yours read: **The Patriarchy Can Eat a Dick**.)* I approached you with a camera-man and a microphone, feigning sympathy with your cause. I seemed genuine and respectful when making my request  not to mention *a little* charming  so you gladly agreed to do an interview with me. In the theatre of your mind, you couldnt help but imagine seeing yourself on YouTube later that day, then immediately sharing the link with everyone you knew. It wouldnt be as good as getting yourself on the news, but there was still plenty of time left in the day for that. Whenever the *Womans March* would be brought up in conversation  not just during Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, but for *years* to come  your family and friends would associate *your name* with it. But, thats not what happened; at least, not how youd imagined it would happen... It took a few minutes for you to realize that I was treating you as some sort of inside joke, mocking your responses subtlety enough so that my audience would know to laugh along, without spoiling the joke by letting you know that it was at your expense. You thought the interview would likely be posted on some Alt-Right YouTube channel to incite mockery. Enraged and indignant, you and the circle of pussy-hat wearing protesters stormed away violently, trying to take my microphone from me in the process. You found the YouTube video Id posted a week later and contacted me shortly afterward, threatening legal action. *(In the comments section, theyd taken to either calling you that attention whore or the older one with the nice tits.

Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul."

I have blond hair and bright, blue eyes. My complexion is pale, usually accompanied by a dark shadow of stubble. Im also hung *(by any realistic standard)*. *** *** **ABOUT MY APPROACH:** Frankly... I have too many kinks to be able to list them all coherently. Even [this](URL doesnt do a very good job of expressing the depths or subtleties of my depraviltiy *(itll have to do for now, though)*. My only hard-limits are children, animals, scat and submitting to women. Everything else can be negotiated, so long as the right context is involved. My experience with cuckolding is rather extensive, both online and off. Im happy to share some sordid tales, if thats the sort of thing that youre interested in. Your experience with cuckolding isnt a qualifying factor. If youre new to this scene and you are hesitant to jump into the deep end, I dont mind being your soft introduction; and conversely, if youre confident and experienced with cuckolding, I wont waste your time with the shallow end of the pool. My intensity will match yours  or, exceed it by a reasonable degree *(just enough to keep things mutually exciting)*. Ive always possessed an extremely dominate disposition toward sex. This has lead me to cultivating a talent for creative humiliation. I pride myself on having a unique brand of domination, which is both distinct and nuanced. To me, the psychological aspects of domination are just as important as the physical ones, if not more so. But above all, I strive to always be *creative* and *memorable*. Ive been told that my approachable and accommodating tone when writing these posts is counterintuitive for any serious Bull advertising their services, especially one who specializes in degradation and humiliation. While I understand the obvious wisdom of this, I still prefer to reserve my *worst self* until after some initial understanding has been achieved between us. Establishing that understanding might take as little as a single exchange of messages back and forth, or it could take several; that honestly depends more on you and your sensitivities than it does me and mine. For now, simply know that Im being on my best behaviour. After we connect, youll get a taste for my deplorable side. Oh and speaking of *deplorables*... I should probably take a moment now to mention my politics, since thats an integral aspect of this. Im a good distance right of centre on the political compass, with strong individualist/libertarian leanings. As far as politically incorrect beliefs go, I harbour more than a few of those. But, we can discuss those beliefs in detail later on. For now, I think thats enough about me. Lets talk about you. *** *** **WHO IM SEEKING:** A couple who subscribe to the *SJW* worldview. I dont mind if youre married or simply dating, but I do prefer that youre both over thirty and somewhat committed. *** *** **WHAT IM SEEKING:** To be honest, Ive never been the type to go around calling progressives *cucks*. Its a juvenile insult and thats not how I conduct myself in the realm of politics. That said, Ive certainly made a lot of progressive-types literal cucks, so... *Hell*, maybe there always was some truth to that schoolyard insult after all. *Are you wondering if youre just further proof?* We can find out. If youre relatively new to cuckolding, we can begin with an introduction of sorts. I think youll find that Im more accommodating than most Bulls on here. I also like to think that Im a pretty good teacher. Then, we can progress organically from there. Im open to a wide variety of interactions, including: * Simply corresponding back and forth *(either as a group or one-on-one)*; * Providing education/guidance to uncertain couples *(I can effectively wear two hats, the second being that of a quasi-couples therapist/confidante)*; * Engaging in virtual cuckolding *(this can include audio/pictures/videos, but doesnt necessarily have to)*; * Roleplaying all sorts of scenarios *(again: together or just between two of us)*; * You can also commission a piece of erotica from me. I love writing personalized smut for couples to enjoy together. Sometimes, I even like to include instructions through-out the story, to make it a more interactive reading experience. And I think that sums it up pretty well. Feel free to suggest anything Ive left out. *** *** **THE FORMALITIES:** Please include your age, your SJW credentials and a brief description of yourselves in your response. Its also helpful if you include some reference to this post, as I might not be sure which you are replying to. Knowing roughly how long youve been together is good context for me, but you dont have to tell me that. Pictures are not required, but I would appreciate if the physical descriptions you give me are honest. *(Honest doesnt always mean Accurate, so feel free to omit physical details that are too identifiable in your eyes, such as a tattoo)*. Im not concerned with your attractiveness *(meaning nothing is a deal-breaker for me)*, I just prefer if everything is grounded in reality as much as possible. Im excited to hear from you, so dont be shy. I reply to all the replies I receive. If you are the type of couple who finds it hard to open up on the first message, thats alright, too. Im more than happy to take this at your pace. For now, take care, be safe and dont let the creeps on here get you down. *...Oh!* One last thing. Below, I included a rather lengthy writing sample, which originates from a separate post I made on r/DirtyPenpals. The theme is very fitting, however. I think you might enjoy it. *** *** **WRITING SAMPLE:** We met in early 2017, on a rather frigid January morning, in the midst of the *Womans March*. You were standing in a tight-knit circle of protesters, each wearing the same pink pussy-hat over their frozen ears, and each holding a placard more naive and absurd than the last. *(Yours read: **The Patriarchy Can Eat a Dick**.)* I approached you with a camera-man and a microphone, feigning sympathy with your cause. I seemed genuine and respectful when making my request  not to mention *a little* charming  so you gladly agreed to do an interview with me. In the theatre of your mind, you couldnt help but imagine seeing yourself on YouTube later that day, then immediately sharing the link with everyone you knew. It wouldnt be as good as getting yourself on the news, but there was still plenty of time left in the day for that. Whenever the *Womans March* would be brought up in conversation  not just during Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, but for *years* to come  your family and friends would associate *your name* with it. But, thats not what happened; at least, not how youd imagined it would happen... It took a few minutes for you to realize that I was treating you as some sort of inside joke, mocking your responses subtlety enough so that my audience would know to laugh along, without spoiling the joke by letting you know that it was at your expense. You thought the interview would likely be posted on some Alt-Right YouTube channel to incite mockery. Enraged and indignant, you and the circle of pussy-hat wearing protesters stormed away violently, trying to take my microphone from me in the process. You found the YouTube video Id posted a week later and contacted me shortly afterward, threatening legal action. *(In the comments section, theyd taken to either calling you that attention whore or the older one with the nice tits. Your pussy-hat was clearly knitted by hand, which itself inspired a whole separate chain of comments, pondering on what it must be like to grow-up with a psycho mother who thinks making genitalia out of yarn constitutes meaningful political action. One commenter wondered if you chose that ugly off-pink coloured wool to match the dusty shade your actual cunt.)* After a few days of exchanging heated emails back and forth, you decided not to pursue legal action. Not because youd realized that you had no case, which was indeed correct, but because youd started to... *enjoy* my replies. My messages were unapologetic and raw, but still understanding and sympathetic in their own way. You found yourself slowly being seduced by my worldview; not convinced, but compelled; *enchanted*, even. It was like an exotic drug, both intoxicating and freighting. You never mentioned our conversations to anyone, because you feared what your friends and family would think of you exchanging emails with a Nazi *(your words, not mine)*. Within time, my emails became one of the few aspects of your day-to-day like that you anticipated. After our correspondence had already taken its new form, the video Id made of you suddenly gained viral traction, causing GIFs of your comedically exasperated expression to spread like wild-fire. Thankfully, your family remained oblivious of your over-night internet infamy. You never saw the meme posted anywhere you regularly interacted online  within *your bubble*, that is  but once you peeked over the ideological fence, you saw it *everywhere*... Itd become ubiquitous amongst right-wing trolls, whod use the GIFs to solicit a cheap laugh. Others had taken to gleefully tormenting your Twitter, like sadistic gremlins praying on your vulnerability. You deleted your account, telling your family that youd simply grown tired of social-media. You even encouraged them to do the same, in hopes that youd limit their chances of being exposed to your humiliation. Basically, *you were the new Trigglypuff...* I brought up your new found status as a meme a few times during our conversations, mostly with an apologetic air to my tone, but sometimes with what approached humoured indifference. I reassured you that the joke didnt have any legs to it, and that people would move on eventually  likely sooner rather than later. Infuriated and hurt, you asked me how Id feel if my family saw *me* being made fun of in public. I told you that I wouldnt like it at all, no more than I enjoyed being labeled a sexist, simply for understanding economics enough to know that the *Pink Tax* and the *Wage Gap* were both self-propagating, self-serving myths. That street goes two directions, I said. Eventually, the frequency of our emails tapered off. You still watched my YouTube channel regularly, always alone and always with private browsing turned on, but we had no further contact. That is, not until January of the following year, when I sent you a message out-of-the-blue. I asked if you were going to the *Womans March: Redux*. When you confirmed that you were leaving your family at home to protest for the weekend, I suggested that you change your plans... Id also been planning to attend the march, hoping to trick another gullible participant into becoming a lucrative meme. But then, Id reconsidered, suspecting that the *Womans March* has become a case of diminishing returns. I decided that Id take the weekend off from producing content. Instead of interviewing uneducated protesters for a laugh, I was going to take a well-earned rest. Making a video five days a week can take a toll on you after a while. I booked a nice hotel room for two nights. You were invited to join me. I made sure it would have an excellent view of the protests taking place on the street down below. *Why stand out there in the cold, when the two of us could simply watch the estrogen-induced spectacle from a distance?* I pitched it to you as your vacation from Feminism. *Wouldnt it be more productive if the two of us had a long, civil conversation in my hotel room? Why stand out there, screaming at the top of your lungs and achieving nothing but welcoming more ridicule? ...Join me, instead.* After you rejected my offer, feeling shocked and repulsed by what you thought were obvious sexual implications, I boldly replied with my hotel and room number regardless. Then, I mentioned that if you found yourself standing out there in the cold, feeling dumb and miserable, you could always come join me. The invitation was an open one. Still beside yourself and throughly disgusted by my approach, you asked *how stupid I thought you were*. You dont want to prove your point, you said. You just want to *fuck* me. Then, a follow-up email sent thirty seconds later: Youre disgusting... *Yuck dude.* I thought better of you... So yeah, I must be *pretty stupid* I guess... Huh? My reply came a second later. No, sweetheart. Youve got it backwards. I want to fuck you to prove my point, not the other way around. You didnt reply to that; you *couldnt* reply to *that*. You attended the *Womans March*, just like youd always planed to. After some deliberation, you packed your hand-knitted pussy-hat into your carry-on. You werent going to let a bunch of twenty-something virgins bully you into silence. But, Id been right about one thing, you realized. While standing out there in the street, holding your placard and chanting loudly, you felt *dumb* and throughly *miserable*. Every few minutes, you caught yourself looking up at the large hotel which loomed above the street, wondering which window was mine. *...Could I see you?* You found it increasingly hard to hold the placard above your head with enthusiasm. You began checking your email, wondering if Id sent you a message. When you saw that I hadnt, you scrolled up and looked at my room number again... *Do I go to him?*, you asked yourself. The idea caused a worm of excitement to writhe inside your stomach. Whenever you caught yourself considering the idea seriously, a wave of dread would then suddenly wash over you, extinguishing the giddy excitement youd felt. *What do I do!?* *** *** Well, I hope you enjoyed the above prompt for what it was. Take care, you freaks. And be safe."

480,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,32 [m4f] dominant guy looking for very submissive woman. (longish post -- probably long distance only -- *preferably* my age or older),1,9tej7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/9tej7x/32_m4f_dominant_guy_looking_for_very_submissive/,2018-11-02 10:05:50,"I should make it clear immediately that its entirely possible that we'll never meet in person, that this could remain entirely online. (And over the phone.) And that, despite that likelihood, theres also a possibility that we *would* be able to meet in person. This aspect of things is quite up in the air at the moment. This is all because *I am* currently in a relationship. Its a relationship that I would not at all like to see end, though things are difficult right now. (You can ask me more details about this privately.) Now, with that out of the way, what Im looking for. First and foremost, I desire a strong connection. Everything else is pointless without a strong, deep, mutual feeling of connection. That might seem like something obvious, but I think its worth making very clear. I dont just want someone to trade pictures with, to get off with on the phone. Actually, I dont even know *how* this would work without a connection. There are probably a lot of people here who have had this kind of relationship long distance, who think that its easy or straightforward. Im not one of those people. This is something that, again, seems obvious to me, but I feel I need to note. For me, much of this dynamic is tactile, sensory. I want to be able to feel your skin against my palm when I slap you or spank you, your pulse and attempts to breathe while I choke you, your body trying to leverage me as I hold you down and force you in place. I need to be able to feel your warmth and smell your hair while youre crying and Im holding you, you tightening around me when you come. So, without that, we would need a strong connection, and mutual desire to have those things. Sexually, I dislike a lot of what I consider kitsch. Sex toys very quickly become silly and/or ironic. A belt is preferable to a whip, a necktie to handcuffs, a hairbrush to a paddle. Above everything else, I like to use my hands. That doesnt mean that certain things arent useful/fun. But I dont like to go above and beyond. (I mean, a buttplug is a buttplug, and nothing else can really replace it.) The same goes for terminology. I dont refer to myself as a Dom, I find the concept of a munch heinous, and I dont like to use terms that wouldnt make sense to the average sexually active twenty five year old. Some of this might be moot, but I think its worth noting here to give an idea of who I am and what I like. More and more, Ive realized that this is basically a sexual orientation for me. I need to physically hurt and deeply humiliate the person Im with. But its very emotional for me, and I also need to take care of her. Its basically about a depth mutual safety. I want to feel safe enough to do these things without rejection, and I want her to feel the safety that it creates for her. I want the connection it creates. As Ive alluded to, I like/need **slapping and spanking, choking, whipping, humiliation, etc. Orgasm control is a given.** (I havent had sex even once with my current partner without hitting her, and she hasnt had an orgasm without my permission since we met.) Physically, I can get pretty extreme. **For who Im looking for**--I dont have very many *specific* needs. Obviously, you need to want the same things I do, and have felt some sort of connection to what Ive written. But I do have some *preferences.* I like women who are roughly 35 or older. That doesnt mean Im excluding younger women, but I find myself more able to relate to and more attracted to older women. I tend to like women who are conventionally attractive, and Im not attracted to women who are quite overweight. (Theres a huge spectrum that I find attractive, from Kiera Knightley to Ashley Graham.) Intelligence is extremely important. The more intelligent you are, the better. I dont much like being around children, and have never wanted themand this would never be that kind of relationshipbut I like a certain kind of personality that blends strong intelligence with warmth, empathy, and maternal instinct. If I see a very intelligent woman taking care of a dog, or talking to a small child, it does a lot for me. Culturemusical talent, film knowledge, artistic abilityall extremely attractive as well. A friend and I once decided that I tend to be attracted to women in a way that's more like how a lot of women are attracted to menI like women a bit older than me who are intelligent, funny, competent and talented, and I like scars and a complicated past. I like *strong* women, which can sometimes consist of a kind of intimidating vulnerability and resiliency. If I had to give a specific physical type, I would say taller than average, thin and pale. But thats nothing like a strong requirement. I wont list limits and stuff, because you probably have a rough idea of who I am at this point. If youre still on board and have a question, just ask. **About me**I read, love music and film, and tend to be the most competent person in the room. Im not arrogant, even though the last sentence makes it seem that way. Ive never been married. Ive been through a lot, and Im not a *happy* person by any stretch of the imagination. But Im also not morose and depressive. Im around 510, thin, well dressed, and broadly considered attractive. Im very much an adult and into adult things, and not into video games or geek culture. Politically Im a centrist, or maybe somewhat left of center. Anyway, if youve made it this far, and are still interested, then please take a moment to send me a message. "

You want to be hurt. I want to hurt you. But I will make you hurt yourself. You will beg for mercy, really beg, while yearning for more. You will expose your fear, making your self-inflicted suffering your authentic gift to me, showing me your complete vulnerability, letting me experience your profound, eager desire to sacrifice your body to me. You see the red and purple marks of my ownership on your body. You make them. You feel them throughout the day, the dull aches and the punctate sting. They give you certainty that you are mine: you can feel my ownership whenever you need to feel safe. You feel my control all the time, every time you sit down or move a certain way. You sweat and your heart beats faster every time you find an instrument that I ask for, wondering what my plan is for it. You gasp when I finally allow your hand to soothe, to seek pleasure underneath your clothes. It is a paradox, our bond, because I am not there physically, but the sensations are intense, real, truly painful; the pleasure, when I allow it, is deeply intimate and raw. This will be our online life together. I want to take you to the limits of your physical experience of this world. l want join you at that edge, immersed in your deepest self, a sexual sadist claiming your body as his own. This isnt for everyone, God no, but you know its for you, because of the soft voice deep inside you. Youve tried to silence her, but now she is whimpering, clawing, reaching out desperately, grabbing you by the throat. Crying to be free. Come to me now, before the thoughts stop you."

To chat throughout the workday, if timing allows, and tease and sexually torment each other with hopes of the stars aligning. Lust and want would take over our already overflowing desire. This daily fun and erotic adventure is what Im hoping to find. I am in a physically neglectful marriage, and Im hoping to find someone who enjoys my sexual energy and wants to reciprocate in kind. The rush of leaving caution to the wind concerning a sexual experience has never happened for me. I am in the Eastern Time Zone, and work from 8am-5pm with a great deal of freedom to be less than professional during the day. To have a woman actually want to be sexual with me, even when Im at work, in my car, or sneaking around at home would be so exciting and satisfying. Would you enjoy waking up with me every morning, at least, in the virtual sense? Would you like having a man who is always eager and wanting to chat with you whenever he gets a chance? With being neglected, not only am I not satisfied, but I havent had the opportunities to satisfy someone else. I am a natural giver who seeks someone who wants and enjoys all of me. Physically, I am 6 feet tall, dirty blonde hair, a kind face, broad shoulders and chest, with a little more to love around the middle which I am working on. I personal believe that every woman is beautiful in her own way. No matter the shape, size, age (other than needing to be over 18), or ethnicity, you are perfectly you . It's our differences and little quirks that make us so interesting. If you feel like we would be a good virtual match for each other, please message me via PM. Please be wanting to send and receive flirtatious and explicit texts, pics, videos, and possibly voice calls or live chats. I know these types of things are very difficult for others to do for many reasons. I am very discreet and expect the same. Its that vulnerability part of giving up control of your pleasure to someone else that so heavenly. I love the idea of me creating a sexual story or scenario and making your body come alive as you send me visuals of approval. Listening or watching each other play and reach climax is also a great fantasy of mine. There are so many ways Im sure we can find to be completely naughty as we sneak around for each other. I am a very understanding person and not a teenager anymore lol, so I will not start humping you once I see the orange envelope. My main platforms of communication are Hangouts and Skype, but I have kik as well if that is all you can do. Even though this post is extremely sexual, I do have the natural ability of listening to others and being of great support to others. That is what is so painful about my own situation. I am the rock for my wife in these regards; however, she does not reciprocate my support of her in the way I desperately need. All PMs are welcome . Im excited to get to know you and see if we hit it off. If I dont hear from you, have a wonderful rest of your week and an uplifting weekend! "

How do you catch the eye of someone you would hope to virtually meet in just a simple phrase? Hopefully, the right woman will take a chance and be intrigued enough to open and read my own little reach out for fun, excitement, passion, and mutual satisfaction. I am a husband and father in the Midwest, USA. I have been with my loving wife for over 15 years (including dating), and I have been in a state of sexual and intimate neglect from the beginning. Its amazing to me how much the message of wait until marriage is coined and preached without any thought of how to teach and discuss what a healthy, sexual relationship within a marriage looks like. Once a month for 15 minutes is not a recipe for either party to feel wanted, needed, and satisfied. Very rarely does a weekend like this one come about in my life. I will be home, not working or other obligations, and my wife will be away until midday Sunday. I am hoping to find someone who is in a similar situation as me or at the very least enjoys the pent-up passion and energy of a sexually frustrated husband. Whether you are married, separated, or single, I am not looking to change either of our situations. Keeping things in the virtual world, specifically, I am looking to have a weekend affair where we completely throw caution to the wind and explore what makes each other come alive. This would include activities such as simple texting, sending teasing and explicit photos/videos to each other, live voice chat, and live video chat. I have been told I have the gift for story telling and creating wonderful scenarios for our imaginations to escape to. I have also been told my voice is very desirable. I know what I am looking for is difficult to find. Not that someone out there doesnt like the idea of what I have outlined, but the amount of vulnerability and risk is a real concern. It is a concern for me as well. Discretion in all areas is a must. I am hoping to get to know you through chatting off and on through the rest of the day and into tomorrow morning. I am a very genuine and caring man. More of the gentle giant type if you will. I find joy in bringing others happiness and pleasure. The bringing happiness has been available to me all my life; however, the moments of bringing pleasure has been few and far between. Physically, I am 6 feet tall, dirty blonde hair, kind eyes, a caring smile, broad shoulders and chest with a little more to love around the middle, strong arms, and thick thighs and calves. As for the physical type I am searching for, I have no requests or requirements. No matter your age (of course being 18 or over), your shape, size, or ethnicity, your energy and positive outlook is what will attract me the most. I truly believe every person is beautiful in their own special way (cue Marry Poppins lol), and it is the quirks or specific differences which make you so wonderfully you. Please be more than willing to dive into what I have outlined in this post after our getting to know each other period. I am a very passionate and giving person who is hoping to find my perfect virtual partner. All PMs are welcome and will be greatly appreciated by this man in the Eastern Time Zone. I am not a teenager anymore, so I will not jump you as soon as I see that wonderful orange envelope appear lol ... and isnt that orange envelope wonderful? "

Could there possibly be so much excitement between the two of us that sleep becomes difficult to happen? Would we constantly wake up in the middle of the night, sending each other messages, hoping the other was awake and wanting? I am a very passionate and sexual man, and my desires have been unfulfilled for almost always. I constantly have fantasies flying through my mind as to what sort of naughty trouble I could get into within the virtual world. Imagine waking up together in the early morning hours and being at the height of excitement as soon as you rolled out of bed. We would be exchanging our morning pleasantries, and the flirting would turn erotic quickly. The I send you a devilish message stating, Would you like to shower together this morning sweetie?  Think of the rush of doing such an act. Imagine having conversations with a man who actual cares if you are having an enjoyable day or not. A man who truly enjoys bringing smiles to other peoples faces. As we send sporadic messages back and forth while Im at my desk working, would you want to push the envelope yet again? I have a back, corner office where I could lock the door and do unmentionable things as long as we were extremely quiet. Perhaps you would rather me head out to my car to give you a voice call and spend ten to fifteen minutes making you cum for me and moaning out my name as you feel the sensual sounds of my voice vibrating through your very being? Or, would you prefer me stay in my office, and lock the door, as you turn on your cam to tease and torment me  you reaching extreme the heights of pleasure as you see my face full of lust and want in watching you seduce me with your body and mind? As is most likely easily deduced by the way I write and express my fantasies, I am searching for a sexting partner as well as a friend. I have been pushed to the virtual world to try and find satisfaction in both my own pleasures and being able to please another wanting my affections. Please be more than willing to push boundaries and escape reality with each other via pics, videos, live voice chats, and cam chats. I do know this type of vulnerability takes time to develop; however, it is what I am most searching and longing for. Physically, I a six feet tall, short, dirty blonde hair, with kind a kind smile and compassionate eyes. I am built like a linebacker with a little more to love around the middle. As for what I look in the person of my fantasies, I hope she has an amazing positive outlook on life and brings forth excitement and curiosity of how we can both attain pleasures never before thought imaginable. It is a womans smile, her mind, and her outlook on life which make her attractive to me. Your size, shape, age (other than being an adult), and ethnicity are what make you perfectly you. Please dont hold from reaching out if you dont fit what shallow-minded men see as beauty. I dont fit the Hollywood, perfect face and body fiction of a body image either. I am married and not looking to change your situation or mine whether you are single, separated, or married. I am hoping to get to know someone intimately and find exactly what not only makes you incandescently happy, but also become filled with lust for someone. All PMs are welcome. In my short experience posting on Reddit, men receive far less response than women, for various reasons of course. If you stumble across my post even days after it was originally posted, please feel free to reach out and say hello. The fall months are coming, and the romantic times that naturally come with the cooling of the weather and the changing of the leaves could be shared with someone who enjoys you completely.

Ideally this would be a long term thing. I'm open to becoming friends. I've had this happen where a former lover becomes a friend and it's lovely. I've found in my explorations that sex without vulnerability and intimacy doesn't do it for me, which is why I'm into this dynamic. I'm hoping you have found the same thing. &amp;#x200B; About you: You've got your shit basically together. You're not looking for anyone to complete you, fix you, or save you. You find the combination of age gap and nurturing dominance in Daddy/little girl relationships hot. You're looking for someone worthy of the level of trust and vulnerability that this sort thing requires. And you like just hanging out, going to the zoo, taking hikes, looking at cemeteries, looking at trees, and beating me at board games. You want to hear about my weirdness and want to tell someone yours. You crave more than vanilla. You crave the tension inherent in how inappropriate this relationship is. &amp;#x200B; About me: As for looks I'm about a 5/10 in the land of forty somethings. I'm losing some on top. Not a lot of wrinkles, but you can definitely tell my age. I'm still in pretty good shape, but not skinny. I've got a stocky build. Not really a beer belly, but just overall semi-lumpy. I'm not perfect. I'm not looking for perfect. Women tell me that my mind is what makes me attractive. I'm incessantly curious about nearly everything, but especially anything to do with the natural world. I wonder a lot and will stop mid stroke to answer questions like ""Where did the letter Q come from?"" and ""What is dark energy?"". My conversations rarely have a plan, and usually meander from topic to topic like a drunken kung fu master. Stats: Married. Ethically non monogamous. 5'10"". Sober 27 years, which basically means I'm a non drinker/non drug user. STD free (I get tested before any new relationships), Fixed, Stable, Sane. Risk Aware Consensual Kink. &amp;#x200B; So, I'm hoping that there's someone out there this appeals to. I'm always up for a chat, even if you're not interested. Hope to hear from you. "
492,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,24 [M4F] Seeking Devout Feminist for Misogynistic Red-Pill RP / Combative Conversation (Long Prompt; 30+),1,9n6zgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/9n6zgm/24_m4f_seeking_devout_feminist_for_misogynistic/,2018-10-11 16:00:26,"**TRIGGER WARNING** The prompt below contains content that could be offensive to anyone whos dealt with online harassment before. *** *** **INTRODUCTION** This is going to be a *very* long post, so I will keep the introduction relatively short. Before I share my prompt, heres a little about myself and a general idea of what Im seeking. Unlike a great deal of the females here on Reddit, I do not get flooded with responses; which is to say, you have all the time in the world to respond to this prompt. And considering how lengthy this post actually *is*, perhaps it would be best experienced if you bookmarked it and read it at your leisure. Even if you dont reply, I hope you enjoy the story below regardless. I had a lot of fun writing it. And, please, dont take it too seriously, folks. ...Its *just* a story. *** *** **ABOUT MYSELF** Im American, twenty-four years old. Six foot three, with broad shoulders and a muscular build. I have blond hair and bright, blue eyes. Pale complexion. Hung *(by any realistic standard)*. Frankly... I have too many kinks to be able to list them all coherently. Even [this](URL doesnt do a very good job of expressing the depths or subtleties of my depraviltiy *(itll have to do, though)*. My only hard-limits are children, animals, scat and submitting to women. Everything else can be negotiated, so long as the right context is involved. *** *** **WHO IM SEEKING** Im seeking a self-identified Feminist, with credentials. Second-wave and up, preferably the third-wave SJW type *(I dont want to debate suffrage or property rights or obvious issues like that)*. You should be older than I am *(at least thirty, please; although exceptions can be made)*. *** *** **WHAT IM SEEKING** I want our roleplaying to be punctuated by real and *very* combative debate, which would then organically filter back into our scenario. Any frustration or aggregation that builds-up between us, we can *use it* to make our roleplaying more electric. Think of it as half exaggerated fantasy and half taboo confession, with the catharsis of hate-fucking. I prefer long-term roleplaying, which develops slowly and gains momentum over time. Some of the best scenarios Ive ever roleplayed built-up and crescendoed over the course of days, or even weeks. With the right investment, those exchanges seemed to gain an agency all their own. Thats what Im looking for, even if it means that sometimes we have to sacrifice the most immediately satisfying outcome for necessary story set-up. That said... Im also content with the occasional short-term session *(if Im not already committed to a long-term one)*. Im not concerned with your appearance *(meaning nothing is a deal-breaker for me)*, but I do strongly prefer that you roleplay using your own looks, regardless of the particular scenario *(it just makes things a little more grounded and immediate).* Aside from that, I have no other requirements. I dont mind if youre the type of roleplayer whos enthusiastic, but who sometimes feels like they arent able to contribute more than the bare minimum; and conversely, I dont mind if youre the type of roleplayer who prefers to take a much more active role in the story as it develops. We can share an equal position leading the scenario or I can guide you through it like a literary rollercoaster-ride; both are fine with me, *its entirely up to you.* *** *** **SCENARIO** We met in early 2017, on a rather frigid January morning, in the midst of the *Womans March*. You were standing in a tight-knit circle of protesters, each wearing the same pink pussy-hat over their frozen ears, and each holding a placard more naive and absurd than the last. *(Yours read: **The Patriarchy Can Eat a Dick**.)* I approached you with a camera-man and a microphone, feigning sympathy with your cause. I seemed genuine and respectful when making my request  not to mention *a little* charming  so you gladly agreed to do an interview with me. In the theatre of your mind, you couldnt help but imagine seeing yourself on YouTube later that day, then immediately sharing the link with everyone you knew. It wouldnt be as good as getting yourself on the news, but there was still plenty of time left in the day for that. Whenever the *Womans March* would be brought up in conversation  not just during Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, but for *years* to come  your family and friends would associate *your name* with it. But, thats not what happened; at least, not how youd imagined it would happen... It took a few minutes for you to realize that I was treating you as some sort of inside joke, mocking your responses subtlety enough so that my audience would know to laugh along, without spoiling the joke by letting you know that it was at your expense. You thought the interview would likely be posted on some Alt-Right YouTube channel to incite mockery. Enraged and indignant, you and the circle of pussy-hat wearing protesters stormed away violently, trying to take my microphone from me in the process. You found the YouTube video Id posted a week later and contacted me shortly afterward, threatening legal action. *(In the comments section, theyd taken to either calling you that attention whore or the older one with the nice tits. Your pussy-hat was clearly knitted by hand, which itself inspired a whole separate chain of comments, pondering on what it must be like to grow-up with a psycho mother who thinks making genitalia out of yarn constitutes meaningful political action. One commenter wondered if you chose that ugly off-pink coloured wool to match the dusty shade your actual cunt.)* After a few days of exchanging heated emails back and forth, you decided not to pursue legal action. Not because youd realized that you had no case, which was indeed correct, but because youd started to... *enjoy* my replies. My messages were unapologetic and raw, but still understanding and sympathetic in their own way. You found yourself slowly being seduced by my worldview; not convinced, but compelled; *enchanted*, even. It was like an exotic drug, both intoxicating and freighting. You never mentioned our conversations to anyone, because you feared what your friends and family would think of you exchanging emails with a Nazi *(your words, not mine)*. Within time, my emails became one of the few aspects of your day-to-day like that you anticipated. After our correspondence had already taken its new form, the video Id made of you suddenly gained viral traction, causing GIFs of your comedically exasperated expression to spread like wild-fire. Thankfully, your family remained oblivious of your over-night internet infamy. You never saw the meme posted anywhere you regularly interacted online  within *your bubble*, that is  but once you peeked over the ideological fence, you saw it *everywhere*... Itd become ubiquitous amongst right-wing trolls, whod use the GIFs to solicit a cheap laugh. Others had taken to gleefully tormenting your Twitter, like sadistic gremlins praying on your vulnerability. You deleted your account, telling your family that youd simply grown tired of social-media. You even encouraged them to do the same, in hopes that youd limit their chances of being exposed to your humiliation. Basically, *you were the new Trigglypuff...* I brought up your new found status as a meme a few times during our conversations, mostly with an apologetic air to my tone, but sometimes with what approached humoured indifference. I reassured you that the joke didnt have any legs to it, and that people would move on eventually  likely sooner rather than later. Infuriated and hurt, you asked me how Id feel if my family saw *me* being made fun of in public. I told you that I wouldnt like it at all, no more than I enjoyed being labeled a sexist, simply for understanding economics enough to know that the *Pink Tax* and the *Wage Gap* were both self-propagating, self-serving myths. That street goes two directions, I said. Eventually, the frequency of our emails tapered off. You still watched my YouTube channel regularly, always alone and always with private browsing turned on, but we had no further contact. That is, not until January of the following year, when I sent you a message out-of-the-blue. I asked if you were going to the *Womans March: Redux*. When you confirmed that you were leaving your family at home to protest for the weekend, I suggested that you change your plans... Id also been planning to attend the march, hoping to trick another gullible participant into becoming a lucrative meme. But then, Id reconsidered, suspecting that the *Womans March* has become a case of diminishing returns. I decided that Id take the weekend off from producing content. Instead of interviewing uneducated protesters for a laugh, I was going to take a well-earned rest. Making a video five days a week can take a toll on you after a while. I booked a nice hotel room for two nights. You were invited to join me. I made sure it would have an excellent view of the protests taking place on the street down below. *Why stand out there in the cold, when the two of us could simply watch the estrogen-induced spectacle from a distance?* I pitched it to you as your vacation from Feminism. *Wouldnt it be more productive if the two of us had a long, civil conversation in my hotel room? Why stand out there, screaming at the top of your lungs and achieving nothing but welcoming more ridicule? ...Join me, instead.* After you rejected my offer, feeling shocked and repulsed by what you thought were obvious sexual implications, I boldly replied with my hotel and room number regardless. Then, I mentioned that if you found yourself standing out there in the cold, feeling dumb and miserable, you could always come join me. The invitation was an open one. Still beside yourself and throughly disgusted by my approach, you asked *how stupid I thought you were*. You dont want to prove your point, you said. You just want to *fuck* me. Then, a follow-up email sent thirty seconds later: Youre disgusting... *Yuck dude.* I thought better of you... So yeah, I must be pretty stupid I guess.* My reply came a second later. No, sweetheart. Youve got it backwards. I want to fuck you to prove my point, not the other way around. You didnt reply to that; you *couldnt* reply to *that*. You attended the *Womans March*, just like youd always planed to. After some deliberation, you packed your hand-knitted pussy-hat into your carry-on. You werent going to let a bunch of twenty-something virgins bully you into silence. But, Id been right about one thing, you realized. While standing out there in the street, holding your placard and chanting loudly, you felt *dumb* and throughly *miserable*. Every few minutes, you caught yourself looking up at the large hotel which loomed above the street, wondering which window was mine. *...Could I see you?* You found it increasingly hard to hold the placard above your head with enthusiasm. You began checking your email, wondering if Id sent you a message. When you saw that I hadnt, you scrolled up and looked at my room number again... *Do I go to him?*, you asked yourself. The idea caused a worm of excitement to writhe inside your stomach. Whenever you caught yourself considering the idea seriously, a wave of dread would then suddenly wash over you, extinguishing the giddy excitement youd felt. *What do I do!?* *** **FORMALITIES** If youre interested in playing out the scenario above, then send me a message and well go from there. Also, I should mention that any of the previous prompts that are still found in my history are fair game. If its not deleted, that means Im still eager to find a partner. Oh, yeah  and regarding the *misogyny* aspect of this scenario, we can take that as far as you desire to. Im content with whatever degree you wish to include, be it very minimal or pushed to the absolute extreme. *(Im very adept at using humiliation/degradation in my roleplaying.)* Just please be forthcoming with your kinks and your limits, so I dont run the risk of accidentally offending you when I merely intended to excite you. If youd like to involve another taboo kink into this scenario, pitch it to me and Ill likely be game to give it a shot. Please include your age, your Feminist credentials and a brief description of yourself in your reply. Its also helpful if you include some reference to the prompt you wish to play out, as I might not be sure which you are replying to. Im excited to hear from you, so dont be shy. I reply to all the replies I receive. If you are the type who finds it hard to open up on the first message, thats alright, too. Im more than happy to take this at your pace. For now, take care, be safe and dont let the assholes on here get you down."

This isn't about looking for a threesome (although if that happens down the road so be it!) **The Idea/Scenario!** We are looking to meet with a lovely lady for an interesting evening chat at a nice establishment (on the classier side) for drinks whilst we're all well dressed. The premise is that we think that sensuality relative to overt sexuality can be severely underrated and good conversation with the right amounts of well intentioned vulnerability can make for a delightfully stimulating evening regardless of any physical outcome. We'd like to hear about your sexual adventures, interests and curiousities. We would be happy to share ours in kind and to talk about sexuality in general and hopefully learn from each other and exchange ideas. There is then a gradual onset of flirting and suggestive hints (and perhaps even some cheeky footsie under the table or a subtle touch or two) as the evening goes on as well. **What sort of person are we looking for?** We are hoping for someone 23 and above who is confident, well spoken, is sex positive and has been explorative for drinks and an exchange between minds. Most importantly we are both extremely attracted to a good personality above all else and highly value being able to engage with others and creating a positive vibe. He is definitely a sapiosexual and she finds humility and being respectful extremely sexy. Physically (bonuses), we are curious about someone who might be brunette, blonde or a redhead (someone other than our own haircolours!), or who might be older than us or is a matured soul and we also happen to have a weakness for someone with a sizable (but not overly so!) bosom and who takes care of themselves. **Other relevant details** Our male half will be dressed in a suit, she'll be dressed in formal wear as she would be for a work event and we'd like for you to be dressed in a sexy and classy dress (we both have a weakness for good cleavage!). That is about what we had in mind. Should there be strong chemistry and interest all 3 ways, perhaps we could even take it back to our place but that certainly isn't not the expectation by any means for this. **About us** She is 54, thin build with cute perky breasts and a nice firm posterior (if I may say so!). She is biracial with black hair and is always well dressed, enjoys exploring the arts, culinary delights and travel. Heres a little bit about us: He is 58, skinny build tan/brown skin tone, an international and has black hair, a well kept beard and is eloquent and enjoys reading, trivia and hearing the stories behind people. Feel free to let me us know if you have any questions. We look forward to chatting!"

You will give me everything and I will never let go.",2,91me3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/91me3m/26_m4f_fl_you_will_give_me_your_heart_soul_body/,2018-07-25 09:08:25,"If you read to the end of this, it might be the beginning of a commitment that will change your life. A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely mine. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union I know, the union between a Master and a slave. What I am looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then I ask you to take a leap after the last sentence. You may not be able to see the bottom, but I will be there to catch you, and I am here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. I hope to share it with you soon. Let's start with some definitions slave: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Your definition of slave and my definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. We'll find the right balance for both of us to be satisfied. Personally, I like this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. We'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. Dominant: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. I think, especially in the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes me feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All I'm doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason I'm going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because I can't just dominate anyone I please. I need their trust. I need their consent. I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. Master/slave relationship: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. What will this relationship consist of: Active submission: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. Daily controls: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now, rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. Daily tasks: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. Weekly sessions: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. Punishments: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. What will be expected of you: Commitment: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. Devotion: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. Communication: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. Trust: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. Emotional intimacy: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. Physical intimacy: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. What you can expect from me: A Strong Hand: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. A Warm Heart: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. You'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. If you're interested tell me a little bit about yourself, and what you're looking for. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon."

A commitment to become a part of something larger than yourself. To become fully and entirely Danny Devito's. It doesn't matter where you've come from, what you've been through, or how wounded you are, because now is the start of something new. The start of the deepest union he knows, the union between a Master and a slave. What he is looking for in you is deep devotion, the willingness to give everything, even if hard, even if uncomfortable. You need to yearn for true vulnerability and true surrender, and know that it will be returned to you, in guidance, in discipline, and in love. If this is what you need, if this is what you seek to be whole, then he asks you to take a leap after the last sentence. You may not be able to see the bottom, but Danny will be there to catch you, and he is here with you now, at the top. At the end of this journey is something beautiful beyond words. Something sacred. Danny Devito hopes to share it with you soon. Let's start with some definitions slave: The definitions of BDSM are rather fluid and non-concrete. Your definition of slave and Danny Devito's definition of slave will also probably differ in some degree. He'll find the right balance for both of you to be satisfied. He likes this parsing of the two terms. A submissive accepts submission, while a slave accepts obedience. A submissive retains freedom of choice and a slave gives her freedom of choice to her Master. He'll clarify this a little more with the next definition though. Dominant: There's likely no need to go into the definition of a Dominant, but let me illuminate on a Dominant's function. In the online community, there's some kind of misunderstanding that a Dom is someone who dominates a submissive out of the power of his will. That's a very fanciful notion, and it certainly makes Danny Devito feel pretty great and powerful, but it's mostly just fantasy. All he is doing is typing words on a screen, and sending sound-waves over your speakers. There's not much power to that. You can do whatever you wish with them, including ignoring them all together. There's a reason he is going through the laborious process of writing an advertisement, because he can't just dominate anyone he pleases. he needs their trust. he needs their consent. he needs their active and willing submission. He does not dominate you with his power. He dominates you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to Danny Devito, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. Master/slave relationship: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, you shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship.

498,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,"32/29 [MF4F] Boston - Something different. Verbal sensuality, teasing amidst sharing drinks without physical follow through on the agenda(!)",1,92vwfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/92vwfj/3229_mf4f_boston_something_different_verbal/,2018-07-30 02:20:16,"This is an scenario that has been of interest to our male half for some time and that has now piqued her interest too considerably so here we are! This isn't about looking for a threesome (although if that happens down the road so be it!) The Idea/Scenario! We are looking to meet with a lovely lady for an interesting evening chat at a nice establishment (on the classier side) for drinks whilst we're all well dressed. The premise is that we think that sensuality relative to overt sexuality can be severely underrated and good conversation with the right amounts of well intentioned vulnerability can make for a delightfully stimulating evening regardless of any physical outcome. We'd like to hear about your sexual adventures, interests and curiousities. We would be happy to share ours in kind and to talk about sexuality in general and hopefully learn from each other and exchange ideas. There is then a gradual onset of flirting and suggestive hints (and perhaps even some cheeky footsie under the table or a subtle touch or two) as the evening goes on as well. What sort of person are we looking for? We are hoping for someone 23 and above who is confident, well spoken, is sex positive and has been explorative for drinks and an exchange between minds. Most importantly we are both extremely attracted to a good personality above all else and highly value being able to engage with others and creating a positive vibe. He is definitely a sapiosexual and she finds humility and being respectful extremely sexy. Physically please be hwp at least, we are curious about someone who might be brunette, blonde or a redhead (someone other than our own haircolours!), or who might be older than us or is a matured soul and we also happen to have a weakness for someone with a sizable (but not overly so!) bosom and who takes care of themselves. Other relevant details Our male half will be dressed in a suit, she'll be dressed in formal wear as she would be for a work event and we'd like for you to be dressed in a sexy and classy dress (we both have a weakness for good cleavage!). That is about what we had in mind. Should there be strong chemistry and interest all 3 ways, perhaps we could even take it back to our place but that certainly isn't not the expectation by any means for this. About us: She is 54, thin build with cute perky breasts and a nice firm posterior (if I may say so!). She is biracial with black hair and is always well dressed, enjoys exploring the arts, culinary delights and travel. Heres a little bit about us: He is 58, skinny build tan/brown skin tone, an international and has black hair, a well kept beard and is eloquent and enjoys reading, trivia and hearing the stories behind people. Feel free to let me us know if you have any questions. We look forward to chatting!"
499,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,"32 [M4F] Indiana  To feel wanted, needed, desired ... To feel that magical feeling of being vulnerable and intimate with someone so completely ... Is that feeling even a possibility? (Long)",3,969vii,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/969vii/32_m4f_indiana_to_feel_wanted_needed_desired_to/,2018-08-11 05:09:47,"How wonderful would it be to know that somewhere, out there (shout out to An American Tale ), there is a person thinking about you constantly? Even if that infatuation only lasts for a few weeks or a month, wouldnt it be amazing to be completely wanted, completely desired? Of course, those feelings are intensified when two people truly care and enjoy each other. When they share intimate details about themselves, when they pour out their worries and fears, when they make themselves vulnerable to that other person. Other than the obvious hardships of searching for companionship in the virtual world, trusting a stranger and becoming entirely vulnerable is almost impossible. Without this vulnerability however, how are the most magical exciting and intimate feelings possible? I am a married man who has been neglected and very rarely feel wanted, needed, or desired in my marriage. As most on here, I am not looking to leave my SO. I know, soon, I am going to have to confront her and experience extremely painful and heartbreaking discussions to truly change my situation. Before I open myself up and let out all the pain and rejection I have felt over the past 15 years or so, I want to feel as though I have escaped from my reality. I wish to experience what it feels like to completely be infatuated with a person and to lust for them constantly. The most exciting part of this for me is of course actually finding someone who wants and adores my advances and lustful desires towards them as well. I am searching for that person who wants to escape reality with me. Someone who enjoys me completely and how naughty I can be when teased. I am a calm, well-mannered, and compassionate man by nature, with almost an insatiable need to please once allowed or wanted to. For me, every woman is special in her own way. I desire a real woman who has lived life. I am not the shallow type who believes a woman should try and attain a supermodel figure. The pleasure is so much more delightful when the mind is provoked and teased. My hope is to find that special woman who enjoys my way of writing, my desire to send and exchanged teasing pics and videos and possibly live chat, and a woman who enjoys my unique imagination. I know moving away from just text is not for everyone. I am hoping to virtually meet that person who enjoys how showy I want to be and reciprocates my virtual treats. Physically, I am six feet tall, dirty blonde hair, kind eyes and smile, strong broad shoulders and chest with a little more to love around the middle. I believe every woman, no matter what shape, size, or age, is incredibly attractive and beautiful with how her personality and energy makes me come alive. Below, I am going to lay out one of my fantasies if I should ever find a person to experience it with. I know this post is already very long compared to others. If you arent curious about me after what you have already read, I hope you have a wonderful rest of your summer . Before I dive into one of my fantasies, please know that I see woman differently than most men. It might be my upbringing and only having sisters, but I sincerely believe you are truly, wonderfully you. Night Time Moment of Desire ... Im not sure if my situation is similar to others, but once I am home for the day, I very rarely have any time to myself. There is no personal time to relax and mentally get away from the stresses and hardships of the day. On a more depressing not, that means that there is no time at home for me to take care of myself since my wife does not think of being intimate with me more than once or twice a month if I am fortunate. This fantasy stems from that lack of alone time. Escape with me to an evening where 10pm is approaching, and you and I have been sending teasing messages back and forth whenever we are able to sneak one in with my wife always being only a few feet from me. You have sent me tantalizing texts as I sit in a chair just next to the couch my wife is on. You have so much fun knowing I am becoming increasingly aroused and not able to do a thing about it. I send you a quick picture of the obscene bulge in my boxers which you have caused. You relish at how hard you get me; how much I throb for you. This game of tease and torment lasts about an hour, and then communication breaks for about fifteen minutes. You know when I am at home, messaging is hit and miss due to my situation, so you start to think about what fun we might have tomorrow while I am at work. Then, you see your phone light up with a notification. Its a message, from me. Are you alone? ..... Those three words are all you see. You reply Yes in a split second. Shes in the bathroom, about to shower. Do you want to play with your lover while Im in my bed? Your heart starts to race, the excitement building at what is about to happen. The hour-long tease you put me through has put you in a complete state of need and arousal as well. With a feeling of pure lust and desire you reply to me, Call me...NOW! Immediately you see your phone showing a video call coming from me. You answer with your body feeling the excitement rippling through and my face appears on the screen. I tell you we have just a few minutes while my wife is in the shower, and I want to play with my virtual lover. You nod your head and have the sexiest, wanting smile on your face. The next ten minutes are filled with us teasing and pushing and playing with each other, desperately wanting to make the other cum. If you were living out this fantasy with me, who do you think would be pushed over the edge first? Fair warning, I am insatiable when it comes to making a woman cum. Im guessing it stems from rarely being able to fulfill that need at home. I hope you enjoyed this little peek into my imagination. All PMs are welcome. I am in the Eastern Time Zone. Thank you for reading this extremely long and detailed post. I you dont send me a message, I hope you have a wonderful weekend  "

I need their active and willing submission. I do not dominate you with my power. I dominate you with yours. That's an important distinction to make. So yes, you will give your freedom of choice to me, but at all times, that will be out of your own freedom to do so. Master/slave relationship: So let's dispel with the notion that a Master/slave relationship is fundamentally different from a vanilla relationship. The same cornerstones of a vanilla relationship (trust, honesty, communication, sacrifice, love, etc.) are the same cornerstones of a successful BDSM relationship, and in the end, we shouldn't look to toss those aside, but rather live them and embody them in the profound way which can only be found in a D/s/M/s relationship. I firmly believe these fundamentals are expressed at their strongest between a Master and a slave, and that's why I am pursuing this. Humiliation and degradation can be an important part of a Master/slave dynamic, but I firmly believe that submission should be a act of self-expression and therefore empowerment, and therefore my greatest role as a Dom is to empower you, both as my slave, and as my significant other. What will this relationship consist of: Active submission: What I will be striving for is to instill an active submission in you in every part of our relationship. I want to instill a mantra in you My Master before myself, his wants before mine, his needs before mine. I want you to grow deeper in your submission a little bit every day, and continue to find new meaning and purpose in it at every point. Again, I do not want you to view this as the losing of yourself, rather the surrendering and fulfillment of yourself in submission. Daily controls: At all times, I will select portions of your life that I will entirely decide for you. These areas will be a reminder to you that you are owned, cared for, and loved, and that you will need to strive every day to be the best slave you can for me. These areas are not determined right now, rather they will be determined based on who you are as a slave. There will only be a few areas at a time, and they will fluctuate, giving you the space and freedom to simply be you at all times. Daily tasks: Similar with controls, every day you will have at least one task to complete for me. Often they will be simple, sometimes they will be lengthy and time-intensive (I will work with your schedule). They may be sexual, or completely non-sexual. They will often be used to help you grow as a slave. When not that, they will be used to help you grow as a person. And when not that, they will just be for my pleasure. Weekly sessions: I think it's important for both our intimacy and development that we play together and enjoy each other as often as we can. Therefore, I will expect at least one real-time BDSM session a week. This is where we will explore the majority of our kinks, and where eventually I will challenge your limits. Safe words will be treated as gospel, and aftercare (the part where I serve you and your needs) will be a must. Expect tears, pain, suffering, and ecstasy. Also expect to feel like you're safe and belong completely. Punishments: Can take the form of a task, but will often take the form of a session. I punish harshly and severely, but I am always fair. I don't believe in holding things against my slave, but I also don't believe in letting her get away with much either. You will hurt for your transgressions but they will be completely forgiven and forgotten afterwards. What will be expected of you: Commitment: Yes, this is play, and there is a greater more important life beyond it. But the NFL is also play, and you don't get to play in it unless you take it very seriously. I expect your full effort. I expect you to not retreat from problems when they come up, but work through them with me. I expect you to make the changes needed in your life to make this work. I expect you to carry out every instruction I give you to the best of your ability. I will be entirely committed to this. I will demand the same from you. Devotion: I need someone entirely devoted to me, beyond just being committed. Someone who will care for me and be there for me. Someone who will think of me actively. I expect you to go above and beyond for me. I expect you to yearn for me. You will be rewarded at all times for this. Communication: Let me make this clear. Yes, your needs are important. Yes, your wants are important. Yes, your state of mind is important. So is your mental status, your feeling of safety, your comfort, your emotions, your energy, your time. Everything about you is important. I'm a great Dom, but I cannot be a great Dom for you if you do not communicate with me at all times. I'll want to know everything about you. Please do not confuse this for you having control. What I do with this information will be entirely my choice, and sometimes I will ask you to surrender your needs and wants for mine, but it's crucially important for active communication to occur for this to work. Trust: Sometimes you will be in the dark. Sometimes I may push you to places you may not think you can go. I promise, if I ask of it of you, I see the strength in you, and I know at the end of the road it will lead to a better relationship, a stronger you, and a deeper submission. I will always have your best interests in heart. You will know that, and you will trust that. Emotional intimacy: When I own a person, I own their mind too, and I will need to possess it. This will include scary things such as secrets and deep-seated fears (even though, I promise, it will not be scary when these things are in my hands.) But it also includes just letting me know you as a person. I want to know what your hopes are, what your aspirations are. What you like to do on a day off. What makes you smile and what makes you laugh. I want to own, and I want to be with you. Give that to me. Physical intimacy: Well, you are my slave. Of course I will undress you. Expose you. See every inch of you. I like panties and bras, and breasts, and pussies, and belly-buttons, and butts. I like seeing you rub your clit, finger yourself, and listening to your moan. I love seeings welts and bruises form on your pale skin. You will be my slut and my sex-toy. This all does not need to happen at once, and I will of course accommodate you to make it a positive experience for you as well. But I want your whole self, and you will give it to me. What you can expect from me: A Strong Hand: As your Dominant I will hold high expectations for you. I will demand that you know your place and keep you in it. I will deal with you harshly when needed, and always demand the best out of you. You will be my slave and my toy, and I will freely use you as such. You will serve me. I will be your Master, and I will mold you as I see fit. A Warm Heart: But I'm also going to be there for you. I will be your mentor, your companion, and your friend. I will do all I can so you end every night with a smile on your face, that is a promise. If you ever need me, I will be there. If you need to talk about something, you have my full attention. You'll have someone by your side, supporting you, encouraging you, believing in you, helping you grow at all times. If you're interested tell me a little bit about yourself, and what you're looking for. We'll talk, get to know each other, and hopefully get started on this journey together. I'll meet you soon."

It is what I carry with me all time, it's mine entirely. It is who I am. And it should only be me, who gets to decide what to do with it. And I love it, in its rawest form. I love being naked, without a stitch covering me at all. The sensation of the line between the world around me and my body shedding away, as I shed every piece of clothing away. That's what I live for. Have you ever been naked in outdoor? Feeling the breeze wrapping you, caressing every single nook and cranny and curve and crevice, it's an exhilarating feeling. As the sun shines on you, you feel alive, knowing that you are how you are meant to be. Or have you been naked with others? It can be ""odd"". Maybe for a minute or two. But as the shame and prudishness melts away, and vulnerability makes way to familiarity, nakedness becomes a tool of warmth. Seeing other people's bodies, as they see yours, in its purest form is amazing. It can be sexy, and sensual, just like any other form of dress. But it can also be warm, cozy, and just natural. Let's talk."

You are leaning over the couch where the assortment of clothes is to fold them in your categorically perfect piles. The outfit you have so nonchalantly chosen is a sports bra with a loose-fitting t-shirt and your tight yoga pants. I come up quietly behind you. My approach hidden by the music you are playing to make your chore more enjoyable. I step within an inch of you, and I wait for you to stand straight up as you pick another piece of clothing to fold. Within a second or two you rise up, and I move swiftly to run my left arm around your torso to secure you into my body, and my right hand keeping you quiet as I cover your mouth. I lean into your ear and tell you exactly what we are going to do...what I am going to do to you...what I am going to do with you... Your body starts to melt in my embrace and your breathing quickens. I spin you around and place my hands on either side of your cheeks, and I pull you in for a deep, deep kiss. I want to memorize every part of your delicious lips. I want to memorize your exquisite taste. We moan into each others mouths as I lift you into the air and move over to the third step of the stairs. We never break our pleasurable embrace. We never stop feeling and exploring each other. I lower us onto the step with you straddling my lap, and I move my mouth to passionately lick and kiss your perfect neck. Your mouth naturally moves to my ear where your moans urge me forward and continue to cause my body to feel ripples of pleasure through it..... This is just one of many ways I dream at night about how it would be like to be with a woman who longed for passion as much as I. Hopefully, I can find such a woman who aches to be vulnerable with a kind and caring man. A woman who wants to feel devilishly sexy ripples flow through her body as my voice tempts her ear. A woman who wants to send and receive such naughty material that we would submit to each others wants and desires. All PMs welcome.

Usually this sub reddit's members meet one time only, but if we get along, then I'm willing to be a worthwhile companion. Describing myself, I'm a North Side SWM, finding himself unable to meet women due to too much commitment. I'm Christian, democratic, read news a lot, slowly binge watching one series at a time like Mrs. Maisel on Netflix, and incredibly nerdy. Finally, what type of woman do I seek? Please be single, not seeking to cheat, DDF, close proximity to north side so I can host you, and intelligent like myself. Most importantly please be a healthy body type. What I mean is not obese, not so thin bones are showing, and not a heavy drug user trading sex for a hit. Just have a normal healthy body type. Can be super athletic, can be chubby, can even have so much self confidence your body image not a type at all. I feel like if I don't put in this disclaimer, then r trashy types will reply to me.

So now, in addition to sending me info about your interests, disposition, and what you look like, I'd also like to know what feminism means to you, and/or how feminism informs the way you interact in kinky spaces with submissives. This will tell me a lot about what you're made of (... and what you could make me do). Me: 22 years old, tough n' tender service submissive. Tiny. Delightful. Devoted. Sharp as a whip. Curvy, tattooed, would fit right in on Suicide Girls, probably. There's some more info about what I look like in my [past ](URL [posts](URL and I will, of course, send you a photo if I'm interested. You are: 25-45 (ideally late 20's, early thirties) residing in the city of Chicago and able to host, experienced with ongoing kinky relationships. You live your life with compassion, care, and positivity. You're able to express yourself emotionally and be vulnerable; you seek this in others. You have an intuition about people, can catch on to what they're hiding and what they might be afraid of. You're stable and feel confident you can provide stable, steady support and meet with regularity. You're kinky as fuck, and understand that a scene is nothing without mutual trust, safety, and open communication. You're a sadist, hedonist, a Daddy Dom, or perhaps a whole other combination of archetypes who love affectionate, firm, uplifting, consensual cruelty/degradation. When it comes to men, I don't have a ""type"" at all, though I'm partial to men who look like [Alton Brown](URL and have the sadistic, devious streak of his Cutthroat Kitchen persona. I also enjoy men who dress well - not in any specific style, but in a way that you can clearly tell they put care into it. Your outlook is much more important than what you look like. Attraction can always grow, provided there's a seed of lust there to start from. I'm flexible around what I'm looking for, always trying to find that sweet spot between having the structure and boundaries I need, and being open enough to account for multiple possibilities. So at the moment I'm open to: Full-on Dominants, semi-casual play partners, people who just wanna be part of group sex with me, and people who might want to go with the flow. (Not my strong suit, admittedly, but I'm trying.) I'm into: patience, enthusiastic consent, emotional vulnerability, compassion, open-mindedness, affectionate cruelty, being appreciated beyond my body (and what I can accomplish with it), learning new things, trying new things, sessions that last entire afternoons, frank yet sensitive communication, feeling special, and being special. I also love The Office more than anything in this world. Also into: service submission, spanking, structure, consequences for misbehaviour, ample praise, filthy blowjobs, dirty talk, the nurturing nature of Daddy Doms, discussing kink till I'm blue in the face, hairpulling, bruises, orgasm denial, sex in public, being lovingly called a slut, affirmation, tenderly degrading piss stuff, choking, forehead kisses, nicknames just for me, being held down, being pushed around, being a messy girl. And, well. Lots more. *** IMPORTANT*** Please PM me if interested - and only PM. If you leave a comment, K*k me, Fetlife me, show up at my house... You're going to be blocked. No take-backs. And as usual, if you don't live in Chicago (the city proper), cannot host (this is a big one), have zero kink experience, send me a dick pic, and/or don't pay close attention to the details of the post, I will not hesitant to block you. And, I can't believe I still have to say this, but: DON'T BE A CREEP. (ALSO, PLEASE DON'T TELL ME ABOUT YOUR DICK. I DON'T CARE, UNLESS WE ARE IN A SCENE AND IT IS, CONSENSUALLY, ALL UP IN AND AROUND MY (sub)SPACE. THEN I'M INTO IT. BUT ONLY THEN.)

I am looking for a partner to explore, grow and bond with. I finally entered therapy a few years ago. Since then I have been through pain, growth and in the last few months finally some progress. One of the issues that emerged is that my sexual identity developed in secret and in shame. Even though I have been kinky my whole life, I have not been free or completely honest with myself. Since having letting go of the past and being single for a while, I concluded that I need to prioritize a D/s relationship as a way of self discovery. Im finding out who I am all over again. Part of that is obviously finding a partner. I am open to all levels of experience, but ideally, someone who is also in a phase of exploration and/or growth. My ideal partner would be smart, strong, self-sufficient and mine. I'm attracted to women who are engaged with the world and themselves. There is nothing more beautiful than self-awareness and vulnerability. Ideal partner would be 26-40, ambitious and curious. Im very much into consent and communication. I know you are there and we have so much to learn from each other. Also, I have some switchy tendencies, love 420 and am D&amp;DF.

The more confident she is, the more you want to ravage her. The allure isn't in the sex, that's only part of the package. The thrill lies in the process of solving the mystery puzzle that is her. Learning to ask the right questions, push the right buttons, stripping her off her vulnerability bit by bit. Your favorite part comes when you begin to be an exception to her every moves and rules and boundaries and limitations that she ever had, because she trusts you now. That raw, intoxicating rush of adrenaline you get from the ultimate triumph of having her at your fingertips, completely succumbed to your wimps and pleasures?

We have no expectations for you to take your clothes off or use anything beyond your hands, but we're comfortable with more if you're into it. A little about us - she's a sexy petite brunette with a great ass and he's 6'1"" with an athletic-ish build and a short beard. We have some experience with threesomes/group play. We can grab a drink and get to know each other a little first if you want, or we can jump right into it! We're located in Cambridge, MA and are able to host. Message us and we can exchange some pictures, hope to hear from you!"
516,vulnerability,dirtyr4r,36 [m4w] seattle - looking for someone desires transparency and vulnerability and intimacy,2,7v606o,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/7v606o/36_m4w_seattle_looking_for_someone_desires/,2018-02-04 21:14:54,"A lot of guys want fwb or someone to quickly move onto sex, because thats what we think about all the time. Its true, I am guilty of that, but thats not what I am looking for here. I want to meet someone to become friend with first, and grow the friendship into a special one that is foremost emotionally satisfying for both parties. I love sex and imagine a lot of kinky things that I want to do with someone who too enjoys it, but I know we cant reallt enjoy it unless we have an emotional bond built on trust. I know it sounds weird and not necessarily true for everyone. Some people really just want a one night stand. For me, sex without feeling is mechanical and boring. I dont mean I must love you, but I want to care for you and cater to your needs. I want it to be happy and meaningfulsomething we both wholeheartedly feel happy about. If you are not bored yet...hear me out. I want to meet someone who doesnt know me, my family, my friends, my background, my job, my religion, so I can talk about anything and never worry about how I am perceived, how I look, how stupid or wrong I am, how I am judged, etc. Consider it a clean slate of a friendship, a blank piece of paper. Its not an anonymity for the purpose of disguising our true selves, but rather anonymity for us to live our true selves. In my normal life with friends and family that I know, I cant actually say and be who I really am, because I have a lifetime of expectation to live up to. But with you, I can be completely real and honest, and I know I dont have to be ashamed because you too will commit to this friendship with complete honesty and transparency. This sounds weird but I actually feel very turned on by this. I want to be able to have someone who we both know, can ask each other any question and trust that the other person will answer with complete honesty. Whats the most embarrassing secret? I have to shave my eyebrow every morning because I dont want people to know that I have an unibrow for example. Whats the worst thing you did? Etc I dont know I just think this kind of intimacy is better than sex...actually it makes me horny just thinking about it. Of course to make it safe and to maintain the relationship, we probably shall never actually meet in person or at least introduce each other to our real life social circle. However if we both enjoy it, we could be transparent physically too via video chat or even in person eventually. Of course it depends on how things develop and where we are located. At the end of the day the most important thing is we respect each others boundary and be willing to say and accept no as an answer, and never lie to the other person. PM me if interested."

(maybe)",2,7o4s5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/7o4s5r/26_m4f_indiaonline_kinky_dirty_talking/,2018-01-05 05:05:41,"*Jeez, that was a mouthful. Here for what the title says. Ok, not really what the title says. But close. Maybe not the heartbreak though. Definitely not that. Never judge a post by its title. Or something like that in the internet age. Thank god for clickbait.* Hey there Reddit. How's it going this fine day? How's 2018 treating you so far? Made any resolutions yet. I have, and that's what I am here for. (probably) My fellow grasshoppers, as you know dating is not easy. And online dating is even less easy. It's often difficult to find a person that just fits. Not like a soulmate (in the beginning at least), but more like a glove that just fits. So you can imagine the chances of finding someone that you like, they like you, all this for a long time and also are on the same level of kinky perversions as yourself. All this for a 'someone' that is a single one out of thousands of millions of possible people and supposed to be 'meant for you'. The chances are very low. But even with all of those impossible odds stacked against any chance of finding anything meaningful and substantial out there in the cesspool of bullshit, it's still possible to hope. Hope that it will be all worth it for that one person that makes it worth it. Maybe I am a bit delusional to think I can find it here, but so be it. It doesnt make sense (mathematically or logically otherwise), but I still believe it is possible to find a glove that fits. I know this reads more like a vanilla dating profile than one geared towards individuals of the BDSM propensity. But that's the whole point. Kinks are just a part of who I am as a whole. They are not my entire being. When I recently discovered my desires of the BDSM variety, I didn't do it by making a Fetlife profile or visiting munches or watching Youtube videos on how to make the perfect restraints out of rope. I don't understand the titles and the rules, to be honest. I am just a guy, who likes to be dominant (and maybe submissive? I'm not sure), that's all. I'd not want to be reduced to a 'to do' list of kinks. Though you can rest assured. There are a ton of dirty, pervy things that will be explored when the right person comes along. The awesome and fun stuff will obviously be a part of whatever that happens, and it will come later. Im much more interested in connecting with as a normal person/human being first. I'm 26, 6'1"" tall, brown eyes, black hair. I have a short beard that I like to trim ever so slightly. I am currently on the bulkier side of things body wise. I had been unhealthy in the past (obesity), and now I am working to take care of my body to the best of my ability. That involves lifting 3 times a week, running 3 times a week (on alternate days), Yoga daily(ok more like 4 times a week), playing a sport or two on the weekends, complemented by a simple yet effective diet. I'm not sure if I look like a stereotypical dom. I look more like an extra large cuddly bear, like Winnie the Pooh. (Unless the stereotypical dom looks like an extra large Winnie the Pooh!) Im also a pretty normal guy. I like to ride on my motorcycle endlessly on an open road, scratch the underbelly of my neighbor's cat (He likes it that cute bastard!), have unexpected bursts of raw, honest emotions in the middle of gatherings that make me afterward go, ""Wait, did I really do that?"" and much more. Also, not a fan of writing about myself. This post has been an exercise in self-discipline. I like a quiet night in versus a loud night out any day of the week. No drugs, smoking, drinking, crazy party any of that. A few hours after we talk, you will feel like youve always known me. I take good care of myself after years of being ignorant about its importance. I can talk days and days about diet and fitness and have grown very very passionate about it. I also have both dom and sub inclinations. Though I think that labels are not very helpful and am still not entirely sure what any of it means and have yet to explore much as Ive not yet found the right person. I believe all of this is much more important than a list of kinks because Im just a human being at the end of the day, with my flaws and imperfections that you should know and hopefully accept and love before we talk our perversions. I see sex and intimacy as beautiful private things, that are born out of a depth of connection and are not pleasures that should be had on a whim. And as you may have experienced this is kinda hard to find. If youre looking to check stuff off a kink list, I am not the person to do this. I want much more than that. I want patience, loyalty, kindness and a metric tonne of cuddles. I'm a romantic sap! But I also want to be able to tease you again and again till you beg me to fuck you. And then fuck you till you beg me to stop. I have simple desires like that! My best friend that laughs at my terrible jokes and lets me have a delusion of being the smarter one while being extremely intelligent herself but modest about it. At the same time, also hungry for me with an extremely creative, dirty and filthy mind! And I don't want to sacrifice one for the other. I guess you could say I am being unrealistic here, but so be it. Maybe this person is just a grand delusion and it's too much to ask of someone. I don't care. I get to live only once. I have to do my best. I'm just hoping that there is someone out there that comes across this research paper length of a post and coincidentally wants this all. To be best friends and create memories as well as loiter in a pool of endless depravity that will lead to mind-blowing orgasms and utter peace. It'll not be for lack of trying that I won't find what I want. I want to find my complement. Different from me, my glove that just fits right. The sub to my dom and maybe the dom to my sub if we so desire. Someone who knows the kind of intimacy this creates and knows the amount of trust needed and the vulnerability that it requires. Or if they don't, then they learn it with me in time. You might see that I haven't said much in terms of details. These will come with time. I would like to take this slow. Age-wise I am pretty open-minded. Don't let our age differences (either more or less) deter you from reaching out. I would ideally really like to have something IRL and meet ultimately. Long Distance or online is not as bankable as a relationship at all. Though I do realize the kind of situation I am in, being from a different continent as most of the users here. And the astronomical chances of finding a traveler here that has similar interests. I do welcome online as well as a result. As for your body, I do realize that beauty and attraction are more than just descriptions like petite or cute or plump. I'd like you to be healthy or at least doing what you can to be healthy, as I know the struggles that come with a fitness journey. Also, love yourself (for lack of a better word) and your body. So I can love it in turn. I should stop writing before I bore you to death. I hope this post serves as an adequate icebreaker. I dont know if Ill find her here, but Im going to try and hope just in case. Nothing is certain, things may or may not take any shape. But you will not find out without reaching out. Now I'm going to ask you to do the most cliche thing possible. Just be yourself. We shall see where things lead and hope for the best. Are you my glove that fits just right?"

He's a 3-year old Pitbull mix and a fairly good boy. I yet have to fall while wearing heels for him. - Speaking of wearing things - I enjoy dressing up. I enjoy hiding my vulnerability and insecurity behind a facade. Not many things get me as hyped as my Dog's leash. In a lot of cases it leads to me dressing up. From short jeans sorts and fitting tops all the way to skimpy party dresses. I'm garbage at relationships. I really am. I constantly need reassurance, I have trust issues and I deny myself to be loved. - Which might be one reason why I cope so well with a dog. But I crave for attention. I want to charge the bitch in me. I like acting arrogant and over the top. I enjoy making scenes, just to be important. - This is why I love taking my dog for a walk. I can dress up and show myself off. I can dwell in the horny looks guys give me and smile at angry woman who can't stop their guys from fantasizing. The confidence I feel, while being protected by my canine friend is indescribable for me. However, today, I broke. When somebody would ask me what my sexual orientation is, I wouldn't be able to describe it properly. But I know for a fact, that I'm into Girls. Not from a relationship perspective, but damn. When I see a hot girl, I get the chills. Today was such a day. I rarely see hot girls. Which might be due to my over the top standards. She was a blonde, wearing white skinny jeans and a crop-top. I'm sure I froze looking at her bum, only to stare awkwardly at her immensely gorgeous belly piercing. - Which wouldn't be half as gorgeous if her tummy wouldn't suit it. I immediately approached her and talked to her. Asked her where she got it from and if she knew the brand. - Before a real conversation could evolve, her boyfriend appeared. He laid his hands onto her waist, locking a few fingers into her belt loop as he pushed the jeans down, gently exposing the bright color of her panties. I haven't yet experienced such caring, yet proprietorial behavior. The way he looked at me communicated so many things. - Without him saying a word, I felt that he found me attractive. I could almost hear him asking how I like his girlfriend, before his look changed into something along the lines of ""You can't imagine what I do with her in the bedroom"". I barely remember anything of the conversation. There was just this playful aura between the two of them. It was so obvious that she belonged to him, in the sense, that he owned her. She behaved submissive, yet cute. He showed her off, yet didn't degrade her. ______________________________________ If you don't know what to make out of this post, I don't blame you. I'm just venting. Venting my frustration. My desires. I like to chat dirty. I really do. I always knew that I need human interaction. That I can't be a wolf, just eyeing on my prey as I show myself off. I'm not interested in making friends. I'm not interested in what you look like. Frankly, I don't even care about who you are. As in what you do, what shaped you in life. All I desire is .. a companion. Somebody entering my fantasy. Helping me to not feel lonely. I'm unsuitable for a relationship, yet sexually satisfied. I'm a career person. I'm efficient while not working well with emotions. I'm not a submissive girl that you can play your master / slave stuff with. Which doesn't mean that I'm not submissive. I'm as complicated as I sound. I'm crazy, I'm fucked up. I like to be special, just to have someone show me how ""common"" I am. I like to look down on people, just to be looked down upon. I like to be submissive and obedient, just to pull out my claws a few minutes later as I unleash the playful little cat in me. I don't like to be bored. I like momentum, heat, taboos. As long as you can accept that I'm not into scat, urine, gore, vore, latex, leather and BDSM in the sense of whips, immobility, masks, burns, wax and other things that prevent me from acting the way I want to act, I'd love you to approach me. Oh! And please be animal friendly. I have a bond with my dog and I consider him to be my friend. Treat him as such if you expect me to treat you well."

Wouldn't you want to take revenge on those arrogant bitches? Haven't you fantasized about it as well? To take all their designer clothing and accessories away .. just leaving them in their heels and chokers. What if I told you I would give you that? What if I told you I'd love for you to humiliate me as much as they did? To use me as a toy for your dog. Don't you think such a big guy does deserve a little fuck toy to blast his load into?

I'm not looking for anything other than to fall in love in our own way, for our own brief time--to feel that there is another person who likes that my heart beats quicker for because of our interaction. I'm not specifically looking to be dirty, live out a fantasy, fuck, or have comfort. I'm looking to share a brief stupid love with someone where we can look back and say ""what the fuck was that...awesome."" I think this involves honesty, vulnerability, and risk. I don't care who you are. I care only that you can love quickly. But we can start slow. Very slow. I fall in love with: people who challenge, people who dream, people who are curious, people who have regrets, people who are sad that they can't have more, people who giggle, people who love. Either/or, for you: * beach or mountains * locked out or locked in *Sex or cuddling * shrieks or swoons * Sunset or sunrise * coffee or tea * books/movies with hanging endings or bow-tie endings * Principles or strife * tongue or lips * Sneaking out or lying to stay in * Liz Lemon or Jenna Baloney * Too much wine or too much [other] * Alone in the woods or stuck in a crowd. Questions: 1. What is something you think I need to read, watch, consider? 2. What is a secret you don't want to tell someone who is close to you? 3. What is something people notice about you? 4. What is something you want people to notice about you more often? 5. What made your last relationship fail? 6. If your life ended tomorrow, how would you feel? 7.

I'm fat, Caucasian, and short. I can switch but have been dominant for more than a decade. I like emotional connection and vulnerability, but it's not necessary. You can have any experience level. I prefer those who have few limits and/or are very open minded to exploring limits. You should find BBWs attractive. You should have some interests outside of kink that you don't mind sharing. I would prefer someone who has an openness to sex with multiple genders but it's not necessary. I won't return all messages, but if you put in some effort, there's a good chance I will.

I'd love to meet up, grab a drink, make out, then watch you go down on me. If you're looking for tips on how to make me (or any guy) cum, here ya go. I'm hoping you'll use them against me ;) 1) When I feel my cock hit the back of your throat and it stops you from breathing. Why? Because I know you're a little uncomfortable and vulnerable, and you trust that I'm not going to hurt you. That trust and vulnerability is a total turn-on. Plus, it feels good :) 2) When you make a moaning, breathy sound. Why? If you're making noises that sound like you're desperate for my cock, it makes me think you're really enjoying this! 3) When you stroke me while you lick my balls, taint, and ass. Why? Because it expands the area you're pleasuring. I love getting my cock sucked, but it's a very focused feeling. When you keep stroking my cock and move your mouth somewhere else, it doubles up my pleasure. 4) When you show me the cum in your mouth before you swallow it. Why? Right when I cum, I can't really pay attention to anything else. The world is a bit of a blur. When I come back around and you already swallowed my cum, I didn't really get to watch you. Hold it in your mouth for a second, show me how much you fucking love it, then swallow for me. 5) When you look at me. Why? First, because your eyes are sexy. Second, because it reminds me that you're here for my pleasure and you're not just blindly sucking cock. Don't overdo it, though. It's not a staring contest :) Want more? PM me and I'll give you some private instruction ;) The next guy you're with after me will appreciate it!"

I also enjoy gaming, reading, and I write and record music and perform in a band. I really enjoy digital privacy as a hobby - I like to see how much I can avoid being tracked by Google and Facebook and stuff like that, but I'm not so hardcore about it that I'm willing to go live in a cabin in the woods. Also dad to two cats and a ball python. As the title says, I am polyamorous. I understand not everyone is, so I just wanted to be upfront about that. My views on poly are that if I'm doing things right, no partner should feel like a secondary. I currently live with my girlfriend, we've been together for a year and we're quite happy. I'm not looking to leave her, just expand my current circle, and she knows I'm looking. She would want to meet any potential partners but she's not really looking to join any new relationships right now. She's not against it, but she's pretty busy so she's not actively looking. This is really just for me. But she is hugely nerdy, huge into anime and video games, so if that's you you'll probably get along with her pretty well. I consider myself heteroflexible, which is why I marked ""M4R,"" but I'm mainly attracted to femme and androgynous looking people. You're welcome to try your luck even if you're clearly male-presenting but I'm just letting you know I'm not likely to be interested. Sorry, nothing person, but we like what we like and again I wanted to be upfront. Having said that, gender doesn't really matter to me so feel free to contact me if you're trans, NB, male, female, whatever if I pique your interested and you think we might be a good fit. I would prefer someone local to central Texas but I might be willing to do long distance if we have good chemistry. If there's anything I missed, let me know. Hope to hear from someone cool!
