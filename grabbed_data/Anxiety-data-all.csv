0,vulnerability,Anxiety,Fake it,1,icq8io,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/icq8io/fake_it/,2020-08-20 01:51:33,"Fake it til you make it has been my mantra for the past several months in my work life. I have to put on my happy hat and smiley mask every day to keep things smooth at my work place. Im in a position of (small) leadership, a director position, and to run my team I need to have my game up and my energy high. The problem isIm getting tired again. I can only keep it up for so long before I break and fall apart. Ill have nights at home where I self-medicate in various methods or just cry for a while, sometimes both. I have a routine I force myself to stick to as much as I can, which includes physical exercise, walking, and eating regular meals as well as tending to the needs of my pets. The routine keeps me going and on track for the most part, but with some slip ups. My home and self are both disgusting and lacking cleanliness. The other problem with the fake it method comes with my leadership. People sense these things. They see it. They feel it. My vibes may look positive and high energy, but underneath it is my depression. Im a calm on the surface guy with an inside I wont show anyone. The most I ever show is here on the internet to a bunch of strangers I dont know. My life-coach/work-coach has told me that the fake it method doesnt work, she doesnt believe in it (this was brought up in casual conversation as I have never mentioned my fake it method to her). She stated that people can sense it and to lead, I need a true self, not a fake self. The problem is is that I cant show my real self because while I know everyone struggles, its not to this degree, mostly. Its a different kind of struggle, I think. I could be wrong. But anyway, to be the leader I want to grow into, I need to get my shit together. I dont know how to. Ive been in therapy for a while, Im on a good mix of medication that helps me get out of bed and keep putting one foot in front of the other. But those things can only do so much. Underneath the calm that medication provides, I feel the sea churning and sometimes I still get swept up in its waves despite those other coping tools in place. Ive read many a self-help book and really tried to dig into myself to find the root my issues, the part that I can repair, the mentality I need to shift. But I am weak and cant seem to pull it together enough to really heal. Partly I think thats because this is just who I am. I am fundamentally wired wrong, and although I have to work with what Im given, I cant find a way to reel it in and own it and stand with it instead of be trampled by it. In short, I feel like Im doomed in my work life because I cant put my true personality and self out there. A leader can show vulnerability, but there is a healthy limit to that. If it goes too far, it will be devastating to my professional career. I fake it and make it work, but my team will pick up on it, will feel it from me even if they arent exactly consciously aware of it. Hell, under my clothes I still have marks from recent self-harm. No one can see those things. Thats too much vulnerability and sharing way too much information that wont result in anything good. I want to step into myself, I want to unleash my potential and become the leader I want to be. I want to grow in my career and not become stale and stagnant. But Im not sure how to do that when all I can do is fake it til I make it. That will only carry me so far. Even now I am plagued with these thoughts and taking my time to write this rather than do my work. Writing this is eating up my time, but so is ruminating on it and being so distracted that I cannot focus enough to do my work properly, or at all. Im hoping that getting this all out will help me function better today. Its a bad day today where my struggles are winning. They dont always win, I have some days where I can function butits still faking it. It always is. Thats the only way Ive ever been able to get through my life. It carried me through high school, through college, through my first two jobs, and now this one The difference now is that Im at a place where something has to change or I will lose my opportunity. My life is slipping away and I dont know how to pick it back up, or if I ever had it in my grasp in the first place. "
1,vulnerability,Anxiety,My vulnerability was taken advantage of,1,if0gpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/if0gpm/my_vulnerability_was_taken_advantage_of/,2020-08-23 19:39:33,"So yeah, I started talking to my ex about a month ago after 7 years. Idk wtf was inside me that pushed me talk to him. I desperately needed someone to talk to and I couldn't find anyone so I ended up texting him. He has always been a creep and he's still the same. 0 changes. Indeed he has worked on his animal instincts and has become even more pathetic. A week later, my dad expired and every one was busy faking concerns. But he did something different, he took that time to take advantage of my vulnerability and started asking me shit like what do I feel about him, what kind of a person I think he is and do I still feel for him or not. He asked me these questions because he thought that I am vulnerable and I will speak the truth. Rather than supporting me and just being there, he took his time to be the Shittiest ass one can ever come across. None of my friends have been by my side in this time. I feel ashamed for trusting such losers. For confiding in them and thinking that they would be there for me. Guess what? At the end of this, I hate myself and I miss my dad. I have realized that no one is there for anybody ever."
2,vulnerability,Anxiety,Constantly catastrophising!,1,ifmuyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ifmuyp/constantly_catastrophising/,2020-08-24 21:01:37,"I'm sure I'm not the only one, but I can't stop catastrophising. I automatically put the most negative spin on events, and assume and fear the worst. I can't stop feeling like everyone hates me (although there's no reason why they should) and have a tendency to just run away from situations rather than resolve them. It's exhausting living with this level of anxiety! I must be in a near-constant state of fight-or-flight. I'm sure it's a factor in the autoimmune conditions I've developed. It's got worse since my husband passed away 7 years ago. His death was very sudden. I also lost my beloved grandad in eerily the same way, some years before. I guess I'm now constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. My one romantic foray since then (a few years ago) was a disaster. I met him on FB. He turned out to be a narcissistic catfish - he told me that he'd been divorced for 7 years. It turned out he was still married &amp; living with his wife (I had ditched him by this point but it came as a real shock). He brutally subjected me to the classic love bomb - devalue - discard cycle, and made me feel like I could only attract the kind of man who would take advantage of my vulnerability, and that I didn't deserve any better. So now if someone is a bit off with me, I assume they're avoiding me because they don't like me. If someone is laughing, then surely they're laughing at me. I subconsciously assume that every phone call I receive is going to be informing me that someone else has died. Everything that can go wrong, will go wrong, right?? It's exhausting, and I need to find another way to be."
3,vulnerability,Anxiety,Does it get better?,2,hleu34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/hleu34/does_it_get_better/,2020-07-05 11:57:07,"There have always been days where I've had that feeling in the pit of my stomach, or a shakiness in my leg, but it never lasted much longer than 24 hours. I always had a new assignment, new interest, place to go, or errand to get distracted by. Now it's been months since I've woken up to anything but my own thoughts. It feels like every feeling I've ever been able to work past has bubbled to the surface with the power to bring me to a point of absolute helplessness in seconds. Guilt, shame, fear, paranoia, anger, vulnerability. Any horrible feeling you can imagine has been my reality for over 2 months now. This past week has been the worst I've felt. I've had 2 days that I haven't left my bed, and I've been losing weight consistently. The moment I look forward to the most is when I can take sleeping pills to get myself asleep. A lot of my anxiety is statistically unlikely, and I've been doing what I can to make sure my worries don't become realities, but my certainty of the worst outcomes can't be shaken. I try to limit my internet time and social media access, but I feel possessed by my keyboard to search out the things that'll out me into absolute panic mode. It almost feels like I'm trying to torture myself. I've been seeing a therapist going on 2 months, and monday I'll have another meeting with a psychiatrist. It's looking like I'll be starting Lexapro. I feel like I've just been burrowing deeper into a hole everyday. I've been avoiding talking to friends, I feel like an imposter around my girlfriend, I've kept my parents at an emotional difference. It feels like everything is falling apart, and the fight or flight of an anxious thought is always another brick in the barrier between my life up until now, and me. I just want to feel like I'm at least ok again. Does it get better?"

5,vulnerability,Anxiety,Need help with intimacy related anxiety!,2,hr1d67,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/hr1d67/need_help_with_intimacy_related_anxiety/,2020-07-14 23:19:22,Little background - I'm 20F and a virgin. I have SH scars from my early-mid teens just about everywhere although 99% of them are not very visible and you'd only notice if you knew they were there or were looking for them. I also had a eating disorder so I went really skinny and have only recently got back to a healthy weight. This really fucks with my head cause I feel uncomfortable in everything and paired with my social anxiety in social settings I just feel horrible. I get a fair amount of male attention but I shoot everyone down or end things prematurely because I know when it comes to sex I'm going to have a panic attack. It's not even them finding out about the SH because I'm pretty open about it. My last 'relationship' in my teens ended because I couldn't cope with being intimate. I hated him touching me and could only deal with it when I was tipsy but I never let it go far. The difference between now and then is that I want to have sex now. My drive is through the roof  I've been talking to this guy for awhile and he knows about the SH/EA/Anxiety everything really and he's cool with it. We've met up a few times and he seems like a really nice guy and I like him but I'm frightened to death of being naked Infront of him when the time comes. I associate nakedness with vulnerability and In my head I'd rather die before being vulnerable Infront of someone. How can I get over this? I don't want to go through the rest of my life being scared of something I know is natural!
6,vulnerability,Anxiety,Is it normal to be repulsed by sex?,1,hsinbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/hsinbs/is_it_normal_to_be_repulsed_by_sex/,2020-07-17 07:19:27,"I am a 16, almost 17 year old girl and have had no sexual experience. I have not kissed anyone, dated anyone, had sex, held hands, etc. Boys have had crushes on me, and I have had crushes on them. But, I have always been fearful to kiss or do anything intimate. Kissing doesnt seem enjoyable to me. I have a problem with over analyzing things. I will scrutinize and think about the action itself, and then become repulsed. The salvia mixing together and the closeness of the faces, and the noses rubbing against each other. It all sounds so unappealing. When it comes to real life the thought of having another person on top of me, and doing all of the things that sex requires scares me and makes me incredibly uncomfortable. I dont want to do it, but I also want to do it just so I can get it over with. I can stay a Virgin forever, but that would be a seemingly pathetic life in the eyes of many people. And also I think I would be discounting myself an area of great vulnerability and connection. Sex creates a closeness that is really important in a few non platonic relationships. It creates something undeniably inseparable if the two people already are drawn in outside of sex. I am not saying that I need to lose my virginity now, but I am worried that I will always have this fear and disgust of sex. What if I never get over it? It seems like a roadblock that could hinder me from maturing and creating deep and meaningful relationships. And I do realize that sex doesnt automatically equal deep and meaningful, it can be casual. But, if I ever want a long term boyfriend I would have to have sex."

Usually it's felt very GAD-ish, with overthinking and rumination etc. With COVID however, I seem to be experiencing more ""panic attacks"" but in the unconventional way that my breathing doesn't get rapid or shallow- that I know of. This morning/last night it was a very slight sore throat that threw me off. My allergies are so bad this summer and my post nasal drip is insane :( When I've experienced these, probably about three times this summer, I do however, throw up and get (sorry, TMI,) diarrhea. This makes me even more nervous (especially during the time of COVID, where those are two symptoms). It's a vicious cycle. Could this be considered a panic attack, even when I'm not hyperventilating? It feels so debilitating and my poor partner doesn't know how to help me. I don't even know how to help myself! Breathing and meditation don't seem to work at all. I slept this one off and feel better. Any advice?"

I feel like it used to be better, but I switched colleges after my sophomore year and since then Ive never had more than 3-4 friends I would see on a really consistent basis. Im constantly in my own head. The longer I go with out really meeting new people the harder it is to feel able to interact with others. I currently work for a law firm and have descent benefits but I have no idea if therapy or anything is covered. I grew up very poor and moved around constantly and was occasionally homeless, with a single parent who was addicted to narcotics, dealt with alcoholism, and suffered domestic for a lot of my youth. So therapy was never an option until college, and while I was in school I distrusted the idea of ever seeing a therapist so much that I could never go. So now that I feel like I have no other options, please tell me what I should do. Please dont make jokes. I feel very vulnerable posting, and Im not comfortable with vulnerability at all."

Like if I talk to my therapist, I feel guilty for taking up her time (even though its literally her job and she gets paid), or if I have to go for testing for health issues that my team cant figure out the cause of, I feel like Im a nuisance for taking up resources and for bothering my family doctor. Like Im in one of those extreme cringey vulnerability hangovers right now because I just talked to my doctor and I feel like Im always wasting his time and I feel like a burden. There is never any factual evidence for me being a burden, in fact ppl tel me that they are glad I came to them for help, but I still feel anxious and guilty and like a waste of space. Ive been working on this in therapy for a long time and while Ive been able to be more emotionally aware and been able to do thought records to examine the feelings and check the facts, I still feel like SHIATTTTT. Damn son, this is horrible and I just need a nap but my brain wont stop going like 1000 km/h Okay, thats all. Thanks for reading"
11,vulnerability,Anxiety,"I've made 6 new reddit accounts because I'm so anxious of being recognized.....by other strangers I met on Reddit, please help me.",2,hjbm6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/hjbm6k/ive_made_6_new_reddit_accounts_because_im_so/,2020-07-02 00:47:30,"So I had a Reddit account I was using since the end of 2019. I got involved in a particular niche sub and became kinda famous because I had very strong opinions. Reddit is a place that enables me to share my strong opinions with no bearing on real life. I'm generally reserved in real life. Anywhere there was a Reddit group DM which active member got together. I found my self messaging users and inadvertently revealing a bit too much about myself. Enough for one user to actually doxx me. With a whole lotta luck and little bit of SOE, a user found my pic and full name. They assured me that my secret was safe and knew I had major trust issues. I took their word for it. In the mean time I had patched they particular vulnerability up and removed that link from the top of Google. A few days later the user (who had revealing a huge load of personal details) was getting upset because I had started to wind back the amount of details I was giving about my sense , I was not reciprocating their trust and my behavior was not indicative of trust. Because I knew this user was involved with many other users, and would nonchalantly slip information to me about other users....how could I be sure that they would not slip information about myself to others? Eventually I caved in and shared my Snapchat. I did feel that I owed this user something, and I did trust them, they had listened to alot of my personal problems etc etc. A few days later some other drama was unfolding with other users gossiping about me. I decided to pull the plug on Reddit because I was genuinely upset and needed a break from those people. I could still connect with that user on Snapchat. A few days after that Snapchat was not really feasible for long text conversation so I found myself back on Reddit, but this is where the anxiety inducing dilemma starts. I made an account to talk to them, and for that reason only. However I did miss commenting on some other subs, but did not want my comments to be associated with me, I wanted to be completely anon again. That was the whole point of Reddit. I comment on some particular subs for example my city subreddit, my job subreddit, my favorite musician etc etc. I am afraid that if I made a second account and used that to comment I would be caught and our friendship would crumble resulting in all the information I've shared to be potentially used against me. Moreover if I start to dial back the enthusiasm and energy I bring to the friendship, it will be noticed and potentially again I could be reprimanded. I understand that the chances of coming across my name are miniscule however I can't shrug th feeling of having a different account behind their back, especially since I have made all 6 accounts today. That user could put 2 and 2 together, figure out it was me thanks to the dates."

I constantly showcase a facade of confidence and control whenever Im outside; leaving my vulnerability unaware to most people. But this leaves me coming of as an asshole. I stare people down. I speak purposely slowly and consumingly in order to gain respect and attention. I feel myself coming addicted to the feeling of dominance. I do not like making people feel uncomfortable but its almost like I involuntarily go through the actions in order to hide my anxiety. Even just yesterday one of my friends said you always seem so.. on edge.. as if you are always angry. And to be honest, I am. Im so on edge and anxious that Im in this heightened state of consciousness, where everything and everyone is a threat. Going out the house feels like Im going to war.. Can anyone relate?"

But then I got taken out of my public school (Due to almost failing the year due to poor math grades and put into an online school), but before that I lost many friends. One of my friends, we'll label Ryan, was a tad bit older than me at the time, and he ended up just kind of using me and then he fought me before our friendship ended and we never saw each other again. Shortly after I had other friends, my friend (labeled Nick), and many other kids down the street. We all hung out, partied, rode bikes, set up stuff, trekked the local woods and went to the convenience store for junk. That was when I was 11-14. I'm 17 now, and I'm completely different. My old friends broke up with me because N just up and decided to taunt me one day over and over until I confronted him, I didn't want to, I was confused and a little upset. We ended up fighting and the neighbors down the road who's yard we were in just watched as we punched each other and kicked. I ended up technically ""losing"" the fight. I was distraught and very upset. He came to apologize and suggest we become friends again and I got mad again and told him to ""fuck off"" and leave. Ever since then everybody broke up, no more Nick and the other guys and girls I hung out (all with me and nick at the time) moved away or just haven't spoken to me in a while. In school I wasn't ""popular"" but I also wasn't an outcast or loner, for sure. I talked to everyone, was involved in everything and had either neutral acquaintances, kids I just talked to, friends, mutual friends and that was it. I was good with it, I played soccer with the Mexican kids, I got exercise like a mofo and I had no problem around in my life. But back then I was odd, careless about how I was presented in front of people and often just myself and if people didn't like it, I just couldn't care. The oddity and strangeness of my behavior almost certainly came from my ADHD which I've had all my life. But now I know how to act proper, convincing and kind, cautious and friendly. But with that I've been introverted ever since Nick and the gang broke it off with me. Been sitting inside for 3 years going on 4. Just playing video games, watching videos, doing online school and barely going outside. But now I feel guilty, and I feel like shit for letting this happen to me. I'm afraid of who I am, and I mean in the way where I've degraded into a lying, deceitful, emotionless eyes and face having, anxiety filled, depressed, out of shape, abusive, insecure ass-lord. And I think about myself in such a negative light because of it, I'm not a fan of how I am, but I can't stop or find the energy to fix it. &amp;#x200B; I may be a bit off track, but my point is now I avoid everybody but my own family. I fear I don't look like ""other people"". But for reference, I'm a 6'2'' male who's always been described as ""handsome and loving"" by my family for years. I apparently have no reason to be insecure about my looks, but I can't shake the feeling I somehow am ""off"". My personality is awful now. As you've read above, I've degraded into half a monster by my behavior, I'm not very funny anymore, I've completely lost my sense of wonder and my creativity isn't even a 10th of what it used to be. My creativity and art levels are now just pale and boring. And with this whole shit personality, I believe I can't impress people or get into people's hearts anymore, because I'm so negative, in general. But I also think people just know who I am or how fragile and weak I am inside. It's like my heart is all of my weakness and vulnerability and I've surrounded it by a thick, but fragile layer of rock. Only for people to somehow shine through it and touch weakness. I don't like the idea of being judged, I don't like getting up and having people's eyes on me unless it's someone I know very personally. I don't like talking too loud in public for fear of people looking and thinking about it, and I don't like the idea of being the center of attention. I just get paranoid, like as I'm walking past groups of people who don't even know who I am, that they're looking at me and just saying ""Eugh"" ""Look at this dude"" ""Ugh loser"" and they're all just so much better than me even if we're all the same. But I have the capacity to realize these fears are sucky, irrational and punk ass of me. I tell myself I have to get over them and stop thinking about it and I think about reasons for why they're irrational and not real and I immediately feel better and proud I know that. &amp;#x200B; I can do things, though. Only if I have a reason to. I don't want to walk down the street without a reason to (such as going to someone's house, going to the store or something like that) because I feel like I have no reason to and people notice that and they see me. I can go to restaurants and be there, walk past people, no problem, I might only have minor thoughts about making sure I walk correctly and stuff. I can talk to people too, usually older people I have zero problem talking with, but younger people like kids my age or young adults, I get anxious, say nothing and might just walk away. I can work in public and around people and have little to no anxiety around them. It seems like as long as I ""have a reason"" or some kind of work, labor or mission while I'm out, I have little issue talking to people or saying hi, being in front of others. Maybe it's because I ""look normal"" and don't feel like I'm useless or seeming pointless in front of others, and I have an excuse for my behavior while I'm working, walking, so on."
14,vulnerability,Anxiety,Showering makes my anxiety go through the roof,1,grn8mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/grn8mc/showering_makes_my_anxiety_go_through_the_roof/,2020-05-28 02:45:03,"I'm not sure when this started, but I've been noticing it a lot more lately. When I shower, my heart races, I have shortened/shallow breath, my abdomen is incredibly tight, and I feel like I'm racing against the clock. I've been trying to figure out the causes, and I think part of it is the feeling of total vulnerability and not knowing if something goes wrong in the house while I'm in there. Plus, I'm trying to be more eco-conscious and now I feel like I'm just wasting water so I try to get clean as fast as possible. Also, this is heightened when I'm showering before work or during lunch (quarantine time). Does anyone else feel this way whether it's during self care or any other similar circumstances? I try to take deep breaths but I can't stop rapidly cleaning and just trying to get out."
15,vulnerability,Anxiety,Realization and acceptance of sensitivity and vulnerability,1,gs68rq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gs68rq/realization_and_acceptance_of_sensitivity_and/,2020-05-28 23:26:17,"With the current situation with the pandemic, I have regressed quite a bit and am at I'd say a 2 or 3 out of 10 on the anxiety scale consistently throughout the day. My diet, level of activity, social life you name is to blame for making it so bad and who knows what else. I guess I could have some kind of subconscious fear of what is happening in the world but I honestly don't really fear corona perhaps it's just because I am fortunate enough that I got food delivered and I have a parent going out to do the shopping for us. Either way, I have realized something about myself over this time, and that is how vulnerable I am and how sensitive I am to what I suppose are triggers or circumstances. The first example was a month or so ago the power went out in our building and oddly enough it was when I was alone, now this could of made it better or much worse because as you all know sometimes when an attack hits, other people can make it better or worse depending on a lot of factors, one for me is they get freaked out in response potentially, or they belittle it and don't take it seriously. Or I guess when you openly state you are experiencing an attack it goes from just being anxious to it being a full-blown episode. But back to the attack, what had happened was I was alone and the power went out and here I was, I guess this was mid-April so I was around a month or more in of not leaving the apartment. I am fine with that I have had situations where I shut myself in before, the thing is I am so content and able to do so because I have the internet, Reddit, streaming movies, playing games. You name it I have it at my fingertips to distract me from life and everything outside my little comfort zone. So once the first few minutes passed and it became apparent that this might be a long one, especially due to the lockdown who knows how long outages could go for I wondered I began to panic. I didn't really put two and two together that it was my internet or tech addiction that was triggering me but as time passed and I luckily defeated it I knew that was it. I am in my early thirties and dealing with anxiety for well over a decade now. I still suffer just as much but one thing is I can handle it better and I can decipher the how and why a lot better now. Well like I said I defeated that attack and as I do I just moved on without trying to make any changes and just ignoring how something as small as not having power for my vices for a short period caused me a full out attack one I hadn't had for quite some time. I didn't ignore or shake the thought though that I was extremely vulnerable to this happening again and that I am super sensitive in general. The idea of sensitivity is something that as a man dealing with anxiety has always been one that you are most shameful of. You don't want to admit that you are afraid and weak and so easily shaken. I remember when I first learned the concept of sensitivity, it was the first day of school, around the early grades no older then 10 I think. We were all lining up to enter the school in the morning or it was recess and either way it being the first day back we were all hyper as can be. What had happened was one boy got picked on and we were all laughing and he started to cry. One of the adults I remember came over and broke things up and as she tended to him of course this makes things worse as we all laugh more. ""Leave him alone he's just sensitive, that's all"" that was along the lines of what she said, but I know for sure she prescribed his tears to be due to his sensitivity. This for some reason stuck with me for all these years. A few days ago I had another incident, it wasn't a full-blown attack like the power outage caused but it definitely was of note as I went from the 2 to about a 5 or 6. What caused this you might be asking? I swallowed a seed from an orange. That's right I swallowed a little white seed, it wasn't one of those tiny little dark ones but one of the larger white ones, I was lazily eating the orange as a snack and slipped two pieces in my mouth as one and I immediately felt the seed in the back of my throat as I swallowed. Now I don't know what phobia causes this I guess I don't like swallowing and the idea of choking I hate, I think it's just general hypochondria, a lot of my anxiety is health-related, whatever the root is I don't know for sure. But what I do know is just how pathetic and stupid I feel and most importantly how sensitive I guess I am. As it was unfolding and all the racing thoughts were occurring I would go from, the health googling and panicking back to, the rational realization that it's just a damn seed, chill you are acting like a baby. This is a damn joke on It's Always Sunny for fuck's sake, Mac with the Appleseed if you don't know very funny btw. In the end here I am now, I am anxious again around my 2-3, but I am vulnerable to anxiety because my sleep schedule is more than fucked and I am going to try to avoid sleeping during the day so I will stay awake for a long period. This scenario for me is usually a recipe for potential anxiety. All I am thinking about though is the fact that I just feel like I need to just accept my sensitivity, it's just a part of who I am, I don't particularly think it's a bad thing, I think I am just emotional I suppose? I do have strong feelings in general. Anyway this went long enough and I am losing my train of thought, I guess I just wanted to vent, thank you if you read even half or a quarter of this."

I see my life as a canvas painted with monochrome colours (all the anxiety induced dazed moments, the occasional subsequent numbness and apathy I experience, the repression, the walls built) and an alarmingly red streak (anxiety) running through it and I'd really love me a more psychedelic, upbeat picture. It can be really heart wrenching and conducive to furthering my anxiety to know how my childhood and the method I chose to cope with it have set me back by years in terms of normal development. I was really enthusiastic about changing my ways and being more rooted to reality and present in the moment, tearing down those walls and just being vivacious and experiencing all the emotions on the spectrum in depth and not shutting other people out due to vulnerability issues, I'd actually become quite the self improvement junkie the past two years and dabbled in the the anxiety alleviating method of working your way through an exposure hierarchy, I started seeking discomfort rather than avoiding it, to you know, ""face my fears"" as the saying goes. I went out more (made new friends...although those friendships didn't last), tried my level best to be less cynical and skeptical, kept my heart more open but now, during lockdown, having to quarantine with that parent has made so angry, frustrated, cynical, rude and anxious all over again that I feel as though it might have reversed all the efforts I'd taken towards not turning out like them(my biggest fear) and evolving into a more kinder, loving and less anxious version of myself. I've also started to reevaluate my ability to cultivate friendships very harshly and just beating myself up for how things have come to be (I'm also a huge procrastinator so I have the first row ticket to witnessing my academic potential melt away and the hopelessness that I've been enduring for past few months isn't really making things any easier). I've been resorting to my old escapist methods and haven't even bothered to keep up with the friends that I have and love or with my academics. I've just been isolating myself and curling up in a ball and crying because I have questioned and overthought myself into total inadequacy. I don't feel like I have a lot to offer, as a daughter, friend, lover, sister, student, human being and that I am the absolute worst for feeling this way despite the things that I have. I'm fearful of the future and who I'll be and who I won't. And I know I've still a long way to go and that nothing's set in stone and , hopefully, i'll eventually learn to rid myself of this self love deficit but I really don't like the current landslide of trajectory my life has taken."
17,vulnerability,Anxiety,Lurker,1,fuqmvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/fuqmvo/lurker/,2020-04-04 20:19:01,"Hello! First post ever. So Ive (23F) suffered from anxiety for at least more than 13+ years now. Ive never been properly diagnosed (as in neurological tests and whatsoever) but several psychologists have confirmed I do have it. Accepting it and dealing with it has been quite a journey however I do feel slightly better everyday, especially since the beginning of this year. One of the aspects that my anxiety has impacted the most has been my personal relationships. I overthink every single detail from every single interaction I have on a daily basis and then create scenarios that only live inside my head. In the past 4 months Ive dated this guy thats really amazing, I like him a lot and I really care about him. I also know he cares about me but sometimes my anxiety creates stuff out of nothing and it makes me believe the complete opposite. I realized that theres a pattern tho: every time I express how much I care about him (to him) I freak out, I build up a wall and develop this narrative inside my head where he doesnt love me at all and is just using me. Anyways... a few nights ago I spent the night at his apartment and I felt it again. So I decided to write it down. Its pretty crappy but hey, Im just venting: I can always feel it lurking behind me Like a never ending whisper It disappears, sometimes. Maybe for weeks at a time. Rarely a month. Never more than one. It always comes back. It always finds its way into the depth of my being. It always takes over me. And the whisper becomes two. Then three. Then so many I can barely breath. Drowning. Im drowning inside of my own head. Drowning with thoughts that are merely there to spit on my face and throw me down, once again. It feeds on vulnerability. It feeds on my deepest feelings being raw and open for everyone to see. A safe? Maybe? Could it be maybe something not so bad after all? Could it be that Im secretly and darkly trying to protect my soul? Maybe the whispers are not whispers. Maybe its pure instinct. Maybe theyre right. Maybe I should not. Maybe I shouldnt have. Maybe I mustnt love. Is it fragile? The thought has wandered my mind for the longest time and I still cant seem to pull the answer out. Which one is it? To love? To be scared? Which one is more fragile? Are they? Am I? Are we? If you read this far, thank you. And sorry for taking up so much of your time. Have a wonderful day everyone. &lt;3"

I have been in this amazing relationship for 2 years, but still hold this weird belief/grudge from the past that he will leave when he sees my full blown anxiety. Well, low and behold, last night it came. We have been living together since end of June, so I guess it was about time. Full blown attack. Puffy face, crying, cant breath, just bad everywhere. I expected him to look me in the face and say this too much, I cant deal, but he doesnt? Instead, he just puts his head on my shoulder and comforts me. He then hugs me and even though he doesnt say anything, it means everything. I expected today to wake up and him be like its not worth it, but we are stronger then ever now. Last night validated my thoughts that I have finally found someone who 100% cares and loves me for ALL of me, the good, the bad, the ugly, and it is beyond beautiful to have found that in such a chaotic world."
19,vulnerability,Anxiety,How to make friends with people who actually understand you,1,g78qww,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/g78qww/how_to_make_friends_with_people_who_actually/,2020-04-24 23:53:04,"We all yearn for those friends who we actually resonate with, not the 'social media' superficial friends. The type of friend we can call up at 3am when we need help. The type of friend who stands by us at the highs as well as the lows. This is how to make those friends even after you have left education: **1) Be yourself.** It's all about vulnerability. It is less about changing yourself to meet the ideals of what you think someone else would like, instead try to be unapologetically yourself and you will attract people who genuinely value you for you. **2) Be proactive.** Comment on people's Facebook posts or reply to people's [Instagram](URL stories - both great way to reconnect with old friends in a direct way. **3) Use friendship apps.** There are many great apps out there which connect you with new people who are all on there for the same reason. They are open to making friends with you. I have used a lot and my personal favourite is [Serendip](URL \- it cuts through the superficiality and actually connects you with people who share your values. Others include [Bumble](URL but it is more used for dating. **4) Phone calls.** Calling your existing friends is a great way to strengthen your bond. When we can't meet in person due to lockdown, a voice or video call has much more depth than a text message. **5) Just ask.** This isn't dating, you don't need to worry about being rejected to find the 'one'. Ask people you have just met for a coffee or their number. ""I am new to the area and it would be great if you could show me around"". Put yourself at the receiving end of this - it's a very natural message. **6) Join local groups.** This is not advised during lockdown! Whilst we are under social isolation we can fall back on #3 for the meanwhile. Have fun guys! Please comment below if you have other suggestions :)"

Today I made it seem like I was kicking her out when she was the one that out of the goodness of her heart wanted to move in with me because I had no place to go. During the conversation I wanted to bring up something that was on my mind since the moment we moved in, she would mention that she didn't like it here, and I never knew if it was because of me or the apartment. She used that moment of my vulnerability to call for bullshit but I was really just trying to express something I had been thinking for so long. Regardless of what my intentions were or what came of it I know it was wrong of me to go about things the way I did. I honestly think she hates me so much right now she doesn't even wanna be friends with me anymore, I've known her for so long and I feel like I'm gonna lose her over a dumb mistake. I already had an attack in front of her but I am just in my room now trying not to cry, she left to her mom's house. I just want it all to go away, everything hurts"
21,vulnerability,Anxiety,Relationship anxiety causing me to give up too early,1,felsyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/felsyc/relationship_anxiety_causing_me_to_give_up_too/,2020-03-07 09:51:52,"Hey. So I was officially diagnosed 5 years ago with GAD. And my diagnosis was a blessing and my meds along with diet and excersizes had helped alot in my day to day. But there are still things that affect me deeply..one is relationship anxiety. More backstory; I'm 34m with 3 girls I raise most days. Their mom and I ended our marriage in 2015 after she met someone else. We weren't happy but also didn't have a bad marriage...but I was comfortable. Now I'm not a bad looking guy and I def have some endearing qualities..I recognize this. But whenever I meet someone new and the initial rush of meeting them and the constant talking and attention dies off..my brain begins to panic and by my own coping mechanisms start taking over..I detatch myself (idk if that's the word but I start severing any care or attachment I have to that person mentally and start pulling away) This has happened countless times..and I've hurt people unintentionally. I've also probably done this as a reaction to rejection isn't even coming..but I make it happen to get it ""over with"" when I perceive they are pulling away or I am getting too attached. This is really excruciating for me because I thrive off intimacy and closeness and vulnerability that come from relationships...but then my brain defaults to the times I allowed this vulnerability and was hurt (my ex wife..my dad) and I do the detatching thing to avoid that happening again. So I guess this was partially to tell my feelings to people who may also understand and maybe find out what has helped others through this mind block."
22,vulnerability,Anxiety,My Story,1,fk28er,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/fk28er/my_story/,2020-03-17 20:20:35,"I wanted to write/share my story as a way to find some degree of catharsis and insight. so this is more for me then it is for you whos reading, but I hope someone somewhere can get something out of it. when I was in elementary school I was a pretty happy kid, not a lot of friends but close ones. I was able to find entertainment in the smallest and most minor of things like rocks which I used to collect. life overall was amazing, however, all good things must come to an end. then I went to a private middle school because my mother was convinced that the public middle school was terrible (i don't know if this was actually the case but I never bothered to look into it) This was not a good decision. I had one friend whom I trusted. everyone else I would go out of my way to ensure that they would never ever become my friend because I was suspicious of everyone's intentions. one example is at the very beginning of the year in 6th grade a girl offered me a grape. My first instinct was that she did something to the said grape. My thinking was ""why would someone randomly out of nowhere offer someone else a single grape? I mean if they were trying to do a good deed wouldn't they offer a handful? why just one?"". She had offered me a grape every day for about a week. After a while, I got annoyed and went and told one of my best friends... the vice principal of student affairs. Fast forward to the eighth grade I had a conversation with that same person. the grape came up in this conversation and she said: ""no I didn't do anything to that grape I really was trying to be nice"". there were many many more stories like this throughout my time in middle school. most of the others would fear me because and attempt of someone trying to interact with me in any way I would go and tell the vice principal. eventually, I started to keep a notebook of all the transgressions that were made against me for even the slightest thing such as someone behind me tapping my chair with their foot and would go and tell the vice principal who would give them a scolding and sometimes even detention. during the entire time in middle school, I could only think of 6 others out of about 80-90 or so in my grade who were genuine. but as a result, I never really had a social life. all of my lunches and free periods were spent doing homework So much so that I managed to complete a quarter's worth of work in about 2 weeks. This lead to a lot of free time at home which was spent playing video games as I always did since I was young. so why did I do all this? because I was afraid of opening up to people, because if they saw the REAL me then they would think I was weak, weird, awkward, etc. Video games were and still are my solace because the truth of the matter was that the real world sucked. everything about it sucked the people in it the things they did even the small things such as a minor breeze. Then high school started. I said to myself ok let's try to find some people that were at least similar to me. I was successful I found a great group of friends who also enjoyed gaming as much as I do, but it took me all 4 years of high school to fully trust them. what I mean is that it was a rocky friendship. a lot of the time it was a game of me finding out their crushes and then bothering the living hell about it. their goal was to keep it a secret and mine was to find out who it was and make an inside meme/joke about it for the rest of the group to laugh at and laugh they did. as a result, though I was not included in a lot of activities that were done and since these were the only people who I hung out with most weekends while other kids were out and about. I was sitting at home playing games way too many games. it affected my grades negatively and as a result, made me feel worthless. so why did all this I do all this? because again I was afraid to open up to another human being. If you do that you're done!!!!! tell them anything. never show any weakness. never show any vulnerability. This was just my group of people whom I considered friends. everyone else I considered inferior, but the reality was I thought and still do think I'm too much of a different person than ""normal"" people. they are the normies I said to myself normies over there weird kids like you and your friends over here and under no circumstances are you to speak with those normies. That was just the rule that I placed on myself. I was afraid of being judged. Then college (which is where I am now). by far the worst experience I have ever had In my life this is how I reached my lowest point. I decided because of the social anxiety I needed to and got accommodations to get a single room. The very thought of sleeping in the same room with a stranger was and is mortifying. In the first week of college, I decided ok let's try one last time to make friends with different people so a friend and I from high school set out to do just that (this friend was also going through a social anxiety phase). after the first week of going to the dorm basement to try to make new friends, I saw the social groups already forming. I thought to myself ""I guess they don't want to hang out with me. well if they don't I'm not going to beg them to be my friend. so my time in college was spent eating studying sleeping and almost every ounce of free time was spent playing League of legends with a couple of friends from high school. granted I did have some friends from my classes, but that's all they were just people who I talked to and sometimes studied with. sometimes looking out the window seeing people every Friday screaming and having a good time. that made me feel like absolute crap, games were the only solution. I managed to make it through the first year with a 3.938 because I would never ever go back to being a mediocre student. That was the 2 best semesters. this next one is when the bomb dropped. in the beginning, I met some more classmates and we became a group of 6 who just sat together in class. within the first month of the semester my grandfather whom I had just seen that summer died. when I first heard the news in class I was in shock. This was the first time anyone close to me passed away. I eventually came to the realization that if you don't meet new people and make new friends you are going to be all alone. more and more I thought about what that really means. I wasn't sure if I was ready for that I used to tell myself: ""you'll be great on your own. you are a machine you are the greatest human to ever exist free of the weakness that is the necessity of human companionship (platonic or non-platonic)."", but after the passing, I realized: ""oh this is what losing people is like"". after a while I had a conversation of mourning with my uncle who lived with him for 30 years. He was absolutely devastated. I thought to myself: "" that's gonna be you"". ever since then, my anxiety spiked up extremely every time I go to the Doctors my BP is always in one of the stages of hypertension and gradually increasing. In addition, every time I get anxious my shoulder blades start to get in unbearable pain. one other thing that did not help was me developing a crush on someone in my class. me never being in a relationship ever had the bright idea that she would somehow fix up all my problems. This made it even worse. every word I said every word someone else said I would scrounge like a lawyer. I had to be seen as someone socially acceptable. all this lead to me having suicidal thoughts life was just pain and an endless goose chase there is nothing but pain for me here, not even video games which I so heavily depend on could cure my pain. The only thing that kept me alive was my family. It would be the most selfish thing to do. so I decided to transfer to another university that I could commute to from home and see the doctor to get medications in the hope of a cure. now I'm in my second semester with incompletes from that semester taking 1 course at my current university to try to get back on my feet, but still, I'm in the same spot as before no friends, like the ones from high school who are all extremely busy at their universities, just me and my laptop and league of legends. The only difference is that I have my family to support me and for that, I'm extremely grateful. As for the future? I have absolutely no idea what to do to feel that same feeling of long term happiness that I once felt when I was a little kid and I've been chasing that ever since. This is already a lot and there is a lot more that was left unsaid. I mostly talked about social anxiety but there are many other factors such as my academic performance and a general fear of leaving the house and more. there is no happy ending to this story, but I hope you get some insight into what kind of person I am. I hope it can help some of you. all I ask of you is that if you decide to comment. say the honest truth. what you really think. by this I mean please do not try to spare my feelings. If you think that I am being idiotic say so. anything might provide some insight. Some of you are probably going to suggest therapy. I tried that numerous times to no avail. I've started to workout thanks to my brother who frequents the gym, but the progress feels so slow and sometimes I wonder if it is even working at all. PS: I suck at grammar :p you'll probably find a few mistakes."

I answered all of their questions with as little detail as possible and started shaking a bit halfway through. Giving that level of vulnerability to someone was terrifying. I just wanted to leave and forget the stupid decision to try this out. At the end they recommended me to a site to find an actual personal therapist but Im not sure if I can bring myself to. Aside from freaking the fuck out over something so little I realized even in a safe space I have no idea if I can let myself expose that much. I insisted to myself that my issues arent anything big and that people who have it worse should go instead. Ive managed to get this far by myself. I overcame a lot by myself. I could probably be fine by myself. But at the same time at least just for once Id like to break down and cry and maybe have it be ok and with someone who I dont have to worry about my image with.

I just want to survive and maybe meet someone who likes me enough to spend downtime with me. I don't know where the jobs are.

I've never taken any psychiatric drugs and I haven't been diagnosed with anything else other than that eating disorder, although I believe I've also been depressed throughout these years. I've been bullied a couple of times because I obviously tend to show vulnerability, appear weak, and go to great extent to keep people in my life even when they disrespect me, hurt me, etc. - I have a complex of ""being bad"", so I let things of that sort pass, just to make myself appear unaffected, mature, soft, understanding... The thing is, I don't understand if I'm depressed or anxious. I've never had a panic attack, I can't even imagine the feeling of it.

Irritability became wild mood swings I went from being a happy, social person, full of life and humor, to someone who desperately wanted to avoid the world and couldnt tolerate its onslaught of stimulation and slights. **\*\*\*Welcome to the Circle\*\*\* is my story** and the multitude of lessons Ive learned along the way. Through 27 accessible, intimate, and insightful essays, poems, lists, and practical guides, I will share what I went through in a way that can reach the reader at the core. More than just memoir, Welcome to the Circle is a meditation on the mental health journeys all of us must take to become better humans. It is full of useful advice about how to navigate mental illness in all its difficulty and unpredictability, either for you or for the ones you love. **Mental illness is not a dead end; it can be a powerful beginning.** In the 7 years since I was hospitalized, I found effective treatment with both therapy and medications. I reconnected with family and friends around the globe. I started a successful global initiative for Wikipedia. I met my strong, brilliant, and beautiful wife. I became a loving stepfather. Along the way I learned and practiced how to help others find their own way into recovery. **My mission is to impact each person** who has personally experienced or witnessed the struggle of mental illness. To end the stigma and shame that prevents people from getting the help they need. To show that recovery is possible, that mental illness can be survived, and that it can be transformed into a dynamic and thriving new chapter of life. **Your support will help share this message with the world**, so that you can grow, and so that you can better understand and help others along your path. My goal is to make a positive change in peoples lives, to shift society towards compassion and acceptance, and to move each of us towards a fuller realization of our precious and vibrant potential.

I have really bad hypochondria and cardio phobia. if you are not to sure what that is will post the definition of each. &amp;#x200B; **Hypochondriac:** *a person who is abnormally anxious about their health.* **Cardio phobia:** *Cardiophobia is defined as an anxiety disorder of persons characterized by repeated complaints of chest pain, heart palpitations, and other somatic sensations accompanied by fears of having a heart attack and of dying. Persons with cardiophobia focus attention on their heart when experiencing stress and arousal, perceive its function in a phobic manner, and continue to believe that they suffer from an organic heart problem despite repeated negative medical tests. In order to reduce anxiety, they seek continuous reassurance, make excessive use of medical facilities, and avoid activities believed to elicit symptoms. The relationship of cardiophobia to illness phobia, health anxiety, and panic disorder is discussed. An integrative psychobiological model of cardiophobia is presented which includes previous learning conditions relating to experiences of separation and cardiac disease; deficient and inappropriate behavioural repertoires which constitute a psychological vulnerability for cardiophobic problems; negative life events, stressors, and conflicts in the person's present situation that trigger and contribute to the symptoms; current affective, cognitive, and behavioural symptoms and their stimulus properties; and genetic and acquired biological vulnerability factors. Finally, recommendations for the treatment of cardiophobia are derived from the model and areas of future research are outlined.* &amp;#x200B; So a little back story to when it all started, I was in the 8th grade in my science class I started getting heart palpitations and about passed out in class, im not sure what caused this but I would worry that it would happen again. Everyday I would worry about it so much once I got in my science class that I would make myself have panic attacks and would have to go to the nurses office daily, any other class I was in seemed to be OK just happened in that class because that is when it was first triggered. Throughout the year it started getting worse and would start noticing myself panicking about it in other classes until finally one day it was all day long. Few years and here I am, but now it actually physically hurts me, like make my chest hurt or my left shoulder heart (cardio phobia) . After i finally told my parents I felt like a bunch of stress was relieved and it actually cured me for months. 4 months later and here I am going back to how I use to be, physically in pain and worrying about it and not sure what I should do. Has anyone experienced anything like this before? If you have what did you do to overcome it? Even if you don't have an answer just support would be great, its very tough for me."
33,vulnerability,Anxiety,My story of becoming anxiety-free... Hope it helps.,59,dgr5am,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/dgr5am/my_story_of_becoming_anxietyfree_hope_it_helps/,2019-10-12 16:51:32,"Its possible. I lived it. THE BAD: I was married to a decent man but we were not in love with each other and were not in a happy relationship. I had constant anxiety and panic attacks weekly. One panic attack was so severe half of my face went numb and drooped and at the ER they thought I might be having a stroke ( I wasnt). I wasnt a happy person. I didnt have hobbies or things I enjoyed. I didnt have any friends out side of my relationship or a social life outside of my husband's family. I had undiagnosed PMDD which made me severely depressed and suicidal whenever I was close to my period. I saw multiple doctors to diagnose a constant pain in my chest that never went away. It would keep me up a night it was so uncomfortable. WHAT CHANGED: My husband and I divorced and I dated someone else. I fell madly in love with him and thought all my problems were solved. I blamed all my anxiety and depression on the bad marriage. A year later, the man I was seeing left me for another woman and I was thrown into a pit of despair. After it was officially over I cried for a solid 22 hours. I had to force myself to eat 12 almonds so I wouldnt pass out but I had no appetite. No interest in watching television or have any distraction other than (and I realized what this was later) SURRENDER. I cried and cried...as much as I had in me. I didnt allow for anything to distract me from it. I just let it come and come. I was devastated. No one came in to help me. No one rescued me. No one tried to fix it. I just felt it. All of it. I allowed myself to feel how alone I was. It was awful. Truly soul chilling. I was so desperate for relief I went to a coda meeting (codependents anonymous) because I had read a few things in the past that lead me to question if maybe I was. Hey, I was desperate after all. Maybe it could help? I went and sat there. Listened. Attempted to speak once and just sobbed. Barely coherent. I wasnt even sure if I was codependent but I appreciated being surrounded by love and support for whatever I was going through. At the end a woman came up to me and said you know what I heard tonight? Surrender. Only up from here girl. I went home. No more tears just numbness. I then asked through social media if anyone knew a good therapist because I was struggling. SO MANY people I would have never guessed reached out to me with either a recommendation or general support. And for the first time, I was vulnerable. I told people I was struggling and I needed help. I had no shame, no ego about it. I didn't care what my friends on social media thought. Fuck anyone who thought less of me for reaching out for help. I just asked for help, from anyone. And this lead me to therapy. Someone I barely knew gave me a name of a therapist and I booked an appointment. I made a commitment to go once a week for as long as I was able. I made financial decisions based off making it a priority so I could afford it. I went even on days or weeks when I felt ok. It turns out the days I went to therapy when I wasnt depressed were days that I found the most insight on my life and really delved deep into unhealthy patterns. When I was struggling however, I remember sitting in therapy and saying how I felt like I was just going through the motions in life and wasnt every really happy. She was THE ONLY one who told me that was ok. She told me to lean into the idea of not knowing who I was and not rush to fill that emptiness with whatever was around or an easy distraction. So I felt it. I didnt judge it and I didnt get frustrated with how long I was in this numb place. I would go out and do things, talk to people, put myself out there. Sometimes I felt engaged but usually I didnt and I didnt get frustrated by that. I just kept going. I had nothing left to lose. I had zero friends so I joined bumble bff and made plans to meet people. Some people I clicked with, others I didnt. But regardless I was putting myself out there. Every morning I listened to those cheesy morning motivations on youtube. I still love them. They never fail to put my head in a good place to start my day. I went on an anti-depressant the CORRECT way which is gradually which worked very well for me. I dont give all the credit to the medicine though. I give the credit to the WORK I put in. It was an incredibly slow process. I would get so upset with how long I felt like shit but since my day of surrender I made the promise to myself that I would keep going until I felt in control of my life again. I didnt skip weekly therapy. I made an effort not to get into romantic relationships until I was mentally and emotionally strong enough to be on my own first. I made a huge effort to find a support group of friends that I could be vulnerable with. I read a lot of Brene Browns books on shame and vulnerability. I forgave myself for going through a hard time and promised to be kinder to myself. I would actually talk to myself in the car. This isnt a joke. I would out loud have conversations with myself to check in on how I was feeling and I would tell myself, its going to be ok. We are going to get through this together. For some reason separating the two versions of myself (the happy successful future me, and the present depressed me)helped. I tried out new hobbies (woodworking, ukulele, video editing) some hobbies stuck, others didnt. I just didnt stop and I was patient with myself. Id sleep when I was tired and I try things as I felt ready to. I just didnt give up. This is what I realized for most of my life I was living other people's perceptions of me. I had NO clue who I really was. So this slow painstaking process involved the following: I had to get to know myself first (this was the hardest part). I had to enjoy spending time with myself and start liking it. I had to start loving myself (the self talk car conversations helped). I kind of visualized the kid version of myself asking for help and the adult version of me saying, its ok, Im here. Lastly, I had to stop listening to what others said I should do for my life and learn that I could trust myself. THE RESULT: Two years later, I am still on antidepressants but my life is so much fuller. I focus on gratitude and say out loud 3 things I am grateful every day. I dont let what other people think of me bother me because now I know myself. I dont let other people influence decisions in my life that affect my happiness. I recently moved to a new city for a job opportunity. I know no one here but I feel good and ready to take on a new challenge. Im not scared of getting depressed again because I know eventually Ill work myself out of it. I have deep true friendships that support me regardless of time or space. I continually put myself out there and try to say yes to going out and doing things. Mostly, I just stopped living my life for other people and starting living for myself. It didnt just happen. I worked my ass off for two years. I was patient with myself and adopted this mantra: ""Discipline is having faith in action. I took action and I had faith that those steps would pay off eventually even if it didnt feel like it at the time. Im here today to say it did eventually pay off and Im anxiety freefor now. Im happy. &amp;#x200B; xo"

My goal is to get into the bachelor of social work program. Some of the courses I'm taking require a great deal of self-reflection, and require openness with my classmates (all of whom I don't know very well). This week I've had to do a Whiteness Inventory on an online forum: it requires a great deal of self reflection and vulnerability. I also have to respond to some of my classmates' posts. With one of my classmates posts: when I read it, I felt like I could relate to what was being written, and I recognized parts of my experience as a white person that I had overlooked. In my reply I pointed these things out, and I thanked my classmate for helping me to build my awareness. My anxiety spikes when I think about that: I think about the details or angles that I've missed; I worry that I've completed the activity incorrectly; I worry about making a fool of myself. It keeps eating at me and it gets worse when I return to the forum to read posts or compose replies."

I hope this helps anyone here who also feels this way :),3,cremiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/cremiv/my_relationship_with_sentimentalitysensitivity/,2019-08-17 09:57:35,"This feeling is really hard for me to articulate, so I'll do my best to explain. For me, anxiety and sentimentality are very closely-linked. It's a real struggle to be simultaneously anxious about lots of things *and* emotionally-invested in lots of things. I'm generally affected2 by people (and places) a lot, and I get ""attached"" quite easily. But not in a clingy, ""never leave me"" sort of way at all, really. After talking to my therapist a *lot* about this, we started to use the word ""empath"" to describe the way I interact with my environment. I don't mean empath in a weird, science fiction sort of way, but rather as a way of saying that I'm highly affected by the ""energy"" people and places give off, and it can result in me feeling as if I'm sort of at the mercy of my emotions a lot of the time. For example, a great night out isn't always just that for me; it's a collage of vivid mental images and deep, gut feelings of affection, longing, and an almost film-like way of processing my emotions. All these feelings rush into my head in a kind of cluster of intense melancholy and it gets really overwhelming to process it all. On top of having GAD, additional anxiety comes into play during times of change and transition. When I feel like I can't hold on to those moments/phases that have had a profound effect on me, I get overwhelmed and panicky. Now, I guess I'm not necessarily *upset* that I'm this way. It's great for things like making music, writing, making friends and having meaningful conversations; but the problem is, it feels like there isn't always room in ""real life"" for this sort of... emotional vulnerability? Sometimes I just wanna be unnafected by things, and I'm so envious of people who are able to go through life without this level of sentimentality. I'm sure I'm not alone in this, so does anyone have any strategies? Thank you lots in advance :)"

Social anxiety to be precise. It burned me down slowly to the point where I started being unable to talk with people I've known all my life without feeling uncomfortable. I thought once I finished high school I was going to break free from all of that. Wrong. Of the two weeks I've been in university, all alone, all by myself, surrounded by all types of people, I've gotten worse. I've tried acting friendly and helpful when the moment is given, in a sad attempt at making a fucking friend, but no one seems to care. I suck at socializing, I know that, but now it feels like trying is useless. And what makes this anxiety worse, is that the most minimal of my insecurities can get multiplied by 10 in any moment of vulnerability. I'm venting here because, like 15 minutes ago I tried to go and chill in the library. I was trying to contain my anxiety the best I could as I walked through the second floor, breathing and trying to think of something else and suddenly someone from my high school greets me in the distance, while his new friends were watching. Which is bad, because I hate to be observed and seen by lots of people. This triggered my anxiety. I felt judged or something, and started walking faster looking for a seat. I couldn't decide where to seat, got nervous, so I kept walking faster as I tried to control my breathing and my facial expressions, so no one could see I was getting an anxiety attack. I kept walking, waiting to reach somewhere less crowded, until I found something close to it and sat quickly. I covered my face and tried to take as many deeps breaths as I could, until I calmed down. This is not the college experience I wanted. This frequent moments frustrate so much to the point of making me think about considering suicide, and I fear that they will eventually build up to that. I just needed to vent because I have no one to talk about this."

The one time I made myself vulnerable and had a panic attack in front of him, he told me to ""grow up"" and made it seem like I was putting on a show because I wouldn't let him dial up an ambulance. Since then, I've been too afraid to show that vulnerability again and I just hide myself from him whenever I feel an attack coming on. As you all know, this is very unhealthy and I've got to stop. So, my question is: Are there any books you guys can recommend for an SO who's partner suffers from anxiety or panic disorder? Or just any book you think might help him understand more?

Anyway! I never talk about this to anyone because it deeply embarrasses me and multiple therapists have tried to help me with it since I was in middle school to no avail (im 22 now), but I don't know how to make eye contact normally while talking to someone. I remember sitting in class in elementary school, not being able to focus on anything the teacher was saying because I was focused on where to direct my gaze and where to put my arms and hands. So it's been a thing for quite a while. Eye contact terrifies me. It must be something about the vulnerability I feel when someone looks into my eyes. I've tried to look at the bridge of people's noses when they speak to me, maintain eye contact completely, look away a few times to prevent the ""creepy stare"", I've tried minimal eye contact during a conversation or WAY too much eye contact. All of it is uncomfortable for me and probably the person I'm talking to as well. I've been told that I ""lock up"" when I'm especially uncomfortable with someone, as in my body gets very still because I'm focusing very hard on the eye contact aspect of the conversation. I often cannot focus on what the individual is saying to me because I'm so focused on looking normal while I converse with them. I've always had this weird, annoying fear of eye contact but it seems to have gotten worse during my college years. It happens with the people I live with and see everyday, my family members, friends, customers, coworkers, everyone. People that I love to be around, and am otherwise comfortable with. I love being around people and I am not an introvert, but I am VERY socially anxious, specifically about the eye contact. I love partying and going out and being around a lot of people, but the eye contact thing plagues me daily, especially when I'm one-on-one with someone. I'm not sure what to do about this. I've tried antidepressants, which have helped me a lot, but the eye contact problem remains. It's something I learned to be afraid of as a kid, so it's very hard to train myself out of it. I guess what I'm asking for is any sort of advice. Does anyone else feel this way? What can I do as a form of therapy?"

I start getting hurtful with my words, intentionally neglecting their feelings, gaslighting, all sorts of horrible, toxic behavior to try and create emotional distance. I cant stop it, the fear is so all consuming its like a compulsion. I build something good and then tear it to the ground and I cant stop. I can just, turn off any form of empathy or emotion for just long enough to intentionally destroy a relationship, and then turn it back on for the suffering that comes after. What the fuck is wrong with me?"
44,vulnerability,Anxiety,Agoraphobia and specific modes of transportation?,4,cff3zl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/cff3zl/agoraphobia_and_specific_modes_of_transportation/,2019-07-20 09:50:35,"I have a complex and specific form of agoraphobia that I've developed a firmer understanding of over the past few years, but I wanted to put it down on paper and get your thoughts on how to best deal with it. At the beginning of the decade, I had a series of incidents take place that formed my current mindset. In 2010, I had a panic attack while hiking that set things in motion. I realized that I was alone and that anything could happen to put me in danger. Any sense of confidence being far away from home/a hotel/wherever I was meant to be staying began to disintegrate. It probably goes without saying that I still don't like walking by myself in uncomfortable areas. I despise heights and bridges. Then, in 2012, I was in a horrific car accident. I've had two more since, one due to an intoxicated driver, and another because the other driver ran a red light and t-boned me. To this day, I feel an intense degree of vulnerability driving, especially on freeways at high speeds. In 2014, I moved to California, and my anxiety was so bad that I was very close to the agoraphobic stereotype. Leaving the house was draining and even a 25 minute drive to school led to some panic attacks. I had one so bad following my third accident that I thought I was going to piss myself driving on the 5 to Pasadena. I found an exit and took side roads back, making a half hour trip nearly 90 minutes. When I got home, I was shaken and spent the weekend with a cloud over my head. But I fought back. I started experimenting with different modes of transportation, scenarios, times of day, etc. and I've had some big wins. What I've discovered is that I am able to go anywhere I need to go as long as there are people around. I can take trains, buses, even larger planes without feeling a paralyzing degree of anxiety. As long as the drive isn't too long, I also can tolerate Ubers, Lyfts, taxis, etc. because I can talk to someone and not look out the window. Hardly ideal, but it's manageable. I had a big breakthrough last year when I took a train to Anaheim for a convention. Other than some mild anxiety at the beginning, it was a very pleasant experience and I would happily do it again. Then, earlier this week, I took a shuttle down to LAX, through a bad traffic jam, and discovered that I felt no negative emotions whatsoever. I was just a guy on a bus, reading a book and feeling very comfortable with the situation. I teared up at the experience of feeling normal and healthy in a situation that I never thought I would have been able to handle 5 years ago. My wife wants me to go with her and our daughter to Disneyland soon and I really think I can do it. One of my biggest insecurities is how many activities I haven't wanted to engage in as a family because of my anxiety, but there's some light at the end of the tunnel. Still, there are some plans I say no to because it's just not feasible to do without driving. I can't see myself vacationing anywhere because there are too many unknowns. I have a long way to go and despite the widening range of things I can do, I don't seem to be improving in this one area. Thanks so much for reading if you made it this far!"

I spend my waking hours being anxious and afraid. Unnerved even by my own heartbeat. Feeling as though this is all that my life has to offer - like this is all that I have to offer. Without knowing anything about me, you started a conversation. You were having a hard day and my heart ached for you. The truth is that even though I couldn't admit it - I understood your pain because it was once my pain too. And that kind of pain - the pain of loss and the devastation that comes from love that should have never hurt - it's unforgettable. In that moment of raw vulnerability, you saw me and I saw you. Except you didn't see the pieces that I'm struggling to put back together. You saw me as a whole, and you told me that you saw someone who you want to befriend. You told me that I was someone you were grateful for having met. You told me that you didn't see the darkness within me - only light. Your words were simple and pure, and each word meant the world to me. Months later, you would tell me that you love me, and for the first time in my life, I would believe it. After years of feeling like a living corpse, I would finally feel alive. Today, I can say that I am worthy of the kindness of strangers. I am worthy of the warmth of a lover. I am worthy of the giddy excitement that comes from experiencing something truly good for the very first time. I hope you can too. Oh and by the way, I love you too. \- E"
46,vulnerability,Anxiety,Social Anxiety and (How To Create) Boundaries,2,cjl8ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/cjl8ci/social_anxiety_and_how_to_create_boundaries/,2019-07-30 12:16:43,"Hey all, I've had some really intense encounters recently with colleagues at work, which have quickly graduated from us being emotionally vulnerable around each other to being physically vulnerable/erotically charged. There are a whole plethora of issues weaved into this, a lack of erotic energy in my relationship (and somewhat in theirs) but also a new-found perspective of mine that social encounters are a positive influence in my life and not the negative experience I've trained myself to believe they are. My immediate thought pattern has been to cling to the erotic encounters that have been appearing with these people, and either value or devalue myself based on if they happen again or my relationship with these people seems to be manifesting itself positively based on those encounters (outside of work with one person, and at work with the other) at work. This is becoming a bit of a trap for me, as although I am comfortable being vulnerable (both emotionally and physically); my colleagues are showing that once alcohol/endorphins/absentmindedness leave their system they are (at least to me) more distant and awkward. That feeds into my already complex view of myself, largely negative and largely socially anxious (which is a pattern I'm trying to break myself out of, but that's another thing). My question for my Reddit friends is this, do you have any literature/talks/podcasts, etc. that you would recommend on how to create proper boundaries with people as I get to know them? I would like to be open to vulnerability both physically and emotionally, but I am starting to feel like my lack of boundaries is leaving me open to emotional turmoil. Any thoughts? TLDR; new friends, complex new interactions and would like to know advice and things to read/listen to/watch to help navigate."

I graduated from high school in June and got to go skydiving as a graduation gift from my parents to me. After such a scary but freeing experience, I decided that I would open up to all of the people that follow me on Instagram that I have an anxiety disorder and what it feels like. I had the courage to open up and I want to use my anxiety to show others who struggle that they arent alone. Here is my post (it was accompanied by a picture of me skydiving): For as long as I can remember, Ive been clinically diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Catastrophic thinking has made me live much of my life in fear. In every situation I find myself in, I always have a tendency to latch on to the possibility of worst case scenarios. I have no control over the fact I have a disorder, but have worked to not let it affect and control my life. Skydiving is a way I have been able to combat my way of thinking, and to allow myself to do something amazing despite my fear. I have never talked openly about it, and I have tried to cover it up as best as I have been able to, for fear of being viewed or treated in a different way. Rather than keep it a secret and not speak out, I want to open people up to the possibility that there are people all around them struggling with mental illness. It is estimated that about 1/5 people deal with mental health issues. Those who do not consistently have internal pain can (understandably) not relate to those who do. This makes those who do struggle feel isolated. I know that everyone deals with pain, but no one wants to admit or show it. The way to help people with a mental disorder is through community and general kindness. Everybody has a twisted perspective that everyone else has their life together but them. This is false and leads to everyone feeling a need to not let any vulnerability show, because they think they would be different when in reality, we all have our own personal struggles. I dont know if I would still be here if it werent for the people who have showed me love and cared for me. It is awful to feel alone, and it is never a feeling that is real. Everybody reading this has people that care for them, and I encourage everyone to take advantage of that and talk to your friends about the good, bad, and ugly. I am completely aware that my one post will not change everyones perspectives, but at the very least I have reminded people to care for those around you. If anyone reads this and wants to open to someone, do not be afraid at all to reach out, I am a safe and trustworthy person you can talk to and I will be able to relate and understand anything. No one is alone. I have a following of about 700 on Instagram, so I hoped it would reach people and impact them somehow. I disabled comments on my post to also show it wasnt for the attention, just the message. How did I do? I really want to be able to advocate for those of us with anxiety and to try to alleviate a lot of the stigma that surrounds it. Did I represent well? I took a lot of time making that draft and it was nice to get it off my chest. Any thoughts/comments on it and how to maybe improve my messaging for the future?"

51,vulnerability,Anxiety,Hi Everyone,2,c4ruyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/c4ruyp/hi_everyone/,2019-06-25 03:24:21," TLTR: I suffer from anxiety. These are my experiences of living with anxiety. Hopefully you get something from relating to someone with these issues. Ive literally just joined this group. Nice to see theres one available. I suffer from anxiety and depression. I have been medicated on a cocktail of pharmaceutical psychiatric drugs in the past leading to catastrophic consequences Im lucky to have survived. They do work for some people, not for me. I havent taken them for nearly ten years now. Ive been better since, but did go through a time of being a one-stage-away-from-peeing-my-pants alcoholic, a functional cocaine addict, and have smoked forests of marijuana. Marijuana is the only recreational drug that I use daily now. Besides nicotine. It helps take the edge off my anxiety and depression; despite they are still quite palpable. I am totally functional on it. Past doctors have said that as much as they dont like to admit it, its a substance that suits me. I believe this to be true, even though I do somewhat depend on it. My drinking has slowed right down. These days I often go nights without a drop. Its rare I have more than three quarters of a bottle of wine in one sitting now. I went through a time of drinking two bottles of wine, minimum a night; a time before that was about sixteen large cans of beer a night. Thats just the evening drinking. Id wake up every morning and grab a beer from the fridge. That was for about a year and a half. I hardly ever touch cocaine now despite it being available to me. Stephen Fry labelled it a pernicious drug; I would have to agree with him from my past experience. I am thirty three years old. Right now I am anxious: About the times earlier tonight my friend would be talking and Id interrupt him mid-sentence because I was jumpy and not actively listening; anxious I did it too much and eventually he wont like me, thinking Im rude. About the last time I worked with this same friend. Despite I was later told I did a good job, I talked too much because I was nervous. So tonight I went to observe him work and spoke much less; because I was anxious that I might talk too much again. Im anxious that my involvement wasnt adequate. About a fight I had with my girlfriend two nights ago, a day before celebrating one year since we met. I was feeling depressed and anxious and took something the wrong way, blowing it up into a total clusterfuck. I was totally self obsessed and caught up in my bullshit that I wasnt wise enough in the moment to see what was going on and I hurt her emotionally. Before the end of the night this fight ended and we made up. She suffers from anxiety, depression, and dissociation herself; the way I acted makes me feel selfish that I didnt treat someone with these conditions the best I could. Someone I love more than I ever did my first love. This IS my first love as far as Im concerned. I didnt know what love was before meeting this person a year ago. We had a dear anniversary the day after the fight. Things have been loving and supportive since. Weve talked about the fight. Ive taken responsibility for everything I did to hurt her. Ive acknowledged that Im not well, despite how relatively functional I am in current day to day life. I am anxious about the pain she will still be feeling from the fight, and the temporary knock to her trust and probably respect towards me. Since that night things have been beautiful. I am optimistic about our future together, I know she loves me dearly and is also optimistic about our future together; but I am anxious about my ability to keep a lid on it at all times so I can be the man I want to be. Her rock. About that despite marijuana is a positive thing in my life, (theres plenty of respected scientific research to suggest its potential positive effects), Im dependant on something to take the edge off pain I inherently possess. One day I hope to not feel a need to escape my intolerable affect in any way, be it with drugs and/or alcohol, sex, exercise, video streaming services, you name it. I am anxious this will never happen, and that Ill never be fully alive. About the fact that weve moved to a new country two weeks ago for a year to see how we find it. Im anxious about it potentially not working out well for me professionally and it going really well for my girlfriend. Im anxious about us potentially having to make that decision in a years time about the future of where we base ourselves. If where we currently are only works well professionally for one of us; and that one person wants to stay here. About my bisexuality. Im in a relationship with a beautiful person who is bi herself. She understands and loves me for who I am. I am anxious about the conditioned shame and guilt I feel regarding my sexuality. Im anxious the femininity in me is unattractive to my girlfriend, despite shes made it very clear she finds it to be my defining quality helping shape my enormous heart, which she loves. Whilst I am proud of what I like to call my androgynous nature, it also comes with much pain and fear. About regular flashbacks of past traumatic experiences that haunt me regularly. I dont actively cling to them. Theyre just there. Im anxious when its been a while since Ive thought about these past episodes in my life, wondering when theyll ambush me again. About the fact that its 3:22 AM and I have a lot to do tomorrow. Im anxious that Id rather sit here right now alone in a quiet room writing this than snuggle up with my girlfriend and fall asleep; because in this moment life feels overwhelming. I just want to put my head in the sand. Im pausing life right now. The list goes on. I have times when my mental health is strong and Im the man I love to be. I equally have times when I feel reduced to the little boy I was once was in vulnerability, not the tall, generally optimistic young man I am now. I find some comfort in anonymously sharing this piece given the current state Im in. Thank you for your attention, it means the world to me."

The thought of the earth dying is very anxiety provoking. Whenever people start talking about how the world is going to end SOON because of mankinds negligence, I cant help but imagine myself and my family/friends/neighbors in apocalyptic situations; naturally, I get very distressed. I took an environmental science class a few years ago and it filled me with hope that we could save the earth. Now people are saying that theres no hope anymore and we need to panic. Hearing stuff like this makes me want to give up on school, my job, my dreams, and my hopes of ever having a family. What would be the point, after all? Am I the only one who feels this way?

I have her 50% of the time and honestly I wonder if it would be better for her to be with her father all the time. Luckily her dad and I were able to keep things amicable for her, so thats something Im mildly positive about- but a huge contributor to my divorce was my inability to move past my past trauma and the overwhelming anxiety and depression that everyday life causes me. Yes, Im in therapy but right now I still struggle to even leave my bedroom half of the time. Trying to be a proper parent seems impossible- just trying to cook her proper meals is something that I have to expend all of my mental fortitude on. I try to be as kid-appropriate honest with her as I can so that she can hopefully understand this is not her fault, but I know that she feels lonely and bored when shes with me and it tears me apart. I feel like the world is judging me for not being able to enjoy spending time with my bubbly, intelligent, joy of a child. How can I minimize the effect of seeing her mother struggle with the most basic of tasks? I feel like a failure that cant even keep my own house clean let alone raise a child.

This may seem obvious, otherwise you probably wouldnt be on this sub in the first place. But I mean REALLY be honest with yourself. Im a 21 y/o male. I consider myself intelligent, funny, compassionate, and intuitive. But Ive recently come to realize that Ive been lying to myself for a very long time. Even as far back as my childhood. I think the reason that Ive been lying to myself for so long was because it was the only way to cope with what I was feeling. Or so I thought. But recently Ive reached the breaking point. To be honest, it felt really good to let it all out. If youve ever had moments where you felt emotionless in a situation where you feel like you should have felt something, dont worry. This is a sign of your own strength. But you should realize that youre human, and you have your limits. No matter how strong you may think you may be, you must, MUST be vulnerable. This is coming from a person who has never shown vulnerability to anyone. Not even my family. But this is the first step to self-betterment. Its not necessarily going to be comfortable. Quite the contrary, actually. But growing pains are called growing pains for a reason ;) TL;DR Put your pride aside and be vulnerable. You need to. I learned this the hard way."

Pinpointing which of my schemas are getting triggered when I'm anxious has really helped me figure out how to deal with them. I thought I would share them, just in case others haven't heard about them.** 1. ABANDONMENT / INSTABILITY (AB) The perceived instability or unreliability of those available for support and connection. Involves the sense that significant others will not be able to continue providing emotional support, connection, strength, or practical protection because they are emotionally unstable and unpredictable (e.g., angry outbursts), unreliable, or erratically present; because they will die imminently; or because they will abandon the patient in favor of someone better. 2. MISTRUST / ABUSE (MA) The expectation that others will hurt, abuse, humiliate, cheat, lie, manipulate, or take advantage. Usually involves the perception that the harm is intentional or the result of unjustified and extreme negligence. May include the sense that one always ends up being cheated relative to others or ""getting the short end of the stick."" 3. EMOTIONAL DEPRIVATION (ED) Expectation that one's desire for a normal degree of emotional support will not be adequately met by others. The three major forms of deprivation are: A. Deprivation of Nurturance: Absence of attention, affection, warmth, or companionship. B. Deprivation of Empathy: Absence of understanding, listening, self-disclosure, or mutual sharing of feelings from others. C. Deprivation of Protection: Absence of strength, direction, or guidance from others. 4. DEFECTIVENESS / SHAME (DS) The feeling that one is defective, bad, unwanted, inferior, or invalid in important respects; or that one would be unlovable to significant others if exposed. May involve hypersensitivity to criticism, rejection, and blame; self-consciousness, comparisons, and insecurity around others; or a sense of shame regarding one's perceived flaws. These flaws may be private (e.g., selfishness, angry impulses, unacceptable sexual desires) or public (e.g., undesirable physical appearance, social awkwardness). 5. SOCIAL ISOLATION / ALIENATION (SI) The feeling that one is isolated from the rest of the world, different from other people, and/or not part of any group or community. 6. DEPENDENCE / INCOMPETENCE (DI) Belief that one is unable to handle one's everyday responsibilities in a competent manner, without considerable help from others (e.g., take care of oneself, solve daily problems, exercise good judgment, tackle new tasks, make good decisions). Often presents as helplessness. 7. VULNERABILITY TO HARM OR ILLNESS (VH) Exaggerated fear that imminent catastrophe will strike at any time and that one will be unable to prevent it. Fears focus on one or more of the following: (A) Medical Catastrophes: e.g., heart attacks, AIDS; (B) Emotional Catastrophes: e.g., going crazy; (C): External Catastrophes: e.g., elevators collapsing, victimized by criminals, airplane crashes, earthquakes. 8. ENMESHMENT / UNDEVELOPED SELF (EM) Excessive emotional involvement and closeness with one or more significant others (often parents), at the expense of full individuation or normal social development. Often involves the belief that at least one of the enmeshed individuals cannot survive or be happy without the constant support of the other. May also include feelings of being smothered by, or fused with, others OR insufficient individual identity. Often experienced as a feeling of emptiness and floundering, having no direction, or in extreme cases questioning one's existence. 9. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE (FA) The belief that one has failed, will inevitably fail, or is fundamentally inadequate relative to one's peers, in areas of achievement (school, career, sports, etc.). Often involves beliefs that one is stupid, inept, untalented, ignorant, lower in status, less successful than others, etc. 10. ENTITLEMENT / GRANDIOSITY (ET) The belief that one is superior to other people; entitled to special rights and privileges; or not bound by the rules of reciprocity that guide normal social interaction. Often involves insistence that one should be able to do or have whatever one wants, regardless of what is realistic, what others consider reasonable, or the cost to others; OR an exaggerated focus on superiority (e.g., being among the most successful, famous, wealthy) -- in order to achieve power or control (not primarily for attention or approval). Sometimes includes excessive competitiveness toward, or domination of, others: asserting one's power, forcing one's point of view, or controlling the behavior of others in line with one's own desires---without empathy or concern for others' needs or feelings. 11. INSUFFICIENT SELF-CONTROL / SELF-DISCIPLINE (IS) Pervasive difficulty or refusal to exercise sufficient self-control and frustration tolerance to achieve one's personal goals, or to restrain the excessive expression of one's emotions and impulses. In its milder form, patient presents with an exaggerated emphasis on discomfort-avoidance: avoiding pain, conflict, confrontation, responsibility, or overexertion---at the expense of personal fulfillment, commitment, or integrity. 12. SUBJUGATION (SB) Excessive surrendering of control to others because one feels coerced - - usually to avoid anger, retaliation, or abandonment. The two major forms of subjugation are: A. Subjugation of Needs: Suppression of one's preferences, decisions, and desires. B. Subjugation of Emotions: Suppression of emotional expression, especially anger. Usually involves the perception that one's own desires, opinions, and feelings are not valid or important to others. Frequently presents as excessive compliance, combined with hypersensitivity to feeling trapped. Generally leads to a build up of anger, manifested in maladaptive symptoms (e.g., passive-aggressive behavior, uncontrolled outbursts of temper, psychosomatic symptoms, withdrawal of affection, ""acting out"", substance abuse). 13. SELF-SACRIFICE (SS) Excessive focus on voluntarily meeting the needs of others in daily situations, at the expense of one's own gratification. The most common reasons are: to prevent causing pain to others; to avoid guilt from feeling selfish; or to maintain the connection with others perceived as needy . Often results from an acute sensitivity to the pain of others. Sometimes leads to a sense that one's own needs are not being adequately met and to resentment of those who are taken care of. (Overlaps with concept of codependency.) 14. APPROVAL-SEEKING / RECOGNITION-SEEKING (AS) Excessive emphasis on gaining approval, recognition, or attention from other people, or fitting in, at the expense of developing a secure and true sense of self. One's sense of esteem is dependent primarily on the reactions of others rather than on one's own natural inclinations. Sometimes includes an overemphasis on status, appearance, social acceptance, money, or achievement -- as means of gaining approval, admiration, or attention (not primarily for power or control). Frequently results in major life decisions that are inauthentic or unsatisfying; or in hypersensitivity to rejection. 15. NEGATIVITY / PESSIMISM (NP) A pervasive, lifelong focus on the negative aspects of life (pain, death, loss, disappointment, conflict, guilt, resentment, unsolved problems, potential mistakes, betrayal, things that could go wrong, etc.) while minimizing or neglecting the positive or optimistic aspects. Usually includes an exaggerated expectation-- in a wide range of work, financial, or interpersonal situations -- that things will eventually go seriously wrong, or that aspects of one's life that seem to be going well will ultimately fall apart. Usually involves an inordinate fear of making mistakes that might lead to: financial collapse, loss, humiliation, or being trapped in a bad situation. Because potential negative outcomes are exaggerated, these patients are frequently characterized by chronic worry, vigilance, complaining, or indecision. 16. EMOTIONAL INHIBITION (EI) The excessive inhibition of spontaneous action, feeling, or communication -- usually to avoid disapproval by others, feelings of shame, or losing control of one's impulses. The most common areas of inhibition involve: (a) inhibition of anger &amp; aggression; (b) inhibition of positive impulses (e.g., joy, affection, sexual excitement, play); (c) difficulty expressing vulnerability or communicating freely about one's feelings, needs, etc.; or (d) excessive emphasis on rationality while disregarding emotions. 17. UNRELENTING STANDARDS / HYPERCRITICALNESS (US) The underlying belief that one must strive to meet very high internalized standards of behavior and performance, usually to avoid criticism. Typically results in feelings of pressure or difficulty slowing down; and in hypercriticalness toward oneself and others. Must involve significant impairment in: pleasure, relaxation, health, self-esteem, sense of accomplishment, or satisfying relationships. Unrelenting standards typically present as: (a) perfectionism, inordinate attention to detail, or an underestimate of how good one's own performance is relative to the norm; (b) rigid rules and shoulds in many areas of life, including unrealistically high moral, ethical, cultural, or religious precepts; or (c) preoccupation with time and efficiency, so that more can be accomplished. 18. PUNITIVENESS (PU) The belief that people should be harshly punished for making mistakes. Involves the tendency to be angry, intolerant, punitive, and impatient with those people (including oneself) who do not meet one's expectations or standards. Usually includes difficulty forgiving mistakes in oneself or others, because of a reluctance to consider extenuating circumstances, allow for human imperfection, or empathize with feelings."
58,vulnerability,Anxiety,LOVE,1,b5nqm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b5nqm3/love/,2019-03-26 20:52:24,"I think most of us would agree that love is the most important thing. To love and care for someone and to have that love and care reciprocated. One would think that something as fundamentally important as love should be something easy to understand, easy to give, easy to receive. In reality, however, many of us have difficulty knowing what love is, and difficulty knowing how to both properly give it and receive it. In the world today, love is confused with sex, whereas sex is only an expression of love. Love also gets confused with limerance, or the feeling of being in love, this too, is mainly a chemical and hormonal response to a person who seems desirable usually in a sexual way, which again is only a limited expression of love. Many of us do not know what love is little wonder, because in todays movies, tv and music they frequently portray love as limerance or being in love, as sex, as enmeshment or even as codependency but none of these represent true love, but rather a warped and out of context view of love. Then, to compound the problem beyond belief, many of us were raised by parents who were cruel and abusive physically, verbally, emotionally and psychologically the terrible scars left on us make it ever so difficult for us to know what love is, how to show it and how to receive it, especially when we have never experienced what normal love is. Love is like a multifaceted diamond. As a child, we are supposed to be taught by experiencing it, that love is unconditional, consistent, reliable it should provide a sense of safety and security when we feel scared or vulnerable it should engender an atmosphere of openness and honesty with a sense of confidence that even if you did something wrong or bad that you will be helped and nurtured to do better. This is by no means a definitive explanation of what love should be, but is an example of what too many of us have never experienced. For too many of us, love was conditional, inconsistent and unreliable, vacillating between what appeared to be love, but we knew could turn into the worst of abuse in an instant and so love never provided a true sense of safety and security when we did something wrong or bad we generally had confidence that we would be further abused. In this sort of environment, as abused infants and children, we did not know why we were not loved as an abused infant or child we formed the only conclusions we could on a fundamental level we started to believe that we did not deserve love we didn't know what we did wrong but we started to believe there must also be something seriously wrong with us and that we should feel ashamed and guilty about it if we had needs and wants then we were made to feel ashamed and guilty for having them. For many of us, a feeling of love had more to do with behaving in a manner that got our parents approval, and so we learned at a very young age that what we think, feel and want is not as important as the way our parents perceived us being truthful was not as important as being safe. Being honest and vulnerable was not seen as an opportunity to be shown love, help and nurturing, but as a highly likely situation for further abuse. In our early teens we start to experience feelings of romantic love our young minds still do not know what normal love is, but by now we know that our parents are incapable of giving us the love that we need. So we start to fantasize and idealize romantic love in our minds as the thing that will heal the deep wounds cut into our subconscious minds, believing that we need another person to undo the emotional and psychological wounds that we carry. As children and teenagers we are introduced to the concept of love through music, tv and movies. These influences further warp our sense of love into something like sex, or enmeshment, or codependency, as though being in love is the pinnacle of what love is, and the ultimate validation of our self worth. Little wonder that few relationships last for years, let alone decades or a lifetime For many of us, we not only start off life with a handicap, but usually a large portion of our life is devoted to just figuring out what the hell went wrong in our lives, when and why and how a great deal of us find the process far too confronting and distressing and turn to drugs or alcohol, or to other self destructive behaviors in an attempt to escape from or dull our pain. One of the main problems with cognitive behavioral therapy is that abuse in our infancy or babyhood, is generally not stored in the logic center of our brain, so logical reasoning alone cannot undo much of the damage that is stored in the emotional fear response part of our brain, typically associated with, but not limited to, the fight or flight response however, this is also where some of our core beliefs of worthlessness, unlovableness and fundamental shame and guilt over simply having needs and wants are stored this is because at a very young age, these emotions were inextricably linked to fear and danger and pain that must be avoided at all costs. That is why also, for most of us, dealing with our issues is first dealt with through severe denial, distraction and suppression, because our minds associate our vulnerabilities with severe pain and anguish and does everything it can to avoid facing up to our vulnerabilities. As if in a cruel twist of fate to sabotage the rest of lives, we are rarely attracted to the type of person we need to fill our emotional needs or to help us heal. Typically we are attracted to people who are oblivious to our pain and behave in such a way as to exacerbate and further entrench our emotional damage. Why? Our early childhood taught us that uncertainty almost always leads to pain we were taught that when we did have certainty, there was a greater chance of avoiding pain. Therefore, when we met the people who could actually fill our emotional needs we were filled with uncertainty, even contempt. Why? Because these people were usually quiet natured, emotional and not afraid of vulnerability and valued openness and honesty. All of these things put us on high alert for potential danger and pain and we are repelled by the things that our subconscious associated with danger. What our subconscious associates with safety is certainty so ironically, we meet people who were like our parents, mainly interested in filling their own needs, people who do not talk about vulnerable emotions, people who put on a good front all of these things our mind is attracted to because it is familiar with it and therefore feels safe we easily slip into relationships of codependency, relationships where our people pleasing, validation seeking and approval seeking find their best use. Usually this is with self centered people with narcissistic tendencies. These people themselves are not to blame for the perpetuation of your abuse because they themselves are products of their childhood that made them who they are who were attracted to you as a person to meet their codependent needs or narcissistic tendencies. One of the most soul destroying, depressing and confronting truths you will ever face is the fact that your entire concept of what love is, is wrong you've never experienced love or given love. You've only ever given and received your concept of love which may only amount to sex, enmeshment, codependency or being in love, none of which on it's own is true love. To fix this problem we need to go back to our childhood where everything went wrong. The challenge is that sometimes we need to remember back to our infancy or babyhood if that is where the abuse began. Unfortunately this is also where many of our deepest scars were made, and it is also the time of our life where we retain the fewest conscious memories so to go as deep as we can we often need to rely on what we know about our parents and combine it with what we know would likely have happened. Here is an example from my own life: As a young adult, I knew I hated porridge, the very thought of it activated my gag reflex. This I knew was because my mother force fed me porridge every day as a baby. It wasn't until my 40s that I realized the deeper damage that my mother had done. As a baby, I didn't like porridge, so like most babies I spat it out this made my mother bang loudly on the table in disapproval, she would yell and scream and hit me for spitting it out when I learned that the only option was to swallow and then scream, my open mouth would be shoved full of another tablespoon of porridge, she would even hold my nose to stop me screaming or spitting so that I would hurry up and swallow so I could breath and scream only to be forced with another table spoon of porridge. Sad story but in practical terms this led to far more damage than a revulsion of porridge this is my earliest memory of subjugation the feeling of dread associated with having no choice but to do what you are told or implied to do subjugation by fear and consequences of pain and shock and humiliation. It also contributed to an underdeveloped self, where my personal preferences were completely irrelevant and dangerous. It also contributed to enmeshment where I quickly had to learn to do and accept and behave exactly as I was expected to make the trauma and abuse end as quickly as possible. Here is another example from my childhood: I can't remember why, but I remember being dragged to the bedroom by my ear at about age 6 I was given a solid beating with a belt and put to bed as most 6 year olds would do I cried hysterically, loudly, inconsolably, sobbing as an adult looking back I think this made my mum feel bad she didn't like feeling bad so she came back in my room to give me another hiding for crying so much another sad story, but in practical terms, as a child it taught me that I will get punished for feeling sorry for myself in effect teaching me that self love, self-soothing is bad and I should feel shame and guilt for it, even self hate. For me personally, this has been my experience my parental abuse led further to feelings of subjugation, enmeshment and an underdeveloped sense of self this led to people pleasing, approval seeking and validation seeking behaviors as well as codependency all of this was unsustainable and ultimately led to my severe depression and anxiety. It is not hard to imagine why so many of us with childhood abuse are debilitated by self hate, feelings of worthlessness, intense guilt and shame for doing things that make us feel good and continuing to do bad things that make us feel good because we were taught that this was the price to pay for feeling good. So how the hell do we undo this? Not easily and not quickly it takes a great deal of time, and concentrated, deliberate, repeated effort and even then your progress will be measured in small increments. To undo the damage, you first have to recognize what the appropriate response to your abuse was. As a child you naturally expressed this appropriate response by crying, screaming, yelling, throwing a tantrum but all of these responses, in your case, were met with an even greater level of violent humiliating abuse our young minds had no choice but to convince itself that the appropriate response was an inappropriate response, even a dangerous response. Now because these memories are not purely logic based but are stored in our fight or flight response center of our brain, we cannot access or change these through logic, or cognitive behavioral therapy alone. In order to access this stored memory we first need to trigger it. For me, triggering the sense of worthlessness and unlovableness meant getting in touch with the feeling of being in love, but having that love unreciprocated or even rejected this pain I was able to intensify by listening to my most painful heartbreaking love songs. Knowing that changing this visceral feeling had little to do with logic, I meditated on the fact that this intense feeling of wanting and needing reciprocated desperate romantic love was a complete lie it's not and never was a true representation of love I meditated on the fact that the concept and truth about what love is was stolen from me by the abuse of my parents then I let myself get angry at my parents, even though they themselves are products of their own abusive childhoods I got angry at the injustice of life itself I started to feel, the way a child would naturally feel when wronged for the first time, indignant, outraged, angry, generally pissed off I listened to music to encouraged the feeling of defiance against outrageous abuse of power such as Leo Morachioli Killing in the Name of and Give it Away and Sabotage. In all fairness, these songs and these feelings will not make you feel love, but they will help you to wipe the slate clean they will give you a sense of justification for feeling angry that you had valid innocent needs and wants that were not met, that you were abused and that you have the right to not be happy about it. Of course, none of us want to spend the rest of our lives angry, but neither do we want to spend the rest of our lives apologizing for the fact that we have desperately unfulfilled emotional and psychological needs the scarey part is allowing ourselves to move into uncharted waters as we explore the person that we really are, having full trust and love for ourselves knowing and believing that we will rise above ourselves, and be an even better version of ourselves than we ever imagined that we could be but first, we need to be willing to explore those parts of us that we have tried for so many years to deny, suppress and distract ourselves from. From that point on, you can start fresh you can start giving yourself commendation, praise, validation and approval for every single good thing that you say and do. You can stop giving a @#!@ what other people think about you, because you know that whatever you did or said was exactly the right thing by you because you can be guaranteed that most people in this world won't care one tiny little bit about you when making decisions or saying what they feel they need to say. You simply cannot love others if you don't love yourself. If you come from a place of self hate, self loathing or low self esteem, what possible love do you have left to give away to others? On a basic level you don't even believe that you have anything good at all to offer anyone so you can't show true love to others until you learn how to show true love to yourself this means being prepared to put your feelings, choices and preferences above those of others without the guilt or shame you were taught to feel. Only from that concrete position can you give consistent, reliable, unconditional love to others you cannot do this from a place of emptiness. Even then, when we have done everything we can, most of us may still find ourselves in a world that is less loving, less nurturing and less accommodating than we need however, this is yet another reason to make sure that you come from a rock solid concrete basis of knowing who you are, knowing where came from, knowing what your needs and wants are, and knowing that you have the right to expect more from life than you got."

Even now, Im still connecting behaviors that normal people dont do or feel the need to do to my anxiety. It was mind blowing to me that not everyone freaks out over every little thing. Its kinda nice to know theres a genuine, treatable thing thats been messing up my life, but its hugely scary for me because these parts of my personality that have been ingrained in me for so long arent actually me. Theyre results of my manic thinking and constant fear. For years now Ive been too anxious to be in a relationship, to open up to people, to enjoy events, to be on social media, to try new things, etc. I think all of this comes from a fear of being vulnerable, of being looked down upon, of not being good enough at something to where I cant be embarrassed that I tried. It might seem small, but its ruined my life and Ive missed out on so much. I think its been fed as well because on some occasions that I have tried, the worst case scenario has happened (which also is probably related to how my anxiety effects me when I have tried). This has made my anxiety feel real, feel like it has some sort of basis in reality. How can I stop feeling so ashamed of myself all the time? I dont even know myself, this isnt me. How am I supposed to live like this?"
60,vulnerability,Anxiety,Of fears and anxieties,1,aph9c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/aph9c5/of_fears_and_anxieties/,2019-02-12 02:21:17,"For starters, people would always regard me as the '*optimist*;' the one who never fails to smile, the one who seems like she has all her life figured out, the one who seemingly lives a perfect life. I guess that's because I rarely open up to people. I am rather chatty but with matters regarding the state of my heart and life, I am pretty much private. It's because life already made me realize that, the more I open up to people, the more I get hurt when they do something against me or when they decide to leave. And that's true because people always leave whenever I try to show who I truly am inside this mask. I have been living with this fear that all people will hurt or take advantage of me. This fear started when I was in high school, when almost all my classmates bullied me. This further exacerbated when my first boyfriend cheated on me. The months following the breakup were long and full of pain. The first person I have ever opened myself up to betrayed me...and he did it without giving me a proper closure. Loneliness took over me for several months. I tried to forget the pain by meeting new people, doing some regrettable things, included. I also tried dating other people to ease the pain in my heart but I only ended up hurting myself more because I just have been with people who emotionally manipulated me and my vulnerability. I've never felt so lost. 4 years after, I have slowly learned how to trust people again. But then, life has a funny way of interfering with my recovery. An (ex)-friend of mine sexually harrassed me when I was just trying to help him. I felt so helpless, so scared. It's like I have a voice but I can't speak. A month after that incident, a stranger tried to rub himself on me. Just when I thought I've had enough miseries in life, here I am, crying myself to sleep every night because of the trauma those incidents caused me. It became worse when I had to take multiple tests just to ensure myself that nothing happened with those non-penetrative acts, even when I am already sure that nothing would happen from those incidents. But sometimes, this mind of mine will try to overthink the situation, and instead of helping me calm down my fears, it would just again force it to think irrationally. Sometimes I even wake up at night just to cry because my anxiety then again creeps without any warning and I have no other choice but to cry...just so I could release the pent-up pain.  But despite these, I still consider myself lucky. My SO is the only person I can openly be myself with. He's been with me during the darkest times, and even if I haven't full recovered from what happened to me (and even if I still get scares every month), he's still there to listen to me. I know I am not the best person for him right now, but I swear to God that I will try my best to be the right one for him. Anyway, thank you guys for devoting time to read my story. This is my first time talking about my fears to someone else beside my SO. I have been excessively down for the past few days and I figured that an outlet could help. Thank you again everyone."

I don't like talking about my mental health with most of my friends and family, either because I don't want to stress them out, or they react in a way that makes me feel worse. I've always been the rock for my real life friends, but many of them don't know how to be emotionally supportive and often just sit uncomfortably when I try to share what I'm struggling with. I'm vulnerable in those moments, so it's humiliating when that vulnerability is met with disinterest or silence. &amp;#x200B; I've always found that online friends are better for that sort of thing. In my teens and early 20s, I had a ton of online friends, which evened out the fact that a lot of my real life friends don't have the same amount of empathy as I do. Now I'm turning 33 in three days, and there's only one online friend left that I speak to often. We're both there for one another, but she's got her own nightmares to survive. I can only vent to her so much before I start to feel like I'm adding to her problems. &amp;#x200B; All of this is to say, I'm trying to find my footing on reddit and see if I can make it work for me. It isn't exactly what I'm looking for, but maybe there's more of a sense of community than it seems? Maybe people could give me some pointers on making the most of this site. &amp;#x200B; I feel like I'm much older than a lot of people I encounter, and I feel increasingly damaged compared to those I talk to. My severe depression and anxiety stole almost a decade of my life, and I still struggle with it. It's something I'll have to learn to work around, which is what I've been trying to do, but it would be nice to have more people who can commiserate. People who listen and don't just try to use me as a therapist. I only have so much energy, and sometimes all of that has to go into keeping myself together."

That's why I thought it was maybe ADHD, because the problems of motivation plus inaction when I do have motivation. I had an evaluation which showed that I might have more ADHD like problems than ""normal"" people, but the doctor thought it really was anxiety. I had of course considered that in the past but based on posts on this subreddit and the standard symptoms of anxiety I just didn't fit that well. I don't have panic attacks, I'm fairly ok with talking with people (though intimacy/vulnerability, even to family, is extremely anxiety inducing), I can leave the house. etc etc etc. I don't say this to brag or anything. It's just that the results of my life so far are very very sub optimal. I just haven't achieved anything I want (as if I knew what I want). If I was in a better place in life I would bet that I could not be diagnosed with anxiety, even if I still had the exact same mental states.

Anger is a response of our subconscious that is intended to keep you from feeling powerlessness over a situation. To address, the insecurity of our powerlessness however, we need to be willing feel the full emotion of our anger to know what it's trying to protect us from. This does not mean acting or speaking in anger, but the ability to feel and analyse it in privacy. The problem is that with an abusive upbringing, as children we may have been taught that feeling any sort of anger is completely unacceptable, and that the reasons for our anger is irrelevant and it will lead us to more abuse, ridicule and shame if it continues. Rather, we should have been dealt with in compassionate, understanding and empathetic way and been helped to process our feelings of anger in a loving dignified way. Of course, if you suffer from severe depression or anxiety then most likely that was simply not the case. And so we learnt to reject, deny and suppress any feeling of anger as unjustified and that feeling anger meant we were a bad person. Anger is nothing more than a symptom of a deeper threat or feeling of insecurity and powerlessness. Allow yourself to feel it, analyse it in detail especially by writing about how, why and what the anger is making you feel... what pain does it want you to avoid? Only by identifying the fear or vulnerability that your anger is trying to protect you from will you be able successfully address the emotion of anger that you feel. PLEASE READ MY OTHER POSTS"

Feeling overheated makes me anxious, and during the start of Spring, I ate less and fasted, and I believe this fear factored into it (and other emotional factors.) I've tried to overcome it, going on walks with short sleeves and shorts, sometimes with my Dad, but in the back of my head I think something bad will happen. When I'm inside I'm still anxious because I know it's hot outside and the sun's out. I used to put a dark blanket over my window (until my parents took it down), and it calmed me a little bit, as long as it was cool inside and no sunshine peered into the room. I've always worn long sleeves in summer and in winter I was more likely to wear short sleeves. I'm okay with lights, but the sunshine makes me feel what I assume is vulnerability.. It's irrational as most phobias are, but you can't escape sunshine and hot days. Have you guys felt similar?"

And an experience I had last night made me feel really bad about myself. I'm trying not to take it too seriously, and I'm trying to write this lightheartedly, but gawwwd it was painful. So my girlfriend was talking to me about some stressful things that have been going on in my life. She was trying to be supportive, saying I could always talk to her about anything. Then later that evening she was being really flirty. She was telling me that she loved me and was getting right at my heart talking affectionately about my sisters, and it meant a lot to me because I miss my sisters a lot. She invited me over and we got in to bed together. We just lied their talking for a few hours watching Cupcake Wars lol. Then she started getting real handsy with me, and we started messing around. She's kissing me and all that sweet stuff people do. Then she just stopped everything, and was like ""Alright. I'm going to bed."" I was pretty confused. I was like ""Is everything okay?"" And she said that everything was fine. Then she lied there and turned to her side facing away from me. This sudden distancing and shutting down just confused me, like I said already. Then I said something like ""babe, come lie over here by me."" and she was like ""Nah. I'm good."" I was kinda hurt by this. So I'm just lying there feeling hurt and confused. Eventually I say something like ""Babe, can you just open up a little. I'm feeling bad."" And she snapped at me like ""You can go home if you want."" I was like ""That's not what I was meaning."" I tried to explaining that I was just hurting a little bit. I was trying to get some reassurance. And she lied there and said ""Bummer man. That sucks."" I just kinda lied there feeling crushed and embarrassed for owning up to any vulnerability. Eventually I got out of bed, gathered myself up, and said ""Hey. I love you."" She just ignored me. I kinda got a little choked up. Not gonna lie, eyes got all watery, got that lump in the throat going on. And I was already feeling pretty bad, so it was probably intensified. Then I closed her door quietly, and left her house at 4 in the morning feeling like absolute garbage. I just feel like I disgust people because they can tell how anxious and uncomfortable I am. I don't ask for reassurance often. Like I have written and rewritten this post so many time. And I've deleted it over and over again. But I don't know how to pull of acting like I'm feeling fine when my whole body is just in pain. I don't have much control over it. Now I'm sitting in my car, outside my house, not able to start it up because I'm feeling like I might shut down if I leave. I don't want to see anyone. And I'm trying to laugh it off, but I feel like if someone gave me a hug I would probably start sniffling and leaking all over lol. It's just an awful feeling. I feel so incredibly low right now... Anyway. Sorry for a long read. I hope everyone is doing well today. :)"

My Ph.D. research focuses on identifying different kinds of positive outcomes among individuals diagnosed with any mental illness/ mental health issues in India. In many societies including India, mental illness is typically perceived as a lifetime adversity with high vulnerability to problems. Therefore, displaying resilience when affected with mental illness is generally not expected or not encouraged much. Hence this study is expected to have important implications in both research and practice, and it is hoped that initiatives such as these may be able to challenge common misbeliefs regarding mental illness.

On every single date/hang-out we've done in-person, I have been extremely anxious. Sometimes it's so bad that I barely say anything throughout the whole date. It has definitely hindered us getting to know each other as much as we'd like. We text consistently on a daily basis, which I've gotten fairly comfortable with (I used to get anxiety from even texting him). But for some reason, my anxiety when hanging out with him in person seems to be getting worse, not better. I have never been comfortable getting close to anyone and have issues with intimacy and vulnerability, so maybe that could be it? How do I overcome this? "

For me, anxiety has always been a more subtle and covert emotion than depression, thus making it harder to deconstruct and work through. When I'm depressed, it's very obvious to me, but when I'm anxious, it can be hard to pinpoint because of how long I've lived with it (it feels normal) and how it tends to hide, expressing itself through other emotions. &amp;#x200B; With that in mind, I decided to get to work and start brainstorming the ways I can detect my anxiety and understand what exactly causes it. I've learned that when I want to work on things like anxiety, depression, etc. I have to dig in head-on. This led me to a TED talk by therapist Brene Brown called ""The Power of Vulnerability"" and she discusses her professional and personal findings on shame, fear, guilt, lack of self-confidence, and vulnerability. &amp;#x200B; Long story short, after some soul-searching, I've realized I have a deeply-seated lack of self-confidence and this realization has utterly shaken me to the core. It's as if I've spotlighted anxiety, hiding in the bushes all this time, and by doing so, I've elucidated how much it affects facets of my life. I realize now why I fear relationships (friendly and romantic) and affection, yet deeply long for a partner and feel pain when I see my two closest friends together, dating. I realize how much I place my own self-worth in the hands of others and subsequently, why I struggle to be content in my own company. I realize how much I live off of affirmation from those around me and how truly inferior and lacking I feel to my peers. &amp;#x200B; This massive realization has utterly ruined me for the last two days and I just ask for some support, advice, and comforting words please, at least to hold me up until Wednesday, the day of my therapy appointment. I'm experiencing so many emotions at once-- grief, shame, fear. What were once quiet hums have turned into booming, overwhelming thunders and it's so difficult to cope. Every small thought transforms into a giant spiral of negativity and catastrophization. I've had to quit playing Minecraft, a game I find calming and soothing, because simply the \*thought\* of messing up a house and having to start over makes my chest tight. This is hell. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

So far it is really good. She talks about vulnerability and how it is seen as a weakness, when in reality vulnerability makes us feel alive and human.

Idk, maybe it's because of my childhood and my anxiety. I've always been afraid of rejection and conflict - but at the same time afraid of vulnerability and intimacy despite a deep desire for it, a deep desire accompanied by a deep fear that I'm unable to handle everything that comes with it. The result of this is that I'm pretty much friendly and on good terms with everyone - I think you could find plenty who would call me an 'acquaintance' - but you would also find that everyone who knows me finds they will hit a wall before they can get any closer to my heart. I sincerely doubt you will find anyone who would consider me a 'close friend'. And vice versa. It's painful. I struggle with emotional and mental turmoil almost daily, with no one to talk to about it with. Yet in the day, almost as if by instinct - I put on my public mask of competence and stability that also serves as a barrier from my heart.

Totally new to this stuff, never felt like I do now before recently. Long story short, I came out of an emotionally abusive relationship in which my ex cheated on me multiple times. At the time we broke up I was legitimately feeling great because I was happy to know I never have to put up with her shit again - I'm normally headstrong and not a great deal bothers me, until lately. I'm seeing someone new and I've fallen hard, and although I have complete faith in her because she is genuinely an amazing person, I find myself overthinking situations because of past experiences. I kinda just panic myself and the feeling of vulnerability from opening myself up is horrible. At the same time I have absolutely no doubt she wouldn't cheat on me, is it irrational to feel huge discomfort just knowing that it's theoretically possible for it to happen? I trust her, but I'm an emotional guy on a normal day, and just the fact she *could* cheat on me makes me feel sick to my stomach. How do I stop this way of thinking? It's doing me no favors, because I am fully aware that the situation I'm imagining is just make-believe. It feels incredibly strange to put so much trust in her when I have so little trust in anyone or anything right now. She's as head over heels for me as I am for her and I've explained the situation I'm in (she knows I have these trust issues and has been nothing but supportive) but I don't want to worry about this because I am very confident that it'll just pass in time. I guess I'm just rambling at this point but I don't know what else to say about how I feel. I overthink situations and am uncomfortable with the looming feeling of vulnerability. She could completely cripple me emotionally if she pleased - but I know she wouldn't. So why am I worrying? It makes no sense to me whatsoever. Thanks for any advice."

Fair warning, this will likely be very wordy. When I'm single I'm usually not an anxious person. Once I'm in a relationship, the vulnerability completely changes who I am on a level I don't like at all. Having to care what someone else thinks is incredibly overwhelming for me, and I don't know how to stop the spiral from repeating itself again and again. &amp;#x200B; I'm 25F, and I have had a total of 5 failed relationships (not including current), ranging from 2 months to 3 years (and a divorce due to his cheating). Every failed relationship has had it's differences, but they all ended in about the same summary. I wasn't what they wanted. I wasn't the right ""type"", or at the right stage in life, or attractive enough, or they were already in love with someone else and didn't bother to tell me. Either way, it always boiled down to me not being enough/what they wanted in one way or another. Usually it would be a problem that would rear it's ugly head in a slow kind of way. Lots of gas-lighting and mixed signals, until eventually I had to figure it out myself and end things for my own protection. &amp;#x200B; Fast forward to current relationship and things are very *very* different, but I'm falling into old habits that are going to destroy things from the inside out. I'll pick everything apart, jam my boyfriend into a corner until he reluctantly says things that I can use as ammunition for why he doesn't love/want me, or make arguments that he's going to cheat eventually with /insert type of girl here/. He gets frustrated and upset that I don't trust him or believe him when he says how he feels about me. When he compliments me or calls me beautiful or says I'm what he wants I feel a literal cringe and scoff inside. I don't feel like he's intentionally lying to me, more like he's just lying to himself or settling and it's just a matter of time until he realizes I was right all along. I'm incapable of believing that I am what \*anyone\* would honestly want for a female partner. &amp;#x200B; I'm not going to lie, the anxiety makes me (rarely) think of just being single again so I don't have to worry about it, but then it's followed by a deep sadness at the idea of not being with him. I'm essentially incapable of believing that I am in fact who he wants to be with. Despite the fact that he pursued me for almost a year before I would give him the time of day, and we were very close friends for all of that time. As soon as I developed mutual feelings and it escalated into a relationship, it's been absolutely heavenly. We're inseparable, and even despite moving very fast we've been very good at handling arguments/differences and working on small hiccups here and there, which have been very few and far between. We've discussed this problem in particular several times and despite my being stubborn and combative to let my guard down, he's still very patient and understanding. Being with him makes me feel motivated to be a better version of myself. I have a lot of self image issues regarding physical and social status - and he is incredibly supportive and helping me make the changes that I myself want to make, with no sense of pressure to change for anything other than my own benefit and wishes. He's told me he feels the same about my making him motivated to grow as a person as well. &amp;#x200B; Long and short, it's a fucking wonderful relationship. Unlike any relationship I've had in the past. This is also the first instance of a relationship where I was pursued so strongly rather than the pursuer, he reminds me of that and I have a hard time letting his efforts really sink in. Even though we've only been a couple for a short while (about 3 months) we both agree that it feels like something very right and ""meant to be,"" so to speak. We've both had our share of long term relationships for comparison. &amp;#x200B; I wish I could stop trying to push him away and have some actual faith in a relationship for once. I get feelings of anxiety almost constantly and it's so subtle and insidious. I'll pick fights over the one night of the week we don't have sex, when I'm really just using it for validation. I'll get physically uncomfortable to the point of not wanting to be touched when there's a woman nearby or even on a screen that I myself perceive as being a temptation for him - despite him doing/saying literally nothing to make me believe so. I'll try to force myself to relax and simply \*believe him\* for a change, but then the voice in my head tells me that just when my guard is down I'll be most vulnerable and that's when he'll cheat or break my trust and it'll be more hurtful than I can handle. &amp;#x200B; I have a very strong intuition and pride myself on being able to read people, and I've rarely been wrong before. This time it feels different, like I'm the one who's wrong, but the defenses are so firmly rooted in place it's become instinct. I sense his discomfort around other women because he knows I'm going to get triggered - and then that leads me to feel like my paranoia is validated and it spirals from there. &amp;#x200B; I know I can't keep this up because I'm going to make my own worst nightmares come true. It doesn't help that I'm a very expressive person. My face and body language give me away no matter how hard I try to just let it pass without acknowledging it. Then he asks me what's wrong and I tell him and he gets this look like he's understanding but still he's discouraged by the problem reoccurring despite everything he does to prove how he feels for me, and he does a lot. &amp;#x200B; I'll stop rambling now, but I'd just like some kind of advice on moving past this mental roadblock before it's past the point of no return for my relationship. I don't want to push this guy away, but letting my guard down is way harder than I expected it would be, especially considering my own sense of self worth is in the gutter. I've been making strides to improve how I feel about myself. I've began working out, watching what I eat, cutting down on alcohol, etc.. Still, the problem feels like it's going to outpace my own efforts thus far, so looking for any advice on the mental aspect of things. I'm sure once I lose 50lbs, get a new job with a bigger income, etc. I'll be fine but that's all a long ways away and I don't want to tank my relationship before I ever had a chance to change my behaviors. &amp;#x200B; Kind understanding and advice is very much appreciated. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

Trust me I get angry a lot (it's something I want to work on but can go into detail later), but this is a different type of emotion and response. I'm not sad or scared and actually want nothing more than to articulate the cohesive thoughts and words at the tip of my tongue. But depending on the audience I either refrain to maintain as much composure as possible, or I let it all out - which comes with the waterworks. It almost happened today to someone who doesn't know me well enough and it did happen as recent as a few months ago, in front of someone I felt safe exposing my emotions and vulnerability to. It just seems like such a heightened state of emotion and I guess I feel not in control. I know if I don't get out the emotion in some way, I'm not able to revisit the issue at hand. So either I bottle it up or have to let it out if I wish to address it. Once I get the initial crying out, I'm able to speak eloquently. It's just an embarrassment and I feel it reflects poorly on my ability to manage things at work, school, or anything. Hate to say it too but I feel like being a woman makes this worse and I'm not able to be taken seriously. If this helps figuring anything out, I had a rough childhood with abusive mentally ill parents, drunk father and relative guardians, and abusive drug addict non-relative guardians. All that considered, I believe I turned out very well and am highly functioning with a steady job, finishing up my education, reasonably well adjusted and with an amazing support system including my fiance. Aside from some ocds and insecurities and generally being emotional sometimes (I am on newish birth control and sometimes feel so uncontrollably emotional over the simplest things), I feel I do alright and am generally with a clear head and empathetic heart. I'm just wanting to explore this topic and see if anyone has experiences or tips they wish to share. It sucks! "

I've experienced several injuries and traumatic events in my life and I can say with certainty that anxiety is the worst. It's difficult for me to talk to anyone about it, because I am fearful of exposing my greatest vulnerability to others. I've took Klonopin back in 2016 for less than a month. It helped considerably for short term management, but the adverse side affects and risk of dependency caused me to discontinue it. I have a prescription for Propranolol and use it rarely on an as needed basis. It helps with the racing heart feeling. Dealing with anxiety has shown me just how resilient we can be. For the most part I get through the day just fine, but there are moments when I feel anxiety building under the surface. I get tense, nervous, and overwhelmed. It feels like an invisible enemy is grinding away at my mind, body, and soul. Anxiety is evil. It's is a purely destructive force and a powerful one at that. I'm currently self treating my anxiety with Ashwganda and magnesium supplements. Exercise, healthy relationships, and focusing on goals also help. I've adopted a warrior mindset for dealing with anxiety. I view it and understand it as an adversary. To my brothers and sisters out there who are also in the midst of this battle, know that you are not alone. Never give up. "

Could someone help me break down the process of determining what type of mental health professional I need to seek out, and how to actually do it? My main issue is just general social anxiety, and trouble initiating change. On the rare occasion I'm asked to do something social, my mind immediately panics and begins seeking out ways and reasons to say no, and I just about never invite others to socialize. I know exposure therapy is likely necessary, I just can't seem to force myself into it. I'd likely need to go through some issues like shame, emotion suppression, vulnerability suppression, etc. I feel like I don't need to work out any meds at this point, and am moreso needing cognitive behavioral therapy to advance. Any assistance with these points would be greatly appreciated! Psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, therapists, etc... what are the differences and how do I know which to seek out? Any decent guides out there to help reduce my ignorance? I have a HDHP plan that will be ending later this year. Do most places offer acceptable pricing for non-insured people? I'm fine with paying with cash to get help, just not sure what to expect here. Once I know what type of professional to seek out, how do find the right one? Do I just google them and hope to find some reviews? Try them once to see if we click? Any other tips or general advice for getting the ball rolling? I've been dealing with this issue for far too long and I NEED to make a change. Thanks!"

My chest is very tight and moving is something that will, for some reason, make something awful happen. I don't quite understand why this happens. There's a certain vulnerability that's a part of the first five to ten minutes after you open your eyes, and that makes it difficult to calm down for a while afterward. Often the feeling lingers throughout the day, when I wake up like this. It seems to happen regardless of whether or not I'm woken up by an alarm. It happens on work days and weekends alike. Work days are especially an issue, though, as it makes it difficult to get out of bed and proceed with what I need to do to get ready for the day. I know this is an experience that is not unique to me, so can anyone tell me what they do when this happens? "

Basically, my life before the past few months was basically studying research and numbers (my field is science/math related), spending time with my friends because I value friendship VERY much and thought I would never need any other emotional connection, because my friends are so amazing, and pursuing art and writing. Mind you, I have never ever thought I would be the type of person who is made happy by anyone other than their best friends or family. So, when this person asked me out, and I developed INTENSE feelings for them, I think for once, accepting that my emotions partially lie in the hands of this person who I deem to be pretty perfect, scared the shit out of me. I always thought I would be the type of person who flourishes alone (which I do, but this person has a similar field of study, we're both going to school for engineering and I can't believe I am admitting this but I think they've made me a better person?!?!?) and self sufficiency has been something I value highly. I was seriously so stupidly idealistic that I thought if I needed to fulfill my biological need to have sex or whatever that casual sex once in a while with someone who I'm just physically attracted to would do the job (I've only been intimate with my current partner by the way so I my ""dreams"" I guess you could say were crushed). Oh, but that has not been the case. I've been reading a lot on how developing feelings for other people affect humans in regards to mental health. Maybe it's because I have never felt so strongly about anyone else and I'm scared that I have something so special I never ever want to lose or jeopardize, but it is terrifying, the fact that part of my emotional sustenance is now in the hands of someone other than myself. Shit. "
87,vulnerability,Anxiety,My wife may need anxiety medication. Has anyone had a POSITIVE expirience in the bedroom while on anxiety medication? [NSFW-ish?],2,8s0i8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8s0i8r/my_wife_may_need_anxiety_medication_has_anyone/,2018-06-19 01:43:41,"I\[M27\] am asking this because my wife's\[F27\] anxiety is starting to physically affect her in ways it has never had. DW has gone 27 years without any kind of medication, mainly because she does not like the idea of putting mind altering chemicals in her body; however her anxiety is starting to get much worse. In the morning, DW literally gags and throw up right when she wakes up. This is caused only by the sheer fear of gagging or throwing up. Her job (ironically, she really enjoys it) involves speaking to crowds of at least 200 people every week. She doesn't necessarily get nervous of being on stage, but she gets nervous of being nervous. Minutes before she goes on stage, she pukes, composes herself and gets on stage. DW is a badass. Our marriage is pretty great. Besides from the expected quarrels and fights that are unavoidable (I left the toilet seat up one too many times) we have grown together emotionally, and spiritually, and we have never been better friends. When it comes to the bedroom, we have learned a lot about grace for both of us. I of course am the stereotypical higher driven husband, and she the lower driven wife. It is a learning curve for both of us and I don't think we will ever get the balancing act perfect, but I know we love each other enough to not let sex be an anchor on our relationship; with that being said, we would like it to be wind in our sails. She has always had vulnerability issues, and for her to present herself to me for the first time on our wedding night was an emotional, beautiful and loving thing. We were excited to be with each other physically. Throughout the years we decided to experiment with different positions, toys, etc. But lately she has voiced to me that she gets nervous about having a good time; she puts so much pressure on herself that she starts to worry about sex instead of enjoying sex. This started to coincide with her anxiety. She has sometimes worked herself up so much that she has even physically gagged during the act like she would before going on stage for work. Everywhere I look, listen and read, I hear about how anxiety medication ruins sex life, but I was wondering if anyone has had a similar situation and has seen an improvement in the bedroom? I know that no matter what effect it has in the bedroom, I want her well being above it all. I don't mind a less-engaging sex life if it means more freedom for her. Next week we are scheduling a doctor's appointment to get her evaluated. **TLDR**: Anxiety for my wife is getting really bad. She has never been on mediation. sex life starting to be affected by it. Wondering if anyone had an improved expirience in the bedroom while on anxiety medication."

I have had random bouts of anxiety around him which I hate and it makes me so angry any time I cry around him. I don't want to put stress on this new relationship with constant crying and anxiety. He's been so supportive despite everything. Any time I'm having an anxious spell I try my best to keep it to myself but he always recognizes it and asks me to communicate- I've been consistently reluctant to but I always do- and he'll cuddle and talk to me until I feel okay. The level of vulnerability I share with him is new to me. I tell him all of the fears and random thought patterns I'll go through and he just listens and understands. I'm terrified that I love him. Inside I love him so much. I'm terrified because I feel like he deserves better than me. Someone less stressful. I'm terrified because I'm afraid I'll hurt him or push him away. I've never had anyone in my life that has my back like he does and it's unreal. It feels like I'm unlearning years of mental traps I have lived in and put up for myself. I've never been around someone that actually sees the parts of me that I hide, and makes me feel like I'm not alone- someone that makes me feel strong like he does."
89,vulnerability,Anxiety,My relationship triggers my anxiety and I dont know what to do from now on,16,8la06s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8la06s/my_relationship_triggers_my_anxiety_and_i_dont/,2018-05-22 23:32:56,"This might be a bit long, so bare with me guys. Im confused and conflicted af and I hope that isnt reflected in the way I formulate myself Ive \(20f\) been in a relationship with my first boyfriend \(21m\) for about 2 years now. We're in a loving supportive relationship and I feel very lucky to have him in my life. Here's the thing though, he indirectly triggers my anxiety. I've been anxious about anything and everything for as long as I can remember. And since this is my first relationship and I've had very little experience and I'm so emotionally invested, small things turn into bigger things in my mind and I overthink things beyond the most irrational way of thinking. Im aware of this but I cant stop and it's been affecting me and my relationship badly. Sometimes I fail to even get through the day without overthinking for hours and Im tired of it, I dont want things to affect me this much. On really bad days I question the validity of our relationship. I'll come across a post on reddit \(or the thought will pop up right in my head outta nowhere\) and I begin to question whether he actually cares or what if he's been lying to me or what if he doesn't have any true feelings for me, what about that one time this happened, will it happen again \(this is just the average relationship bickering that i overthink\) etc. You get the point, I think unnecessary unrealistic thoughts. Because I know deep down in my heart that my thoughts are bs, he's shown that he cares and has true feelings for me etc. I have no doubt in that, and atm picturing myself think those things seems so absurd, but at the time of overthinking the feel so real. A bit of background. For the past few months because of our schedules we havent been able to see each other as much. Especially my boyfriend, he had been busier than ever because of exams. I remained supportive of him throughout but I couldnt help but feel neglected and forgotten about. I hate myself for giving in so easily to distance and guarding my feelings by putting up this wall and become cold. I couldve handled it in a better way but because of how anxious I was becoming I decided to ""emotionally uninvest"" for a while. Now its better though. We talked about it and now that he has more time we can ""resume"" the relationship. Im still afraid I might react this way another time if sth similar happens again. And I dont want to do that. To my main problem now. Ive had a lot of time to think when we didnt see each other as much. And I have a scary thought on my mind which I cant quite decipher because my anxiety takes it in all possible directions. So when we first got together I was in a vulnerable spot. In no way was this taken advantage of \(as Im writing this im obsessively thinking ""what if he did take advantage of it"" and taking that to another level even though i know thats not the case, this is so exhausting, screw this\). And now Im scared that what if I only got together because it made me feel good about myself and what if I didnt truly want it. That one is definitely partly true in at least a very small way. And now Im questioning our entire relationship. What if this is only my attachment issues sipping through or do I truly love him and want to be with him? If it did begin because of my low self\-esteem, should I still be in this relationship if I NOW am truly, genuinely, emotionally invested? And what if Im leaning towards the keep\-the\-relationship\-going decision because Im scared of what will happen when we're over? This has been conflicting me for weeks. Im wondering whether this is just my anxiety from the distance acting up or not. Because seeing him happy makes me happy, when hes sad I get sad too. Being the one to make him happy makes me extra happy, and seeing him laugh and have fun brings so much joy to me. And spending time with him is amazing, there's just so much enjoyment involved I love it and there's no doubt in my mind that I love him or cherish this relationship. But at the same time, it turns me into the worst version of myself \(ball of anxiety\) and Im questioning whether I should work on it with a fresh new start or if I can work on it in the relationship, if its even the right thing to remain in it \(vulnerability thing, what if this only feeds my medium\-level self\-esteem\) Also, he knows how Im feeling, Ive talked about this with him. I told him I dont know now where I think the relationship will go and that Im trying to figure it out. He said he wants me to be happy and respects any decision I would make. TL;DR: anxiety triggered by the emotional investment put into a relationship is turning me into my worst self and I dont know what to do about it. I also question whether I should still be in the relationship if it started out with me entering it cause I was vulnerable even if things have changed now. Anxiety's a bitch. Or is it how I truly feel? Idk. Conflicted af. Thank you it anyone who made it this far. I hope you all have a nice day and conquer your anxiety even in the smallest ways. I believe in you all\^\^"

91,vulnerability,Anxiety,ANXIETY,1,8pjwxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8pjwxw/anxiety/,2018-06-08 23:35:05,"Shorter version: I did something impulsive. I am freaking out because I reached out to someone who has deeply hurt me in the past and somehow I expect him to change. I didn't sleep all night. I sent him four messages in a row he has not responded to. I am going to a counselor to manage my obsessive thoughts and relationship/sex/vulnerability issues, and I'm scared that this is not a good idea for me to be in contact with this person. I want to get some sleep but I can't and I have been working very hard to be healthier in my thinking and feel like this is not going to foster that. I told him we could be friends, maybe more, but we had to spend time together first and I'm terrified he will leave and reject me again, or that I'll send him a million more messages out of anxiety that is very deep. So I contacted someone who I have had a bit of a tumultuous relationship with during the past semester. I was very needy and did pressure him a lot. However, he consistently said he wanted to have sex as fwb and it just never worked out (either he was busy or I was, and it was really annoying). He also took advantage of me a few times and asked for a lot of my notes. When I apologized fixed because we had had a texting argument and I was definitely pressuring him to have sex, then he asked for a nude pic which I sent. Today I contacted him once more because I do think I have feelings for him, and I wanted to see if he'd ever speak with me again. We had a wonderful conversation online and he said he wanted to hang out sometime when he got back since he is now out of state. The thing is that he deeply hurt my feelings last semester and I have trouble trusts by him at all. He mentioned nude pics again but then apologized. I don't know if I'm thinking about this as clearly as I should be, but he always shows up for coffee and lunch, and other stuff, if I don't really pressure him a lot. Just not for sex. I think if he actually just wanted to fuck we would have a long time ago. The thing is that I have a long history of being extremely obsessive and controlling and bombarding people with excessive attention when I like them. I did that to him for months and I'm terrified of actually forming a fairly close relationship of any kind with anyone. I'm working through my issues with a counselor, but I'm not sure if this person is a healthy friend that have, and I'm not sure if I am in a healthy enough place to manage myself and not objectify and harass him with two many texts...and it's tough not to be obsessive. My counselor said I didn't need lithium which I had been on; but we are working on changing my thinking patterns. I feel that this person had the unfair responsibility of calming me down and I don't want that to happen again but I am already wide awake sweating profusely because he hadn't texted me back after a long conversation, even though he outright told me he was interested physically at least. Just very scared and confused and maybe unrealistically hopeful? What do you think? I also just get super nervous and extremely flirtatious, and so I'm sure I have given the impression more than once that I am easy, and, honestly, I have been for a long time. Is this a good idea to even consider? I am already freaking out about it and I'm just not sure what to do at all. My counselor has said to stay single until I get myself together, and the lunch wouldn't be for two months, if ever, but I am terrified of being rejected or having it never happen, and I feel like I cannot control my anxiety and obsession right now...and I sent him something very flirty and maybe too forward and I am just overly concerned about what he thinks...He did invite me over for sex and then cancel a lot and he also asked me to bring beer to his room. I just would appreciate a second opinion, and a way to manage my thoughts and urges, and anxiety? Thanks.I said I would be fine with hanging out and then maybe if something more happened that would be okay. I can't shake the feelings of fear I am having. I haven't been able to sleep all night and he hasn't responded. What should I do?"

I've been gone since Wednesday in D.C for my final orchestra field trip. The reason i'm posting this story here is because I've dealt with insecurity in my relationship of about 2 months and have a pretty extensive history of anxiety and depression. &amp;nbsp; The trip was very rocky now that I look back on it. For the past 2 months, I've been able to cope with the stress and anxiety I've been having cause of the vulnerability of being in a relationship. I smoke a good bit of pot to help me sleep at night and I wasn't gonna bring any on the trip so that definitely added to the overall hardship. To cope with this, I got drunk at night (my roomies snuck in some alchy) which resulted with me hungover in the mornings. &amp;nbsp; My girlfriend (ill call her ashley) also has this kinda codependent friend who constantly was getting mad at her, because she was ""all over me"" during the trip. Ashley told me that she would rather spend time with someone who actually makes her feel confident and happy (me i mean) than her friend who holds resentment for me and Ashley while we're together and talks down. It was a struggle and made me feel guilty of their fighting, and thus Ashley being in a sad mood. &amp;nbsp; Basically this added to the overall shaky and mood swingy feel to the trip, but something did happen that was kinda cool. I'm a white boy (bout 5 11) who used to play sports a lot, and I'm pretty fast. While we were waiting for the bus outside a bar type food place, I heard a girl I knew scream (with shrill in her voice) ""Heyyy!"". When i turned to look, she was running after this black dude who stole her phone out of her back pocket. I instantly jumped over this rail and started running after him and he was gaining distance on the girl i knew. It's been a long time since I've played baseball or soccer, so I forgot the feeling of running on adrenaline. I felt like my will power make me stride harder and I started gaining on him. He had turned a corner on a block and was running through the street when he prob noticed I was close because he rounded a parked car, put the phone on the car, and said ""It's there, it's there"". I grabbed it, and yelled ""stupid ass bitch"". After a brief moment the girl caught up and was yelling at the dude. I kinda came back to myself and realized we should just get back to the group, i didnt want this poor girl hurt. I grabbed her and said we should bounce. and thats about it. afterwards, my director pulled me, the girl, and all the shaps aside to get the rundown. apparently, after we got back a shap kinda trailed the pick pocket back to a hotel so we knew where they were. My director said we could press charges but the girl would have to fly back to D.C, so we decided to just focus on getting the drama down and keep the trip going. &amp;nbsp; I know my writing is pretty bad but ive since got back about 2 hours ago, smoked a bowl, took a shower, talked to my parents about getting my immunization stuff for college, drank a cup of coffee, and helped my dad pull some weird vines off our azaleas. Kinda funny, we won yard of the month in our neighborhood which is pretty dope and im probably just gonna play some league and get high. Thank you guys for listening to this."

Most people have experienced this feeling at some point in their lives. This feeling isnt peculiar to individuals who havent achieved much in their lives. The most successful and achieving people in the world have had their own share of this feeling. Theres a lot to say about this topic and the huge impact it has on our emotions, our decisions, and our actions. So I decided to dedicate a number of posts to write about this type of fear and how we can handle it to build a life of true fulfillment and happiness. **The question here why do we feel this way?** There are a number of factors that contribute to and feed this feeling. But in this post I wil focus on an external element that helps generate and grow this fear. Fear of not being good enough could start at a young age as were repeatedly told and taught how to fit in. Were encouraged to think, feel, and behave like others. As we grow older, our vision of ourselves changes and we start to fight back against what we were brought up to. Deep in our hearts we know that what were told isnt working, it isnt making us happy, and it could be the reason for our pain. As human beings we all need love, acceptance, and appreciation. However, the way we try to satisfy these emotional needs is what makes the real difference between a life of joy and contribution and one of misery and pain. Trying to get others love by thinking, and acting in a way that is out of alignment to our true selves creates inner resistance. The mental and emotional war that goes on a deeper level of our existence is what creates most of our pain.. We want to be loved, we try to get love by following others examples, but we end up disappointing ourselves. We buy into the discourse and we follow trends to gain popularity, fame, and wealth. We might achieve success by acting according to whats accepted to be the norm. But, if this role is incongruent with who we truly are, we end up with pain and suffering. So our fear of not being loved and accepted is deeply ingrained in our fear of not being good enough. We all want love, even the ones who act with indifference on the surface, deep inside they are thirsty for deep love and connection. This indifference could be nothing but a mask to hide their fear and vulnerability. In the next post well look into the possible danger of constantly needing others to make us feel good and loved. "
97,vulnerability,Anxiety,Fear of not being good enough Episode 3: Your emotional imprint,14,8at3aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8at3aw/fear_of_not_being_good_enough_episode_3_your/,2018-04-09 07:13:12," Sometimes our attempts to get others love arent successful for different reasons. One of the very common is missing the skill of effective communication with those you seek their love. When one of our relationships isnt working and were in such a bad need for the love we used to get from this relationship, we might associate pain to seeking this kind of relationship. We might even take a step further to associating pain to seeking love in general. In this case we indulge ourselves in an unhealthy emotion that we use as an alternative for the love that we cant get from others. This emotion may vary from a person to another depending on the persons core values and most essential need s/he tries to satisfy. For example, a person attempts to have a relationship, s/he tries for a couple of times but things dont work out. This person then might form a belief that s/he doesnt have what it takes to be in a happy loving relationship. Before long this person gets depressed as the future sounds so lonely and depressing like the present. Depression becomes the new channel to get love and connection with oneself (and possibly from others). This depression cycle could take the form of one or two repeated emotional patterns. Usually anger and sadness are very common because each of them satisfy a certain human need. The important point here for you here is to find out whats your emotional imprint that you use when youre afraid and not getting the love you need from others or from yourself in a healthy way. The next step is to find out what triggers this emotional imprint and puts it to work. For me I knew that my depression, which shaped in cycles of anger and sadness was triggered mainly by comparison. I used to try to be as good as others in an area that I wasnt genuinely interested in. But when I wasnt that successful, I fell into the trap of feeling not good enough to be loved. Then I used my depression to stay connected with myself because I was too embarrassed to admit to others that Im not good enough. I also used my depression to hide my fear and vulnerability to look strong infant of others. So my invitation to you is to spend some time exploring and finding out what your emotional imprint is because this is your first step towards stepping out of the not enough game. The next post will cover how you could breakthrough the fear of not being good enough. "

I wasn't actually diagnosed or on medication until my mid-20's, with various ups and downs. I'm more often than not pretty stable in my life; I work a lot, I have good friends I hang out with a lot and go places with, and I moved twice in one year with little incident. (I was sleepless and panicky, but I did some research and it is a common problem when people first move into a new place). There is one major area that still sets off my anxiety full force, regardless of medication or mental preparation: being around members of the opposite sex. Like, recently I got back in contact with someone I knew a long time ago. Ended up meeting up and I was a wreck. All my old anxiety symptoms manifested again I became a teenage boy again. Consciously I'm not even interested in her romantically, but I fear rejection and ridicule and vulnerability so much I panic. I tried controlling my breathing which helped, but when I stopped focusing on that I immediately went back into fight or flight mode. Basically, has anyone experienced similar and figured out how to work through it? I really don't want to up my dosage medication wise, but that would be a last resort. Thanks for reading. "
100,vulnerability,Anxiety,Anyone else have a bad and unproductive attitude toward coping mechanisms?,1,7n6nwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7n6nwi/anyone_else_have_a_bad_and_unproductive_attitude/,2017-12-31 16:00:35,"Okay, so what I mean is, I have a therapist. Great guy, I love him, but sometimes he suggests that I think about something in a different frame work so I don't feel anxious about it, and for whatever reason I naturally resist that? I'm having a hard time coming up with an example, but his suggestion of rewording it so as not to provoke anxiety feels somewhat ingenue to me. Or perhaps, an example of something similar: a common coping mechanism I see on social media goes something along the lines of: ""Name 5 things you can see, four things you can hear, three things you can taste, two things you can smell, one thing you can touch."" And ya know, I bet that has helped *a lot* of people calm down in times of stress. And I am happy it has done that. But if someone were to tell me to do that? My first thoughts would be ""screw you, I know you're trying to distract me, that isn't going to make it go away. You can't swoop me into some safe illusion."" Or like he loves to talk about ""The Power of Vulnerability,"" which yes, vulnerability IS powerful, but I can't take that phrase seriously. I'd feel like an asshole. Is anyone else like this? Or did anyone else used to be like this and then stopped? I would like to not be like this. I guess it's skepticism? Or pessimism? Something. But it's annoying because I would love to be able to cool my anxiety, but all the anxiety cooling tricks that I would never judge anyone else for using for some reason seem silly when suggested for my personal use.

It's been a while. Like, a *long* while, and I felt that I had made all this growth while on my own, and I *did*, but just not in the context of relationships. I'm in a relationship now, a really new one, and I just feel so lost. I'm scared he won't understand my anxiety (it's been mentioned, but not deeply discussed). I'm scared I'll go back to old behaviors. I used to disconnect from my partners when I was anxious. My anxiety made me believe they wouldn't want to help me. They wouldn't want to deal with me. I was just a problem. Etc. So instead, I'd play stupid games: not respond to their texts just to see if they cared or if they missed me because I craved validation but it hurt too much to ask. Last night, in a moment of drunken vulnerability, I asked my boyfriend if he thought I was beautiful. He had been calling me cute, and I needed to make sure. I felt so stupid afterwards because the answer was a resounding yes, but I was scared. Anxiety took a compliment and turned it into this horrible thing: ""He only thinks you're cute, and that's not good enough. This won't last. Nobody wants to date someone who's just 'cute'."" This is partially venting, I guess, because I don't know anyone else with anxiety I could talk to who would understand. I'm not seeing my therapist for another 2 weeks. I just don't know what to do. I don't want to ruin things because of this. It's like that's anxiety's goal sometimes, ruin everything and keep me locked away in my room forever. If anyone can offer any advice or...anything, it would be much appreciated. Hope you're all doing well &lt;3"

I'm not sure if better or manageable are the right word, but I have seen an improvement in my life over the past year. The problem is that I'm now 27 years old. I have had little to no improvement in my depression that I've had since I was around 11. I had treatments, therapists and medications that did more harm than good. I have used poor coping mechanisms like dissociating and over eating. Last year I lost 30 lbs and I continue to reach my goal weight. But the problem is that I have had depression for so long that it's like Rip Van Winkle trying to reenter the world. I have barely dated for my age, I had to learn how to do things like apply makeup and go on dates. And dealing with the shame of learning things so late in life doesn't make anything an easier, especially since women are supposed to be (born?) experts at self presentation, social cues and dealing with the opposite sex. The inexperience from being closed off for so long makes wanting to return to my unhealthy habits more appealing than contending with the constant vulnerability, pain, shame and anxiety of being found out. I feel like anxiety is almost supplanting the depression that I've struggled with in the first place. Everything beyond 'recovering' basic functioning feels artificial to me. Like because I had such severe depression for most of my life, I can never know what my personality would have been, mental faculties, social life, etc. I still struggle to be open socially knowing that even if my relationships deepen, I will eventually have to account for the ""dead space"" that makes up when I graduated from college until now. I deal with the social anxiety and shame being around my peers who are so at ease in the world that I spent most of my life trying to avoid. It makes the redescent seem easier and sometimes more alluring than continuing to struggle to improve. I have had a hard time dating and trying to seem normal enough to be intimate - I'm aware that being a virgin is cute only up to a certain point, and I feel like for the first time in my life I don't feel tremendous shame attempting to see myself as a sexual person. But dealing with the ""timelines"" makes things difficult and makes me feel like I will always have less romantic options, because on top of those who don't want me because of my age or physical preferences, I would have to also filter out those who don't want to deal with how weird my past is. It makes hiding my past more awkward because I have to contend with people assuming I have something dubious to hide, and in a way I do. I don't know where to go socially or if I even deserve to make any romantic attempts at all. Trying to reenter normal life is much harder for someone like me than the people who have depressive episodes, because there was never a 'me' before depression. All the resources on the Internet RE: reentry are for people who knew who they were in the first place and knew something is wrong. A few days ago someone told me about a documentary featuring a formerly blind person whose sight is restored via modern surgery, and how they actually wished they could return to blindness because the sudden onslaught of being sighted, coupled with the sudden requirement to learn depth perception as an adult (versus when the sighted learn it in early childhood and infancy) was incredibly overwhelming. Nothing could do a better job of describing my ""recovery""? from depression, or make me more doubtful. Recovery has meant that I regained a piece of my life back. But the life that I regained I'm not sure what to do with, or even what I'm allowed seeing as my past is so undesirable. I don't know what to do with myself or even what is reasonable to hope for or strive for as a woman my age with so little under her belt and so little to offer, and I don't know what to do. "

A lot of it is life-story type stuff that seems inconsequential to Ergophobia, but bear with me. I'm still trying to figure all this out, and I'm realizing each day just how much this has infected my life. As a result, I won't fault you if you just read this: **The TL;DR Version:** - My personal story of ergophobia doesn't link to one area of my life, but infects all aspects of it. The root cause is my life history, which is long and disastrous for 25 years and not something to get into over an impersonal venue. Everything I want to do, I cannot do it if it involves 'work', 'responsibility', 'expectations', or any sort of reasonable 'adult-stuff' including but not limited to: washing dishes, cleaning house, keeping up my hygiene, writing these novels that have been stuck up in my head for more years than I care to count, transitioning (being transgender), getting or keeping a job, applying for jobs, going shopping, doing laundry... It's exhausting. And I just don't know what to do about it. Blame the formatting on me being an aspiring author and trying to make this an interesting read. **Discussion Primer, or: Me explaining why I'm explaining this.** - ""I'm running on four hours of sub-par sleep and this anxiety is starting to make my breath smell terrible and mouth taste awful. Yes, anxiety can do that. I need a place to explain what's going on... Hey, what about reddit?"" As I'm a first-time poster, I'm going to be open with my feelings. I'm already in a state of vulnerability for future events that has kept me from getting quality sleep, so it's not like opening myself up to a welcoming and understanding community is going to make anything worse. I feel like this is going to be terribly misunderstood, I feel that I will be judged, and more than anything I feel that I will screw up. But I also know these are irrational fears with no logical basis. For a mind such as mine, that's a frustrating conclusion that creates a toxic loop of 'Why do I feel this way? Can I please just stop feeling this way?' which I'm certain many of you can relate to, and is the secondary reason why I'm posting today after feeling a desperate need to reach out. The primary reason is because, tomorrow, I have to approach an individual whom has effectively offered me the perfect (for now) job. And yet, my crippling anxiety that infects every aspect of my life makes it feel like it's impossible to say yes. **Discussion of Ergophobia History, or: What is the cause of my anxiety?** - ""Where did it all begin? What is the root cause of my anxiety? I've been trying to figure that out for the past four years. It's a complicated web of intricate events in my life that have weaved me into the person I am today."" So, I have Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Not recognized by the DSM, but it is what it is. I don't have General Anxiety Disorder, but I might as well given how much of my life this disorder infects. I do have some degree of Social Anxiety Disorder and a modest degree of Agoraphobia. But what I *really* have is Ergophobia. I wish I could say I knew where it started. At what point in my life did it really start hitting me hard? My coping mechanism of choice has always been distraction tactics, and video games have provided the best and worst possible outlet for that part of me. I keep my mind active, I'm not afraid of learning, but, to all of my memories... - I'd always hated homework, but was it because of my ergophobia? I can't really say. Perhaps due to the incessant bullying, and my constant moving around, or maybe losing access to all my school records and redoing school year material from before in a school that was teaching at a slower pace? - I have 'friends', but no real friends who I hang out with regularly except on the internet. Being abandoned by your entire friend group for graduating high school early tends to do that to a person. But I met and kept a few from college. Mostly. - I've always had difficulties doing house work or home chores. (""What kid hasn't?"" my mind says. Normal kids don't get fearful of doing chores.) To some degree I can blame my grandmother for this. She demanded an unreasonable level of perfection and became verbally abusive when I didn't reach it, and non-approval when I did. But the roots of it have been there for longer. - College was terrible. I'm awful at homework in the first place, I hate doing it, and college's teaching style did not suit my learning style even beyond my growing phobias. That I was failing only made it worse. ""I'm an intelligent human being, damn it. I'm more than capable of getting these things. So why am I doing so badly at keeping up my grades?"" - Getting A's and B's in school despite this, due to a heavier focus on testing for grades and catching up on homework while in school, but D's and F's in a strange and arbitrary 'behavior' category from awful teachers who hated me for being socially inept. - I have brief memories of being a mostly-functioning human youth. Doing a lemonade stand to earn enough money for a toy that I broke within a month... Actually, nevermind. No. I just realized that wasn't a good thing for my psyche in the end. - Being *really good at writing* and then your college writing teacher recognizing that you're better than them and becoming overly critical of your work. Yeah. That was when I left college. - Working for one day. I mean, I'd volunteered before (barely able to do so, never wanting to go, not recognizing I was always on the verge of a panic attack), but this was an actual job at a packaging company. I was good at it, I was fast, I was ready to do my part for the machine! I turned off my brain for a bit and went to work. Then I came home and realized I would have to go back and do this again. And again. And again. And again. At least until my job was replaced by a robot, since this company was being ornery and refusing to automate for now. *Then* I panicked. - SSI refusing to accept my disability. Yes, SSI, I'm physically and mentally capable of working. No, I cannot keep a job. Please stop putting me through these stupid, annoying hoops. I can only hope the judge sees the validity in my claim, but I can't bring myself to get representation. I'd need someone else to do it for me... That's how crippling this is. All that aside, I'm left with a rather particularly... annoying, and strange, and counter-intuitive event in my life. **Discussion of Ergophobia, or: What's going on with me right now?** - ""I have a job offer! Y-yay! I... Oh god, I have a job offer..."" *Whew*. Still with me? Alright. Thanks for sticking through it for this long. Because that was just up to my 20th birthday. I'm 25. I'm an *adult* For the past 5 years or so, other than college and a few hiccups of stressful-ness, my life's been pretty stable. At least until recently. I had an individual offer me a job, point blank working around the rules established by the sign on the door, giving me the opportunity of a lifetime (from my perspective). It's a job flipping burgers. Yes, you read that right. But not like you think. Less 'Mcdonalds', more ""Quality, fresh baked buns, toasted with butter and without mayo or mustard. High-quality ingredients. Locally sourced produce and beef. Locally owned and operated. Not a franchise."" It's not fast food. It's good, wholesome, quality comfort food. I've been going to this place for the past four years. It's changed owners a couple times, but it's a special place to me. Now, my wife is worried (yes, I'm married) that this event will keep me from going there ever again. It won't... But I can't deny that it wouldn't take me some time to get past my anxiety. The job is 3 hours long, five days a week. I'd mostly be managing the till, but also working in the back making burgers for hungry customers. Standard stuff for a small business, as the place is almost always managed by two people. The manager, the one who soft-offered me the job, has their own anxiety disorders that makes it difficult for them as well, so they can relate. Many of the people that work there have there own anxieties or life inhibitors. The hours are flexible, the people understanding, the situation all but ideal for me to work under, and I'd get to say ""hey, I have a job now! I'm a respectable human being! (To the rest of society, anyway)"". Now, here's the cyclic emotional beating I'm going under: - I start by thinking to myself, hey, I can do this! This is perfect and ideal. - I then start panicking. I can feel it in my shoulders, tensing up my chest, my heart rate rises, I start keeping exits in mind... - Suddenly, I'm not so sure I can do it. - Then I'm *really* not sure I can do it. I cannot do it. I absolutely cannot. I have to say no and get away. - But... I really want to do it. I *want* to work. Especially at a place like this. - So I calm myself down. Deep breaths. Distract myself a bit. Relax. It'll be alright. Irrational fear is irrational. - Then I start thinking to myself, hey, I can do this! This is perfect and ideal... I've gone through this with my writing. The writing is what I want my career to be. I've *three* multi-book novels wanting to be written. I'm a good writer. My dialogue is fantastic, my description and scene setting could use some work though. But this disorder cripples me in every aspect of my life. - I love to cook, and yet I hate doing dishes and can't cook on the regular. - I enjoy socializing and kinda need it from time to time, but the only friends I can really keep and maintain are those who are online since I'm always at my computer. - I like a clean house, and yet cleaning triggers my anxiety. I have to take it slow, and piece it out. - I'd like to be able to transition, since I'm transgender. I wonder how much of my fear infects that, as well. - I want to better the quality of my life at some point in my existence. I'd like to have a biological kid of my own, and adopt another. Yet I also want to be a functioning human being. But I'm stuck in this endless loop of fear... Therapy is getting to this troubling point of not helping and also triggering my panic. I'm a progress person, I like making progress and I really hate feeling like I'm not making any progress, and right now that's what I feel. I don't know if I can tolerate another attempt at going through SSI if the judge dismisses my case. And overall, I'm just getting tired again. Which means I'm getting depressed and anxious. Life was good for a bit. Then the anxiety crippled me. I'm really getting tired of that. I honestly don't know if I could face the fear of working if I was forced to, and I don't have a single clue as to what to do to really make any effective progress on these things. I'm supposed to be writing a page a day of just absolutely nothing as a writing exercise (part of therapy), but I can't even bring myself to start it. And I also recognize that this will pass, in time. It's just hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel when the tunnel is years long."

I have a really hard time expressing this to my SO because I think it's an extreme vulnerability that can be easily taken advantage of so I prefer to just bite my tongue if I feel like I'm about to say something nasty. The main issue here is that my SO is extremely outgoing and willing to make friends. Now this really nice and I'm genuinely happy for her but sometimes her approaching method could easily be confused for flirting. I'm not very experienced when it comes to this and I realize just typing this post might make me seem like a paranoid fuck but this exactly how I've been feeling recently.

I struggled with severe anxiety for about 4 years after my parents' divorce. This also coincided with starting college. I struggled to pay attention in class, relax around all the new people I was meeting, and I lacked a general feeling of comfort for years. I sought help early on and worked through this time, but have had a fear of the feeling of intense anxiety ever since. Fast forward 6ish years, and the anxiety is back in what feels like a different form. My job is chaotic. I have a lot of responsibility that I'm not entirely sure I'm prepared for, and I'm in a leadership role that requires me to speak in front of groups fairly frequently. Not something I love, but something I can do when I'm comfortable and less anxious. In the past 2-3 weeks my anxiety has grown exponentially. I found myself waking up for 2-3 hours a night for a week straight, which is very unusual for me. I was thinking about work. Last week I had 2 panic attacks in the middle of speaking and had to make an excuse to leave the meeting. I had another one today, and left a meeting before I had to speak. The panic attacks are the worst because I don't feel like I can breathe my way out of them, and they always happen right when I need to be present. I have a hard time predicting them, and they throw me for a while afterward. It's so challenging to pinpoint what about my work and life right now has caused the change. There have been a lot of changes in my job and life, which I'm sure contribute. My natural responses are to leave, or just stop moving entirely, neither of which are helping (surprise!). I'm not sure how to handle this at work. I have a hard time showing any vulnerability to the people I work with. Our work is tough right now and I don't want to add to anyone else's stress. But, I know that if I keep putting on a happy face and ignoring the struggle my body will revolt even if my brain says to keep going. I can't stand the embarrassment of having to walk out of another meeting, or the feeling of failure that goes along with leaving or not being able to communicate with my team(s) clearly. I made an appointment with a psychologist, it's a couple weeks away, and I told someone in our HR department. How do you handle intense panic at work? Do you tell others around you? How do you balance the need to take a break with the constant demands of a work environment? WHAT do I do now? Thanks for any advice you may have, and good luck in your own personal journeys. "

If vulnerability manifested itself as a feeling, its crawling up and down my spine right now. I've been doing lots of reflection on my anxiety. My brother physically, mentally, emotionally, verbally, even sexually abused me all throughout my life. I'm 21 years old safe studying abroad away from my family, giving me space to think alone. He called me fat-ass every chance he got, making me feel like I wanted to chop off my skin to look skinny. He convinced me at a tender age before 10 that I was autistic out of his own disdain for the fact that I existed. He made me suck his dick when I was in grade school. He made me lick my own shit out of the toilet. He'd punch me in the face, grab me by the throat and throw me down to the ground, push me around, jolted me by clenching his fists and throwing his aggressive anger into my face every second he could, the way bullies try and threaten their way into their own sense of self-esteem. I felt safest either when he wasn't around or when the beating he gave me didn't involve physical hitting. He coupled this abuse with the threat of ""resetting the game,"" a threat he used to get me to do what he wanted because of how much he knew I really enjoyed playing video games with him, even though I could only remember a couple of real times I actually felt like I was playing with him before he'd get angry. I wanted his love so badly that I put up with this abuse. There were times where I hid behind my mother who I thought could protect me, but she was interested in nothing other than my grades. She had no idea I was in so much danger. I don't think older-brother figures exist in psychology. Truth is I didn't need him to love me. I could have easily fought back if i had the defense of my father. But I can't say he was one to even know how to protect himself. I didn't know him. I couldn't. I looked into his face and saw a stranger every single time. He tried to ""love"" me but the only things that ever came out of his mouth or eyes was fake. He had a dangerously dark aura about him. As if he was an evil monster. He seemed like he had absolutely no idea how to cue into someone or control his rage if he ever let it out. He seemed like a person who could genuinely kill me. No empathy. Just darkness. Odd thing is he tried to ""love"" me by pretty much treating me like a fucking girl. The fucking bullshit words that came out of his fucking mouth was all fucking belittling and disgusting. The way he faked smile. The way he only saw me as a little boy instead who I was. He had no idea who I was or how terribly insecure his treatment of me made me feel. He was an awful awful awful man. He was a fucking monster. He either belittled me or showed his true unrelenting unhinged anger that had no regard for who it was aimed at. My dad also cheated on my mom and abandoned us all for a couple years to live in a foreign country without ever telling us what he was doing. But my psychopathic mother stayed with him because she feels too guilty to leave him. Like the only thing she knows about happiness is how to unbearably stay with a detrimental spouse no matter how much it hurts. My whole family is fucking twisted. And goddamn it I want to undo the damage and the fear from all of it. Goddamnit my fucking father. He terrifies me. He makes me feel like a failure inside. Also another thing he does. I wrote an angry letter to him expressing how upset I was over how it seemed like he favored my brother over me. He keeps it as a fucking momento, like a fucking souvenir. The belittling nature of his unrelenting ignorance towards the passionate feelings I express and used to express as a kid scares the shit out of me and makes me feel like a failure inside. Also, how could parents make such emotional distance and uncertainty within a family for a kid to need to write out his true feelings in a letter instead of just feeling safe enough to say it to their face? Goddamnit, I need more therapy. I feel like I've found the deepest and most hidden source of my anxiety and depression. My father's terrifying psychopathy. He almost killed himself around my age too btw and never got help. Makes psychological sense he'd seem like a deadly monster to a kid."

I've gone from analyzing my emotionally abandoning and verbally abusive mother to my extremely abusive terrorizing brother, and now finally to my disgustingly abusive father. He raped me. He fondled my genitals, flashed me way more times then I needed, and possibly even fucking probed me. I've been feeling incredibly incredibly lost today. While at the gym, I felt an incredible helplessness bring me to my knees emotionally. It began with thoughts of how my father sexually abused me and how I've always been able to sense this emotional capacity for murder he had. Again, he was suicidal at one point in his life and never got help so if he could have murdered himself, there was nothing stopping him from murdering me. At the youngest age I know, I remember him fondling me, taking baths with me but feeling helpless and scared. I remember feeling concerned how often I saw his penis. As I grew older, I began to feel incredibly belittled and angry at how much he treated me like a girl. He never got angry, but when he did it tamped me down into a crumbling ball of vulnerability and victimization that I'd do whatever he wished. It was a fear for my life. Fathers shouldn't make children feel that way. This feeling of helplessness brought me the idea of homosexuality and who I am. Whether I'm gay or not. It was an incredibly fearful time having to think through this because at some points, I leaned so far to the answer ""yes"" but when I did, I felt abused and vulnerability like at any minute, my father would rape me again. I wouldn't accept that I was gay because I knew if I was, it was out of fear to become the person my father wouldn't kill. I thought of the questions I had in high school and in middle school, and I swear it's from the same source. I know homosexuality is no where near an identity, rather it's a mere sexual preference. I know accepting that you are gay wouldn't do anything other than lift your confidence and help you to feel impervious to fear rather than making you succumb to it if it was correct. Gay isn't a personality either. The more effeminate I thought I needed to be was only motivated by my father and his willingness to kill me rather than a biological skew in sexual preference. Femininity is just societal. It's a learned personality trait that's not designed into human beings upon birth. Never biological. So if there was any reason I had it, it was only because I was scared into it by my sexually abusive father who wanted a daughter rather than me. I know I can own this world I live in. I know I can truly own myself too and be who I truly am without fear crushing down on my sense of safety. I know I can feel bigger than anyone. I know I can love myself to my fullest capacity. I know I can love others to my fullest capacity as well. I'm tired of feeling fucking lost. I want myself back. Fucking damnit. This feeling of helplessness. I know it's all a lie. I want myself back. I want to know myself. "

This stuff is so ridiculous, yet tends to loop over and over in my mind, to the point where it's hard to be in the moment and just live without thinking about how I am perceiving my current surroundings in some weird fashion. This happens even more often in unfamiliar places, so I like to keep most of my life in a bubble of space. All medications thus far, except for sedatives, have had little effect. These thoughts often lead to feelings of panic/terror, which I can sometimes distract myself from before they start to cause physical symptoms. I have agoraphobia to some extent, which is often triggered by cities (unfamiliarity combined with huge buildings, giving me a feeling of vulnerability in all the open space and beyond). As such, I don't go into the city unless very necessary. I'm sick of all this. The only reason I am able to prevent this from getting worse is by constantly exposing myself, but it never is comfortable, and doesn't even get a whole lot more comfortable over time. One step forward, 2 back. Does anyone else have similar thoughts/feelings? This type of anxiety is extremely hard to combat through traditional cognitive techniques. "

You'll try to interrupt me or tune me out because what I'm saying is too painful to hear because you KNOW it's the truth - it's YOUR truth. Somewhere along the way you've been hurt, probably multiple times and perhaps so deeply it gnawed at your very core and led you to question everything you thought you were. And it fucking hurt. You've been told, ""You're a disappointment, you're too sensitive, grow up, be a man, don't be a pussy, quit being so emotional and stop acting like a child."" In so many words you were told that **you aren't enough**. All you craved was to be loved. But over and over, you perceived subtle messages from those you tried to impress that you are empty - that you are worth nothing. You learned that you had prove your worth to receive love, to survive. So what did you do? You believed the lies and tried to prove them wrong. You're whole life you've been collecting a pedigree, accolades, achievements, trophies and gold stars that you can point to when your worth is questioned. ""But look what I've done!,"" you exclaim, ""I AM good enough!"" You remember the pain you once felt and vowed not to let others hurt you the way you have been before. So you hide behind a veneer that projects toughness and authority, to prove to others that you ARE strong and HAVE worth because deep down you still believe **you aren't enough**. Careful though, when an unsuspecting person stumbles over a fault in your armor, it doesn't take much before the whole faade shatters away. Underneath lie you're ugliest, deepest, insecurities - like boiling red lava, throbbing, and lashing out to burn anyone who happens to be in it's wake. You feel powerless exposed without your shell, so you lash out in anger at anyone who dares to expose what you really are - a **fraud.** You've been bitten. And now you're infected with emotional venom that swirls through your veins but you were never allowed the opportunity to find healing, find the antidote because to be healed implies you're sick and ""GOD FUCKING DAMNIT I am not SICK, I am FINE"" you say, And yet you feel **you still aren't enough**. You're enraged that you're **powerless** trapped by expectations that were designed from their inception for you to fail. Yet you are silent. Because you've been silenced. You've been told that not being able to control your emotions is only yet. another. failure. So you go through the motions of life. And every so often, when the lull/threat of boredom creeps up and the disapproving whispers from your past gain purchase in your mind they reverberate louder and louder inside your own skull and you just want them to please SHUT UP but you know you can't escape. You're a captive to demons who gnaw at your core if your mind stays empty for too long. So what do you do? You try to silence them by giving them what they want - by proving that you're in control. But it's only an illusion. When you don't FEEL like you're in control the only way to believe the illusion that you are is by comparison. You prey upon someone else's moment of weakness, of vulnerability. These moments present themselves most easily in the form of ""loved ones,"" - those who have lowered their guard and trusted you to love and respect us for the same in return. Someone like me. You toy with my deepest insecurities (that I entrusted to you), like a cat toys with a terrified mouse before swallowing it whole. You KNOW you inflict pain on your victim, it is your intention. It's a vindictive, twisted GAME for you, it's cathartic to torture. You thrive on this **POWER and CONTROL** - the two things you've lusted for your whole life. When I yelp out in distress and cry uncle you punish me by telling me, ""You're too sensitive, you can't take a joke, are you on your period or something?"" which conveys that my emotions are flawed. Emotions, which are at the core of my humanness. Therefore, I'm flawed. You feel vindicated because if you're flawed well then at least so am I. Silly girl, she's emotional and can't control her feelings and I'm strong because she is weak. Of course, you're careful of pushing me too hard for fear that I might realize I am worth more than a pawn in your insecurity-fueled game. You fear that one day I might decide I've had enough. It's a slow process of testing your limits, testing mine. Because you know people like me are the ones that enable this kind of behavior. If you were to dare attempt this on someone who wasn't so invested in you, you know they would ~~walk~~ run away without so much as a backward glance. I'm exhausted from having my insecurities manipulated just to provide you with a false sense of worth, all the while wondering, what's wrong with me? I'm angry that you would take advantage of my trust and love for you and push boundaries simply because you think I'm too weak to stand up for myself - that I'll always be here to serve as your emotional fodder.

I wanted to go and do so much. but I was always instilled that I MUST DO THIS in order to be a member of society and that basically my personal desires were stupid.

It started around this time last year when I dropped out of college ( I'm back in college now), where I would stay in bed till the afternoon after falling asleep at about 4am, all my nights would consist of was going out and smoking weed with my friends, this was a daily think and I participated in this for the most part of a year, it has only been the last 1/2 months in which I have stopped. The reason I had to stop was because I was starting to experience awful feelings when high, I would be extremely self analytical, I would get paranoid thoughts and myself esteem would drop completely. I couldn't hold a conversation with my friends when out with them because my mind would run wild with negative thoughts. I have now realised my vulnerability to picking up a serious mental health problem because it is in my family, at the time that's what I thought I triggered after smoking that joint it would often lead me to thinking about things I have done wrong and later thoughts of how I need to improve my life would emerge. The intensity of this would leave when I was no longer high but feeling of anxiety still remain and also paranoid thoughts still come to my head. Not extreme paranoid thoughts but still things I know I never used to think about. I often scare myself with thoughts of developing a mental health illness. After stopping things are slowly and slightly getting better but I am still experiencing these feeing often, I feel asif I think about it far too much. My sense of humour has almost completely deteriorated and I am often socially awkward around people and sometimes get unwanted thoughts, as well as this I have started to care extremely about what others think of me. I just want to be myself again! Many articles say these affects may be present for a few months after quitting weed if you were smoking it everyday. I just want to know is it likely I will find myself in a totally normal state again if I adopt a healthy lifestyle by partaking in regular exercise, a correct intake of nutrients (eating and drinking healthy), getting the correct amounts of sleep and picking up proactive habits such as reading and avoiding any substances which may antagonise these harsh feelings. Could applying factors such as these in my life in a positive manor reduce or even cause these anxious and paranoid thoughts to subside. Thank you if you were patient enough to read all of that and if you have any advice you can give me I would be very grateful!

I am a 15 year old IGCSE's high school student, I have upcoming external exams soon in May. I had and still have social anxiety issues for as long as I still breath. (I am socially awkward as well) That's not the point though, that's some background. I'm going to try to keep this short. I joined the gym/a Muai Thai club and my classmates there are very supportive (they're all older than me, high school seniors, 20 year olds and 30 year olds), it's helped calm down my anxiety as the community there is more accepting and lenient towards me as compared to school, public places or with acquaintances. Although that's helping, I'm continuously pressured daily. I give no fucks about anyone at school, I don't pay attention to them in the corridors, in the mornings I just shake my hands with classmates and acquaintances and remain quiet the rest of the day. I keep feeling I'm going to fall or die for some reason, I'm not sick, just something in my head that stirs up fear whenever a conversation is presented to me. Moreover, there's this usual teenage bullshit gossip around the school, sometimes I overhear people trying to make up rumors at me as they've done before in the past, and it keeps adding pressure and fear. For some reason, EVERY fucking girl thinks I'm dreaming about her (I was told narcissism among girls is common at this age, I get pissed off a lot about it). Afterwards they continue on saying ""EEWWWW YUCK!"" And start laughing, they hate me despite not knowing them (I say hate, because whenever I pass by in a conversation between a group, they go quiet, and try to go away like I'm some type of pedophile). I take care of my hygiene and put deodorant usually because I don't sweat as much as people would think a 15 yo teen would. I don't stink because I shower very regularly and put cologne on and as I said before, usually put deodorant as there are sometimes I forget (in a hurry for example or something). This group has always been the same since 7th grade, 3 years later nothing's changed despite not knowing who they are (on a personal level or whatever, we only know each other's names, as some of them have been my classmates previously) I am a respectable, polite human being who values morals and good will. Yet I do not understand why girls would do this to me, I pay zero attention to them, I'm an average looking guy 5/10 or a 6/10, so I doubt it's to grab my attention. Not only is it them but also the boys, yesterday after shaking hands with one, he quickly goes on to tell his friend I'm a garbage back, the last semester I've been called ""A useless pile of shit that has no purpose in life"" by another guy multiple times over the semester. I don't understand wtf is wrong with people, I'm scared shitless that my anxiety might be showing up, because if it does it would show vulnerability and that would allow them to do more creative shit with me. (Non contact things, if it was contact I'd figure I can win, I'm no longer bullied like I'm 10 or something) Here are some examples on rumors:- ""Picture taken of me looking at a teacher's ass"" ""Bisexual horny cunt"" ""Liking multiple girls at once"" and this gives them all an ego boost on the social hierarchy thing, idk, they keep gossiping whenever I pass by them, or didnanything (literally), like moving seats, looking in their direction (friend is next to them for example and I'm waving at him), talk to a teacher ""OH HES JUST DOING THIS SO HE CAN GET NEAR ME EWWWW"" ""Using condoms to fuck whores and looking around to play around"" Along with many other things that I don't know of, but these were the ones I heard about me by multiple people, at least the most popular. It's not like anyone gives a shit about me, they just seem to hate me when I remind them of my existence (seeing me in the hall, recess or class) I don't get why this stuff would be said about me, fuck these people.

By Edmund J. Bourne, PH.D.** **Personal Background of Anxiety:** *Reading this is not required to help with your anxiety* *Current Age: 20* I'm professionally diagnosed with: Agoraphobia (related to frequent urge to urinate,) OCD (checker,) Manic-Depressive Disorder (Bi-Polar but Manic majority of the time,) and ADHD. The medications I am on are: Lamotrigine (mood stabilizers) 50mg twice a day, Adderall 30mg once in morning, and Quetiapine (for bi-polar) 150mg once at night. I began using drugs at the age of 13 and lived with my girlfriend from the age of 14-16. From the age of 15 I began heavily using drugs because my girlfriend and I would argue all day and I needed an escape goat. November 22nd 2012 I lost my girlfriend, all my friends, and got clean. I used Alcohol to self-medicate for a 9 month bender, after which I developed a *panic disorder.* 3 Years ago I was physically trapped in a situation where I could not urinate. I then felt the urge to urinate every time I left the house, so I isolated myself inside for 3 years. This allowed the agoraphobia to develop. **Actual Anxiety Help:** **Avoidance of Phobic Situations:** As long as a situation of any kind is avoided the worry and fear of not being able to handle it will increase. *Example:* Associating the urge to urinate with the accessibility of a washroom will increase the likelihood of avoiding washroom-less situations. This increases the urge to urinate when away from a washroom. **Anxious Self-Talk:** Negative thoughts that promote worrying, avoidance, dissuasion, fear, belittlement, and losing control will increase *physical and mental* symptoms of panic attacks and anxiety. *Example:* 1.) Planning on where or when to use the next washroom promotes worrying. (Wait until the urge is unbearable to start wondering where the washroom is.) 2.) Thinking of uncontrollably urinating promotes negative self-talk. *Stopping Negative/Anxious Self-Talk is very difficult and should be further looked into, or try mindfulness meditation.* **Mistaken Beliefs:** Views on ""the way the world is,"" others, and one's self, *in a negative light,* increase anxious self-talk and general anxiety. *Example:* 1.) Believing that one's self has to adhere to a specific genders average urinary breaks per day promotes a negative self-view. 2.) Believing that others are judging one's self for frequency of urination promotes a negative self-view. 3.) Believing the urge to urinate is the same as urinating uncontrollably promotes a negative self-view. **Withheld Feelings:** Denying feelings and emotions of any kind may contribute to a state of *free-floating anxiety.* This includes suppressing negative memories and not addressing your repressed negative memories. *Emotional social support is key to improving on one's anxiety.* *Example:* Not sharing the information of one's urge to urinate when experiencing anxiety, with one's family and peers, promotes the negative growth of one's condition. **Lack of Assertiveness:** In order to express one's feelings and emotions requires a level of confident communication with others. *Example:* Saying ""I need to go to the washroom because I'm anxious,"" rather than saying ""I need to go to the washroom."" **Lack of Self-Nurturing Skills:* The inability to love, care for, calm or relax, accept, and comfort one's self when feeling overwhelmed, depressed, anxious, or angry increases general stress and anxiety. *Example:* Not being able to accept one's frequency of washroom breaks, or calm one's self during an intense urge to urinate, increases cumulative and acute stress. *Stress promotes negative growth of anxiety.* **Muscle Tension:** Tense muscles restrict one's breathing. Restricted or shallow breathing increase panic/anxiety. Tense muscles also may allow one's mind to race, or may help keep one's feelings suppressed. *Example:* 1.) Bladder massages may reduce stress on the urinary track. 2.) Breathing exercises may reduce moments of intense panic or anxiety. **Stimulants and Other Dietary Factors:** Caffeine and Nicotine may increase anxiety and the rate of panic attacks. Sugar, food additives, and deficiency in minerals or vitamins may also increase anxiety. *Examples:* Food dyes may irritate the bladder, as well as spicy foods. *(More examples of foods that may irritate the bladder is easy to Google.)* **High-Stress Lifestyle:** Cumulative and acute stress increase anxiety and one's vulnerability to panic attacks. Stress releasing activities promote the growth of a healthy, anxiety reduced life. *Examples:* Allowing the *""worry, plan, panic""* cycle to repeat to figure out where/when the next washroom will be available increases stress, thus increasing anxiety. **Lack of Meaning or Sense of Purpose:** Nothing to look forward to may increase boredom or give one a vague sense of confinement. Confinement may increase the likelihood of panic attacks, and boredom may allow the mind to wander to anxious thoughts. *Example:* Setting goals, such as time going without urinating in an anxious situation, allows one to feel a sense of accomplishment. This associates a good feeling *(accomplishment)* with a bad feeling *(anxiety)* hopefully increasing one's likelihood to seek improvement. **Further study may be found by reading The Anxiety &amp; Phobia Workbook, Fifth Edition, By Edmund J.

I'm 23 now, and throughout high school it was fairly well managed at 20 mg prozac (and I took 40 mg focalin for my adhd). In college, my anxiety got worse, particularly manifesting as health anxiety and social anxiety. I had a sticky situation with a roommate one year which didn't help, and obviously the stress of school was an issue for me as well, but with 40 mg prozac and 20 mg focalin I was, I guess I would say, okay. Not great, but okay. I graduated from college in May and have a steady, good job that I enjoy. I live with my boyfriend of 6 years and we're very close. But for some reason my anxiety has skyrocketed the past few months. I get panic attacks for almost no reason, severe guilt about things that happened in the past that I really shouldn't have guilt about (harmless, embarrassing kid stuff), lack of trust in myself, questioning everything I thought was true about myself, feelings of vulnerability, intrusive thoughts, fears of being alone...you name it. Around maybe june or so, we decided to go back to 20 mg prozac because 40 mg was making me emotionally numb, but since the recent spike in anxiety my doctor wanted me to try 30 mg so I take a 20 and a 10 since it doesn't come in 30. I'm just really confused, guys. I thought anxiety was a familiar animal to me but now it's changing shape and I don't know how to fight it. Could the spike in anxiety be a symptom of another problem? Would I do best on another medication or should I go back to 40 mg? Am I actually just going bananas? Any input would be golden. Thank you so much for reading, I appreciate it tons."

121,vulnerability,Anxiety,"Reading different psychological perspectives, r/anxiety posts and other sources has given me insight on my anxiety",5,59owff,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/59owff/reading_different_psychological_perspectives/,2016-10-28 03:24:08,"I recently read a fair chunk of *No More Mr Nice Guy* by Dr. Robert Glover, the quintessential guide for those not wanting to be anxious and passive-aggressive and looking over a whole lot of other sources has given me new insight into my anxiety. My anxiety is primarily based on a fear of losing control. Doesn't necessarily matter what it is, but I am afraid I cannot control the outcome. My intrusive thoughts are almost always based on **one** aspect of the situation I did not account for, like some general painstakingly going over the battle plans and losing his shit because he forgot about one thing. Then it lends itself to catastrophizing, and if left uncontrolled, suicidal ideation and planning. From Dr. Brene Brown and Dr. Robert Glover, it would seem I have a fear of vulnerability and not having control over a situation. My childhood was horrifying, I had no control over either of my parents or how they would act when pissed at each other. All I could do was let things happen and hope that everything would be alright. Normally, it didn't end up being alright. I think this internalized, either unconsciously or subconsciously as a desire to control. Karen Horney in her neurosis terminology labels it as ""Moving towards"", where someone is outwardly nice to everyone, and thinks better of everyone than they do of themselves, but inwardly wants to be in control of everything (relationships, jobs, life, etc.), but represses those thoughts because they are associated with being aggressive or mean. This is folly. I cannot control for everything. I can minimize the possibility of something bad happening like; not drinking and driving; or not procrastinating on a project, but in the end life is about rolling with the punches as best you can, and making the best of what you have been given. I have let me health deteriorate and I hide in my house away from campus, thinking that the more I knew about anxiety, the better I would feel, and I could come back with a new mind. I can't say whether it is has worked or not. I still get obsessively worried about some disaster coming out of left field, and because of the isolation, I do not have the close friendships that could break me out of my foolhardy thinking. To get to the point, I am beginning to understand the root of my anxiety. There isn't anything wrong with me, nor am I a bad person like my obsessive thoughts want to make me think. I am fearful because life is uncertain, and always has been, as much as I want to believe otherwise. The best I can do for myself, is keep moving forward, make relationships, treat myself well, and deal with crises as they develop, rather than try to plan every last moment for the end times. First things first, I am going to burn off all of this adrenaline and cortisol with daily exercise, and spend more time with friends, rather than alone. See where it takes me from there. Thanks for lending an ear to my ramblings, I want this post here both so that I can remind myself from time to time, and also in case it helps anyone else with there anxiety troubles. tl;dr: Figured out where my anxiety comes from, after having read a plethora of information.

I was diagnosed with PTSD, major depression and agoraphobia after going through a horrifying trauma a few years ago. I self isolated for 3 years and was happy not having to see or deal w another human being for days at a time. Realising that this was avoidance and self soothing, opened myself up to being more sociable. I was successful in making a few friends. I learnt also that my vulnerability attracts controlling narcissistic types. My anxiety causes me to misjudge people - either missing important red flags or over thinking small things. I met a girl in June and got on well. She had left her drug abuser partner and had no where to go so I have her a room in my place. She was desperate to get away from him. She also is going through chemo for cancer. I knew how it felt to be sick and alone and I never want anyone else to have to feel that way. It turns out that she has a diagnosed personality problem - severe OCD, bipolar w a splash of uncontrollable anger and narcissism for some extra 'joy'. I've had her verbally abuse my close friends, my landlord, the neighbors and various other people. Her anger is explosive and highly triggering for me. I'm left in a state of speechlessness and seem too weak to stand up for myself. I am finding it hard to set boundaries. It also turns out that she is as much of a drug addict as her ex whom she left. She is selling and using drugs whilst getting treated for chemo. The mood swings suck. She is trying to control my spending, eating, domestic habits. I know that this is terrible for me and the progress I'm making to get out of the PTSD funk is not happening even with weekly therapy. My counsellor says that I'm in a dangerous situation. Besides not having the skills to put boundaries up or say no, she also has cancer w is devastating for her and also to see. How on earth do I extricate myself without causing more hurt? "

That's right, *another* the same thing I've had at least a hundred times over the last 10 years. Once again it was different though. So all the panic attacks I've had and this one was different. Except, it's not. It just feels that way. Symptoms are the same as always. Same ones you go through. Same scared but convinced it's different. Trying various distraction techniques because they aren't working. The panic still here except it's not different. It just ""feels"" different or the classic ""I've done this to myself so many times I've really done it to myself"" nah, and I know I'm full of shit for one simple reason. I think about how the next time will really be it. That's why my body even felt anxiety writing that. It won't be. It will be the same as this one. Extremely scary during but not ""that one"". I think that's why people cycle. We don't want to believe we are wrong. Out of all the light headed, fear of death cycles we've been wrong. The evidence doesn't match what's happening. We want to get better but we don't want to look foolish for being so wrong about your own body. It's not your fault though. You unfortunately experience something that most people don't. Pure and total vulnerability. That's not really a bad thing. Neither is you being wrong. So what you're wrong and that one won't come even if you over think it. You can not think your way in to going crazy or dying. It's not an actual option. Tldr: If you compare the evidence the conclusion you're jumping to is not only an outlier, it's not possible. "
124,vulnerability,Anxiety,a somewhat significant revelation in my name-changing process revealed an underlying layer of anxiety that i had been misunderstanding,1,4w5onn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4w5onn/a_somewhat_significant_revelation_in_my/,2016-08-05 03:27:31,"The title is too long and probably not the best, I'm sorry. So I'm transgender, and I posted about my anxiety over choosing a new name on a trans sub a while ago (on a throwaway different from this one; side note: does anyone else obsessively use throwaways for every post because they're super embarrassed even though the post is a completely normal post?) but the responses/advice I got was all basic transition advice, like ""if someone insists on deadnaming you then get them out of your life"" or whatever. And I *know*, people change their name all the time and it's not a problem, it's my name and I shouldn't feel required to keep one that makes me uncomfortable, anyone who would take issue to me changing my name/the name and choose or refuse to call me by a different name is a jerk that I don't need in my life, etc. But the issue isn't *really* with other people, it's with *me.* No one in real life has ever made fun of the names I like (the name subreddit is a different story; they can be quite hostile), no one has ever genuinely refused to call me by a different name (one of my friends joked about it, but contextually I don't blame her at all, cause it was like the fifth different name I'd asked her to try.) The problem is *me*, making up and exaggerating problems and assuming the worst about everyone and what they think of me or that they really think about me and this bullshit at all. And saying ""cut out jerks"" doesn't help that at all. But I have legitimately been playing around with names for two and a half *years.* It's not that there are no names I like. There are *lots* of names I like, though a fair number of them are a bit unconventional. There are no names I feel comfortable using. And I wore out my friends, too. Cause I thought for so long that if I could just find the perfect name it would be alright, it would all fall into place. And I'd find a name I liked, and I'd ask my friends to call me by it, and then I'd decide it's not me, it's too weird, I have a stupid taste in names that's pretentious and bad and I should just use a normal name like every other fucking person God I'm the worst, and so I'd find a different name to get my friends to use and repeat the cycle. I have probably tried out seven or eight different names with my friends, and they're tired of it. They don't say they are but I know they are. And I understand why; I'm exhausted too. And sometimes names are all I can talk about. Because I love names and I have wanted to change mine for as long as I can remember even before I came to terms with being trans, and it is so overwhelmingly important to me to pick a name that I really genuinely love but that's also not going to make people think less of me. But I still don't have a name, and at this point I don't feel comfortable asking my friends to try different ones or give me their opinions on ones I like because two and a half years is just too long and I hate putting this burden on them. But I somewhat recently decided that I really like a very conventional, standard, normal, common, appropriate for my age group name. There is absolutely nothing objectionable about it at all. Is it my favorite name? Not by a long shot, but it's alright. And upon realizing that I liked it and briefly considering using it, I came to another realization: it doesn't matter what the name is. I can't ask people to call me by a different name. I can't do it. Other people changing their name is fine, not an objectionable process at all. But if I do it, no matter what the name is, it's pretentious. It's always that word that gets me. Pretentious. It's stupid, it's unnecessary, it's inconvenient to everyone around me, it's a slap in the face to my parents who named me, but worst of all it's *pretentious.* Changing my name is *pretentious*, and I just can't handle that. It's not when other people do it, but it is for me. I'm more comfortable coming out than I am changing my name. Telling someone I'm trans? Fine. Whatever. It's who I am, and if that's a problem for you too bad. But changing my name is a choice. It's choosing a representation of myself. It's projecting who I think I am to everyone I meet for the rest of my life. Granted, down the line most people aren't going to know I changed it. But in this moment my family, my friends, my coworkers, my classmates, my professors, and everyone I've known in the past 20+ years that I or anyone I know meets again will all *know.* And it's not even like there's an option that says nothing, because everything says something. Every name says something. And I know I should talk to my therapist about it more, but I've talked to her about it a lot and I feel like there are other things that we need to focus on instead and I'm just bogging her down with a decision that I need to make for myself, and that address my anxiety in general should help my name anxiety so why should I waste time talking to her about something that I've been talking to almost everyone I know about for the last two and a half years? I don't know what's left to say except to repeat everything I've been saying because it's still bothering me, or what she can say that she doesn't say about everything else that I should just be able to apply to this on my own but for some reason can't? This is a massive point of vulnerability for me. And it's a very important decision that I have to make, and probably within the next couple of months. And definitely sometimes but perhaps even overall it is my greatest single source of anxiety. Picking a name. Asking people to use it. *I can't do it.* But I need to. "

I seem to get this bad feeling when my abdomen is naked. I also get it if I am wearing clothes that bring my attention to my midriff. so like, I normally wear jeans, but if I wear leggings, the waist band is in a different place and doesn't fit like the jeans, I start to feel this dysphoria... like discomfort but the kind where I feel like I want to die. I feel like I want to just no longer exist. for the ground to open up and just destroy me in an instant. it's almost like nausea but without the physical feeling. so anyhow, I just got out of the shower and wearing a towel. was fine until for some reason, looking at my tummy, all of a sudden I felt this horrible vulnerability. it seems to be a vulnerability... but I'm not sure why. it seems like maybe my intestines will fall out. to be honest now, thinking about it, does remind me of times when I've seen surgery on tv. and there was this anime I watched when I was younger, where a person woke up and had been vivisectioned. his intestines were pulled out. maybe this is just an extension of that... but I'm not sure if I can get past it. I can't feel comfortable naked? also. I do have a minor umbilical hernia. maybe it affects me more than I realise. but I can't really sit and think to myself ""that's it, I've solved it"" because it seems to arise when I don't think about that. and I feel horrible if I wear tight clothes, like a corset. yeah so this is pretty distressing when it happens, but most of the time I'm fine. I'd just like to get it figured out so I can wear what I want without having to 'ease into it' or so I can walk around naked without suddenly feeling like I want to die. any help is appreciated!!!"

I'm not sure if it is hypochondria or Munchausen's/facticious disorder or hysteria or what, but I am completely obsessed with being sick. This is going to be a little disjointed but it's the best way I could get it out accurately. I want to be sick. I want to be in hospital. I can't remember when the thought first settled in my mind: early childhood. I've always been fascinated with medicine, human biology and anatomy and later, drugs. This fascination somehow morphed into a perverted, and unfounded romanticism. There is something so intimate about the human body of which I'm certainly not the first person to notice. That juxtaposed by the by the stark clinical nature of hospitals is enough to capture my fancy. However, I am also a woman obsessed and there is a thin line between fancy and obsession. When admitted, you have nothing but your skin. Everything else on you, around you and even in you is issued. It is the same. It might as well be nothing. You might as well be naked. Vulnerable. But that's what it is, isn't it? Vulnerability? It doesn't even have to be a hospital. A psych ward is enough. A rehab center. Even an alien pod with nothing but you, stasis fluid and grotesque tubes running through your spinal column and out to a mother ship's fuel cells. There is peace in it. Individuality is not paramount for once. You have your body and only your body. Everything else is trivial. The instruments are probably an entirely different fixation that ties into vulnerability. You have a perfect, mass produced, lifeless extension of yourself. It is more often than not tapped directly into your squishy insides. It's a part of you now. It is cold, uncomfortable and clinical and it's doing the work for you. No need to release endorphins to kill your pain: we have a metal tube threaded into your vein delivering your brain a rigorously tested, perfectly timed dose of dilaudid. It's a nonstop obsession. I cannot think of anything else through the day. I recently went through an onslaught of tests and doctors visits (which I thoroughly reveled in) to be diagnosed with a boring case of hyperthyroidism. Every time I get palpitations or dizzy I spend the episode praying for it to get worse. I scour Google for any condition relating to my ""symptoms"". I spend hours doing this. It doesn't help either that I work in a hospital. I see people come and go through the emergency room. They are exhausted and in pain. They only want the relief of their own home and their own bed, but I want to be them. These people are sometimes knocking on death's door and I still envy their rigged up bodies. I feel shameful and disgusting. It's perverted and wrong. I hate that I want this. It doesn't make any sense and I have no idea how to manage it. I have a psychiatrist and I am being treated for dysthimia and GAD with Cymbalta. Klonopin as needed. I don't know how to bring this up with them though. I feel like this issue is the most embarrassing possible problem I could admit to a health care professional. And then what? Do they refer me to talk therapy? I don't want that. I want a quick clean fix that only clinical treatments can provide. "

I was diagnosed with anxiety (and very slight depression) about 2 years ago. Since then I have been mad at myself for feeling this way, but I have now been to Thailand (huge step), seen bands and gone away for work. Basically, I was coming off my meds (fluox 20mg), and me and the other half wanted to buy a house. When we put the offer in, and had it accepted I freaked. I couldn't think straight, I couldn't see anything, I cant even remember the last week at work. I started having very strong anxiety and depressive thoughts (quite unusual for me). Since then I have withdrawn this offer (no other choice). Basically, I was freaking about the money, which I got over, then I was freaking about crime and feeling intimidated in my own home (well built 6 ft 3 male, stupid right?). Now I just feel disappointed in myself. I don't think im ready. I want to try this again as I want to give my OH a nice life, but I cant shake the feeling of vulnerability. When I see a place, I check out local crime rates and amount of council homes etc, I don't know if im ready. I was so close to what I think was back to normal. Any advice would be great. Thank you"
128,vulnerability,Anxiety,Boundaries and Anxiety... Is there a connection?,1,4dmu3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4dmu3i/boundaries_and_anxiety_is_there_a_connection/,2016-04-07 03:38:52,"Been working with a therapist for a few years now. It's been a long road but a fruitful one. My anxiety came rushing to the surface about 3 years ago after the breakup of a very toxic relationship. You can look through my post history for more info on that. One thing that has been troublesome for me has been both my perception of my self. Being quite hard on myself both mentally and physically. Anxiety, body image issues (which i didn't really have until after my long relationship) and some depression. I have come to realize that my entire life, I have exhibited poor boundaries. Always playing the ""nice guy"" role. Allowing partners or people in positions of power to walk all over me. Never wanting to go against them for fear of abandonment and rejection. Obviously this was learned in my childhood, and I see these patterns ALL throughout my family. Well, the past 6 months have been particularly challenging after another breakup and I have been doing a ton of growing and learning. One thing that has come up for me is that I am realizing that when I let someone cross my boundaries without saying anything, or sticking up for myself, I fall into my old pattern of beating myself up. I turn the anger on myself. This past week, I had a small personal victory. I was dating a woman, for a fairly short time. I started noticing I was having anxiety, and could not totally pinpoint why. But then I realized, after some awareness practice that she was not reciprocating in the relationship. I was always organizing our dates, making the the first call or text, etc... She seemed not interested, and yet, would still go out with me, kiss me, have sex, etc... In the past I would not think twice about that. I would just keep trying to please her more. Be nicer, win her affection, etc... And if it ended, I would probably fall into my old pattern of self hate, self blame. So I decided to end it. I met with her. Explained that I was feeling anxious about where things were going and that I needed to take care of myself and that I was ending things. She was sad. But she understood and you know what, she said she was proud of me for doing what I did. I was not looking for her approval. But to hear that was affirming. She actually respected me more than if I had kept trying. And you know what, I respect me more. It was two adults talking frankly and honestly, and risking vulnerability. It was still hard. I was anxious as hell prior to doing it, because it goes against my entire life of avoiding that type of thing. But I don't feel nearly as bad as I would if I had just let things go until the inevitable end. I feel empowered by my decision and for recognizing the real source of my anxiety. And taking responsibility for myself, not giving up my power. So, while this may not be true for everyone. I am starting to realize, finally, after years of hard work, where this anxiety and self deprecation comes from. As Obi-Wan said, it's my first step into a wider world :) Does anyone else have experience with this sort of thing? I really feel like it is a watershed moment for me and want to know if this is a common thing, this connection. Cheers. "

I dont know at all how to title this without giving a wrong impression. The fear is not specific, but it is different than general anxiety. Sometimes, I get really scared. This feels separate from my general anxiety, this is more like the feeling that some*thing* is watching me, listening to my thoughts, and essentially ""gonna get me"". It also escalates very easily, because i feel like the thing can sense my fear, and know my vulnerability, so it just plays off itself and i get more terrified very quickly. One day ill be completely fine with my dark room at night. The next day I am terrified of ""it"" getting me. Even when i sit with the lights on and watch my room, no matter what breathing exercising or rosaries or whatever i do, I cannot forget about the ""thing"". I used to be on klonopin, which would help with this. But about a month ago, klonopin really fucked me up (i took a couple, forgot and took more, then ""blacked out"", I dont remember ANYTHING from the next 2 days, but apparently i took the whole bottle and did some very crazy things) I asked my doctor to prescribe me something else for my anxiety, but he says he wont. I think he doesnt believe my story, and thinks i abused the klonopin intentionally. I am honestly lost. After essentially begging, he gave me vistaril, which feels like nothing more than benadryl and does not relieve anxiety, sometimes it puts me to sleep, but it causes sleep paralysis, which is terrifying. Sorry for the long post. I'm worried no one will read it because it is so long but i really need help. TLDR: I have a fear of an ""unknown monster"" and cannot take medicine, none of usual anxiety techniques work."

I'm constantly ruminating on the possibility of him wanting to end things at any point in time, and it's dominating my thoughts and preventing me from completing the work that is already such a huge stressor. I'm otherwise very happy with the relationship, but can't seem to get out from under the weight of my worries. The obvious solution is to talk to him (M/25) about it, and I absolutely plan on discussing it when I see him later today. That being said, I'm also terrified that revealing the severity of my insecurities will be a ""red flag"" for him and might clue him into the notion that I'm more trouble than I'm worth. I really do want to be honest with him, but there's so much vulnerability that comes with that, and I'm so scared it'll end badly.

I have seen a few threads bringing up the concept of ""air hunger,"" and I almost feel like I'm experiencing the opposite now. If I get anxious about full breaths, it's not because I feel like I can't get a full tank. I feel, rather, that I can't exhale all the way. I feel like I'm storing tension in places that I can't always find - I check the shoulders every now and then, which of course helps, but sometimes I'll find that I'm shaky and sore as though something was clenched for a period of time. As a musician I have some experience with diaphragm breathing, and have been exposed to Alexander Technique (a body-awareness system of exercises for performers, speakers, etc.). Even so, I can't shake this feeling that my body wants to stop exhaling before it is capable. Ideally I'd have been asleep for about six hours now, but as I was drifting off, I think I had a panic attack and I have been on edge since. I have been mostly able to resist the urge to scrutinize every sensation I feel, but the exhalation one is kind of a bugaboo. Also, even if nobody reads this, I just want to thank this sub for being supportive enough that I feel comfortable posting. This is definitely a small trifle compared to what many of the posters are going through, but in the moment, it feels kind of intense, and it is good to have a place to talk through it."

When I was a kid I think it was more of a sensory thing, water on my face made me freak out for a very long time, but now I think it's become more anxiety related? Like, its not so much the shower itself that bothers me, but the vulnerability of being in the shower? Every little noise I hear makes me panic, and since my house makes a lot of noise all the time, AND the bathroom window is poorly sealed so all the noise from outside seems like its right there with me, thats kind of a big issue. It takes a lot of energy for me to go take a shower and even then I put it off and put it off as much as possible, double check all the doors are locked etc, and even bringing knives into the bathroom, and I still don't feel safe. I've lurked here before but majority of **the solutions tend to involve music, does anyone have any advice on this that doesn't?** Whenever I listen to music, I worry that I'm missing out something vitally important, like someone is creeping around my house and I can't hear them I currently rent a house with a friend and he's away a lot for his family. The anxiety is usually barely existent when he's around but when he isn't, and I'm alone, I'm barely functional. It's not just a dependence on him either, this was all a lot easier when I lived with family for the sole fact that there were other people in the house (But there's enough issues there that moving back for that one reason is hardly ideal) Any advice is super appreciated, I'm trying to encourage myself to have one tonight!"

A quarter of motorists would feel anxious if they were without their vehicle, while feelings of depression (15%), anger (10%) and panic (10%) were also anticipated."" ""Direct Line commissioned the study to support its new Guaranteed Hire Car proposition, offering customers guaranteed hire car cover as standard with all comprehensive insurance policies."" There are two incredible messages in this statement (which was report by ABP news recently): 1) Many British drivers have an over-reliance on the use of their vehicle on a day-to-day basis and are unsure what they would do without their vehicle 2) Rather than look at ways to help people ease their reliance on their vehicle, companies would rather exploit their vulnerability. Is this what Britain is becoming - a country that is unable to function without the use of their gadgets and helpful tools? A country where we struggle to adapt to unexpected changes? I appreciate that this is not the case for the majority of British drivers in this survey, but that shouldn't take away from the importance of this message. Furthermore, this isn't the first time that something like this has come to light. In July 2012 a study was completed by Anxiety UK to understand the impact of social media on people and how this can trigger anxiety. The study found (among other things) that 45% of people that were not able to access their social networks or email feel uncomfortable as a result. Then, perhaps the most troubling thing of all, companies who provide products to consumers use results such as these as a selling point to prove that they are better than their rivals (with the Direct Line example being just one of many). Not all will directly link their promotions to a survey as Direct Line have, but when people see a message that highlights ""super-reliable connections"" does this sell to someone more because it is considered to be convenient or because it suppresses their anxious feelings, their fears, towards potentially losing connection altogether? Rather than exploit these feelings why can't we see companies doing the right thing and helping people manage these changes that are out of their control as best as they can, adapting to the loss of technology for even a brief period of time and understanding what this loss means to their customers. Do customers want to feel this way? What a silly question, right? But it's one that companies don't even seem to consider when they sell their products today. Why not show support to organisations and initiatives that loom to help those who suffer with anxiety (and its links to depression), even if it is an initiative that specifically relates anxiety caused by the use (or lack of availability) of technology - organisations such as Anxiety UK as just one example that could be worked with. Support your vulnerable customers through their difficulties, don't exploit them. Anxiety and depression can suddenly impact ANYONE without any prior warning. Be responsible! Is that too much to ask?

I always lock the bathroom door, but I'm always terrified that something horribly wrong is happening in the house while I'm in the shower...or that someone's going to pound on the door, or break it down. I usually rush through my showers in a panic (which is a plus for the environment) but often times I nick myself shaving or I forget to wash out the shampoo in my hair. So now I get in a terrible cycle of being afraid to take showers because of my anxiety, which results in more anxiety! I know it sounds stupid, but this used to be one of the only things that could subdue my anxiety, and now it's just creating more stress. Has anyone experienced this/have any advice at all?

One thing I hate about being in a relationship is that I care too much and become really codependent. I feel like I need constant reassurance that the other person hasn't had some huge change in feeling about me. I know it's not attractive. I don't want to be this way. And I'm pretty sure I keep these feelings to myself, so I don't look crazy. But it's this almost constant feeling of anxiety in the pit of my stomach. I just haven't cared about someone this much in a long time. My last relationship wasn't ideal, and there was always something missing. I just don't want to fuck this up. Why can't I be normal and just not care so much? I'm so sensitive. I'm pretty sure he feels the same way that I do about him. But I never really know. I sound so stupid. Maybe I know that these things never really work out and I'm just prolonging the inevitable. Maybe I'm sensing something that he did wrong, and just hasn't told me about yet? I'm usually really good at picking up on those things. I can't let myself get hurt again. Maybe I'm just making this a bigger deal than it should be. I have a flypaper brain that all these thoughts get stuck to and I never know what's valid or just a manifestation of my anxiety. It's always there, no matter what I do. I feel like sometimes I might subconsciously create problems so I'll have a reason for feeling this way. But every problem I have feels real and valid and I think so much about it that they should all be worn with use, bleach stained and tattered. I just want someone to love me for me, crippling anxiety and all haha. But that's not realistic. I think I keep it pretty well hidden. For the most part. You just don't want to care to much. That's a vibe I've gotten. Caring too much in relationships, platonic or romantic, is mostly seen as pathetic. And I always care too much. I love too hard. I don't want to be pathetic. I want to care just the right amount, nothing less and nothing more. I realize how anal that sounds. But I'm scared. Really scared of being vulnerable again and being hurt. And there's nothing better to put someone off than vulnerability. I'm not one of those cool, collected people with intimacy issues. The type to end it before they get hurt. I'm more the one that will hold on to the thing I'm afraid of, and quietly worry myself to death about it. Maybe this is my way of fucking things up for myself. Who knows. "

I have been in a state of depression and constant panic attacks, which have only been getting worse for the last couple of years. I'm terrible at socializing and have a really small circle of friends. I always assume that everyone is out to get me. Even the smallest jab from a classmate raises my heart-beat and makes me fully aware of my surroundings. This has been bothering me for a long time and I'm fed up with waiting. I hate living with the fear that I may die one day, because of my panic attacks. I know I'm panicking all for nothing, but I feel I have absolutely no control over it! I hate waking up in the middle of the night covered in sweat when I have an important event to attend to. I detest meeting new people, because I always feel like I'm not good at anything. Depression has also taken a massive toll on my personal life, I no longer feel motivation or pleasure in doing anything. All of the hobbies I once had interest in like guitar and video games are now collecting dust. I am socially withdrawn and can't even engage in a normal conversation without stuttering. I hate my girly nasally voice, since I always get the impression that someone is laughing in hearing range, even when I try to be as quiet as I can. I'm sick and tired of my family circle telling me it's all ""normal"". I really want to know if it's ""normal"" to feel that you are in a constant state of vulnerability when going outside. Or throwing tantrums over minor things and thinking about them all day. I know it is only going to get worse if it goes on, but I don't know what to do and my parents aren't taking me seriously, because they're into that pseudo-science bullshit that psychiatrists are evil and that all of these personality disorders are ""made up"". However, they completely trust conventional medicine, which is pretty contradictory on its own. I want to take matters into my own hands, but since I'm still in school, I'm entirely dependent on my parents. I've tried telling both my mom and dad about the things I'm going through, and so far, I have received the same response. That I'm going to overcome it on my own and it's completely normal for my age. They're not abusive or anything, since they've always been there for me, just pretty oblivious. I know a psychiatrist nearby, and while I do have the money, I also need my parents' consent. Where should I go from there?"
138,vulnerability,Anxiety,How to not feel so vulnerable?,4,3chzue,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3chzue/how_to_not_feel_so_vulnerable/,2015-07-08 11:38:59,"I've been dealing with anxiety my entire life, but in the recent year it's gotten so bad that my thoughts are bordering on almost complete irrationality, and any attempt to solve them with reason is useless. Like most people, I would never want to end up in an accident so severe it would paralyze me from the neck down, I would never want to suddenly end up with a fatal brain tumor, I would never want to be murdered. Yet, for me, these fears are so intense, they leave me mentally and almost physically immobile. I've been experiencing crippling feelings of vulnerability in a cold, cruel universe which has made me sink into an existential crisis. I used to love horseback riding; now I'm afraid of falling off a horse and breaking my neck. I don't want to do it again. I've developed a fear of long, steep stairs. While going up stairs, I make a point to bend forward so there's no chance I'd fall back. I'm worried in the future that I may experience some sort of traumatic injury that would either end my life, or severely lower my quality of it. The fact that this is entirely possible freaks me out. To me, it isn't that unreasonable to think the universe is cold and unfeeling and that I'm entirely vulnerable. But I wish I could just be a carefree, but naturally cautious person like most other people, who don't think about these things on such a deep level. I just want to live my life without the urge to worry. I almost NEED to worry about things because I don't want to get shaken up and surprised if they do happen."
139,vulnerability,Anxiety,"I didn't post this publicly for the longest time due to, funnily enough, anxiety. That ends today!",15,3e8yjd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3e8yjd/i_didnt_post_this_publicly_for_the_longest_time/,2015-07-23 07:42:40,"A good while back, a very courageous friend of mine posted a call to action on Facebook for a change in the national discourse on mental illness. In it, she admitted to having depression and encouraged anyone feeling similarly to seek out help. I greatly respected her willingness to share her struggles, and agree that the only way to reduce the stigma is to demonstrate that mental illness is prevalent and treatable. However, the discussion didnt continue much after her passionate request, and I think its important that it does in some form or another. Considering Robin Williams would have turned 64 today if we had not lost the comedic juggernaut to his own demons, I thought now was a good time to humbly share my attempt to change the conversation. When I was 18 years old, a boy I knew...lets call him Carl...committed suicide. It was strange for me, as I never knew Carl very well beyond having classes together and the odd social run-in. But he and I attended the same schools for most of our lives and somehow ended up with a similar social group in college, so I felt obligated to inform those people who wouldnt otherwise know from Facebook or word of mouth. It was unsettling, to say the least. Having an extremely intimate and uncomfortable conversation about someone I really didnt know all that well. So I dont really know how to say thisCarl committed suicide today. What?? But I knew that guy. Was he really that depressed? People can be arrogant like that. We think we know how the world works. We think we know what everyone else is thinking, and we get upset when it turns out we are wrong. I know about that aversion to the unknown more than most. I am one of an estimated 6.8 million Americans with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Its a pretty broadly defined mood disorder, so let me be more specific about some of my individual symptoms...I exhibit an extremely low tolerance of uncertainty, high looming vulnerability to threat (basically extreme impatience), inappropriate use of abstract linguistic processing (avoidance of emotion by failing to process threatening stimuli thoroughly), and a tendency to catastrophize pretty much anything you let me think about for long enough, among others. Sprinkle a little bit of classic social anxiety on there for good measure and, bam! You have a woman in her mid-twenties who can go from perfectly happy to a sobbing wreck downing whiskey at 11:00 am and blubbering about how an awkward conversation last week is evidence shes going to die alone, in a matter of minutes. Dont believe me? Ask my sister. Since I can remember, shes served as my shrink. Before my actual diagnosis, we would go through all sorts of theories about what might be causing my struggles with getting through the day...That it was the type of people I hung out with. That I was overly introverted. That I was just one of those people who worried a lot, and I could snap out of it if I just gave it some effort. But I didnt, because honestly (and I do admit this sheepishly) it kind of made me feel more prepared than everyone else. Since I was always worrying about stuff, Id obviously be ready for it, right? Those silly people driving to work un-petrified by thoughts of how quickly the imaginary cancer already growing in their uterus will kill them...theyll never see it coming! Yes, many of the people you know are currently depressed, or anxious, or obsessive-compulsive, or whatever else. You may be aware of that fact or you may not. They may not even be fully aware themselves. But waiting to ask the question until after the fact is to ignore the tragic reality that someone finally gave into whatever torment you were unaware of. Carl committed suicide today. What a fucking coward. Im sorry. But how could he do that to his family? I have no idea for how long Ive been anxious to the degree of a diagnosable disorder. Most people dont. In fact, its thought that most GAD-having people dont seek help for it and the number of cases are much higher than just ~2% of the U.S. population. At any rate, I never thought I needed help, because I never thought I had a problem that needed fixing. What I needed instead was to get over my worries and get out of my own head. Everyone else did it every day of their lives, what the hell was so wrong with me? Ive led a decently easy life without too much hardship or trauma. But I still found myself utterly exhausted by everyday things like...going shopping, or having a job interview. I felt weak and pathetic. Just the thought of going to a dinner with friends would make my hands shake while I fretted over every possible scenario...that is if the anxiety hadnt paralyzed me into just cancelling. Every time I was told DUDE you freak out over everything. Just stop worrying. Its going to turn out all right, I would revert into what I like to call a worry spiral, over why I couldnt seem to get the hang of it. Thats right. Sometimes I worry about worrying. Ever do that? Its a fun lil circle jerk to work through, ending in some really colorful shades of self-loathing. My point is, I thought seeking help meant admitting I failed. It meant admitting I was worse than everyone else at...living. I felt the courageous thing to do was to suck it up. It took the people I loved the most in the world telling me they were unable to understand my emotions and felt helpless to support me to make me really challenge my idea of what failure meant. Perhaps instead of judging ones actions as cowardice, we should ask how they define it, and why? Ask what could motivate a person to act in that way and, if you havent, be grateful that you yourself have yet to be forced to such extremes. Carl committed suicide today. Huh, well I guess thats one way to get attention. This kind of victim-blaming is the reason there is almost an entire year gap between my friend's original post and this one. I thought people would assume I was looking for pity and miss my overall message. But the fear of coming across as a narcissist is, to me, the lesser evil than continuing to ignore mental health until it causes another tragedy in the public eye. If you are of the opinion that I wrote this for my own ego, then that is your prerogative. I have met several people who have claimed to have anxiety over the years. I also harbor doubts that a very small number of those individuals may be using the term anxiety to excuse poor behavior and illicit sympathy. However, I am not a mind-reader. I have no way of knowing what motivates a person to share details of their mental state. All I know is that if more people are honest about theirs, those crying out for attention will be drowned out in the conversation. Its estimated that one-third of the population has some sort of mood disorder...with that many people discussing it, the novelty of having it might wear off. We have all encountered people who fake all sorts of issues to gain attention. There has even been people who went so far as to create online personas with thousands of followers supporting their fight against cancer while they remained perfectly healthy. But if someone told you they had cancer, would you doubt them because theres a small chance they wanted to martyr themselves? Carl committed suicide today. Holy shit, I didnt know he was depressed. Shame he didnt even try to get help. The reason I took the time earlier to explain some of my individual symptoms is because mood disorders are muddled. Its not like a virus or bacteria, where an outside pathogen infects you. You can have multiple disorders with varying levels of intensity, or just exhibit a little more social anxiety than the normal person. Each disorder is really just a spectrum of symptoms that have reached a degree of severity warranting a disorder, based on how your mind is hard-wired to work. A treatment that works for one person may or may not work for the next five, even if those people have the same disorder. One anxious acquaintance of mine exhibits it severely enough to warrant daily medication and weekly therapy appointments. Another has an emergency stash of benzodiazepines to calm him down only in the event of a panic attack, but prefers meditation and deep breathing for every-day coping. One person saw a therapist for only a brief stint until they identified a good medication schedule for her. Another went to a therapist and never returned after an incredibly negative experience, but still reads credible literature on the subject for self-education. I myself see a cognitive-behavioral therapist occasionally and sometimes participate in group sessions, but dont have any prescriptions. For me, it has proven by far the most effective coping method. For someone else, it might exacerbate their disorder. Seeking out meaningful help for mental illness requires much more thought than scheduling a doctors appointment. It requires humility to admit needing help, funds to afford it, sincere self-reflection to choose a method that suits your needs, determination to try a different route should the first not work, and a willingness to learn some of the uglier things about yourself. On top of that, no one wants to be the crazy person who has to go to the shrink. I will admit Ive come up with various reasons to leave work for my appointments for fear my coworkers might think Im unstable or deranged. Yes, thats also a symptom of my social anxiety, but I do think this enters into the problem. People who feel marginalized by their disorder might not even admit to having it, much less seek out meaningful and effective treatment. Perhaps if we stop prescribing simple help to those with mental disorders and instead offer a brainstorm of the various methods, taking that first step to wellness wont seem so daunting. I will never know why Carl decided to kill himself that day, but my friends reactions of disbelief, shock, and awe speak loudly to one issue: mental health is a taboo. One that we are so averse to talking about in everyday life (with the exception of caricatured psychiatrists and lunatics in entertainment), that we continue to be rocked by the tragedies that result from its mistreatment, no matter how numerous. Mental disorders can be very different to treat than some infectious diseases, but the rhetoric we use should not differentiate between the two. I can only hope that this has encouraged someone to think and speak differently about mental health, because it will remain destructive as long as we refuse to change our conception of it. I urge you, if you yourself or anyone you know has shown signs of mental distress, to please start looking into treatment options. Whether that means simply reading about various disorders, trying homeopathic remedies, or even seeking out a therapist, that first small step can make a huge difference months down the line. My loved ones can attest to the changes Ive gone through since finding a treatment method that worked for me. No one has a chance of improving if they dont take action. The National Suicide Prevention Line is available 24/7 at 1-800-273-8255 to anyone who may be having suicidal thoughts, and SAMHSA has a line for treatment referral and general mental health information from 8 am to 8 pm M-F at 1-877-726-4727. Be well, my friends. And be good to each other. "

I've gotten closer to my friend's dad which offers more guidance and for that I'm grateful. The other day, I was telling him how I felt guilty and lonely all the time. The guiltyness is an attribute of me not being able to ignore insults, but the loneliness comes from something more overwhelming that has everything to do with my upbringing. I'm strange in the way I'm a very open person and most people love that and grow quickly attached to me. It's nothing I'm not used to and always confused me. I'd find out even though I'm very open, i have a lot of emotional guards and it's very difficult to make me feel both vulnerable and loved. This may explain why when i have a crush, it's a race to find out how crazy they are before i get too deeply involved with them. He tells me I assume the worst in people. Easy solution is learn to be vulnerable and the loneliness will go away. The reason that is so difficult for me is because in the past year, the few people I have gotten vulnerable and emotionally connected to have intentionally hurt me and taken advantage of me and i knew i should have listen to my gut. The other part of vulnerability is the risk of getting hurt and I'm really tired of getting hurt and the loneliness gets worse when i get dissapointed by someone. How did some of you relearn being vulnerable and learning which people to be emotionally engaged with and not? ---------------- TLDR; How did some of you relearn being vulnerable and learning which people to be emotionally engaged with and not?"

Normally I'd help her through like I had all the preceding years but I'd had enough of putting others before me. For months before the breakup I was borderline suicidal.

Now I have something like a career to consider, I have a girlfriend to consider, I have physical fitness to maintain, I have certain studies I want to devote time to.

He is in a toxic relationship with his wife, physical beatings, abuses, wailing. They divorce every month and yet are ""intellectually and spiritually perfect for each other"". His wife does not seem to be sufficiently aware of his bipolar, as she overlooked the symptoms each time they appeared. Apparently, he is on a six-month medication, and I know it for sure that he has been under diagnosed. Yet, there is absolutely nothing I can do. His wife will take offense if I point out that he needs to see another pdoc. I am so anxious that I literally just got up to kill myself, but then the thought of my brother stopped me. I am dying worrying about specifically about two things- He needs to divorce his wife. As much as they claim love for one another, I can not ignore how they BOTH bully and disrespect each other, in their own respective ways. They are not happy. At least, his wife is not,who changes her opinion of him every 3 days. But if they do get divorced, my brother will perhaps lead a more miserable life. He does not have any friend, so forget about finding a new partner who would be okay with his bipolar and history of domestic violence. Currently, my mother is befriending his wife, so that the latter keeps us updated about the treatment. But, what about when my mother and/or my sister-in-law die? How will I know my brother's bipolar is not back ? And how will I get him the prolonged, supervised medical help, unless I stay with him in the same house, which won't be possible. I am struggling with my own anxiety. In fact, my pdoc has given me a thought-stopping medicine, to control my vulnerability to bipolar Had it not been for my brother, I would have killed myself already. My anxiety has finally taken its toll on my job too. I asked for a deadline extension yesterday, citing family emergency. I don't think I am in a position to work at all. I want to quit all my assigned projects, but if I do, my reputation goes for a toss. Edit: They both continually drink alcohol too. I told him it is not recommended in case of bipolar, but he just shut me up. What do I do? My parents are old. Before I know it, my mother is gone. What will I do then? Who gave her the right to conceive children in an abusive household?! Edit: Who will take him to the doctor after I am dead? "

She's hinted at or invited me to hang out with her and her friends a few times or just to go somewhere between ourselves, and every time I become avoidant of it. I hate going out, and the only reason I do it is because I have to or my friends want to go somewhere. My agoraphobia runs so deep that I piss in empty water jugs to avoid leaving my room and running into housemates. When I go grocery shopping sweat drops perforate across my furrowed brows and glazed eyes before I get through half my shopping list (which I often leave incomplete because of the state I am in). Sometimes I'll look at events or meetups and scope out images of the place online and I'll imagine myself sitting at these outside tables or standing among a crowd at a venue like the carefree pixelated strangers and just imagine what hell it would be for me. This issue is largely why I've been avoidant of relationships in general, because I worry about disappointing my partners and revealing the paralyzing vulnerability and parade of traumatic episodes that have controlled my life that are engrained in my brain. I admitted to her very casually that I'm agoraphobic, but I dont think I've done enough justice expressing how much its ruined me. She admitted to me she's agoraphobic too, which is nice that she could understand, but I think my level of agoraphobia is much more advanced than hers, and makes me dream of bouts of isolation in spite of the swirling loneliness that surrounds me. I just want to spend a week straight with her, morning to bedtime, eating with each other at tables and frolicking in public, but I know for a fact that it wouldnt be possible without her witnessing some sort of nervous breakdown from my end. I don't know what to do. **tl;dr**: Deal with a stage of agoraphobia that could give Howard Hughes a run for his money, and its making me avoidant of my girlfriend. I want to spend as much time as possible with her, but public places are a fiery hell for me and it makes me feel crushed and inadequate as a boyfriend. "

I feel like if something goes wrong socially, now I have the tools to cope with it, and respond appropriately and keep myself safe. :) I can ask for things, and not be completely terrified of people saying no. I'm getting better at remembering I'm allowed to say no myself, or propose alternatives, and if I forget in the moment I know how to deal with it after the fact. :) Of course it's not going to solve all the world's problems, but it feels that way right now ;)"

I apologize in advance if I sound like a stoner spewing psychobabble.) I am a 27 year old woman. My parents divorced when I was three and I grew up living two polar opposite lifestyles: one that shamed me for being human, having private parts and curiosity, and another that encouraged every kind of exploration, especially through literature and personal experience. The problem was, it was mainly the shamed lifestyle I grew up on, while the free-to-explore one was one I could only visit every other weekend and holidays. And so, I started developing intense phobias very early on: sin, being bad, stepping on cracks, touching raw meat, walking under ladders, vomiting, making my mother cry, getting hit, getting bad grades, getting in trouble, getting people mad at me, stomachaches, odd bodily symptoms, failing, failing God, going to Hell, ghosts, the dark, the Devil, tsunamis, tornadoes, earthquakes, war, asteroids, conspiracy, lies, intimacy, tragedy, injustice, vulnerability, men and their words, abandonment in every form... I've sobbed uncontrollably and made myself supremely paranoid and sick over it all, trust me. Tears, heaving, elevated pulse and hyperventilation over everything between my friend's decision to cook something with clam sauce instead of the safer marinara, to the idea that the sun is going to blow up and take us all with it, with the fear of immediate death(s) and failure(s) in between. I've freaked out through it all. Punctuated in the middle of all this internal made-up hell and madness were actual experiences: several failed relationships, parents divorcing twice (they got back together when I was 14 and then split again when I moved out at 18... which was something I never thought I'd be able to do). Other experiences were the deaths of some important people in my life, traveling, drunken nights, discovering weed and discovering sex. I consider myself profoundly lucky and I aim to be humble every day. I feel like I've seen and been to every side to this awful fucking state of mind and I've figured out how it works. Our minds are like spiders trapped under invisible bowls. We see what's out there, but for reasons X, Y, and Z, we can't escape ourselves and we're trapped in fears we can't actually see, but assume are there and are limiting us from feeling better than the shit we're trapped in. In order to slowly and gently escape, without letting excitement or arrogance over my newfound freedoms, carry me away, I've simply been telling myself the following ***I'm not going to worry about the next thing until I have to*** This is what has been most consistently keeping me present, centered, and even enjoying what I'm doing while I'm ignoring and/or letting go of other inevitably present irritants and things I cannot control. My father, a licensed mental health practitioner among a certified intellectual, has been my saving grace and guidance around the merciless environment of my own head. What I was lucky enough to have in him is something I wanted to share with you all. If any of you need to rant or have someone to talk to, I offer my inbox and correspondence. Much love to everyone.

Was gently making some art on my laptop, about to go to bed early after doing a little meditation. Then the palpitations began out of nowhere. I tried to sleep anyway but after about an hour and a half of lying in bed with chest pain (and certain im inches from death) i decide theres something wrong and have my wife take me to the ER. Anyway, nothing apparently wrong with my heart... Its ""just"" anxiety. But now ive been up all night, cant go to work tomorrow. But the hardest part is that everyone on the team will want an explanation. ""Hospital? What is it?"" (Its a big building with patients, but thats not important right now). But i dont know what to tell them. Why am i so embarrassed of anxiety? I feel like people assume its a made up thing, or bullshit excuse. I could tell them ""no its real, You'd believe me if you saw me completely crippled by it and sobbing on the ground"" but i dont want to reveal that vulnerability. Does anyone else feel this way? Are you able to admit to hospitalizing anxiety attacks with your coworkers, friends, or family?"

I lived abroad for a year and was depressed and anxious for the duration of my stay. When I returned home, I was extremely depressed and anxious and was having a hard time readjusting to the change. When I returned I told myself to only take a month off to adjust and was telling myself to find a job as soon as possible. Of course this goal was extremely lofty and I started thinking negatively about my use of time, my capabilities, and my motivation to work. I was depressed for several weeks and realized that I could not continue to live with the level of anxiety that I became accustomed to all my life and I'm sick of being depressed after life changes. I started seeing a therapist (for CBT), started working out, and I finally realized that I avoid everything that gives me anxiety or potentially could make me feel anything. I am really, really good at avoiding friends, responding to emails, talking to strangers, taking risks, challenging myself, intimacy, making mistakes etc. I am hesitant to find a job because I am afraid of the anxiety and nervousness that comes along with starting a new position. I initially could not complete my resume because I was afraid of being less than perfect and putting myself out there. With my therapists help I have accepted those feelings and challenged my perfectionism enough to (partially) complete my resume but I'm still struggling. Frankly, I'm not okay with completely accepting my feelings and avoid the vulnerability that comes along with people seeing that I'm less than perfect or put together at all times. I'm having a hard time being okay with the time off I have taken and being okay with the reasons why I haven't found a job yet. I'm having a hard time knowing that if I send my resume to people I'm eventually going to have to interview and I might actually get a job. I fear that I'm setting myself up for another anxious episode (due to the changes that come along with starting a job) and I'm really afraid of being depressed because of it. My therapist has helped me with my motivation and my perfectionism but I still feel stuck and afraid. I've considered taking an antidepressant but my appointment to see a psychiatrist isn't for another few weeks. I don't know if I should wait until I start an antidepressant and then look for a job or start apply now and hopefully be able to cope with the stress with just my therapist. I feel like the longer I'm unemployed the less likely it is that I'll find work. I have trouble not thinking negatively about this ""down time"" and it's hard to accept that I NEED to take time to get my head together. I feel like I'm misplacing my anxiety and finding new things to ruminate and worry about but I don't know what to do... Any thoughts? "
149,cybersecurity,Anxiety,Reflections on my experience with anxiety,1,i7xme8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/i7xme8/reflections_on_my_experience_with_anxiety/,2020-08-12 04:52:55,"Given that 2020 has been, well, quite ""interesting"" so far, I've noticed that my anxiety has increased by a fairly hefty amount. So, I wanted to take time for myself to review pretty much all the anxiety-related advice from my therapist, and I thought I might as well share my ramblings with all you fine people at the same time. Please note, I have posted a comment a while ago which likely contains some or all of the below, but I'm not even going to look at that comment as I write this. The goal of this post is primarily for me to think back and review what I learned about dealing with anxiety, and I hope writing this out here can be helpful to some people. Having said that, let's get started! Anxiety for me: * The origin of anxiety for me is apparently one of the less common ways it manifests in people. For me, one day I was fine, went to bed that night, had a dream that I was walking around my parent's house waiting for my heart to start beating again, and woke up from that dream with the ""wonderful gift"" that anxiety is ... (I hope my dripping sarcasm is evident) * For me, anxiety tends to manifest as health-based anxiety. Typically, anxious thoughts tend to focus on two main categories: heart issues, and breathing issues. I will fixate on my hearbeat, fearing that it will stop. I will be worried about having a heart attack. I will be worried about suddenly not being able to breathe. I will be worried about my chest and neck muscles tightening up so much I can't breathe. Once I get focused on these things, heart rate goes up, breathing gets quicker, and it just keeps spiraling. Woo, so much fun! Medical related thoughts: * Disclaimer: I am not a medical professional. Everything here is from my own experience and discussions with medical professionals. * Medicine: Anti-anxiety medication is certainly an interesting topic. I think I agree with my therapist's view on medication: ""Medication is a handy tool to have in the fight against anxiety, but it shouldn't be something that you should depend on for the rest of your life."" Now, there are obviously exceptions to that statement, but I think, for most people, finding a good anti-anxiety medication is helpful to lower anxiety to the point where you can truly work on developing other anxiety-coping skills. Once you have developed those coping skills, lower the medication dosage and evaluate your life. Maybe you need to go back up in dosage, or maybe you are comfortable trying to go off medication with your increased coping skills. Of course, developing these coping skills is so much easier when you can work with a therapist! * Therapy / Psychiatry: I'm going to cover specifically the medical side up here, and discuss therapy in general down below somewhere. In my instance, I was super lucky to be able to see both a psychiatrist and a therapist. The psychiatrist had a massive amount of experience in helping people deal with anxiety than any of the ""normal"" doctors or RN's, and was able to help me find a medication and dosage level that was right for me. * My medication journey: Let me say this very clearly. I am discussing my own medication story. This is different for every person. I hope me discussing this can be helpful for you in some way. When anxiety first showed up for me, and I finally went to my university's health services, I was first prescribed fluoxetine. That ... did not go well. Fluoxetine is apparently now listed on my medical chart as an allergy that causes panic attacks. I just found that out at my last health checkup. Regardless, I went back to the health services and asked to see the psychiatrist, because I figured they would have more experience with anxiety than the RN. The psychiatrist prescribed me sertraline, and also instructed me to take clonazepam while I was building up to a helpful dosage of sertraline. This apparently worked, as I went off clonazepam once I had been on sertraline for a couple months, and I spent a while on sertraline. Eventually, I felt comfortable enough with the coping skills I had developed through therapy to try lower, and then going off, sertraline. I stopped taking sertraline in 2018. Now, in 2020, I am starting to take sertraline again due to increase anxiety and coping skills seeming to be less effective. * Get a physical exam: Having routine physicals helps reassure me that my body is still healthy. I can also talk about lifestyle choices with my doctor and get her opinion on them and if she thinks they are healthy or not. (E.g., going onto the keto diet, which I'll talk about somewhere below.) If you can, also have bloodwork done. For me, turns out my Vitamin D3 levels are low, and there are apparently a lot of things in the body that Vitamin D3 affects (my doctor didn't go into many details except that having proper levels could help reduce baseline anxiety for me). Therapy: * General thoughts: Seriously, if you experience anxiety (or rather, any sort of mental unwellness), find a therapist to help if you can afford it. If people give you genuine crap for seeking professional help, they are not worth having in your life. I would like to note that my friends and I give each other crap for pretty much anything and everything (including seeing a therapist!), and we understand where our humor-lines are and try not to cross them. If we cross the line, we get told that and learn better where the line is. Open and honest communication is highly valued among my friends. I'm not talking about cutting someone like my friends out who respect boundaries and, if they make a mistake, remember it and do their best to not make that mistake again. I'm talking about cutting someone out who thinks you are weak for showing any sort of weakness emotions. In my opinion, it takes more strength to open up to a stranger and let them try to help you, especially if you need to overcome anxiety in even setting up the appointment and getting there in the first place. * Finding a therapist: I was extremely lucky in that the first therapist I went to, I got along really well with and his therapy style just worked for me. Many people are not that lucky. If you don't get along with or don't like your therapist, there is nothing wrong with finding a new one! A good therapist will recognize that they are not a match for everyone, and will encourage you to find someone else if therapy with them isn't working for you. If a therapist is not supportive of either changing their therapy to better suit you or you finding a new therapist, I'd say it's probably not worth your time sticking with them. Changing therapists is not a sign of weakness, it is simply recognizing that good therapy comes from trust, and you need a therapist you can trust. Does the therapist need to be someone who you would normally be friends with? No. Is it helpful to have a therapist you would consider a friend? Yes. (Please note, you are likely still going to be a client, not a friend, to them. That's ok! What's important is for you to trust and be comfortable with your therapist.) * Therapy in 2020: With the pandemic, many therapists are choosing to hold sessions over skype/webex/zoom/etc. While I have never had this problem, for many people this makes it easier to seek help because they don't need to overcome agoraphobia to even get to an appointment. They can remain in a more comfortable environment while taking those first steps of even getting to an appointment. Prior to the pandemic, many therapists would still offer remote sessions for those who struggle to leave the house (at least, according to my therapist many did), but it wasn't widely known, which made it even harder for some people to seek help. * CBT: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. This is the form of therapy my therapist practiced. It has been helpful for me, but everyone is different. I do recommend giving it a shot, though. What is CBT? The best way I can explain it is honestly with the age-old saying: ""Just don't be anxious!"" Sounds pretty unhelpful, yeah? CBT is (in my own words) retraining the brain so that instead of going down the same mental pathways of anxious thoughts that spiral into more anxious thoughts, it helps you build up an off-ramp over time to get out of that anxiety-spiral. In my therapy, this would essentially be my therapist explaining a mental thought process to help get out of the anxiety-spiral, then eventually practice putting myself in an anxious place and helping me work my way out of that. Eventually I was able to do this well enough that we moved on to other topics to try to reduce baseline levels of anxiety I was feeling. * Other forms of therapy: I'm sure there are other forms of therapy for anxiety that I don't know off the top of my head. Please be open to other types of therapy. Everyone will respond differently to different therapies. There is no one right type of therapy for a given person, just varying levels of effectiveness. Mental ""Tricks"": * General thoughts: This section includes those mental thought process that I learned to help get myself out of spiraling deeper into anxious thought patterns. * Don't claim anxiety: Something my therapist said was to never say ""my anxiety"". This makes anxiety part of your core identity, when it shouldn't be. Instead, say something like ""the anxiety I experience"". The goal here is to, over time, think of anxiety as something that is experienced and will end, rather than something that is to be experienced forever because it's part of you. Is anxiety something many of us will live with for the rest of our lives? Yup. Does that mean we have to be anxious all the time? No! Anxiety and panic attacks are temporary (sometimes I doubt that myself...), and not saying ""my anxiety"" can help reinforce that. (You'll notice I said ""my anxiety"" in the first sentence of this post on accident... I'm just going to leave that there because I still do make mistakes with this.) * Think logically: Anxiety and panic are inherently illogical traits. If you can think logically about how you got into an anxious/panic state, this can help you exit that state. For the health anxiety I experience, it can be thinking about my posture recently to see if I've been slouching and have a tight chest due to that, or did I get enough exercise today, or did I eat something that is causing heartburn. Having a logical reason for why you are feeling the way you are is helpful. You may not be able to always have this logical reason, and that's ok. For me, sometimes bodies are just weird, and while it's hard to accept that fact, this is something that is necessary to accept. It's honeslty not that helpful to have a logical reason for an anxious/panic state be ""bodies are weird, yo"" ... but it's better than nothing for me. * Talk to yourself: I very much speak slower than I think. By talking out loud to myself, I am slowing my thought process down, which helps keep my mind from racing into the anxiety-spiral. Additionally, talking can help regulate breathing, which helps me be less likely to hyperventilate. While trying to step through the road to the anxiety attack and think logically, also speak out loud. I've also found that vocalizing my thoughts helps me be more sure of them, which in turn gives me more confidence that my logical thought process is more correct than the anxious thoughts. * Move: Another item that helps me process anxious thoughts better is to be moving while I'm talking out loud through my thought processes. Thankfully, I've got a fairly large house, so I can pace from one end to the other if I really need to. This still works in smaller spaces, but for me, it's less effective. * Get outside: Removing myself from the place that the anxiety attack occurred is helpful because it provides a visual and environmental change, which in turn helps my brain be more able to think logically. Obviously, getting outside right now can be trickier due to the pandemic and mask requirements, but because there are (hopefully) less people outside, you are less likely to run into people while talking to yourself! Yes, keep talking out loud to yourself, even outside. At least, I do. I'm not shouting at myself, I'm more likely talking on the lowest end of my vocal volume without going into a whisper. Wave and say hi to people. The ""crazy guy"" talking to himself and ignoring everyone is stereotyped to be crazy. The ""crazy guy"" who talks to himself, but still waves hi and greets people and is friendly is much more likely to be viewed as eccentric, not crazy. That's how I think about it, and it works for me. It also helps I don't care too much about what people think of me. * Grounding: This is a technique to help ""ground"" yourself in reality and get out of anxious thought patterns. Personally, this is better done outside for me. I go sit somewhere and start with my sense of sight. I name, out loud, 5 things I can see. Then, I name 4 things I can hear. Then, 3 things I can touch. Then, 2 things I can smell. Finally, 1 thing I can taste. I kinda cheat on the 1 thing to taste by bring some sort of drink outside with me. Play around with the order of the senses! I switched the order around a decent amount to find what worked best for me. * Breathing patterns: Focus on counting a pattern for your breathing. For me, I inhale for 6 counts, hold for 2 counts, exhale for 6 counts, and hold for 2 counts. The exact timing of how long each count is for everyone, and the number of counts for each step, is up to personal preference. I actually spent about 4 or 5 months discussing this on-and-off with my therapist to find a good breathing pattern that worked for me. The important part, for me, is to fully inhale, hold, fully exhale, and hold. The goal is to not hyperventilate, and spending slightly longer inhaling, holding, exhaling, and holding will help prevent that. * Intentional repetitive physical motions: Can't get up and go walk or go outside or something? Start making slow, intentional, repetitive physical motions. Could be anything. Could be slowly crossing and uncrossing your fingers. Large or small doesn't matter. The key is to intentionally focus on it, do it slowly, and do it repetitively. The goal is to give your brain something to focus on that isn't anxiety/panic, so give you a bit of space to start trying to fit logical thinking into the anxiety-spiral and try to get yourself to that mental off-ramp. I use this when I'm, for example, in a meeting and can feel an anxiety attack oncoming. Mental Care: * General thoughts: This section is dedicated to, as my therapist called it, ""lowering baseline anxiety"". * Be intentional about relaxation: I live in America, and it feels like too many people focus on being productive all the time. I've found that I need to not simply relax, but set aside time in my day that I can look ahead at and say to myself ""I have set that time aside to relax"". It's a subtle difference, but the marking time with the intention to relax helps me put my brain into the relaxation mood quicker than just going from working to relaxing. In a way, it makes me feel like a kid looking forward to summer vacation when I can forget about school. I've had people question why I would want to be less productive, and my answer is always ""I am being productive. I'm intentionally doing nothing of value right now so I can produce better value work when I am trying to be productive."" * Stoicism: I recommend looking at the wikipedia entry for this for a much better idea, but this is a school of thought that is essentially aimed at accepting the present as it presents itself. I have not yet looked into this much, but with anxiety having risen back up for me recently, I am starting to look more into stoicism to see what parts I can incorporate into my life that would be helpful. * Meditation: I like meditation. Everyone meditates differently. Personally, I prefer to meditate for shorter periods, inside, in a quiet place. I will sit on a yoga mat in half-lotus (I'm working on trying to get to being able to sit in full-lotus, but that's really hard to do) and focus on a slow breathing pattern. At the bottom of each breath, I will increment a mental counter. My goal is to be mindful enough during my meditation, that I count each breath and after I reach 9, I will reset the counter back to 1. Focusing on each breath and incrementing this looping counter helps me to keep my mind clear of anything else. Of course, thoughts will intrude this meditation, but that's ok. Let them intrude, play out, and disappear. I keep my focus on the slow breathing and looping counter. * Reading: Reading is ... well, I can't read close to bedtime because I just want to keep reading to the detriment of my sleep that night. So, I don't read as much as I want to, but I love reading. Mostly, I use reading as a way to reduce baseline anxiety, not as a way to distract myself from anxiety, because I've found trying to use books to distract from anxiety just means I run from anxiety, not stand up to it. I personally read sci-fi and fantasy books, though I do enjoy some other authors not in those genres. I think the main reason why I primarily enjoy sci-fi and fantasy is that the world settings are just so different from our current world that it helps draw me away into something completely different. * TV / Series / Movies: I tend not to watch too much TV/series/movies. For some reason, I just don't get into them. For some people, though, having a long series that they enjoy watching is comforting. For example, I know someone who pretty much had Friends on repeat because it was so comfortable and calming to them. * Youtube: I'm putting this as a separate category because I've found that Youtube has a good variety of content that works well for helping me relax. I won't put specific creators in here, but in general, my tastes fall into: longer-running strategy games; minecraft; educational; art; and fun, short, stupid videos. Oh, I also use an adblocker so I don't get frustrating ads. Using the adblocker has been so helpful for Youtube to be a place for me to relax with video content I enjoy. * Board games: I really enjoy board games ... when people are actually able to come over. Means I get to play games with friends while I hang out with them in person. This is kinda not possible right now, so board gaming is on hold. There are online options for playing board games, but I haven't tried any so can't give any recommendations. A good group of friends to play board games with, though, is something I do highly value. * Dungeons and Dragons: Oh boy, I love playing DnD. So much that I run a campaign for my friends. We've transitioned to playing online due to the pandemic, which is different and not as fun as playing in person, but playing online is better than not playing. I enjoy the prep work for the sessions too, so it doesn't feel like work to plan out the campaign. I guess the important thing for both DnD and board games is that I can hang out and have fun with friends, even if we can only do it online right now. * Video games: This can be a tricky subject area. I do love my video games, but I also need to recognize that I used to use video games as an escape from reality when I was younger. As I've gotten older, my tastes in video games have changed, and it has taken me a while to recognize that. For me, the important part of using video games as a mental care tool is: am I enjoying the time I'm putting in to it? Most days, I'll want to play an RPG or strategy game, but some days, I'm in the mood to die over and over again in Dark Souls. I just need to be able to recognize what sort of mood I'm in, and to accept that bouncing between 5 games in an hour is fine, as long as I'm enjoying the time I spend playing. I do, however, still need to make sure I'm not trying to use video games as an escape from anxiety (or the world in general). How do I do that? Honestly, I just don't have the endurance to play video games for as long as I used to. I'm currently fine with accepting I'm getting bored playing a game and transitioning onto something else. * Work/life balance: this can be hard to do for a lot of people, but in my specific case, I can set my own hours fairly easily (as long as I'm around for meetings) and only have to average 40 hours per week over the course of the fiscal year. Beyond that, I can flex hours between days and weeks, which means I can make time as needed for being away from work and focusing on my mental health. Additionally, I don't have any work stuff on my personal devices, and no personal stuff on work devices. This means I can have a mental separation between work and home. Even though I'm mostly working from home right now, I have a separate room I go into to work, and can leave work behind in that one specific room to provide that work/home separation I need for better mental health. * Job enjoyment: Do you enjoy your job? I do, and that honestly really helps my mental health and reduces baseline anxiety. It's a job, so of course there are parts I don't enjoy, but overall, I like my job. Most days, I am happy to come into work because I feel like I am contributing to making a better world, even if my role is that is fairly small and specific. (I do research in the crossover between power engineering and cybersecurity.) Job markets are quite ... not fun to deal with right now, and many people can't afford to quit their job, but if you can, I strongly encourage you to do something to enjoy your job more. Maybe that's making an effort to get to know your coworkers better, or maybe it's going back to school for a different degree in a different field. If you can still make ends meet, often times a pay reduction is worth a rise in job enjoyment and happiness. * Pets: I personally believe having pets is very beneficial for the mental health of most people. We have two cats, and they are cute and adorable and even though they can be needy attention-seeking turdbutts sometimes, they make me happy and I love them a lot. Being able to watch those two zoom around the house or just sleep peacefully has a calming effect on my mind, and having a pet come up to you to cuddle with you and sleep on your lap is just so wonderful, because they trust and love you. * Significant other: If you are like me and have an SO, include them in your struggles. Let them know what you're going through. Open and honest communication is, in my opinion, key to a good relationship. I actually asked my wife (then-girlfriend) to come with me to a couple therapy sessions so she could see how my therapist worked, and ask him advice on how she could help me through anxiety/panic attacks. This has been so helpful for me, as she is able to help reinforce and guide me through those mental tricks when I'm having trouble doing it. * Check-in with people: I have found that it is so helpful for me to be able to check in with my friends and see how they are doing, and we can chat about our lives. I've got friends who are ready to listen if anxiety is up, just like I'm ready to listen if they are having trouble that day. I think it is extremely beneficial to be able to share feelings and emotions with people, as otherwise we just keep bottling them up. In my experience, this is not healthy. I'm naturally an introvert, but I definitely do still need to talk to other people. * Personal grooming: Sometimes, I do like spending all day in my pj's and not showering. However, I have noticed that on those days that anxiety levels are typically higher. It's still important to me to take laid-back days like that, but I do have to recognize that getting up and showering and taking care of personal grooming and getting dressed has a good effect on my mental health. Some days, if I wake up feeling really bad, just taking time to make myself look and smell good helps so much more than I expect it to. * Plants: I am ok at taking care of plants, but simply having the greenery in my home office is so helpful to keep my mood up during the day. Yup, I have to remember to water them, but it is nice to have a watering routine for them, because it helps to solidify in my mind what day of the week it is. * Art: For me, having a creativity outlet is apparently really good, even though I did not expect to need one. Prior to the pandemic, I was painting miniature figurines for use in my DnD games, but now my home office setup and plants have taken over that room, so I'm missing being able to have an area to spread out easily and paint mini's. However, I did recently pick up some alcohol markers and have been coloring in adult coloring books with them and enjoying that! For those wondering, one is a Discworld book, and the other is a Serenity book. Exercise: * General thoughts: A very common piece of advice given to people with anxiety is: ""Go exercise!"" Well, in most cases, this piece of advice seems to be correct. Exercise is helpful for spending excess energy we have, and at the same time it helps you to get more fit. When I exercise consistently, my baseline anxiety is definitely lower. When I don't exercise, baseline anxiety goes up. Everyone will have different preferences for exercise, and that's ok! Personally, I prefer weightlifting. However, given that I don't think it would be a healthy idea to go to my gym right now, I am more focusing on running and bodyweight exercise. Just recently I was able to run three miles straight for the first time in my life! I've also noticed that, generally, on days i run baseline anxiety is lower. However, even bodyweight exercise helps reduce baseline anxiety more than doing nothing. Something to be careful of, though, is over-exercise. I have to make sure to build a rest day in because, even though anxiety is likely to be higher on a rest day for me, that rest day will let me exercise better the rest of the week, decreasing baseline anxiety levels more and helping me to get more fit. * Yoga: My therapist highly highly highly recommended yoga as something I do regularly. I should have listened to him from the first time. Yoga is super helpful for me, because it combines static strength along with flexibility and stretching out tight muscles. * Running: Cardio is good, and will help in the zombie apocalypse. I've found I like running much more when I started with the following plan: run for X minutes, walk for Y minutes, X + Y = 10 minutes. Slowly bump up time spent running and reduce time spent walking. Instead of feeling like I was dying at the end of a run, I could feel like a got a good workout. * Walking: Can't run for some reason? Go on a walk! Less hard on the body, and you've got more time to smell the roses as you go past them! * Cycling: Bicycling is much easier on the body than running (in my opinion), but it also works different muscles than running. For me, I do enjoy cycling, but I've found that having to lean forward for much of the ride makes it less helpful when a common cause for anxious thoughts for me is a tight chest. However, there are days that a bicycle ride just sounds better than anything else. * Weightlifting: My preferred exercise. I like it because it just feels good to my body. Don't really have any other reason why. Of course, a muscle-building diet can come with the cost of building body fat too, so management of that part is important too. (More on this later.) There are multiple styles of weightlifting in my opinion: powerlifting, strongman, and bodybuilding. I personally try to strike a balance between all three styles, but more towards bodybuilding. If you want to get more into weightlifting, check out how each of those three styles structure workouts and see what appeals to you the most. * Bodyweight: Bodyweight exercise is a good way to lean up and build lean muscle, and can be done at home with very little or zero equipment. Some people really get into it, I personally use it as a way to cross-train endurance on muscle groups. * Group fitness: I personally don't enjoy them too much, but some people much prefer group fitness courses. My wife is one of them. She actually is certified to teach a few different fitness classes, and fitness classes really help motivate her to go work out. Physical care: * General thoughts: This section includes ways to physically help your body relax. This is super important for me because extremely tight muscles can often cause anxiety attacks, but I hope there are some tips that are helpful to you. Once again, this section aims to ""lower baseline anxiety"". * Baths: I. Love. Baths. Yes, I get sweaty, but the warm water just helps my muscles relax so much better than a hot pack. Baths stay warmer longer and cover more skin area. What's really nice is when it's winter and I can open the bathroom window and get cool air as a contrast to the hot water. But, if you can, I suggest trying different ways of taking a bath. Do you like baths in silence? Music playing? Video playing on a laptop? I prefer having some sort of media up while I take a bath. What about bath salts? Maybe a fun bath bomb? I've found some scents of bath salts are nice, and others are too overpowering. Bath salts / epsom salts / soaking salts may or may not help with muscle relaxation, but regardless, a pleasant scent you enjoy will help you enjoy the bath more, leading to a more relaxing bath. That's my philosophy. * Standing desk: I'm really lucky in that I have access to a standing workbench at home to work at (non-lab work is happening remotely for my job), as well as a standing desk in my cubicle whenever we are able to go back and work from the campus. Using a standing desk helps me relax my shoulders, which in turns helps the rest of my upper body to relax. * Stretching: I'm separating this from yoga and the exercise section in general because, overall, I believe it is good to take time out of your day to do a few stretches, particularly if you sit a lot. I am fairly consistently microbreaking throughout the day to stretch out my shoulders or legs or something. This is helpful for me because I can feel the difference between days where I do small stretches over the course of the day and days where I don't, and I feel much better on days where I get good stretching in. * Diet / Eating style: I think I've finally found a good ""diet"" that my body feels good on. Basically, I eat a fairly normal ""healthy American"" diet for most of the year (mostly eating fairly healthy, with some Taco Bell thrown in because I love Taco Bell), and spend 3-4 months a year on keto. This is because I want to build some muscle, but also want to manage the body-fat buildup that comes with a bulking diet. I have discussed this with my doctor, and she was quite happy with this eating plan, and additionally my body seems to be responding well to it. That good response is the most important part, to me. Pretty much any sort of diet you can go on can be considered a current or former fad diet, but talk to a professional and see how your body responds. Pay attention to how your body and mind feel at different weights and body compositions. Find something that is physically and mentally healthy for you, and is sustainable. Having a body that physically feels good is so helpful in reducing baseline anxiety for me. Again, I would like to stress once more, please work with a professional for this part! While this was a wall of text, I hope that you found something useful in here. I do know that typing this all out was helpful for me, as it reminded me of multiple things my therapist and I had discussed that I had previously forgotten about. If you have any questions on my experiences or thoughts with anything here, please feel free to ask, whether in the comments or as a PM if you'd rather not comment publicly."
150,cybersecurity,Anxiety,How Internet can ruin your entire life,1,hkza2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/hkza2d/how_internet_can_ruin_your_entire_life/,2020-07-04 17:16:46,"First of all, my first language is not English so.. It might be little uncomfortable to read :) +If this post doesn't fit here please leave a comment! It all started from last year. I was on the internet, I was visiting here and there. But then suddenly I witnessed something weird. So weird and creepy that made me almost cry. It was a video of me. Well, more sepcifically, a leaked [insert facepalm here] kind of video of me I took. My face was not on there but I immediately knew it was me. Yep. I was hacked. Without even knowing anything. And then my life has changed completely. I became extremely, EXTREMELY paranoid (mainly about cybersecurity stuff). And I mean REALLY paranoid. I started to doubt everything. I started making up weird irrational thoughts in my head to figure out what exactly caused this. I searched about all kinds of shits on google. THAT was nightmare. I was becoming more and more irrational and paranoid(and I am STILL quite paranoid.) The thoughts I made up were so irrational that if I tell about them to other people they would ignore that. I didn't even watch Netflix. I didn't even take selfie or anything anymore.. well this is reasonable I guess. Now I don't even turn light on my room now(that is because I fear that there MIGHT be a sort of shady backdoor chip(I know. I know. Tech guys would laugh at me and I would laugh too.. Just if I were not this paranoid) on my lightbulb or whatever so I'd end up get hacked again.) I use freakin candle at night now. And I use match to light them. Well some of you guys would say if you are that paranoid how tf you're on the interent. That's kinda right but hey, I'm telling you. All this is completely irrational and weird lol. I'm starting to doubt myself too. Like when I lock the door, I start to make up weird reasons in my head that the door wouldn't be properly locked(sorry, English is so difficult) even though it WOULD be properly locked. So I repeat the same thing several times just to literally convince myself about the fact that the goddamn door would be properly locked. I format my computer every day, and I factory resetted my phone over 50 times til now. I've spent 12 hours on that sort of stuff yesterday. Maybe it's just me being that kind of easily-being-paranoid person but I live like this anyway. I DO miss my old life when I didn't bothered with formatting computer for 12 hours a day.. but I just can't help with that. Anyway.. I think this is it. I just wanted to share my story.. Lol. I really hope you guys won't go through this nightmare. +I feel like at this point I do need help. If anybody knows what to do about this please leave a comment below. Seeing a therapist isn't possible now sadly."
151,cybersecurity,Anxiety,Is anyone else concerned about their cybersecurity and paranoid about the dark side of the internet from time to time?,1,gxy0oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gxy0oq/is_anyone_else_concerned_about_their/,2020-06-07 06:04:29,"The fact that there are particular people who strive to ruin others' prescence or life through means of data breaching and whatnot, while it might not directly involve vigilant and reticent people who know to avoid being stupid, is one that causes me to essentially freak out about things from catastrophic thinking based on the fact I make posts outlining my life to being completely broken when it comes to viruses and malware on hardware. Additionally, the fact that our IP addresses, basically what I think are key geographical identifiers, are out there through simply making an internet footprint, no matter how small, just adds more fuel to this fire - but I guess that's really a matter of how, not when or if. This doesn't even feel like that large of a priority over dealing with my health anxiety - which makes sense."

Originally I was a bio major but changed because I didnt like chem and it too hard and stressful the only thing I was good at was the math but my math skills can only reach up so far. I literally went up to precalc/trig and I stopped there and thought about being a math major but that involves java programming and I'm not up for it. Honestly, I don't like anything besides playing video games. I don't want to make that into a career. Everything stresses me out. Im so stressed on what i want to study because living in Florida is expensive and dropping out to work at a normal job isnt gonna pay the bills. I literally made a list of what I should study but could not think of one thing. I dont like being a teacher, psychology, law, medical like nurse or doctor, any humanities or liberal art or literature im doing right now cybersecurity and I hate coding its a fucken night mare for me. I was literally working at a medical recepitionist and I wanna quit because its to much for me and they are already training me for front desk when I dont even know how to use the system well. And its to fast pace. Honestly, I feel so fucken useless I dont wanna drop out also because I dont want to be the girl in my family that dropped out because I was too stressed or too much anxiety to go to school. I literally cry and think about this all the time. I just dont like anything literally there nothing for me and if I cant handle being a receptionist then what the fuck am I good for? Literally I'm going to my last resort as a radiography/x-ray tech because my mom just gave me that option and I took because I dont know what else to do and its only a 2 year program."

I'm a junior in university studying cybersecurity. I am grateful and thankful to have made it this far. I'm not sure what I really want to do in life but I have goals. I want to own three cars, a nice huge house, travel, etc. I want to get into filmmaking, editing and photography, music production. My situation however has made me so anxious all the time thinking about the future. I grew up on affordable housing, mother has depression and anxiety, developmentally delayed brother. Both had cancer. Mother lost her social security income last year and we've been on edge of homelessness yet she persists I finish my bachelors degree. I'm going into debt. cost of attendance of 2018-19 is 28k. No financial assistance whatsoever for my program. I want to just focus on the present goals, get a job, certifications, internships, etc. But when I do these things, I lack the motivation to commit to it, to stick to it. My last retail job as a stock associate, I left after the first day of work. All these financial thoughts have made me resent the U.S. government for their lack of healthcare and their high tuition rates and debt, homelessness, mental health issues. TL;DR - broke college student growing up low income can't commit to anything and the thought of this and my financial situation gets me anxious thank you all for taking the time to read this. "
