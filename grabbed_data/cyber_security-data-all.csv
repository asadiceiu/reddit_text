When a user types a domain name in the browser, a program available in the operating system known as DNSresolver searches for IP address of that domain name. First, DNS resolver searches its own local cache and check if it already has the IP address for that domain. If it does not find it in the local cache, It queries a DNS server to check if it knows the accurate IP address for that domain. DNS servers work in a loop which means they are able to query each other to find the DNS server that knows the correct IP address of the domain name. As soon as DNS resolver locates the IP address, it returns the IP address to requesting program. DNS caches domain address for future use as well. Though Domain Name System is quite powerful yet it seems less focused toward the security. Maybe thats why we are noticing different types of DNS attack. To minimize the possibilities of DNS attack, server administrators must take some necessary steps. They can use an upgraded version of DNS software and regularly configure servers to duplicate. At a personal level, users can flush their DNS cache to avoid security risks. If you dont know how to flush DNS, read a resourceful post at ICSS India. How Hackers Use DNS? The biggest issues with DNS system is that if on any account a hacker is able to find a way to replace the authorized IP address of a website with rogue IP address, then any person trying to access that website will be sent to a bogus address. The user would not have any idea that he is accessing the wrong address. One of the major problems with DNS server configuration is that it does not remember its default configuration. Attackers take advantage of this loophole. Types of DNS Attack Over the past few years, a sudden increase has been noticed in DNS attacks. And this attack is not limited to small websites only. Numerous popular websites such as Reddit, Spotify, Twitter have also complained about their inaccessibility to thousands of their users. As DNS attacks are becoming all too common, we should learn to identify DNS attack so that we can tackle the situation in a better. Lets have a look at types of DNS attacks. Zero-day attack In this type of attack, the attacker exploits a formerly unknown vulnerability in the DNS server software or protocol stack. Fast Flux DNS Hackers swap DNS record in and out at high frequency to redirect DNS requests. This technique helps attacker avoid detection as well. DNS-Spoofing DNS spoofing is also known as DNS cache poisoning. It is a type of computer security hacking. Attackers or hackers corrupt the whole DNS server by replacing the authorized IP address with the bogus IP address in the servers cache. This way they redirect the whole traffic to a malevolent website and collect the crucial information. This is the one of the most popular phishing techniques attacker use to steal the information. Because users type correct domain address in their browsers, they never realize that are accessing a fake or rogue website. Therefore, it becomes challenging to detect this attack. Sometimes, users are not able to find it until the time to live (TTL) expires. TTL or time to live is the time till DNS resolver remember the DNS query before it gets expired. The best method to prevent DNS cache poisoning attack should be time to time clearing of DNS cache. DDoS Attack on DNS DDoS attack is referred to as Distributed Denial-of-service attack. It usually arises when multiple systems flood the resources of a targeted system. Attackers can use this attack against different types of systems which include DNS server as well. DDoS attack can crash the whole DNS server and make users unable to access the web. However, they will be able to access websites they have accessed recently if they are saved in the local cache. DNS server attack can be a huge network security issue. Therefore, it should not be taken lightly by businesses. They should implement state-of-the-art safeguards to reduce and prevent the effects of such attacks. How you can defend this attack depends on the role of your systems in the environment. However, you may take the following steps. Get regular insight into what is actually going on in a network. You can take the help of technologies like IPFIX, NetFlow, etc. for the same. DDoS attacks usually enter into the network that has excessive packet per second rates. Think of some good solutions for it. Final Words DNS attacks can be lethal to your security. Therefore, you must take every possible step to prevent them. Have you ever been a victim of DNS attack? How did you prevent them? Do share your experiences with us "

In the Synology website they claim IPS is included but looking at Qualys Guard I do not see anything related to IPS. Norton Core also only mention Network level protection but there is no details provided. The only thing so far is Asus which has a TrendMicro IPS which their technical details shows that they indeed have an IPS. Is there any other home users router with such functionality?

Hackers around the world take advantage of the current situation for cyber espionage. Its time to increase cyber-hygiene and online safety even more than before. Healthcare providers and related services have a unique requirement for security of data placed upon them by The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (**HIPAA**) laws and rules. HIPPA requires a stringent adherence to the protection of data about patients. This includes assuring the data is not otherwise destroyed and is always available for healthcare professionals to reference and access in the performance of their responsibilities. This set of requirements and implementations often cause issues with ease of access between medical facilities, both external and internal, as well as the patient being able to access their own records from a single point. Today, in **COVID-19 era**, healthcare industry is facing much bigger cybersecurity challenges than ever. Hackers around the world take advantage of the current situation for **cyber espionage**. Its time to **increase cyber-hygiene and online safety** even more than before. [**Fragglestorm** can aid in providing secure management of access to patient records and other medical data. ](URL assures its availability and resiliency even after a ransomware attack. Recent revelations that hackers have bypassed even two factor authentication (2FA) methods demonstrate the need to seek out the best security solutions to prevent theft of data and the tremendous costs (fines, records loss, etc.) associated with data breaches and ransomware. According to the report, healthcare breaches cost organizations $6.45 million per breach or an average of $429 per record. Fragglestorm provides several core functions that address the needs of those faced with providing services in the Healthcare field: **Data is always** **secured by use of**: o Encryption * Data is encrypted according to user-selected algorithms and keys * Cybervore has no backdoor method to access encrypted data or otherwise recover owners lost keys o Smart Data Fragmentation * The data is fragmented as specified making it impossible to be of use to a hacker even if copied * This is comparable to going to a puzzle store and dumping all the puzzle pieces on the floor * A hacker cant determine what piece goes with another piece to even begin encryption cracking * Fragglestorm fragments are smart, a.k.a. Smart Fragments * Any fragments missing (with replication) will be automatically recreated * Fragments can be reassembled into files without the control database * The authentication credentials must be presented * Only an authorized data portion in use (in memory) is ever viewable outside of Fragglestorm' **Data is kept highly available** **by replication** Loss of access to a given storage location is transparently handled with no user or IT intervention **Data is resilient by versioning** o Ransomware attacks - Once the ransomware has been contained, a Fragglestorm utility can identify attacked files and automatically revert the last good copy in place o This function allows rapid recovery from ransomware infections **Managed Data Distribution** **for supporting data transition to multiple cloud services** o Fragglestorm can actively aid in management of storage in hybrid multicloud storage environments o Data according to specified filters, and parameters can be distributed across cloud, and local storage to specification **Interfaces with everything** o The main interface is presented as a letter-drive, such as a C:\\, in Microsoft Windows * Any number of drives may be defined * Each drive can have different end storage configurations with Geolocation specifications (if supported by storage location) * Each drive can have different fragmentation, replication, and versioning specified o Allows any activity or process to be performed in a secure manner * The data is always protected * Results of operations are automatically protected in real time by simply locating them on the defined drive * Allows indexing and other operations to occur without loss of protection on the data * Resultant indexes and metadata are automatically secured * Indexing occurs across all cloud location and storage devices transparently **Data Sharing** o Fragglestorm provides for data sharing and access to multiple users o Several users can be defined for every defined drive * Each user can have different defined levels of access * Recommended to prevent one user from controlling access to data o Select folders and files can be shared securely via methods similar to Google Drive, Dropbox, and etc. **Performance** o Fragglestorm was designed with performance as a primary requirement, the user sees no change in speed o Utilization of low level operating system components provides the highest level of security possible o Fragglestorm provides the user the same performance experience by utilizing low level operating system methods Fragglestorm can be easily adopted to work with existing medical record systems to further armor the system against hackers and other issues that would prevent the required access to the medical records."
22,cybersecurity,cyber_security,How Smart Data Fragmentation will Change the World,1,g74xgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/cyber_security/comments/g74xgw/how_smart_data_fragmentation_will_change_the_world/,2020-04-24 18:47:10," Recently our CEO Frederick Callis was interviewed by CEOCFO Magazine. **CEOCFO:** ***Mr. Callis, what is Cybervore?*** **Mr. Callis**: Cybervore is a cybersecurity software company. We make a product called [Fragglestorm](URL which provides a secure method to help businesses transition their data to cloud services. How secure? It makes data useless to any unauthorized person- only an authorized user can access their data. Cool, right? URL **CEOCFO:** ***How does Fragglestorm go beyond encryption?*** **Mr. Callis:** Well, encryption jumbles the actual data but keeps the data all together. Through certain brute-force technologies, todays encryption can be compromised. Soon, through the commercialization of quantum computing, encryption will become handicapped and broken. To protect and manage data in todays multicloud services world, the Fragglestorm process takes the actual data, uses the encryption but then fragments the data into multiple puzzle-like pieces. We then wrap technology around those pieces, thereby making the data smart, which by the way, we call Smart Fragments. As such, these smart fragments become impossible to break or reassemble unless you are the authorized user. &amp;#x200B; URL For example, if a document was stolen or compromised in any way, even if the encryption is broken, the hackers only have a very small piece of the puzzle. It gets better. Lets take lots of data in general and all of these are turned into smart fragments. If we dump them all together, you can start to see how hard it is to hack through or try to break them. Finally, lets make it even more difficult. Lets place those pieces in different locations across storage devices or cloud services. As a result, Fragglestorm allows the data to become ultra-secure and hardened against being broken or useful by any bad actors. **CEOCFO:** ***Is this a novel approach? Has it been tried before? Is it in use now in other ways?*** **Mr. Callis:** Yes. Think of how data is stored on a disc drive on any computer. Data is separated into pieces on a disc drive which allows the data to be stored more efficiently. However, when you put data on a network or cloud service, you are outside the data center which is why businesses are so concerned about security and resiliency. Regarding how it is in use in other ways, up until recently, encrypting the data was good enough. But times are changing and we believe encryption plus Fragglestorm can fill the void specifically against encryption-breaking systems such as quantum computing. Our approach enables the fragments themselves to reassemble into a file when authenticated credentials are presented. In todays marketplace other companies may use fragmentation, but no one has developed software that simultaneously assures availability, accessibility, security and ransomware recovery into one product. **CEOCFO:** ***How do you create a system that will do this? How do you separate the data and how do you put it back together?*** **Mr. Callis:** It is based upon mathematical algorithms and processes. There is a lot of detail that goes into how fragments are made and how they are made smart. They are connected almost a little bit like the blockchain concept, but it is not public blockchain. It is more of a private blockchain built for performance. As such, a smart fragment would know another smart fragment; how they all go together. You cannot even come up with fake fragments, because they are intelligent to each other. Awesome, right? **CEOCFO:** ***Who is using this?*** **Mr. Callis:** Right now we are a software startup. We have early adopter customers that wish to remain anonymous and we have a product release scheduled for the end of this year. **CEOCFO:** ***Who would be the most likely types of companies, industries or size of organizations that you would be targeting? Who needs this more than others?*** **Mr. Callis:** Our initial target market is small to medium-size businesses. They are the biggest targets of cybercriminals and we can help them the most. As far as industry verticals: healthcare, financial services, and legal/accounting. **CEOCFO:** ***Would you be working through MSPs or would you be looking at reaching the end customer directly?*** **Mr. Callis:** We work through both MSPs and carriers to offer Fragglestorm. They are market-positioned between their users and cloud services which makes them ideal to work with. Fragglestorm offers MSPs and carriers new ways to further protect their customers as they transition their data to multiple cloud providers. To them, this is a competitive value. **CEOCFO:** ***When you are speaking to the right person, do they recognize the concept and the effectiveness?*** **Mr. Callis:** Yes. The example I use is: take your name and social security number as one saved document. By using Fragglestorm, the document is encrypted and then fragmented. Those pieces are wrapped in our secret sauce, copied or replicated as well as versioned into multiple copies. These pieces are then intelligently stored across different locations which could include on-premise devices, PCs/servers, or multiple cloud services. The value here is even if the data is stolen, the hackers only have a piece - if they can break it. That is how Fragglestorm makes data ultra-secure and manageable anywhere. **CEOCFO:** ***Would this be in conjunction with other security measures? How does this come together?*** **Mr. Callis:** We complement other security solutions - we do not replace them. In other words, sometimes the hackers get in or a virus infects computers and servers. They will always need other security products to help them. We are the last line of defense. What we do is make the data useless to any unauthorized user no matter where the data is located; only an authorized user can access and reassemble their data. **CEOCFO:** ***Are you seeking funding, partnership or investment as you move forward?*** **Mr. Callis:** Yes. We need money to grow. We have a great management team which is experienced in building new businesses. But in this cybersecurity marketplace, rapid growth requires capital and strategic alliances. It takes a village. We are in a business where hopefully, a.k.a. through hard work, we can align with the right lead investment firm. **CEOCFO:** ***When did you recognize that this was the way to go as a product? When did you recognize this was something needed and that you could do it?*** **Mr. Callis:** About two years ago, we were awarded a patent for Smart Data Fragmentation after years of researching and looking deeper into the security and management of data. We found so many businesses were getting hacked or ransomed regardless of all the security products they had installed. We also noticed that corporate hacks and breach reports were showing up on national and global news channels, not just on tech news. With the rise of quantum-computing which greatly handicaps encryption and the ongoing exposure to financial penalties, legal, and compliance problems, we concluded there is a huge growing market place for smart data fragmentation. **CEOCFO:** ***There are so many ideas to look at regarding cyber security. Why Cybervore now?*** **Mr. Callis:** Data is a businesss most important asset and it is also a huge liability. Todays basic business operations and intelligence require data to be safe and resilient. If they cannot get to their data to make decisions or operate, they are out of business. This is especially true for small to medium-sized businesses which are the fastest-growing piece of the U.S. economy. Fragglestorm can help businesses simplify their access to multiple cloud services while keeping their data safe because there is protection no matter where the data is located. We are evolving into a cloud services mobile world where data needs to be as intelligent as the systems and networks that process it. Cybervore hopes to be a big part of this movement with Fragglestorm. Thank you for the opportunity to be featured in the CEO/CFO magazine."

I will be upfront and start by saying I have no professional computer science or cybersecurity experience. I earned my bachelor's degree \~2 years ago in International Security with a minor in Arabic, and I am currently completing my first semester of graduate school toward a master's in Cybersecurity. I work full time as an accountant, and would like to work toward a career dealing with computer forensics/investigations/cybercrime, although I am flexible on the field matter. That being said, I am willing to do just about anything to get my foot in the door. Internships, a minimum wage job, whatever it takes just to get started. I am in the Portland, OR area, but I am also flexible on relocation. I am moderately proficient with Java, Python, and SQL. I am intensively growing my networking skills at this time. I will be taking the ISACA Cybersecurity exam in December, and then I aim to have my CCNA no later than June of next year. What more can I do to make myself employable? To me, the idea of approaching a company and saying ""Hi, I've never done this before, and I have 0 hands on experience, so please take me in and show me how to do new stuff"" seems pretty crazy. On the other hand, I am very sharp on learning new things and willing to take on any job with a good attitude/growth mindset. I know projects are king when it comes to getting programming jobs, but do projects matter at all in cybersecurity? What other skills or certs would you recommend? Please accept an enormous and sincere thank you on my part, for anyone who takes a moment to respond. Being new in a field is always challenging, but I know this is where I am meant to be, and I am ready to take on anything."

And pretty much all of them were either on how to build securely for the robot manufacturers/developers, or a 5-step list like, change the default password, read the terms and conditions, think about whether you really want to be connected, keep the software updated, and research the manufacturer/developer to see their stance on security. Is this really all I can do? I mean, they're good advice, and I know only the manufacturers/developers of the robot can actually make a difference, but I was hoping for advice on something more than I could do to secure the robot. I did see some recommendations to use a VPN when I specifically searched for it, but does it really help secure the robot? For example, could it prevent an unauthorized person from getting access to my robot's camera by pretending to be the server or an authorized user like me?

To date I've had a few interviews at large companies for various cybersecurity analyst/engineering roles and I keep getting stumped with a specific type of question. See question below.

What is DNS Hijacking?, What is DNS attack? What is DNS attack?, What is host Records? What is host Records?DNS attack, In todays post, we will come to know about DNS Attacks, how they work and how to fight against them What is DNS Attack? Indeed, DNS attacks happen when a hacker is able to find weaknesses to exploit in the DNS (Domain Name System). Hackers take advantage of vulnerabilities make DNS attack possible. In order to understand, how DNS attacks actually work, you will have to first understand how DNS works. For those who dont know, domain name system is a protocol that interprets an alphabetic domain name into IP address. In short, its major function is to convert a user-friendly domain name into the computer-friendly IP address. How DNS Works? When a user types a domain name in the browser, a program available in the operating system known as DNSresolver searches for IP address of that domain name. First, DNS resolver searches its own local cache and check if it already has the IP address for that domain. If it does not find it in the local cache, It queries a DNS server to check if it knows the accurate IP address for that domain. DNS servers work in a loop which means they are able to query each other to find the DNS server that knows the correct IP address of the domain name. As soon as DNS resolver locates the IP address, it returns the IP address to requesting program. DNS caches domain address for future use as well. Though Domain Name System is quite powerful yet it seems less focused toward the security. Maybe thats why we are noticing different types of DNS attack. To minimize the possibilities of DNS attack, server administrators must take some necessary steps. They can use an upgraded version of DNS software and regularly configure servers to duplicate. At a personal level, users can flush their DNS cache to avoid security risks. If you dont know how to flush DNS, read a resourceful post at ICSS India. How Hackers Use DNS? The biggest issues with DNS system is that if on any account a hacker is able to find a way to replace the authorized IP address of a website with rogue IP address, then any person trying to access that website will be sent to a bogus address. The user would not have any idea that he is accessing the wrong address. One of the major problems with DNS server configuration is that it does not remember its default configuration. Attackers take advantage of this loophole. Types of DNS Attack Over the past few years, a sudden increase has been noticed in DNS attacks. And this attack is not limited to small websites only. Numerous popular websites such as Reddit, Spotify, Twitter have also complained about their inaccessibility to thousands of their users. As DNS attacks are becoming all too common, we should learn to identify DNS attack so that we can tackle the situation in a better. Lets have a look at types of DNS attacks. Zero-day attack In this type of attack, the attacker exploits a formerly unknown vulnerability in the DNS server software or protocol stack. Fast Flux DNS Hackers swap DNS record in and out at high frequency to redirect DNS requests. This technique helps attacker avoid detection as well. DNS-Spoofing DNS spoofing is also known as DNS cache poisoning. It is a type of computer security hacking. Attackers or hackers corrupt the whole DNS server by replacing the authorized IP address with the bogus IP address in the servers cache. This way they redirect the whole traffic to a malevolent website and collect the crucial information. This is the one of the most popular phishing techniques attacker use to steal the information. Because users type correct domain address in their browsers, they never realize that are accessing a fake or rogue website. Therefore, it becomes challenging to detect this attack. Sometimes, users are not able to find it until the time to live (TTL) expires. TTL or time to live is the time till DNS resolver remember the DNS query before it gets expired. The best method to prevent DNS cache poisoning attack should be time to time clearing of DNS cache. DDoS Attack on DNS DDoS attack is referred to as Distributed Denial-of-service attack. It usually arises when multiple systems flood the resources of a targeted system. Attackers can use this attack against different types of systems which include DNS server as well. DDoS attack can crash the whole DNS server and make users unable to access the web. However, they will be able to access websites they have accessed recently if they are saved in the local cache. DNS server attack can be a huge network security issue. Therefore, it should not be taken lightly by businesses. They should implement state-of-the-art safeguards to reduce and prevent the effects of such attacks. How you can defend this attack depends on the role of your systems in the environment. However, you may take the following steps. Get regular insight into what is actually going on in a network. You can take the help of technologies like IPFIX, NetFlow, etc. for the same. DDoS attacks usually enter into the network that has excessive packet per second rates. Think of some good solutions for it. Final Words DNS attacks can be lethal to your security. Therefore, you must take every possible step to prevent them. Have you ever been a victim of DNS attack? How did you prevent them? Do share your experiences with us "

I have been wanting to expand my career into the field of Cyber Security( I have done a few things with penetration testing using Kali Linux), I was wondering if I would benefit more from a associate/bachelor in cyber security or from certifications. The certification that I think will be useful are as follows: Certified Computer Examiner (CCE) Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) Cisco Certified Design Associate (CCDA) Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP) CompTIA A+ CompTIA Linux+ CompTIA Network+ CompTIA Security+ Computer Security Incident Handler (CSIH) LPIC-1 Microsoft Certified IT Professional (MCITP) Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE) Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert/Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSE/MCSA) Mobile Forensic Certified Examiner (MFCE) There are some on this list that I doubt will be of use(such as comptia a+ lol) Which of these certifications are worth it? Would you hire someone in the field of CyberSecurity with these credentials? Overall what can I do to further myself into this rapidly growing field? Any and all help is greatly appreciated. If you have any questions for me just ask. Thanks"

I would like employer name and position (job title), if possible. I'm only going to ask for first name. Some form of email contact may be needed for verification. This is a new requirement for this particular grant, so I haven't been given much direction. I planned to put together some simple questions like ""How did you get started?"", ""What's good/bad?"", and ""Reccomendations?"" I will try to include enough questions such that interviewees may choose a handful to answer. I just need to submit something like a page or less report. I'm also interested in conducting more than two interviews, so I may select the ones easiest and most beneficial to report. Thanks for the help and if interested please comment or PM."

Advice/Help Appreciated!!,2,44itps,https://www.reddit.com/r/cyber_security/comments/44itps/new_to_the_field_of_cybersecurity_completely_lost/,2016-02-07 10:41:43,"So, I am completely new to the field of cyber/information security. I understand that it is a very vague term. I graduated with a BA in History and minors in Biology and Chemistry. I was enrolled in a medical school in the caribbeans but realized that my chances are slim to none if I am going to continue pursuing medicine. I want to switch tracks before it is too late. I love technology, love messing around with my computers yadda yadda yadda.. I have experience of coding in C++ and VB and A+ ages ago but need a fresher.. I am 27 y/o and I know its a bit late but I have currently enrolled in UMUC's cybersecurity BS program. Since I don't really have any clue of how the field operates, I figured that a BS would be more effective than an MS. I am specifically interested in doing penetration testing and working my way up to becoming a Information Security Analyst from where I can expand on my horizon years down the road. I plan on gaining Net+, Sec+ and A+ certs about 6 months down the road with my BS. What would be some advice you would give this noob on how to get my foot in and what jobs should I be looking for. I've heard an array of people suggest help desk jobs and working your way up but are there any other alternatives? I've been looking for internships, but it seems I might be too old for that as they want undergrads more than often and not career switchers like me. What do I do to self-educate myself (coursera, udemy, etc) and get a foot into an IT job?? Any advice would be completely appreciated... I am so lost"
