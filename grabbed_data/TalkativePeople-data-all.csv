For example, there are people who have sexual urges toward buildings, and people who eat metal. I would consider those full blown mental illnesses. They have no logical cause or reason. In the case of dysphoria, an interesting statistic is that there are something like 4 MtF cases for every FtM case. Thus for some weird reason, **males want to be female far more than the converse.** Most people would chalk this up to the false premise of the ""feminization of schooling and society"" without actually giving any examples as to why that is the case. Instead, I think that there are fundamental incompatibilities between the genders. To be specific, that a female personality just doesn't work in a male body. Conversely, a male personality can work relatively fine in a female body. The best analogy I can give is young v. old. If you could somehow swap a 35 year old man into a 5 year old's body, nothing would really go wrong. If you swapped a 5 year old mind into a 35 year old body, that abomination would be put into a mental institute. Ultimately the reasoning for these two situations are the same. Traits of ""femininity"" and of ""youth"" are both traits of helplessness, vulnerability, and dependence. People will accept and even nurture these traits, **but only if they come in the right physical package.** Men will take care of helpless women if they are sexually attractive, and adults will care for children because they are cute. When you superimpose that helplessness onto a less appealing physical form, it loses it's charm. A 40 year old adult with the mental abilities of a 5 year old would be exhausting and unnerving to everyone around them. A man with the mind and sexual desires of a woman would also be off putting to a lot of people. /u/susou"

The women I've been close to have wanted me to share more about myself. To share how I'm feeling so they can relate to me emotionally. They don't want to be the only one expressing emotion, they want a 2-way exchange.

Not like [/u/Ineffable\_yet\_f-able](/u/Ineffable_yet_f-able) said, where women don't like how men respond. And that emotional expression is not complicated (but it's not easy either).

This is what I've found women are asking for more of. Men absolutely do censor each other's feelings. If I cried in a movie, I would be mercilessly mocked by my male friends, or at least awkwardly ignored. No engagement on that topic. And I censor my own feelings because I don't want to bring people down. My instinct for creating a good relationship is to be a good member who only provides uplifting content.

And while a very small minority of men will reap the benefits and privilege of rising to the top of the so-called ""patriarchy, most men are left at the bottom to walk that emotional tightrope which you explained so well: *Displaying any emotion except for the one which is demanded of us almost always results in a worsening of the situation, isolation, and shaming.* Displaying *unwanted* emotion is how you get friendzoned by your own girlfriend or wife.

It's sort of like the fundamental attribution error (i.e. judge others by their actions but judge yourself by your intentions) for name-callling. Because there are subtle differences between a ""nagging wife"" vs ""concerned wife"" or ""confident man"" vs ""cocky man"" (weak/sensitive boy, assertive/bitchy, mansplaining/explaining, etc) and it does affect how we perceive OP's question and questions of relationship performance. Nonetheless, I firmly believe the solution to both toxic masculinity and toxic femininity is ultimately a healthy balance of both Stoicism and vulnerability (withholding and expressing emotions with a sense of right time, right place), but it does seem a bit unfair that women seem to consistently decide when a mans vulnerability turns into weakness and when his Stoicism turns into coldness, almost as if she gets to play the role of Director directing a scene and decide if her man is hitting his mark or not. /u/UberSeoul"

I was in an emotionally abusive marriage, I was in denial that it was time to call it quits. I was upset and vulnerable from a fight we just had. I had low self-esteem, I was living a lie, I had a mutual crush on someone that met my longing for love, I was drunk and had poor boundaries. I was naieve thinking he was just being friendly and wouldn't try anything. I was detached emotionally from my husband and I was incredibly lonely. Even when I knew I was about to kiss and sleep with this man, my anger towards my husband overcame my morals, my drunkess ass thought ""fuck him for hurting me all these years, I deserve love"". I ended my marriage a few months later. I did what I did out of my vulnerability, poor boundaries and naievity. Not because I'm a cheating scumbag. I'll never ever do it again and will end a relationship if I ever find myself that miserable again. I have grown from the experience and I don't regret it.

How much easier would it be if we didn't have to deal with guys?! etc etc"". So much so that this was a trope, like we'd make fun of ourselves. We also used to use the phrase 'chicks before dicks', or also 'bros before hoes'. And we'd go out and dance/flirt/kiss, but the highlights were often the getting ready pre-drinks, and crashing together afterwards. Women LOVE women! I know the media still pushes the idea that women are vapid, gold digging princesses, with a single-minded mission of catching a man and then holding him in her talons. But there are squillion of counter examples to this  Onto your main point: Dan Savage (a relationship/sex columnist) spoke about your idea, that studies have shown that gay/bi men self-report much higher levels of happiness than straight men. He attributed this to the fact that the process of coming out meant you had to face so much bigotry and self-loathing and soul searching, and that process lead to a level of self-actualization. Something that straight men, living the default setting, never go through. So straight men just accept their crappy lot in life without question. Also, I think that the patriarchy gives men an incredibly restrictive and narrow band of accepted behaviour (in the mainstream, anyway). It looks hard! So much pressure to be macho, strong, hard-working - zero permission to show vulnerability. A reason you're finding bisexual men happier could again be because sexuality isn't binary and there's been LOADS of evidence for decades from the Kinsey Scale, that our sexuality is waaaaaay more fluid than it's sometimes presented. It's just a super patriarchal idea that a dude maybe diggin' another dude is such an earthshattering event! Girls often don't get that sort of restrictiveness growing up, which is why most girls you've met will have at least kissed another female. Finally, I would encourage you to see that you might be in a bit of an echo chamber (aren't we all? ) It ASTOUNDS me that you think misogyny is growing, because that has not been my experience at all. Possibly thanks to MY cosy echo chamber? Over the past few years, I've noticed such great improvements in the way men relate to me - at work, on dates, in relationships, at parties etc. . Similarly, I've noticed that women are more keen to be with a man who is emotionally available, able to be vulnerable, earns less than them, is shorter, less educated, doesn't own a car etc. In my mind, the misogyny stuff on the internet is a total punchline; it feels like a weird pocket of the internet to mine for jokes - my mates send posts from incel/PUA forums to each other for lols. All of which seems like a great reason that this subreddit, and posts like yours, exists! /u/kapitankonig"

The first link you provided includes several explanations, such as: In many cases black schoolchildren are taught by white teachers who have low opinions of the abilities of black kids from the moment they enter the classroom. These teachers immediately write off black students as academic inferiors and do not challenge them sufficiently to achieve the skills necessary to perform well on standardized tests. And Black students may be subject to what Stanford psychology professor Claude Steele calls ""stereotype vulnerability."" Steele contends that black students are aware of the fact that society expects them to perform poorly on standardized tests. This added pressure put upon black students to perform well in order to rebut the racial stereotype in fact makes it more difficult for them to perform well on these tests. And School administrators and guidance counselors often believe that black students are less capable and less able to learn. They routinely track black students at an early age into vocational training or into a curriculum that is not college preparatory. Black students are rarely recommended for inclusion in gifted education, honors, or Advanced Placement programs. Once placed on the slow academic track, most black kids can never escape. By the time black students are juniors and seniors in high school, they are typically so far behind their white counterparts in the critical subject areas necessary to perform well on standardized tests that they have little hope of ever matching the scores of whites on the SAT. And I would add: [The Essence of Innocence: Consequences of Dehumanizing Black Children](URL ""We find converging evidence that Black boys are seen as older and less innocent and that they prompt a less essential conception of childhood than do their White same-age peers.

In fact, the stereotype of black students as troublemakers led teachers to want to discipline black students more harshly than white students after two infractions, Eberhardt and Okonofua said. They were more likely to see the misbehavior as part of a pattern, and to imagine themselves suspending that student in the future.""

It's a result of racism. Of stereotypes and teacher expectations. Being put in a juvenile detention center instead of given a warning. Any child who gets treated like this is probably going to become discouraged, they're not going to support their peers, and when they grow up they are less likely to emphasize the importance of school to their children. Beyond school and adolescence, there is even more discrimination, particularly in regards to employment and treatment by police. White people are more likely to get away with a crime like possession of marijuana because they're less likely to be stopped by police, and if caught they're less likely to see jail time, and if sentenced their sentence is likely to be shorter than it is for black people. That means they're less likely to lose their job (if they don't go to jail), less likely to fall behind on their bills, and less likely to adapt to prison culture or make criminal associations. This all has a huge impact on the socioeconomic disparities between black people and white people. /u/radialomens"

How can you claim that we ignore social double standards that aren't beneficial to men and then mention toxic masculinity in the very next sentence? Toxic masculinity refers to societal standards that are harmful to men and their environment. These are negative generalization about man's existence and behavior, for men to socially defend themselves they are going to have to come up with terminology that is cynical towards women. How are toxic masculinity or male privilege negative generalizations about men? I don't think that you understand what either of those term mean. I guess you've only saw some outrage porn, but never actually tried to read an actual article about toxic masculinity. femmagazine com/feminim-101-what-is-toxic-masculinity Toxic masculinity refers to societys expectations of how a traditional male should behave. Ideas related to toxic masculinity have been normalized in society; comments like, be a man, thats girly, and man up stem from this attitude. It is important to underline that toxic masculinity relates to the cultural perspective given to masculinity, not the biological traits of the male gender. Toxic masculinity exists throughout cultures, expressing itself in different manners. In Latinx culture, toxic masculinity comes in the form of Machismo. Machismo refers to the societal belief that males must adhere to traditionally masculine stereotypes and maintain dominance over women. the odyssey online com/toxic-masculinity-hurts-boys The stereotypical ideal of masculinity generally promotes the image of a man as being dominant, muscular, a protector, and able to control his emotions. None of these traits are necessarily bad, and Im not trying to attack them, but they create a very narrow definition of what masculinity is. The masculine man only likes certain kinds of music, dresses certain kinds of ways, likes sports, has short hair, etc. Early on in a boys life, that kind of masculinity becomes a strong force that begins to pressure the boy to conform to that set of narrowly defined behaviors. If a boy cries frequently, for example, he is shamed as not acting toward the standards that life set for him at his conception; he is made to feel that he is less than a man, that he must change his behaviors, his way of thinking, even maybe his personality to that standard. This boy is shamed until he changes, until he stops crying and learns to ""control"" his emotions and to think more ""logically."" If the boy changes, hes rewarded through external gratification; hes praised as someone who has grown up into more of a man. On the other hand, if the boy doesnt change, hes criticized, sometimes bullied and harassed and made to feel like he is worse than what hes supposed to be. Effectively, the boy isnt allowed to be himself. This is when things start becoming ""toxic"" and harmful. [URL Ill never forget a family session in which a father berated his son for crying about not making the basketball team. Get over it. Dont be a sissy, the father said. The boy was clinically depressed. I tried to explain how corrosive it can be for boys to stuff their emotions. It didnt go well. After all, the father said, I was biased as a female shrink. A documentary released in 2015, The Mask You Live In (which you can now watch on Netflix), films boys from every kind of background who describe the way they suffer from our cultures narrow definition of acceptable masculinity. A viewer cant help but be impacted. Given the long-range effects of this public health crisis, everyone should see it. What happens to this pent-up frustration when boys inevitably come up short in the manhood-code department? It can lead to depression, conduct disorders, isolation, problematic relationships and even violence. [URL Traditional notions of masculinity often categorise it as a weakness if a man were to acknowledge that he has a health problem, and that it is not ok to talk about it or take action. For this reason, men are often leaving it until crisis point to seek assistance for their mental health issues and are more likely to engage in risky behaviours that may be harmful in the long run. [URL Even those men who might be suffering from mental illness are unlikely to seek out counseling because it is often stigmatized as weak for men to seek out help and admit vulnerability. Among those who do make it into an therapists office or mental health program, domestic abusers are notoriously resistant to treatment protocols. [URL Words have power, and terminology about masculinity can be dangerous. Overtime, hearing phrases like ""be a man"" or ""real men don't cry"" sinks into the subconscious. As CNN's Kelly Wallace explained, our culture doesn't do a good job of creating a safe space for boys to express their emotions without the fear of facing ridicule. Doing away with toxic sayings such as these remove the pressure from boys to hide feelings other than anger. [URL The concept of toxic masculinity is used in psychology to describe certain traditional male norms of behavior in the United States and Europe that are associated with harm to society and to men themselves. Such ""toxic"" masculine norms include the traits of dominance, devaluation of women, extreme self-reliance, and the suppression of emotions. As you can see toxic masculinity refers to harmful gender norms that are placed upon men. It doesn't mean that men are toxic, it means that it is harmful to men that people will call them gay for eating vegetables and pussies for showing emotions. The whole debate about toxic masculinity is about pointing out harmful double standards in society that negatively affect men. So what do you have to defend yourself from? Why do men have to defend themselves by coming up with terminology that is cynical towards women? And what do any of those following PUA links have to do with healthy masculinity?

I'm sorry. Hopefully your Bf is better than me. When someone is hurting financially it's hard enough asking family (parents) for financial assistance. But to ask a girlfriend puts them in a very very vulnerable position. To be vulnerable and then have that vulnerability thrown in your face... You took away the trust you had built. Now he can't trust you to be vulnerable again. It will take some time if ever... As for your situation. He's probably being honest about not knowing you truly needed financial assistance. Again, you have to understand, to let someone know you need help financially is hard and it doesn't seem like you did it to the point of vulnerability therefore he brushed it under the rug. When you complained he said he had no idea and sent you money right away. I hope he gets over it. If I were you I would tell him you'd never do that again and that he can trust you always. I assume you don't put yourself out there. But if you want the trust back you're going to have to. Good luck. /u/threadsayer"

You were repeatedly triggering her two fears as long as you remained in a close relationship with her. Until she has had many years of weekly therapy in a program such as CBT or DBT, whatever you do likely will be wrong much of the time. She will perceive you as being hurtful when you DO and hurtful when you DON'T. This conundrum is due to the position of her two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the _very same spectrum_. This means you often find yourself in a lose/lose situation because, as you back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum. Your predicament is that the solution to calming her _abandonment_fear (drawing close and being intimate) is the very action that triggers her engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming her _engulfment_fear (moving back away to give her breathing space) is the very action that triggers her abandonment fear. Hence, as you move close to comfort her and assure her of your love, you eventually will start triggering her engulfment fear, making her feel like she's being suffocated and controlled by you. Yet, as you back away to give her breathing space, you will find that you've started triggering her abandonment fear. In my 15 years of experience with my BPD exW, I found that there is no midpoints solution (between ""too close"" and ""too far away"") where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears. Until a pwBPD learns how to better regulate her own emotions and tame her two fears, that Goldilocks position will not exist. This is why a relationship with an untreated pwBPD typically is characterized by a repeating cycle of push-you-away and pull-you-back. Indeed, even if you are sitting perfectly still and not saying a word, a pwBPD who is experiencing hurtful feelings will project those feelings onto YOU. Her subconscious does this to protect her fragile ego from seeing too much of reality -- and to externalize the pain, getting it outside her body. Because that projection occurs entirely at the subconscious level, she will consciously be convinced that the painful feeling or hurtful thought is coming from YOU. Hence, as long as you remain in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, you will often find yourself hurting her -- i.e., triggering her engulfment fear as you draw near, triggering her abandonment fear as you draw back, and triggering her anger even when you are sitting still in a room saying absolutely nothing. Importantly, this does NOT mean you are a bad person. Rather, it simply means you were unable to help her because you were trying to do the impossible. I am sympathetic because, whereas you tried for 5 years, I tried to do the impossible for 15 years. **My own emotions are getting crazy.** It is not surprising that you're starting to feel like you are _""getting crazy.""_A large share of the abused partners of pwBPD become so utterly confused that they feel like they may be going insane. Because pwBPD typically are convinced that the absurd allegations coming out of their mouths are absolutely true -- they generally have a greater ""crazy-making"" effect than can ever be achieved by narcissists or sociopaths. This is why that, of the 157 mental disorders listed in the APA's diagnostic manual, BPD is the _one most notorious_ for making the abused partners feel like they may be losing their minds. And this is largely why therapists typically see far more of those abused partners -- coming in to find out if they are going insane -- than they ever see of the BPDers themselves. Nothing will drive you crazier sooner than being repeatedly abused by a partner whom you know, to a certainty, must really love you. The reason is that you will be mistakenly convinced that, if only you can figure out what YOU are doing wrong, you can restore your partner to that wonderful human being you saw at the very beginning. **I feel myself so attached and even addicted to her.** For caregivers like you and me, walking away from a pwBPD usually is extremely painful and creates an enormous feeling of guilt. One reason is that our desire to be needed (for what we can do) far exceeds our desire to be loved (for the men we already are). Hence, walking away goes against every fiber of our being -- even when it is exactly what we should be doing. A second reason is that, because you essentially were in a parent/child relationship, walking away makes you feel like you're abandoning a young child who -- despite her frequent temper tantrums and rages -- must dearly love and need you. A pwBPD typically exhibits the warmth, spontaneity, vulnerability, and purity of expressions that otherwise are seen only in young children. As any parent can tell you, young children are VERY EASY to fall in love with. It thus is not surprising that two of the world's most beloved women -- Marilyn Monroe and Princess Diana -- both had full-blown BPD if their biographers are correct. Not surprisingly, this childlike behavior makes most pwBPD very hard to walk away from. For articles on the painful process of walking away, I recommend [Surviving a Breakup with Someone Suffering with BPD](URL and the article, [No Contact: The Right Way](URL Another good article is [Pain of Breaking Up](URL at the Psychology Today website. /u/Up-Town"

You can get picky and say, ""mom, I only want my Playboy magazines delivered to my room - throw away all of the other ones."" As long as I don't disguise my junk mail as a Playboy magazine, it won't get to your room. This assumes that your mother has been correctly told what to deliver and what to throw away. The technical version: A) Port forwarding tells your router that any traffic coming in on port 123 needs to be forwarded to port 456 on internal IP address 192.168.1.20. This means that all packets sent to that port will be forwarded on to that internal ip address. It would normally block those requests. If you have your server locked down correctly and your router configured correctly, the only hazard is if there is a vulnerability in that listening application. If you turn off your server or shutdown the application, there shouldn't be anything listening and nothing bad can happen. You will want your server to have a static IP address internally - you can either configure in on the server as a static or you can use DHCP and tell the router to make it static, so that the router will always assign the same address to the server. 2) I assume you are talking about using a dynamic DNS service for your router. If your router supports dynamic DNS, you will need to set it up, probably create an account with a dynamic DNS service, and then use the DNS name that they provide you as your public server address. If your router doesn't support it, then you will need to run a dynamic DNS application or service on your server which will ping the DNS service and update your public ip address there."

It helps, but it's certainly not perfect, and it needs to be correctly configured. And it's of no help when access must be allowed. All a firewall does is having a list of rules: - If a connection comes from place A, and wants to use service S, allow it - If a connection comes from place B, and wants to use service S, allow it - If a connection comes from place B, and wants to use service S2, allow it - Otherwise, forbid the connection. So that's all well and good, but the protection it provides is limited. For instance, on a LAN you probably want to share data between machines. You want to have working file sharing, maybe remote desktop access. And that means those services are allowed through firewall, and any vulnerability they might have is exposed. By analogy, a firewall is a list of people you'll open the door to. Not opening the door to strangers certainly helps your security, but if a friend of yours decides to shoot you, the whitelist isn't going to magically protect you against that. - /u/dale\_glass"

The answer is lots, and it depends on what kind of criminal you're trying to catch. Catching money launderers is very different from catching shoplifters. The situation is similar in the cyber world. What kind of attack are you trying to detect? Phishing? Social engineering? Malware? Network intrusion? Server intrusion? Data theft? Zero-day vulnerability? There's a wide range of tools and techniques used to combat each of these attack types. If there's a specific type of attack you have in mind, you should ask about it specifically. - /u/orangeturtleshell"

First, virtual machines and containers have 0days published from time to time which allow breaking out of them; but that was covered in other comments (and I agree with them), so I'll address another issue. These last years we've seen new types of attacks that were previously unheard of because they target the hardware, and are very hard to counter: 1. [Rowhammer](URL flipping bits in the memory of neighboring containers/VMs or the host OS; allowing a VM to run code outside. All computer architectures are affected. ECC makes it much harder, but in theory possible. 2. Side-channel attacks, like [Meltdown](URL [Spectre](URL reading memory outside the VM, on many architectures (eg. Intel, AMD, and ARM). An up to date server should now be no longer vulnerable, but all servers were vulnerable for a time. 3. many more like Meltdown and Spectre, whose name I forgot because they were basically variants of the same issues. AFAIK the last ones to date are in the [Microarchitectural Data Sampling](URL which was discovered in 2018 but patched only a couple of months ago. 4. Earlier this year, [RAMBleed](URL made public, combining Rowhammer with a side-channel attack to exfiltrate information. Authors demonstrate the possibility to exfiltrate a private SSH key, and claim ECC is not enough to stop it. AFAIK it still isn't patched in any OS. My takeaway from this is to stop using VMs for isolation, and use smaller computers instead. But you're still vulnerable to side-channel attacks, like monitoring power usage or EM (those are still hard to exploit, but I wouldn't bet that will last for long). And if anyone finds a vulnerability in SSH and gets access to your network, game over. /u/ProgVal"

The word ""hack"" implies it's in the shadows trying to steal something, that was a major full on attack. Trump shutting down the American government back in January for a whole month basically achieved the same effect. Because it's a attack on the frontends, who was operating the systems is irrelevant because you can achieve the same effect by DDOS-ing whoever that operates those core systems.

What if your server is mounting devices over a network from an external source, and that source is compromised? What if someone developed an API and that API ends up passing data to your script? And you might say ""lol my script will never do that"", but this is exactly the problem: people write software assuming a very specific use case, it expands, and now its rife with security holes because someone's literally arguing that sanitizing values is a bad idea. Almost every exploit I've ever seen is a chained series of exploits, not a major catastrophic one. Your script might be the second, not the first, link in that chain. For example, a webserver upload script has permissions that don't check a file extension, so someone's able to upload a malicious script. That malicious script then runs and exploits _another_ security issue present in the underlying OS, and it goes from there. There's literally no reason not to check filenames before you operate on them. Do you know how many exploits happen because someone allowed a script to traverse up directories because someone was able to get ""../../../"" into the filename? I've seen that at least twice and I'm not even in the cybersecurity world."
